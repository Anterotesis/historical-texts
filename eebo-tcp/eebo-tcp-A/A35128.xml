            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE AVTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AS</hi> I know my selfe to baue been mou'd with noe other impulse then that of Charity in composing this booke, so doe I coniure the Reader to carry the same minde along with him in the perusing of it. It is a great mistake to thinke, that heate of disputation, for the finding out of truth, is a cooling of Charity. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of this kinde are not so much breaches of freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as a meanes to vnite vnderstandings in the beleefe of truth. If contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Schooles, for interest of ones priuate opinion only, or some worldly glorie, be esteem'd no violation of amity amonge disputants, surely to contend meerly out of zeale to saue soules, cannot be thought inconsistent with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In this contest, our warre is not against the <hi>person,</hi> but the <hi>errours</hi> of our neighbour:in which to be silent would in some degree make vs criminal, and responsable to God for our neighbours ruine.</p>
            <p>If any man wonder, why an answer came forth no sooner, let him consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that my Lord Bishops booke was publish't not long before the time of our publique distractions, in which it concern'd vs rather to prepare for the next world, then answer books, that defended the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which was then in so bleeding a condition, that it might haue been thought as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome to impugne it, as to fight with a dying Aduersarie. But the heate of the warre beeing ouer, and many of the Prelatique party (who, together with our selues, did daily entertaine a confidence of the happy return and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of our gracious Souereign King Charles the second) seeming to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that my Lord of Canterburies booke was an impregnable piece, in regard wee had not attempted to assault it, I thought, I should performe a worke acceptable to God, and very satisfactory to the wishes of Catholiques, if I framed an answer, so often called for, by our Aduersaries.</p>
            <p>In perusall of the Bishops booke I found so many affected Windings, and artificiall <hi>meanders,</hi> especially in that important controuersie of <hi>resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Fayth,</hi> (where he ought chiefly to haue aym'd at perspicuity) that I could not chuse, but looke vpon it as a <hi>Labyrinth;</hi> and haue therfore soe styled it in my answer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57798:3"/>
I intend not to make my Reader spend time in vnnecessary Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; which I wish him rather to imploy in seeking satisfaction within my booke. I shall therfore in this preface, only take notice of some few things, which the Bishop vrges against vs in his dedicatory Epistle to his late Maiestie of glorious and deare memorie.</p>
            <p>The Bishop charges Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> with downright disloyalty, for publishing, <hi>contrary to the Kings express command,</hi> the Relations of the Conferences which he had with the Bishop and Doctor <hi>White; because</hi> (sayth he) <hi>Mr. Fisher was charged vpon his allegiance, not to sett out, or publish what passed in some of the conferences, till his Maiestie gaue further licence.</hi> To which I answer, his Maiesties command (even as here sett down by the Bishop) doth only forbid the publishing of what pass't <hi>in some of these conferences:</hi> so that, for ought appeares, what pass't <hi>in other some</hi> might be publisht without further licence. Secondly, 'tis auerr'd by A. C. that not Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> but his Aduersaries, first transgress't this precept of his Maiestie by diuulging false reports to the preiudice of Mr. <hi>Fisher's</hi> person and cause: by reason whereof Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> was forced, for the iust and necessary vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himselfe and the Catholique cause, to deliuer some copies to his friends. Thirdly, who made most hast in publishing what had passed in these Conferences, appeares likewise out of <hi>W. I.</hi> from whome the Bishop frames all this charge against Mr. <hi>Fisher. Some may (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) maruaile</hi> (sayes <hi>W.I.</hi>) <hi>why these Relations came out so late; it beeing now long, since the Aduersaries haue giuen out false reports both in speeches and print.</hi> So that it seems by this, not Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> but his Aduersaries were the first prouokers both in speeches and print; and by consequence, the only transgressours of his Maiesties command.</p>
            <p>Neither are those of Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> profession so apt to complayn, and cry out <hi>Persecution,</hi> without cause; there beeing <hi>then</hi> persons of great Authority about the King, inciting his Maiestie to put the penall and sanguinary Laws against vs, in rigorous execution: to say nothing of those, who were then actually persecuted. Nor does the Bishop so much cleere, as contradict himselfe in this particular, while he first sayes (pag. <hi>11.</hi> of his Epistle) <hi>God forbid I should euer offer to persuade a persecution, in any kinde, or practise it in the least:</hi> and yet, in the very next lines, adds; <hi>God forbid too, that your Maiestie should lett the laws</hi> (viz. against Catholiques and Catholique Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) <hi>sleep, forfeare of the name of persecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> and his <hi>fellowes</hi> doe <hi>angle</hi> for his Maiesties <hi>subiects,</hi> as the Relatour pretends, 'tis only to bring them the safe
<pb facs="tcp:57798:3"/>
to Heauen, and by which only they themselues hope to arriue thither: it is not to draw them into the beleefe of any assertions repugnant to loyaltie and Christian vertue, but such as their Teachers will be euer ready to maintayn, both with their pens and liues. To <hi>fish,</hi> in this manner, deserues neither hanging, drawing, nor quartering; but is conformable to the ancient commission, which in the person of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, these <hi>anglers</hi> (as he calls them) receiued from Christ. Matth. <hi>4. 18. follow mee, and I will make you Fishers of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither doth Mr. Fisher, or any of his profession, allow, or vse any such <hi>netts,</hi> as the Relatour mentions (<hi>pag. 11. Epist.</hi>) that is, they neither practise, nor hold it lawfull to <hi>dissolue oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, to depose or kill Kings, to blow vp states for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of QUOD VOLUMUS &amp;c.</hi> All which, out of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and professed <hi>forbearance</hi> towards vs, the Bishop does very kindely infinuate both to his Maiestie and the Reader. But our answer is, wee yeeld to none in all Christian and true allegiance to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereign Lord the King; which wee haue in times of tryall so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to the world, that wee hope there are not many, euen amonge our Aduersaries, but are conuinced of our <hi>reall</hi> fidelitie: and though some perhaps will <hi>talke</hi> more, and <hi>sweare</hi> more, yet none vpon all iust occasions will <hi>doe more,</hi> in defense of his Maiesties sacred Person, rights, and dignity, then those of our profession. This is certain, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholiques alone can glorie in this, that whereas in these late vnhappy times, some of all other Religions in <hi>England,</hi> oppos'd eyther his sacred Maiestie that now is, or his Royall Father, they only haue been, <hi>all</hi> and <hi>euer</hi> Faythfull to them both: therby shewing, that the doctrine of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to their lawfull Soureigns is a necessary point of their beleefe, and a part of that duty, which not only interest and ends, but Religion and conscience obliges them to pay.</p>
            <p>The Relatour would haue vs obserue, that <hi>the Church of England is between two factions, as between two mill-stones, like to be grown'd to powder. (pag. 15. Epist.)</hi> meaning by one of these, Catholiques; for whome alone, I haue vndertaken to plead. The Bishop here seemes to complaine of <hi>persecution</hi> himselfe, as well as wee; but with farre less reason, as is euident: seeing wee Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, (if wee were so ill minded) haue no other instruments to <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi> withall, but our tongues and our pens; which draw noe bloud, and in the vse whereof, I presume no indifferent man, well confidering what hath passed both from the pulpitts and presses of our Aduersaries, will thinke, that in any thing, they fall short of vs, eyther for lowdness, or passion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57798:4"/>
'Tis no such idle Querie, as the Relatour would haue it thought, (<hi>pag. 16 Epist.</hi>) but a very pertinent one to demand <hi>where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi> or this pretended <hi>Church of England, was before Luther.</hi> For haue any Protestants as yet, been able to shew a visible Church in the world, before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, professing the doctrine, which distinguishes them from vs? 'Tis true, they haue been often call'd vpon to this purpose; but haue euer any of them done it? was the question euer answer'd categorically? or otherwise then by tergiuersation, and shifting it off with ambiguioyes of their owne fiction? as the Relatour himselfe (for example) here doth, by telling vs, <hi>their Church was there where ours is now; one and the same Church still; noe doubt of that; one in substance, but not one in condition of state, &amp;c.</hi> Is this to answer categorically? wee doe not enquire whether or noe, or in what feigned sense, theirs and ours may be sayd to be <hi>one and the same Church:</hi> the following treatise doth sufficiently confute that pretense: But our enquirie is, whether there were a <hi>Ptotestant</hi> Church before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, <hi>there where our Church now is;</hi> I say a <hi>Protestant</hi> Church, be it in <hi>name,</hi> or <hi>thing;</hi> that is, a visible Society of Christians openly <hi>Protesting</hi> against the pretended errours and superstitions of our Church, and beleeuing the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which Protestants now beleeue and hold in opposition to our Church. This, neither the Bishop nor any body else, was euer able to proue. Wee Catholiques, therfore doe not only <hi>doubt,</hi> but absolutely <hi>deny,</hi> that there was any Protestant Church, (or any Church, which the Bishop can properly and truly call <hi>his</hi> Church, or <hi>their</hi> Church, speaking of Protestants) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luthers</hi> time, not only <hi>there where</hi> ours <hi>now is,</hi> but in any other part, or corner of the world.</p>
            <p>Neither is <hi>their</hi> Church and <hi>ours one and the same</hi> Church, in any other sense, then what is meerly fictitious and arbitrary, and wherby, all Heretiques whatsoeuer may, if they will, pretend to be <hi>one and the same</hi> Church with the Catholique. Nor is it possible for Protestants to confute them; seeing they can bring no conuincing argument to proue, that such errours are more destructiue of the Foundation, then those which they account <hi>damnable</hi> and to shake the very Foundation of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Who knowes not that wee Catholiques, differ from Protestants in the <hi>Sacraments;</hi> which certainly are of the <hi>substance</hi> of Religion, if any thing be; and by our Aduersaries own principles, and definition of a Church pertaine to the Churches essence? Wee differ from them in the matter of <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> which they reiect, but wee hold and beleeue to be the most princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and solemne action of all that pertaines to Religious worship. Wee differ from them also in many other points of maine concernment to the honour of God and Saluation of soules. They charge vs, and wee them
<pb facs="tcp:57798:4"/>
errours directly derogatory to Gods honour, directly contrary to divine Reuelation, directly contrary to the institution and ordinance of Christ and repugnant to Saluation. How then are wee <hi>one and the same</hi> Church? or how can Protestants pretend to become members of the Catholique Church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> s they maintaine principles, or articles of doctrine of such high concernment in Religion, contrary to the beleefe of the whole Catholique Church, in so many ages before Luther?</p>
            <p>What he layes to our charge (<hi>Epist. pag. 17.</hi>) of crying vp the Church aboue Scripture, and that so farrae, as <hi>to indanger the beleefe of it with a great part of men,</hi> will be abundantly shew'n in the following discourse, to be a calumny of the greatest magnitude. At present wee only protest against it as such, and auerre with himselfe, that the <hi>Scripture, where it is plaine, should guide the Church; and the Church, where there is doubt, or difficulty, should expound Scripture.</hi> Only to that <hi>Prouiso</hi> which he adds, touching the Churches exposition of Scripture, viz. that <hi>shee may reuise what in any case hath slipt from her,</hi> wee cannot allow it, till wee certainly know his meaning. For if by <hi>reuising what hath shipt from her</hi> he mean't to intimate (as 'tis most probable he did) that the Church should erre in any thing shee <hi>defines</hi> to be beleeu'd, 'tis his own errour to affirm it, as wee shall proue hereafter: if any thing else, wee meddle not with it.</p>
            <p>Whereas he obserues <hi>(Epist. pag. 18.) that many rigid Professo urs haue turn'd Roman Catholiques, and in that turn, haue been more Iesuited then any other: and that such Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists as haue chang'd from them, haue for the most part, quite leap't ouer the meane, and been as rigid the other way;</hi> to the first part of his obseruation I assent; reason it selfe teaching it to be true. For the streames of that zeale, which formerly wrought extrauagantly in them, by reason of their ignorance and errour, beeing now cleer'd and turn'd the right way, make the Professours of it still feruorous for that, which is good, and no less vehemently auerted from what they know to be ill. But of the second part I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue; it beeing so contrary to all experience; which shew's, that the desertours of our Religion seldome become so zealous in the contrary way, as the Relatour pretends: nay reason it selfe is against it. For, commonly speaking, the motiues of their turn are eyther the preseruation of their estates, the obtaining of some other wordly and temporall ends, or lastly some voluptuous pleasure, of which in the way of Catholique Religion they finde themselues debarr'd. And hereof this is an assured Argument, that when these motiues cease, (as at the howre
<pb facs="tcp:57798:5"/>
death they all doe) many of them, through the mercy of God, returne from whence they had departed. Whereas on the other side, I neuer yet heard of the man, who professing the Catholique Fayth in time of health, desired in sickness to dye a Protestant.</p>
            <p>The Relatour obserues againe <hi>(Epist. pag. 19.) that noe one thing hath made conscientious men</hi> (of his party) <hi>more wauering in their mindes, and more apt to be draw'n beside from the Religion professed in the Church of England, then want of of vniforme and decent order &amp;c.</hi> therevpon taking occasion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large himselfe on the subiect of ceremonies, shewing their vsefulness and necessity in the publique exercise of Religion; wherin I haue noe reason to contradict him. Only this I must note by the way, that whereas (out of indulgence to his ordinary humour) he taxes the Roman Church with thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in many, that are <hi>vnnecessary</hi> and <hi>superstitious,</hi> he might haue know'n, that the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> it selfe not only inables, but inioynes all particular Bishops in their respectiue Dioceses, and all Archbishops and Metropolitans in their respectiue Prouinces, to reforme what euer they may finde amiss in this kinde. And this his crimination is no more, then was obiected to himselfe by his owne people.</p>
            <p>Wee shall in due place shew, in what sense it is, wee maintaine, that <hi>out of Rome,</hi> that is, out of the communion of the Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, <hi>there is no saluation.</hi> At present it may suffize to say, that wee doe not <hi>shut vp saluation in such a narrow conclaue</hi> as the Bishop would haue his Reader beleeue, when he parallels vs with the <hi>Donatists.</hi> Wee teach no other doctrine concerning the attainement of saluation, then what hath been held in <hi>all ages,</hi> in <hi>all times</hi> and <hi>in all places,</hi> and is now visibly taught and professed throughout the Christian world; viz. that out of the true Catholique Church, saluation is not to be expected. Nor doe wee <hi>shut Heauen-gates,</hi> as the Relatour insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, to any that are willing to enter; prouided, they be willing to enter, and goe that way, which Christ hath appointed. But 'tis the Bishop and his party, that doe <hi>really</hi> shutt Heauen-gates to those who otherwise might enter, euen whilest they pretend to open them. For by teaching the way to Heauen to be <hi>wider</hi> then it is, and that Saluation may be attained by such <hi>meanes,</hi> and in such <hi>wayes,</hi> as according to Gods ordinary Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it cannot, what doe they but putt men into a <hi>false</hi> way, and in stead of leading them in that <hi>straite</hi> path to eternall happiness, which the Gospell prescribes, trace out that <hi>broad way</hi> to them, which leads to death?</p>
            <p>I shall close my Preface with an Aduertisement to such, as are apt to quarrel at words, beyond the meaning of those that vse them. The
<pb facs="tcp:57798:5"/>
               <hi>infallible</hi> (which in treating of the Church and Generall Councils I haue had frequent occasion to make vse of) is cunningly raised by our Aduersaries to so high a pitch of signification, as though it could import no less, then the ascribing of an intrinsecall vnerring power in all things, to those wee account infallible; which is cleerly to peruert our meaning: wee intending to signifie noe more, when wee say the Church, or Generall Councils are infallible, then that <hi>by vertue of Christ's promise</hi> they haue neuer erred, nor euer shall in definitions of Fayth.</p>
            <p>In fine, Good Reader, that thou mayst see and embrace the truth, is the hearty wish of him, that bids thee noe less heartily.</p>
            <p>Farewell.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THough <hi>Dedalus,</hi> that ingenious Artificer, might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly shew no less skill in contriving his <hi>Cretan Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> then did the principall <hi>Architect,</hi> employ'd by <hi>Salomon</hi> in building that Magnisicent Temple at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi> yet their <hi>Labours</hi> were of a different nature. For whereas the latter exercis'd his Art in raising a noble, elevated, lightsome <hi>Structure;</hi> the former (<hi>Dedalus</hi>) us'd all his Inventive industry in framing a Subterraneous, darksome <hi>Prison,</hi> with such redoubled <hi>Turnings,</hi> perplexed <hi>Windings,</hi> and tortuous <hi>Meanders,</hi> that who ever entred into it, might indeed <hi>wander</hi> up and down within its involved and recurring <hi>paths,</hi> but never be able to get either back, or thorow it.</p>
               <p>Now alluding to these different <hi>Works,</hi> we may not unfitly compare the learned Labours of the <hi>Fathers, Doctors,</hi> and <hi>worthy Divines</hi> of Gods Church, to this stately Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> being the rich and illustrious <hi>Monuments</hi> of their <hi>Piety, Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Erudition.</hi> Whereas by the <hi>Cretan Labyrinth</hi> are fitly Symboliz'd the Artificiall, but Pestiferous <hi>Works</hi> of all <hi>Hereticall Authors,</hi> who (forsaking the <hi>ever-visible</hi> and <hi>conspicuous Church</hi> of Christ, and <hi>known Consent</hi> of Christendome) induce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and Followers to believe the novel Fancies of their own Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Brains. These mens <hi>Labours</hi> are so farre from being <hi>lightsome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents,</hi> that they are rather <hi>Labyrinths,</hi> or <hi>intricate Dungeons</hi> for poor
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57798:7"/>
seduced Souls; who being once ingag'd in the perplexities of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled <hi>flexures,</hi> see not the radiant light of Gods Church; some few onely excepted, whom of his great mercy he is pleas'd to shew the way out, and reduce into his <hi>Fold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it hath already been shew'n by others, that the <hi>Works</hi> of many late <hi>Protestant Writers</hi> of this Nation are of the aforesaid <hi>intangling Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and I doubt not, by Gods help, but to evidence, that this their <hi>Grand Authors Book</hi> I am now about to answer, is very liable to the same Reproach. For, to describe it rightly, it is a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> most artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially compos'd, with as many abstruse <hi>Turnings,</hi> ambiguous <hi>Windings,</hi> and intricate <hi>Meanders,</hi> as that of <hi>Dedalus,</hi> and therefore equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable.</p>
               <p>But a more sure and stronger <hi>Clew</hi> then <hi>Ariadne's,</hi> the <hi>Line</hi> of the Catholique Churches <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> joyn'd with <hi>Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> hath not onely carried me through it, but by Gods good as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, enabled me to render it pervious to all, by the <hi>Discoveries</hi> and <hi>Directive Marks</hi> I have set on the Leaves, that compose this present Volume.</p>
               <p>Yet before I descend to particulars, I must advertise the Reader, that I designe not the Defence either of Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> or any other <hi>Author,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they deliver the <hi>generally received Doctrine</hi> of the Catholique Church; which is that I undertake to maintain.</p>
               <p>The three leading pages of the Bishops Book contain the occasion of the <hi>Conference</hi> between himself and Mr. <hi>Fisher, viz.</hi> for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction <note place="margin">§ 1, 2.</note> of an Honourable Lady, who having heard it granted (on the <hi>Protestant</hi> part) in a former <hi>Conference,</hi> that there must be a <hi>continuall, visible Company,</hi> ever since Christ, teaching <hi>unchanged Doctrine,</hi> in all points necessary to Salvation, and finding (it seems) in her own Reason, that such a <hi>Company,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> must not be fallible in its <hi>Teaching,</hi> was in Quest of a <hi>Continuall, Visible,</hi> and <hi>Infallible Church,</hi> as not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it fit for unlearned persons to judge of particular Doctrinals, but to depend on the judgement of the true Church: which point of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> the Bishop sought to evade, saying, That neither the <hi>Jesuit,</hi> nor <hi>the Lady her self spake very advisedly, if she said, she desired to relie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 3. num. 2. pag. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>upon an Infallible Church,</hi> because <hi>an Infallible Church denotes a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, in opposition to some other Particular Church not Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here already you may observe the Bishop falling to work on his <hi>projected Labyrinth,</hi> by making its first <hi>Crook;</hi> which is apparent to any man that has eyes, even without the help of a Perspective. For though he could not be ignorant, that the Lady sought not any one <hi>Particular Infallible Church,</hi> in opposition to <hi>another Particular Church not Infallible,</hi> but some Church, such as might without danger of Errour direct her in all Doctrinall Points of Faith, call it <hi>an</hi> or <hi>the</hi> Infallible Church as you please, (for she had no such Quirks in her head) yet the Bishop will by no means understand her <hi>sincere meaning,</hi> but instead of using a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable endeavour to satisfie her perplexed Conscience, vainly pursues that <hi>meer Quibble,</hi> on purpose to decline the difficulty of giving her a satisfactory Answer in his own Principles. Neither indeed does that expression (<hi>an</hi> Infallible Church) denote a Particular Church, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to some other Particular Church not Infallible, but positively
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57798:7"/>
signifies a Church that never hath, shall, or can erre in Doctrine of Faith, without connotating, or implying any other Church that might erre. Nor can it be pretended, that the Particle <hi>a</hi> or <hi>an</hi> is onely appliable to Particulars, seeing the Bishop himself applies it to the whole Church. For, omitting other places, see page 141. where speaking of the <hi>whole</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 18. num. 5</note> 
                  <hi>Militant</hi> Church, he sayes, <hi>And if she erre in the Foundation, that is, in some one or more Fundamental Points of Faith, then she may be a Church of Christ still.</hi> Here sure he cannot mean a <hi>Particular Church</hi> by this expression <hi>A true Church,</hi> but the whole <hi>Catholique</hi> or <hi>Universal Church,</hi> unless he intended to speak non-sense, <hi>viz.</hi> That the whole <hi>Militant Church</hi> is a <hi>Particular Church.</hi> And what Learned Interpreter ever understood those words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Ephes. 5. 27. <hi>That he might exhibit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self A glorious Church,</hi> &amp;c. of any other, save the Universall Church of Christ? And seeing the Lady made enquiry after <hi>that Church IN WHICH one may,</hi> and <hi>OUT OF WHICH one cannot attain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> (as the Bishop sets down the words of Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> page 3.) it is evident, that really and in effect she sought no other, save the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Visible Church of Christ: which <hi>A. C.</hi> (to take away all doubt of her meaning) expresses pag. 1. by saying, that she desired <hi>to depend upon the judgement of THE TRUE Church.</hi> Why then might not the Lady express her self, as the Bishop himself does in the place above ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the Particle <hi>a,</hi> or <hi>an,</hi> and yet not speak so improperly, that he must needs mistake her meaning? The truth is, it was an affected mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in his Lordship, as any man may easily perceive, that has not lost his discerning faculty.</p>
               <p>But the Bishop having now entred his hand, and willing to shew his dexterity betimes, immediately redoubles the <hi>Crook</hi> he had made, while (to countenance his former trisling with the Lady touching <hi>an</hi> Infallible Church) he craftily attacks <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for maintaining an <note place="margin">§ 3. num. 3. pag. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Particular Church,</hi> or Diocess of <hi>Rome,</hi> as hoping to make that opinion pass for an Article of Faith among <hi>Catholiques</hi> (which it is not) and by confuting it, to seem to have overthrown the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the whole <hi>Catholique Church.</hi> Now though <hi>Bellarmins</hi> opinion is, indeed, That the whole Clergy and People of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot erre in Faith, and desert the Pope, so long as his <hi>Chair</hi> remains in that City; yet the Bishop knew very well, that the Catholique Church doth not restraine the Doctrine of her <hi>Infallibility</hi> to that opinion of <hi>Bellarmin:</hi> it being sufficient for a <hi>Catholique</hi> to believe, that there is an <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the Church, without further obligation to examine, whether the Particular Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be Infallible, or not.</p>
               <p>By what has been hitherto faid, a man may easily perceive the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Bishops proceeding, and what he is to expect from him throughout his whole Work; which will (I assure you) for the greater part, be found to correspond with that you have already seen.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the fourth page to the twentieth he goes on disputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">§ 3. num. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, &amp;c.</note> severall Opinions of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> (as whether the Popes <hi>Chair</hi> may be removed from <hi>Rome;</hi> and in case of such Removall, whether that Particular Church may then erre) which seeing they are but <hi>Particular Opinions,</hi> I shall not expostulate them with the Bishop, as being no part of the Province I have undertaken. And as to the <hi>Authorities</hi> here
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57798:8"/>
quoted by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> out of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen,</hi> &amp;c. in proof of <hi>his opinions</hi> touching the Particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> seeing they are neither cited by the <hi>Cardinal</hi> to prove any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles held <hi>de Fide</hi> among Catholiques, nor impugned by the Bishop but as insufficient to make good those <hi>particular Opinions,</hi> (though he hoped the Reader would make neither of these reflections) I cannot hold my self oblig'd to take notice of his pretended Solutions, till I finde them brought to evacuate the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Catholique,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Church in its full Latitude, as <hi>Catholiques</hi> ever mean it, save when they say expresly the <hi>Particular Church,</hi> or Diocess, of <hi>Rome,</hi> as here <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth. However, I intend to examine them, when I come to treat the Question <hi>of the Infallibility</hi> of the Universal Church.</p>
               <p>Where I make no doubt, but I shall clearly evince against his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and the whole party, these particulars following. First, that to draw the word <hi>perfidia</hi> (which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> useth) to <hi>his own</hi> sense, the Bishop leaves out two parts of the Sentence, which he ought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to have expressed. Secondly, that by glossing almost every word of the Text imperfectly alledged, he makes that Father give no more Priviledge to <hi>Rome,</hi> then what was due to every particular Church, yea to every Orthodox Christian of those times, quite contrary to St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> intent. Thirdly, how he presses St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> not being tax'd by the Ancients, for holding a possibility of the Popes teaching Errour in matter of Faith, but never reflects, that he was as little tax'd by them for affixing possibility of Erring to the Universall and Immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Tradition of Non-rebaptization, embrac'd and practised against him by the whole Church. Fourthly, I shall shew, that his Lordships Answer to St. <hi>Hieromes</hi> Authority is meerly Nugatory, making him advertize <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> that the Apostolicall Faith, first preach'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> could not <hi>in it self</hi> be any other, then what it <hi>essentially</hi> is; that is, it could not be changed, so long as it remained unchang'd. Fifthly, that he trifles as much in the allegation of St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen.</hi> For though that Father useth the word <hi>Semper retinet,</hi> (as the Bishop trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates him) and doth not expresly say <hi>Semper retinebit</hi> (it <hi>ever holds,</hi> and not it <hi>shall ever hold</hi> the true Faith) speaking of the Roman Church; yet certainly in this place the word <hi>retinet,</hi> coming after these other <hi>ab antiquis temporibus habet,</hi> and having <hi>Semper</hi> annexed to it, must in all reason be understood to relate to the severall Differences of Time, past, present, and to come. Sixthly, that he wrongfully imposes upon <hi>Bellarmin</hi> the alledging of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> as holding his opinion about the particular Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> whereas <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath not so much as St. <hi>Cyrils</hi> name in that whole Chapter; nor <hi>Ruffinus's,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he cites St. <hi>Hieromes</hi> Apology against him: and when he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges those two Authors in his third Chapter, he expresses both the places and their words; but it is to prove another Proposition: and that of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> is a quite different Text, from what the Relatour thrusts into his Margent. Thus eagerly fights he by Moon-light with his own shadows. Seventhly, that his Lordship confounds two Questions that are distinct, and distinctly treated by <hi>Bellarmin, viz.</hi> Whether the Pope, when he teaches the whole Church, can erre in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith (which is the Proposition <hi>Bellarmin</hi> defends in the third
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57798:8"/>
Chapter, and belongs to the Pope as he is chief Pastour of the Church) with this, whether the particular Roman Church, that is, the Roman Clergy and People, cannot erre in Faith; which question <hi>Bellarmin</hi> treats in the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Chapter. Lastly, that the Text of <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Tu es Petrus;</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> &amp;c.) cannot in the Grammatical and proper sense be applied to the confession of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as abstracted from his Person, but onely to his Person, as made, in that occasion, for and in vertue of that Confession, perpetually to endure in him and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, <hi>THE ROCK</hi> of Christs Church. But of these hereafter.</p>
               <p>The Bishop having long wandered from the Ladies Question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Infallibility,</hi> whether to be admitted in any Church or not? at length in the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> page, removing St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair out of his way and <note place="margin">§ 3. num. 17.</note> from the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and disporting himself a while in that particular <hi>City,</hi> or <hi>Diocess,</hi> in a kinde of <hi>Raillery</hi> upon its <hi>Infallibility,</hi> his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship comes to the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, on occasion of some words spoken by a friend of the Ladies, in defence of that Church. I believe that <hi>Friend</hi> did a friendly office to the Bishop, in giving him a rise for a new Dispute, and diverting the Lady from pressing him further for a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory answer to her <hi>Querie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The question started by this friend was (as I have already hinted) about the Faith of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> told him, had plainly made a <hi>change</hi> and taught <hi>false Doctrine</hi> concerning the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and that he had heard his <hi>Majesty</hi> should say, <hi>That the Greek Church, having erred against the Holy Ghost, had lost the Holy Ghost.</hi> This latter part of Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> assertion the Bishop will needs interpret as a disrespect in him towards his King; whereas in truth he highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd his Majesty, and shew'd the Kings great <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in that point, touching the Holy Ghost. But the Bishop with all his respect and present flattery, is resolved to contradict his <hi>Majesty:</hi> yet that he might seem to do it but in part, he introduces this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">§ 5. pag. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. That a particular Church may lose the Holy Ghost two wayes.</hi> 1. <hi>The one when it loses such special Assistance of that Blessed Spirit, as preserves it from all dangerous errours and sins, and the punishment that is due unto them.</hi> 2. <hi>The other is, when it loses not onely this Assistance, but all Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to remain any longer a true Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Bishop denyes the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to have lost the Assistance of the Holy Ghost in this <hi>latter Acception, viz.</hi> totally, which would render it no <hi>true Church;</hi> but grants it to have lost that <hi>special Assistance</hi> specified in the first branch of the distinction. <hi>But this</hi> (he sayes) <hi>is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called an errour, CIRCA SPIRITVM SANCTVM (about the Doctrine concerning the Holy Ghost) then an errour CONTRA SPIRITVM SANCTVM (against the Holy Ghost.)</hi> Thus he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces what he had said before, <hi>That the Greek Church did perhaps lose the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid;</note> 
                  <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and <hi>that they erred against him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us see what Arguments his Lordship brings in proof of his Assertion, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church continues a <hi>true Church,</hi> and that their errour is not properly <hi>against</hi> the Holy Ghost. Here the Bishop makes no great haste, but breathing himself a while, does very prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepare his Reader to expect no great matter from him in this kinde. For, dilating very speciously on his own <hi>modesty</hi> he adds, <hi>There is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 6. pag. 23.</note>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57798:9"/>
the weight of this whole Cause should rest upon one particular man; or that the personal defects of any man should press any more then himself. <hi>Also</hi> that he entred not upon this service, but by command of Supreme Authority; <hi>there being, as he sayes, an hundred abler then himself to maintain the</hi> Protestant Cause. <hi>This his acknowledgement as I have no reason to blame him for it, so I cannot see, what just cause his Lordship had to censure Mr.</hi> Fisher, <hi>for thinking so humbly of himself as to confess,</hi> there were a thousand better Scholars, then he, to maintain the Catholick Cause.</p>
               <p>Before we come to the Bishops <hi>proofs,</hi> I must in the first place entreat the Reader to lend attention to his words, which are these; <hi>I was not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 9. pag. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>so peremptory,</hi> viz. as to affirm the <hi>Greeks</hi> errour was not in a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. <hi>Divers learned men, and some of your own, were of opinion, that</hi> (<hi>as the Greeks expressed themselves</hi>) <hi>it was a question not simply Fundamentall. I know and acknowledge, that errour of denying the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son, to be a grievous errour in Divinity.</hi> After this he adds as a Theological proof of his own, <hi>Since their form of speech is, that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father BY THE SON, and is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Son, without making any difference in the Consubstantiality of the Persons, I dare not deny them to be a TRVE CHVRCH; though I confess them AN ERRONEOVS Church in this particular.</hi> Are not these very specious expressions? <hi>I was not so peremptory. Divers lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men were of opinion. I know and acknowledge that errour to be a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous errour in Divinity. I dare not deny them to be a true Church. They seem to agree with us. They think a diverse thing from us.</hi> But I pass by his trifling, and make way for truth. It is to be considered, that now for many hundred years the whole Latin Church hath decreed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it to be a flat Heresie in the Greeks, and they decreed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to be an Heresie in the Latin Church; and both together condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the opinion of the Grecians as Heretical in a general Council: <note place="margin">In Florentino.</note> how then bears it any shew of probability, what some few of yesterday (forced to it by an impossibility of otherwise avoiding the strength of Catholick Arguments against them) affirm, that the matter of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie is so small and inconsiderable, that it is not sufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Heresie on either side? Is not this to make all the Churches of Christendome, for many hundred years, quite blinde, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves onely clear and sharp-sighted? which swelling presumption, what spirit it argues, and whence it proceeds, all those, who have learn't from St. <hi>Augustine, that pride is the mother of Heresie,</hi> will easily collect.</p>
               <p>But though this perswasion had not been attested by such clouds of witnesses, Theological Reason is so strong a Foundation to confirm it, that I wonder how rational men could ever be induced to question the truth of it. Is it (think you) enough to assert the Divinity, and Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiality, and Personal Distinction of the Holy Ghost (as the Bishop sayes) to save from Heresie the denial of his Procession from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son as from one Principle? would not he, that should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Son to be a distinct Person from, and Consubstantial to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but denyed his eternal Generation from him, be an Heretick? or he, who held the Holy Ghost, distinct from, and Consubstantial to them both, but affirmed his Procession to be from the Son onely, and not from the Father, would he not be highly guilty of Heresie? It is then
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57798:9"/>
most evident, that not onely an errour against the Consubstantiality and Distinction, but against the Origination, Generation, and Procession of the Divine Persons is sufficient mattter of Heresie: which being here most manifestly found, either in the Affirmative maintained by the Latins, or in the Negative embraced by the Greeks, about the Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Holy Ghost from the Son, there must also be found suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent matter to constitute the erroneous Tenet Heretical. And seeing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants acknowledge with the Bishop here, that the Greeks in this are the erring party, how can they possibly excuse them from Heresie?</p>
               <p n="5">5. But before I fall upon a particular <hi>examen</hi> of his proofs, we must distinguish between Greeks. Some are Ancient; other Modern. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Greeks, though they did indeed, in this question of the Holy Ghosts procession, express themselves sometimes by the word <hi>per Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> (by the Son) yet the sense they gave them was Confignificative with <hi>à Filio</hi> (from the Son.) Whereas the Modern Greeks, since they rais'd this Dispute against the Latin Church, will not admit that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression <hi>à Filio,</hi> but <hi>per Filium</hi> onely, and that too in a sense Dissigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative to <hi>à Filio.</hi> For they so affert the Holy Ghost to proceed from the Father <hi>by the Son,</hi> that he proceeds from the Father <hi>alone,</hi> and not from the Son at all: thereby making the words <hi>perrFilium</hi> to signifie the <hi>Medium</hi> onely, not the <hi>Principle,</hi> from which he is Originiz'd as truly as from the Father. And that this is the erroneous perswasion of the Modern Greeks is manifest, not onely by those long Discourses between the Greeks and Latins, set down at large in the <note n="a" place="margin">Concil. Florentin, Sess. 18. pag 686. 690. Sess. 22. pag. 741. Sess. 23. pag. 749. <hi>

               <p>Now after this distinction of <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern</hi> Greeks, and their different meanings even under the same expression, it will be seasonable to give solutions to all the Bishops proofs. To the first therefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Bishop labours to excuse the Modern Greeks from a <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 2. pag. 2. 5.</note> errour, he takes a wrong course to effect it, and in stead of excusing them, directly overthrows and condemns them; nay renders those, whom he endeavours to excuse, incapable of that favourable expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Authors he alledges in their behalf, have made for some of the Greek Church. For pag. 24. § 9. num. 1. he acknowledges that errour, of denying the Holy Ghost to proceed from the Son, to be a <hi>grievous errour in Divinity,</hi> and pag. 26. § 9. num. 3. that the Greeks <hi>think a diverse thing</hi> from the Latins in this point, as I have noted above. Now to prove that these who erre thus <hi>grievously,</hi> and differ from the Latin Church <hi>in re,</hi> not in the words onely, but in the thing, do yet not erre <hi>Fundamentally,</hi> he brings Testimonies from our Authors, who speak of such Grecians, (even as he cites them) which erre not at all in the opinion of those alledged Authors, and which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Latin Church onely <hi>voce, in words,</hi> and not in the thing, or matter of their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Thus he cites <hi>Durandus. Pluralitas IN VOCE, salvata unitate IN RE, non repugnat unitati Fidei.</hi> Magist. Sentent. Dist. 11. <hi>Sanè</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57798:10"/>
                  <hi>sciendum est, quod licet in presenti Articulo à nobis Graeci VERBO difcordent, tamen SENSU non differunt:</hi> and the like sayings are in all the following Authors there cited by the Bishop. But what a strange <hi>Medium</hi> is this to prove his intent? He was to prove, that such as were <hi>in grievous errour</hi> in Divinity, erred not Fundamentally; and for proof of this he alledges such as have no <hi>real</hi> errour at all in Divinity. He was to prove, that such as differ <hi>in re,</hi> in the thing it self, from the Latin Church, about the Procession of the Holy Ghost, erre not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally: and for proof of this he alledges such as differ onely from us <hi>voce,</hi> in words, but not in the thing controverted. Is not this strong Logick? Let his Lordships Defender then prove, from the said Authorities, his Assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That those Greeks, who erre grievously in Divinity, and differ <hi>in re</hi> from the Latin Church, erre not Fundamentally, and he will have done more then my Lord himself has done, or any other (I presume) can do. In the mean time every half eye will discover, how inappositely the Relatour hath reasoned hithertó, and brought no Authority at all to make good his Assertion.</p>
               <p>For the Master of Sentences, he speaks only of such Ancient Authors, as differed onely <hi>in voce,</hi> in words, and not in <hi>Substance</hi> from the Latin Church; or at least who spake not so clearly against it, but that their words might admit some tolerable interpretation. But how proves this, that those of the Greek party say <hi>now</hi> no more, nor otherwise, then the <hi>others</hi> did in those Ancienter times? seeing it is manifest from the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> and from <hi>Hieremias</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that their Doctrine cannot admit of that Exposition, which those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors give to the Doctrine of the Ancient Grecians. For they flatly and in express terms deny, that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son, and understand <hi>per Filium</hi> (by the Son) in that sense which excludes <hi>à Filio</hi> (from the Son.)</p>
               <p>This difference of times was long since observed by St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> in that very place, wherein his Lordship cites him, to wit, <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Sentent. dist.</hi> 11. <hi>quest.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>ad</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">um.</hi> &amp; 4<hi rend="sup">um.</hi> His words are these. <hi>Ad il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud quod objicitur de Damasceno dicendum, quod non est in istâ parte ei as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiendum. Sicut enim intellexi, ipse fuit in tempore, quando orta est con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentio. Vnde non est in hoc sustinendus, quia simpliciter fuit Graecus: tamen ipse cautè loquitur. Unde non dicit, quod Spiritus non est a Filio, sed dicit, NON DICIMVS A FILIO; quia Graeci non confitebantur, nec ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men negabant. Sed modò eorum maledicta progenies addidit ad paternam Dementiam, &amp; dicit, quod non procedit à Filio, nisi temporaliter: &amp; ideo tanquam Haereticos &amp; Schismaticos Romana eos damnat Ecclesia.</hi> 
                  <q>To that (sayes he) which is objected from <hi>Damascen</hi> it is to be answered, that we are not to assent to him in this particular. For, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, he lived in the time, when this Controversie was sprung up. Wherefore we are not bound to maintain him in this point; because, absolutely speaking, he was a Grecian: yet himself speaks warily. For, he doth not say, the Holy Ghost is not from the Son, but he saith, <hi>we say not from the Son.</hi> For the Grecians, as they did not confess, so neither did they deny (to wit, the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son.) But now their accursed off-spring hath added to the madness of their Fore-fathers, and professeth, that the Holy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57798:10"/>
Ghost doth not at all proceed from the Son, otherwise then <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally:</hi> and therefore the Roman Church condemns them both as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques and Schismatiques.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But let us adde a word or two more in particular to his Authorities cited. <hi>Durandus</hi> his words give onely a general Doctrine, which is most true, <hi>viz. That difference IN WORDS is not repugnant to the unity of Faith.</hi> The Master of Sentences (we said but even now) speaks of those Ancienter Greeks, who spake moderately and <hi>warily</hi> in this point. <hi>Bandinus</hi> is cited, but no words of his alledged. St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> is quite against his Lordship. For in that very place which he cites, St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> brands the Greeks of his time, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted the Roman Church, with the note of <note n="a" place="margin">Suam Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere ausi sunt, &amp; Auctorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Ecclesiae Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manoe obviare; &amp; ideo facti sunt Heretici quia negant Fidei verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; &amp; Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matici quia recesserunt ab Ecclesiae unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. D. Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. ibidem.</note> Hereticks and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques, Now the Bishop uses some cunning, in not giving notice of those precedent words, and thereby perswading his Reader, that St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> by not answering to the Objection pressed by the Greeks, <hi>viz. That Salvation might be had without that Article, A PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRE FILIO QUE PROCEDIT;</hi> but onely saying, that <hi>such a determination was opportune by reason of the danger,</hi> tacitly grants that Salvation may be had without it. And consequently was of opinion, that the Greeks who separated from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in his time, were capable of Salvation, even in that Separation. Whereas it is most manifest in that very Paragraph, that St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> (as is said) holding them Heretiques and Schismatiques, excluded them from Salvation. And this would have appeared, had not St. <hi>Bonaventures</hi> former words been concealed by the Bishop.</p>
               <p>But this is not all the Art he useth in this Citation. He was to prove, that according to St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> the Grecians opposite to the Roman Church, notwithstanding their Errour and Separation, were capable of Salvation, even supposing the Declarations and Decrees of the Roman Church in his time against them: and to prove this he alledges an Answer of St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> to an Objection about the addition of the word <hi>Filioque</hi> to the Creed. Now this addition was made before the succeeding Declarations of the Church against the Grecians; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently seeing for many hundred years the Creed was without this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it was most evident, that Salvation might be had, and was had without it: nay, even after the addition was made, till the <hi>necessity</hi> of it was sufficiently declared by the Church, and the point fully <hi>defined</hi> against the Grecians who opposed it, it was not happily so necessary, but some might be saved without it. But by what reach of Logick will the Bishop be able to prove this Consequence; St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> tacitly grants, that Salvation might be had without that Article, <hi>before it was added</hi> and decreed by the Church to contain a Point of Christian Faith necessary to Salvation: <hi>Ergo</hi> St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> holds, <hi>that even after such decrees were made,</hi> Salvation might be had without it; and even by those who obstinately contradicted the Truth contained in it? For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was added, and at the first addition, before the said Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Christians might be excused by ignorance: but after such Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were made, those who knew them, as the Greek Church did, could by no ignorance be excused.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jodocus Clictoveus</hi> is cited to small purpose. For the question is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57798:11"/>
not, whether <hi>quidam ex Graecis</hi> (some of the Grecians) hold that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Sou; for that is true even at this day: but whether those, who violently oppose the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is to say, the Patriarchs, Bishops, Clergy, and people who take part with them (which we now term the Greek Church) hold, that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scotus</hi> is of as little force as <hi>Clictoveus.</hi> For the Bishop was to prove from this Author (as he undertakes) that the present Greek Church errs not Fundamentally. And to prove this he alledgeth him saying, That <hi>the Ancient Greeks differed rather in Words, then in Substance from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church;</hi> which was not at all touched in the Controversie between them. For all of ours grant, that the Ancient Grecians were guilty of no <hi>real</hi> errour at all, land so of no <hi>Fundamental</hi> errour. But how does that excuse the present Greeks from <hi>Fundamental</hi> errour? His Lordship should have shew'n this. And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is as far from proving <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Greek Church</hi> not to erre, as his words point from the time of it. For he speaks of St. <hi>John Damascen,</hi> who flourished six hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was born, and who spake so <hi>warily</hi> and moderately in the point, that (as St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> observes) his words may be taken in a favourable sense, to wit, as <hi>not denying,</hi> that the Holy Ghost pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Son, as the latter Grecians now do, but onely saying <hi>non dicimus,</hi> we use not to say <hi>ex Filio,</hi> but rather <hi>per Filium, neque af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmando nec negando,</hi> formalizing, as 'tis evident, at the manner of expression, but not at the thing. Lastly, when the words of <hi>Tolet,</hi> and of the Lutherans to Hieremias the Patriarch shall be cited, they shall receive answer. Onely this is most certain, that <hi>Tolet</hi> holds, with all Catholique Doctors, that the Modern Grecians are Hereticks, and so do erre Fundamentally: and the Lutherans oppose <hi>Hieremias,</hi> who denyes in express terms the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son, as we have already shew'n.</p>
               <p>His second and Theological Argument is, that since their forme of speech is, that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father <hi>by the Son,</hi> and is the Spirit of the Son, without making any difference in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiality of the Persons, they must be <hi>a True</hi> Church, though <hi>an erroneous</hi> one in this particular. Here the Bishop thinks to blinde all the Churches of Christendome with a trifle. He grants, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever makes an Inequality between the Holy Ghost and the Son, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes the Consubstantiality of the Holy Ghost with the Son, is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique. But he goes not about to shew in Divinity (though he talks much of it) how all this can be, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Holy Ghost should be in all respects Equal and Consubstantial with the Son, unless he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Son. This (it seems) was matter too deep for his Lordship to wade into, and therefore very dexterously he puts it off as a business of no great moment. And to hide his face from an open profession (with the Greeks) against the Holy Ghosts Proceeding from the Son, he first casts a vail over the Readers eyes, giving him a dark ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, that the Holy Ghost is <hi>the Spirit of the Son,</hi> and then boldly tells him <hi>non est aliud,</hi> 'tis the same to say the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of the Son, as to say the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son. But I ask his Lordship whether the Modern Greeks say, the Holy Ghost is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57798:11"/>
the Spirit of the Son; for he cites none, but St. <hi>John Damascen,</hi> for it, who is none of the Moderns? Secondly, whether the Spirit he here sets forth, do truly proceed from the Son? if not; then he trades with some other Spirit, and not with the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>What I have hitherto said is, I doubt not, sufficient to undeceive any indifferent Reader, touching the Question in Dispute. Yet to press the point a little harder, I thus argue in form against his Lordship, and that out of his own Concessions.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Greeks</hi> errour be not onely <hi>concerning,</hi> but <hi>against</hi> the Holy Ghost, then (according to the Bishops own Distinction) they have lost all Assistance of that Blessed Spirit, and are become no <hi>True Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But their errour is not onely <hi>concerning,</hi> but <hi>against</hi> the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Therefore they have lost all the Assistance of that Blessed Spirit, and are become no <hi>True Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major,</hi> or First Proposition, contains the Bishops own Doctrine: The <hi>Minor,</hi> or Second Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Greeks</hi> errour is not onely <hi>concerning,</hi> but <hi>against</hi> the Holy Ghost, I thus prove.</p>
               <p>All errours specially opposite to the particular and personal Processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghost are (according to all Divines) not onely errours <hi>concerning,</hi> but errours <hi>against</hi> the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>But the Greeks errour is opposite to the particular and personal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Holy Ghost, as is already proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> their errour is not onely <hi>concerning,</hi> but <hi>against</hi> the Holy Ghost: whose <hi>Assistance</hi> therefore they have lost, not onely according to the <hi>first,</hi> but even <hi>latter Branch</hi> of the Bishops Distinction; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently remain no <hi>True Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here the Bishop may seem to have provided against the force of this Argument, by hinting a difference between errours <hi>Fundamental</hi> and <hi>not Fundamental;</hi> which point I shall purposely examine in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter. In the <hi>interim</hi> I observe, that his Lordship having been for a while serious, begins now to quibble upon the word <hi>Filioque,</hi> on occasion of the Popes inserting it into the Creed. And first he grumbles, that the Pope should <hi>Adde</hi> and <hi>Anathematize too.</hi> I hope, <note place="margin">§ 9. num. 2. pag. 25.</note> he will give the Holy Ghost leave to Assist the Church, in <hi>adding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> for the better explication of any Article of Faith: and then the Pope hath leave and command too, to <hi>Anathematize</hi> all such, as shall not allow the use of such expressions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now to come to the debate of <hi>Filioque,</hi> 'tis true, that many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of years had passed from the time of the Apostles, before <hi>Filioque</hi> was added to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and more since the Declarations and Decrees were sufficiently published: and in all these years Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was had in the Church without mention of <hi>Filioque.</hi> But it is also true, that the Addition of <hi>Filioque</hi> to the Creed was made many years before the Difference brake out between the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Greeks.</hi> So that th' inserting this word <hi>Filioque</hi> into the Creed was not the first occasion of Schisme. But grudges arising among the Greeks, who had been a large flourishing Church with a number of most learned and zealous <hi>Prelates,</hi> and held the Articles still, though upon emptier heads: such, quickly fill'd with winde, thinking their swelling places, and great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Constantinople</hi> might hold up against <hi>Rome,</hi> they began to quarrel,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57798:12"/>
not for places (that was too mean a Motive for such as look'd so big) but first they would make it appear they could teach <hi>Rome,</hi> nay they spyed out Heresies in it, (the old way of all Hereticks) and so fell to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the Procession of the Holy Ghost, and must needs have <hi>Filioque</hi> out of the Creed.</p>
               <p>To return unto which, after the meaning of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church was understood, and that the word <hi>Filioque</hi> lay in the Creed to confess that the Holy Ghost <hi>proceeded</hi> from the Son as truly as from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that whoever denyed the <hi>Filioque</hi> must be supposed to deny the <hi>Procession,</hi> then it became an Heresie to deny it, and the Church did <hi>rightly Anathematize</hi> all such denyers. None can be so ignorant as to think the Church, in composing the Creed, intended to thrust in all points of Faith concerning the <hi>Trinity</hi> ('tis clear, more may be added yet:) but when the Church understood that some of her <hi>Truant Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> began to stumble at a particular point, (the Holy Ghosts Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Son) then she thought it high time to speak a loud word, that might keep her good Children from falling.</p>
               <p>Neither is the Roman-Catholick Church justly accusable of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (though the Bishop taxes her of it) because she is quick and sharp against those that fall into Heresie. 'Tis not the Libertine Heretick the Church looks so eagerly after, to have him punished; as a Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compassion of her other Children (yet good) lest they should come to be infected. If sinners could be bad themselves onely, and not infuse their venome into others, nor give scandal, the Church might possibly have reason to mitigate her severity. But seeing the Bishop brings in <hi>St. Peter, with the Keyes at his girdle,</hi> to shew his mildness, may not I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to his Lordship St. <hi>Peters</hi> proceeding with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira, Acts</hi> 5. 5, 10. striking them dead at his Feet for retaining <hi>some part</hi> of their goods, though they had deliver'd the <hi>far greater part</hi> of them to St. <hi>Peter?</hi> Yea, why may I not joyn St. <hi>Paul</hi> to him, chastising most severely such untoward children, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20? Certainly the Church punishes not her Delinquents, to encrease the suffering of such as are to dye, but to strike a terrour into the living, whom fear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, more then the love of God, keeps from sinning.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Bishop in the end of the ninth §. parting friendly with the Greeks, before he enters into war again with the Roman Church, in the tenth §. he scoureth up his best Defensive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, the Point of <hi>Fundamentals;</hi> having hitherto given us but a glimpse of it. He tells of Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> that <hi>he read a large discourse out of a Printed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 10. num. 1 pag. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Book, saying 'twas his own</hi> (his Lordship would seem to mistrust it) writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against Dr. <hi>white,</hi> concerning <hi>Fundamentals.</hi> The Bishop sayes not what he answer'd to this Discourse, but puts all off with an <hi>I do not remember:</hi> might he not have call'd to his Chaplain for Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> Book, if he had minded an Answer? But I see him now drawing up his great Artillery of <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> to attack his Adversary for saying <hi>All Points Defined by the Church are Fundamentall;</hi> yet this proves but a Squib: for he presently goes out of the question, to disport himself with a fancy of his own (a piece of Policy, forsooth, which he hath spied in the Roman Church.)</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Rome, <hi>sayes he,</hi> to shrivel the credit of its Opposers, <hi>blasts them all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Num. 2. pag. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>with the name of</hi> Heretique <hi>and</hi> Schismatique, <hi>and so by that means grew into Greatnesse.</hi> To make good which proceeding this course was taken. The School must maintain, that all Points defined by the Church are thereby Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, necessary to be believed, of the Substance of Faith: <hi>and</hi> then, <hi>saith he,</hi> leave active Heads to determine, not what is truest, but what is fittest for them.</p>
               <p>Now what a weak discourse have we here from a grave <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>England!</hi> Thinks he all the world is turn'd mad, or Heathen? No truth left upon earth, but all become Juglers? Is the whole business of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but a <hi>Legerdemain</hi> to serve the Popes Ambition, a puff of winde? Is it credible so many learned and Venerable Prelates, and other Holy men, whose eminent Sanctity it hath pleased God to illustrate by the Testimony of glorious Miracles, so many famous Doctors, and Heads of Schools, so many Austere and Religious Persons, as have secluded themselves from all Temporal Concernments, to attend wholly to the Service of God and Salvation of their Souls; is it credible, I say, that all these were such <hi>egregious dissemblers</hi> as to prostitute their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the Popes Greatness, by <hi>determining</hi> not what they conceived <hi>Truest,</hi> but what they esteemed <hi>fittest</hi> for his Temporal ends? Such stuff as this might serve sometimes for Pulpit-babble, to deceive the giddy multitude, and to cast a mist before their eyes, that they might not see the Impurity of their own English-Protestant Church, even in its first rise under <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and the <hi>People-cheating</hi> Policies it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to for its restauration under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as may be seen in History. But who could have imagined his Lordship would betray so great a weakness of Judgement, nay so much want of Charity, as to affirm so groundless, so impossible a slaunder? But let it pass for one
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57798:13"/>
of the Bishops <hi>Railleries.</hi> Yet I must confess it becomes not one, that would be esteem'd a grave Doctor of the English Church, an <hi>alterius orbis Patriarcha,</hi> as the Ancient Primates of <hi>England</hi> have been called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After his Lordship has sported thus a while with all that can be serious upon earth, (Mans Salvation) he returns again to the question, <hi>Whether all Points Defined by the Church be Fundamental;</hi> and like one that provides for a Retreat, or Subter-fuge, he cuts out a number of ambiguous Distinctions, as so many <hi>Turnings</hi> and <hi>Windings</hi> to fly away by, when he shall be put to it. He blames Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> for not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing between <hi>a Church in general,</hi> (which he supposes cannot erre) <note place="margin">Ibidem num. 3.</note> and <hi>a general Council,</hi> (which he sayes, he <hi>grants not,</hi> that it cannot erre.) Would he have Women and Children come to determine Doctrines? you will finde, he alwayes perplexes the Question; he staggers in the delivery of his own judgement: he sayes, <hi>he is slow in opposing what is concluded by a Lawful, General, and consenting Authority</hi> (this must needs be <hi>a Church in General.</hi>) It seems then sometimes he opposeth it, or staggers at it, as those sometimes do, that go slowly. One while hee'l take <hi>Fundamental</hi> for a point necessary to be believed <hi>explicitè,</hi> as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish't from a point that is necessary to be believed onely <hi>implicitè.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while he takes it for a <hi>Prime</hi> and <hi>Native Principle</hi> of Faith, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinguish't from what he calls a <hi>Superstructure,</hi> or <hi>Deducible</hi> from it. Now he takes <hi>Fundamental</hi> for a point common to all, and contain'd expresly in the Creed; then for a point <hi>necessary to be known of all</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Salvation, as distinguish't from a point necessary onely to <hi>some particular</hi> mens Salvation: and thus by shifting from one acception to another, he carries on the design of his Labyrinth with so much Art, that the Reader is in great danger to be lost in following him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Having therefore seen the word <hi>Fundamental</hi> used in so many <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> senses, we will first deduce, even from the Bishops own Discourse, the right sense, in which for the present we ought to take the word <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental.</hi> His Lordship and Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> fell upon this Dispute about points <hi>Fundamental,</hi> or <hi>Necessary</hi> to Salvation, occasionally from what was touched in their Debate concerning the Greek Church: where the Bishop affirmed, that though they had <hi>grievously erred</hi> in Divinity, yet not in a point <hi>Fundamental</hi> sufficient to <hi>un-church</hi> them: which must needs have happened; had <hi>they</hi> erred in a point <hi>necessary to Salvation.</hi> Wherefore the Bishop in his 25<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> page takes it for the same, to put the Greeks <hi>out of the Church,</hi> and <hi>to deny</hi> to them <hi>Salvation.</hi> We have also seen, how in the words lately cited he calls <hi>Fundamental</hi> what ever is <hi>necessarily</hi> to be believed. Nor can the Lady be thought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired satisfaction concerning <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> in the Bishops sense. For she is to be supposed to have understood, what both Catholiques and Protestants usually mean in this Dispute: and Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> pag. 42. (even as the Bishop, § 2. pag. 2, cites his words) gives an express Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement, that by points <hi>Fundamental</hi> neither he, nor the Lady un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood any other, then Points <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> when he sayes thus, <hi>in all Fundamental Points, that is, in all Points necessary to Salvation.</hi> The question then in Controversie between the Bishop and Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> was, <hi>Whether all Points defined by the Church were Fundamental, or Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation;</hi> that is, <hi>whether all those Truths, which are sufficiently</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57798:13"/>
propos'd to any Christian as Defined by the Church for matter of Faith, can be disbelieved by such a Christian without Mortal and Damnable Sin, which unrepented destroyes Salvation?</p>
               <p>Now Points may be necessary to Salvation two wayes. The one <hi>absolutely,</hi> by reason of the matter they contain, which is so <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally necessary</hi> in it self, that not onely the disbelief of it, when it is sufficiently propounded by the Church, but the meer <hi>want</hi> of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Knowledge, and Belief of it, will hinder Salvation: and those are such Points without the express belief whereof no man can be saved which Divines call necessary <hi>necessitate medij:</hi> others of this kinde they call necessary <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> which all men are <hi>commanded</hi> to seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and expresly believe; so that a <hi>Culpable Ignorance</hi> of them hinders Salvation, although some may be saved with <hi>Invincible</hi> ignorance of them. And all these are <hi>absolutely</hi> necessary to be expresly believed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>necessitate medij,</hi> or <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> in regard of the matter which they contain. But the rest of the Points of Faith are necessarily to be believed <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> onely <hi>conditionally,</hi> that is, by all such to whom they are sufficiently propounded as defined by the <hi>Church:</hi> which necessity proceeds not precisely from the <hi>material object,</hi> or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in them, but from <hi>the formall</hi> object, or Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity declared to Christians by the Churches definition. Whether therefore the points in question be necessary in the first manner or no, by reason of their <hi>precise matter;</hi> yet if they be necessary by reason of the <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> or <hi>formal</hi> object of <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> sufficiently declared and propounded to us, they will be Points <hi>Fundamental,</hi> that is necessary to Salvation to be believed; as we have shewed <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> must here be taken.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The truth of the question then taken in this sense, is a thing so manifest, that his Lordship not knowing how to deny it with any shew of probability, thought it his onely course to divert it (according to his ordinary custome) by turning the Difficulty, which onely proceeded upon a <hi>Fundamentality,</hi> or necessity, derived from the <hi>formall</hi> Object, that is, from the Divine Authority revealing that point, to the <hi>materiall</hi> Object, that is, to the importance of the matter contained in the point revealed; which is a plain Fallacy, in passing <hi>à sensu formali ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I shew, (the difficulty being understood as it ought to be, of the <hi>formall</hi> object, whereby points of Faith are manifested to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) <hi>That all points defined by the Church as matter of Faith are</hi> Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, that is, <hi>necessary to Salvation to be believed by all those to whom they are sufficiently propounded to be so defined,</hi> by this Argument.</p>
               <p>Whosoever refuses to believe any thing sufficiently propounded to him for a Truth revealed from God, commits a sin damnable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of Salvation:</p>
               <p>But whosoever refuses to believe any point sufficiently propounded to him for defined by the Church, as matter of Faith, refuses to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a thing sufficiently propounded to him for a Truth revealed from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Whosoever refuses to believe any point sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him for defined by the Church as matter of Faith,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57798:14"/>
commits a sinne damnable and destructive of Salvation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is evident. For to refuse to believe Gods revelation, is either to give God the lye, or to doubt whether he speak Truth or no. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove from this supposition. For, though his Lordship say, he grants it not; yet for the present he sayes, that though it were supposed he should grant, that the Church, or a lawful General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, cannot erre, <hi>yet this cannot down with him, that all Points even so defined were Fundamental,</hi> that is, (as we have proved) necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Supposing therefore, that the <hi>Church,</hi> and a <hi>lawful General Council,</hi> be taken in this occasion for the same thing, as he affirms they are, saying in the beginning of <hi>num.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 27. <hi>We distinguish not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Church in general, and a General Council, which is her represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative;</hi> and admitting this he proceeds in his argument. Supposing then that the Church in a General Council cannot erre, I prove the <hi>Minor</hi> thus.</p>
               <p>Whosoever refuses to believe that, which is testified to be revealed from God by an Authority which cannot erre, refuses to believe that which is revealed from God:</p>
               <p>But whosoever refuses to believe that which is defined by the Church as matter of Faith, refuseth to believe that which is testified to be revealed from God by an Authority which cannot erre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Whosoever refuseth to believe that which is defined by the Church as matter of Faith, refuseth to believe that which is revealed from God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is evident <hi>ex terminis.</hi> For, if the Authority, which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies it is revealed from God, cannot erre, that which it testifies to be so revealed, is so revealed. The <hi>Minor</hi> is the Bishops supposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church in a General Council cannot erre, as is proved. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And this, I hope, will satisfie any ingenuous Reader, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Proposition is fully proved, taking <hi>Fundamental</hi> for <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> took it. Yet to deal freely with the Bishop, even taking <hi>Fundamental</hi> in a general way, as he in this present Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence mistakes it, for a thing belonging to the Foundation of Religion, it is also manifest, that all Points defined by the <hi>Church</hi> are <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> by reason of that <hi>formal object,</hi> or Infallible Authority, propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, though not alwayes by reason of the <hi>matter</hi> which they contain.</p>
               <p>Whoever deliberately denies, or doubts of any one Point propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and declared as a Divine Infallible Truth by the Authority of the Catholique Church, cannot for that time give Infallible credit to any other Point, delivered as a Divine, Infallible Truth by the Authority of the same Church. For, whoever gives not Infallible credit to the Authority of the Church in any one Point, cannot give Infallible cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to it in any other; because it being one and the same authority in all points deferveth one and the same credit in all: And therefore if it deferve not Infallible credit in any one, it deserveth not Infallible credit in any other. Now I subsume. But he that believes no Point at all with a Divine, Infallible Faith for the Authority of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, erres Fundamentally: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Subsumptum</hi> is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57798:14"/>
evident. For, if he believe none at all, he neither believes God, nor Christ, nor Heaven, nor Hell, &amp;c. with an Infallible, Divine, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith; and thereby quite destroys the whole foundation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And seeing there is no means left to believe any thing with a Divine, Infallible Faith, if the Authority of the Catholique Church be rejected as erroneous, or fallible, (for who can believe either Creed, or Scripture, or unwritten Tradition, but upon her Authority?) It is manifest, that if the Church be disbelieved in any one point, there can be no Infallible Faith of any thing. Where I desire all men seriously to ponder, that the reason, which moveth a man to give Infallible credit to any point declared by the Authority of the Catholique Church, is not the greatness or smallness of the matter, nor the more or less evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Truth, but the promise of Christ, which assures us, that himself and his holy Spirit will <hi>alwayes</hi> be with the Church to teach it <hi>all Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that when the Church declares any thing as matter of Faith, it is not she (considered onely as a company of men subject to errours) but God himself to whom we do, and must give Infallible credit, in all matters whatsoever, great and little, evident or most obscure. For, the Infallibility of the credit given to any one Article, proposed as a Divine Truth by the Catholique Church, doth wholly depend upon the Authority of God, speaking in and by the Church. Wherefore he that will deliberately deny, or doubt of any one Article of Faith, may as well do the same of all, yea of the whole Canon of Scripture: Because if you take away the Authority of the Church, we should not admit of that, according to the words of St. <hi>Augustin: Ego verò Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Libr. contr. Epist. Manich. quam vocant <hi>Fundament.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>non crederem, nisi me Ecclesiae commoveret Authoritas.</hi> I would not (saith he) believe the Gospel, unless the Authority of the Church mov'd me thereunto. So that he, who obstinately denies any one thing sufficiently declared to him by the Church, can have no super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and infallible Faith at all, but opinions of his own, grounded upon some other reason, different from the Divine revelation proposed and applied to him by the Church.</p>
               <p>Wherefore St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in his Book <hi>De Haeresibus</hi> recounteth many Heresies; some of which seem not to be about any matter of great moment: yet he pronounceth, that <hi>whosoever doth obstinately hold any one of these against the known Faith of the Church, is no Catholique Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi> Moreover, St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> tells us, that <hi>nihil periculosius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tractat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  Fide.</note> 
                  <hi>his Haereticis esse potest,</hi> &amp;c. There can be nothing more perillous then these Heretiques, who with <hi>a drop</hi> of poison do infect our Lords sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Faith. Hence it is, that Christ our Saviour saith, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17.) <hi>If he will not hear the Church, let him be to thee as an Heathen and a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can:</hi> As if he should say, let him not be accounted a Childe of the Church, nor consequently of God.</p>
               <p>Adde to this, that to deny or doubt of any thing made known by the Church to be a Truth revealed by God, is in effect to contradict God and the Church, which Divines in other tearms say, is <hi>to give God and the Church the lye,</hi> and to oppose and preferre a private mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and will before and against the judgement and will of God and his true Church; which cannot stand with supernatural Faith in any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57798:15"/>
point whatsoever. Wherefore it is said in St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Creed (which is approved in the nine and thirty Articles of the pretended English Church) that <hi>whosoever will be saved, it is necessary that he hold the Catholique Faith,—which unless every one hold WHOLE and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, without doubt he shall perish for ever.</hi> Neither can the Bishop reply, <note place="margin">Ibidem num. 6, 7. pag. 30, 31.</note> that all points expressed in St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Creed, are <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> in his sense, that is according to the importance of the matter they containe; for, (to omit the Article of our Saviours descent into hell, which can be no <hi>Fundamental</hi> Point in his acception, for Christs Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Resurrection, Ascension, &amp;c. may consist without it) he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exprefly the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son, which his Lordship ha's denyed to be a <hi>Fundamental</hi> Point, as we saw in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>The foresaid distinction of <hi>material</hi> and <hi>formal</hi> object satisfies his Num. 8. pag. 31, 32. For, not so much as <hi>quoad nos</hi> does any point become <hi>Fundamental,</hi> that is, a prime principle in Faith according to the <hi>matter</hi> attested, or <hi>the material</hi> object, which before the definition was onely a Superstructure, or secondary Article. But all the change made by vertue of the Definition is in the Attestation it self, which induces a <hi>new obligation</hi> of holding it to be a point of Faith; and the refusing to hold it so both de stroyes Salvation, and overthrows the whole Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Faith, as is already declared. Let therefore the Reader carry along with him this distinction of <hi>objectum materiale &amp; formale, materia attestata &amp; Authoritas attestantis,</hi> (<hi>the Matter</hi> attested and the <hi>Authority</hi> attesting it) and he will easily both discover the fallacies of his Lordships discourse in this main point of controversie, and solve all his difficulties supported by them.</p>
               <p>And that it may be more apparently perceived, how inapposite his reply is in this whole controversie about <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> we affirming, that all things defined for Points of Faith by the Church, are made <hi>Fundamental</hi> onely by reason of the Infallible Attestation of the Church, and he instead of disproving this, labouring onely to prove, that such as were not <hi>Fundamental</hi> before the Definition, become not <hi>Fundamental</hi> after in the <hi>matter</hi> attested, which we hold as much as he can do: replying, I say, in this manner, he proceeds just as if <hi>A. C.</hi> should assert, that a Crown, an Angel, and <hi>a Piece,</hi> cut out of the same wedge, are as fine and pure gold one as another, and <hi>W. L.</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and labour much to prove, that the one is of <hi>more weight</hi> then the other, which was not at all questioned: or as if <hi>A. C.</hi> should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, that a Thred, a Gord, and a Cable of twenty ells long a piece, were all three of the same length, and <hi>W. L.</hi> should reply and demonstrate, that they were not all of the <hi>same thickness;</hi> which no man ever affirmed them to be.</p>
               <p>Some Modern Protestants object, that the Infalliblity of the Church is limited to <hi>Fundamental</hi> points onely, and not to <hi>Superstructures:</hi> so that they may reply, this Argument proceeds upon a false supposition, by extending that Infallibity as well to <hi>Superstructures</hi> as to <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</hi> To this I answer, that if by <hi>Fundamental</hi> Points be meant onely such Points as are <hi>the prime Articles</hi> of Faith, and the first principles of Religion according to <hi>the precise matter</hi> contained in them, from which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57798:15"/>
all the rest are deduced, and have necessary dependance upon them; and by <hi>super structures</hi> onely such Points of Faith as are <hi>less principal,</hi> and deducible from the other; if, I say, onely this be understood by <hi>Fundamentals</hi> and <hi>Superstructures,</hi> the distinction destroyes it self. For on the one side it supposes that those Superstructures are Points of Faith, as it were of secondary or less principal importance; and yet supposes, that the Church is not infallible in her Definitions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and by that makes it impossible that they should be Points of Faith.</p>
               <p>This I evidence by this Argument, grounded in my former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. Every Point of Faith must be believed by an Infallible Assent; but if the Church be not Infallible in her Definitions of <hi>Superstructures,</hi> no <hi>Superstructure</hi> can be believed with an In fallible Assent. <hi>Ergo</hi> if the Church be fallible in her Definition of <hi>Superstructures,</hi> no <hi>Superstructure</hi> can be a Point of Faith. The <hi>Major</hi> is granted both by his Lordship and those Protestants, who coin this objection. The <hi>Minor</hi> is already proved in the former Argument, For there is no means left to believe any point with an Infallible Assent, if the Authority of the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining those points to be believed, be fallible.</p>
               <p>Neither can he avoid the force of this Argument, by replying that Scripture believed to be the word of God by <hi>the introducing autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the Church, and <hi>its own light,</hi> may be <hi>a formal</hi> object, and reason of an infallible Assent, to such superstructures as are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in it, though the authority of the Church be fallible in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them. For, first we will shew hereafter, that we can have no infallible certainty that any canon of Scripture is the word of God, but onely by the authority of the Catholique Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it infallibly to us. Secondly, there will be no infallible means to know what <hi>Superstructures</hi> are contained sufficiently in Scripture, what not, if the Church can erre in that declaration. Thirdly, seeing (as we shall prove hereafter) many <hi>superstructures,</hi> are not expresly, and some not at all contained in Scripture, how can we believe them with an infallible assent, if the Church can erre in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of them? And this shall serve for the present to remove this objection, as Implicatory and Chymerical in it self; when we meet with it hereafter, it shall be further satisfied.</p>
               <p>As concerning those things which the Church either doth, or can define, (which the Relatour hints at pag. 27.) whether they must be in Scripture, at least implicitely, or whether they may be out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (though not so entirely, as perchance he would inferre them to be) but deduced from thence, or making for the clearer explication of that which is contained in Scripture; concerning this, I say, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Divines agree not; and it concerns not our present purpose to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. Neither will I discourse much of the Difference between the Church in general, and a General Council. The first containing the Head and all the Members of the Church; the latter onely the Head and principal Members thereof; although the latter represent the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: I say, I will not discourse much about this Difference; because without a further distinction (which the Bishop would have) it is as well known what we mean, when we say, <hi>The Church cannot erre in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:57798:16"/>
                  <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> as when we say, <hi>A General Council cannot erre in defining them.</hi> For no man will conceive, that we put this power of Defining in the common people; which were nothing else, but to bring all things to confusion; but we place it <hi>in the Prelates and Pastours of the Church assembled together,</hi> when they may write in Capital Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, what was written by the Primitive Church, as we read in Holy Writt, <hi>IT HATH SEEMED GOOD UNTO THE HOLY GHOST AND TO US, Acts</hi> 15. 28.</p>
               <p>Now to come a little closer to the point, we finde his Lordship to say, (pag. 28.) <hi>That although he should grant, that a General Council cannot erre, yet this cannot down with him, that all points even so defined are Fundamental. For, Deductions are not prime and native Principles; nor are Superstructures, Foundations.</hi> But this Difficulty of his would not have risen, had he considered the distinction of <hi>Fundamental</hi> and <hi>not-Fundamental,</hi> which Catholique Divines admit, in the <hi>material</hi> objects of Faith. For, in the manner before declared, we grant some are <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>Native</hi> Principles, others <hi>Deductions</hi> and <hi>Superstructures.</hi> But this we stand to, that all points defined by the Church are Fundamental <hi>reductivè,</hi> that is, points whereto (when we know them to be defined) we cannot deny our Assent, by denying or doubting of them, without destroying <hi>the formal</hi> object of Faith, by taking away all Authority from the Church, whereby we may be Infallibly assured, what God has revealed to be believed by Christians.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For answer to the rest in that page, you will finde enough in my discourse a little before of <hi>Fundamentals</hi> and <hi>not-Fundamentals:</hi> let us now examine those words of his (pag. 29.) <hi>That which is FUNDA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTAL in the Faith of Christ is a Rock immoveable, and can never be varied. Never. Therefore if it be Fundamental after the Church hath Defined it, it was Fundamental before the Definition.</hi> All this may be granted, if rightly understood. For, whatsoever is to be believed as a matter of Faith by the Definition of the Church, was believed before, though not <hi>expresly.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Implicite</hi> Faith of all may be said to be <hi>Fundamental;</hi> but <hi>Explicite</hi> Faith of that which is onely <hi>now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined</hi> is not required before the Definition. Therefore the Christian (to use the Bishops phrase) hath <hi>whereon to rest,</hi> as not being bound to believe more expresly, then is declared by the Church to be revealed from God. Therefore the Church makes not the <hi>Implicite</hi> Faith <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,</hi> but the <hi>Explicite</hi> Faith it maketh <hi>Fundamental.</hi> When I say <hi>Implicite,</hi> I mean not a point so implicitely believed, that none before might have <hi>Explicite</hi> belief of it; but such points as were not general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to be <hi>certainly revealed,</hi> (though they might be known to some of greater learning and knowledge) which by the Churches De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition are Authentically attested to have been revealed from God: after which Declaration there arises an obligation to all, who know they are defined <hi>as such</hi> by the Church, to believe them <hi>Explicitely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what we have here said may be granted to the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving her power to make <hi>new Articles</hi> of Faith.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For to this it is sufficient, that she declares those, which were so before in themselves, though not so well known to be such as alwayes to oblige them to believe them explicitely, who are bound to it, when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57798:16"/>
they know them to be revealed from God by the Churches Definition. And by this time I hope, you finde that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> speakes truth, and wrongs not the Catholique Church.</p>
               <p>For in those places he onely sayes, that the Definitions of the Church give no <hi>strength,</hi> or <hi>greater certainty,</hi> to the revelation of God, that being wholly impossible to be done; for nothing can be more certain then is the revelation of God, who is Truth it self. But withal he teaches, even in the places cited, that the Definitions of the Church make it <hi>known to us,</hi> that such and such a point is an object of Divine Faith, and that so <hi>certainly</hi> that she cannot erre in it: which is all we either say, or need to say. For though the Church makes the Divine revelation <hi>no certainer</hi> then it is in it self, yet she makes <hi>us more certain,</hi> that such a point is a Divine revelation. As a faithful and honest Servant, telling one that his Master, being a man of great and entire credit, said such a thing, gives no <hi>strength</hi> to his Masters vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and authority; but yet it gives assurance <hi>to me</hi> that his Master said so: neither believe I, that the thing spoken is morally true, because the Servant <hi>tells me</hi> his Master said so, but because <hi>his Master said it,</hi> whom I know to be a man of that credit, that he would not say a thing that were not true; though I am not <hi>certain</hi> that his Master said it, save onely because the servant tells me so, whom I know also to be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But the Bishops difficulty about points <hi>Fundamental,</hi> when he sayes, that <hi>the Churches Definition cannot make Superstructures to become Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> or <hi>Foundations,</hi> is easily solved according to my former distinction. The Churches Definition cannot make a <hi>Superstructure</hi> to become a Foundation <hi>quoad materiam,</hi> or <hi>rem attestatam,</hi> (according to the Thing, or matter attested) I grant it: for in this sense, neither the Church, nor the Aposties, no nor Christs Definition can make a Superstructure a Foundation: for what they are <hi>in themselves</hi> they must alwayes be. The Churches Definition cannot make a Superstructure a Foundation, <hi>quoad formam,</hi> or <hi>Authoritatem attestantis</hi> (according to the form, or Authority of the persons attesting, or witnessing that it is a Divine Revelation) I deny it. For such a Testimony, or Authentical Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, makes it both <hi>necessary to Salvation</hi> (in which sense onely <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> is to be taken in this <hi>present Dispute,</hi> as I have proved) and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>reductively,</hi> or consequently belonging to the Foundation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, according to the Authority of Christ testified to reveal it; which will be dissolved by the disbelief of it, as is already shewed.</p>
               <p>When he sayes that <hi>every Fundamental point must be known to all,</hi> I distinguish in the same manner. Every Fundamental point according to the <hi>material</hi> object must be known to all, I grant it: every Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point, that is, every point necessary to Salvation to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>when it is sufficiently propounded,</hi> according to the attestation made by the Church of it, must be known to all, I deny it: and this distinction solves all his other difficulties propounded in this page.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Scotus</hi> cited by his Lordship, Num. 6. pag. 30. delivers nothing in behalf of his party, but affirms the same thing, which we have already asserted namely, that St. <hi>Basil,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and other learned Greeks; differed not from the Latins, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57798:17"/>
                  <hi>Augustin,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> &amp;c. but onely <hi>in manner of speech;</hi> because otherwise either the Greeks, or the Latins, had been Heretiques. Yet hence it follows not, that <hi>Scotus</hi> thought they could be Heretiques, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they denied, or doubted of that, which they had reason to believe was revealed by God. But it onely followes, that if they knew this (as those learned Greeks had sufficient reason to know it) they might well be esteemed Heretiques, before any special Declaration of the Church: although it be more clear, that he is an Heretique, who denies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Doctrine, after he confesses that it is defined by the Church. Wherefore <hi>Scotus</hi> doth well adde, that however it was before, yet <hi>ex quo,</hi> &amp;c. from the time that the Catholique <hi>Church</hi> declared it, it is to be held of Faith.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we deny not, but that <hi>a learned man, who oppugnes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine clearly contained in Scripture, or generally received by the Church, may be accounted an Heretique, before he be AS SUCH condemned by a General Council.</hi> But we say, that <hi>there are many things, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves are matters of Faith, yet so obscure, in relation especially to unlearned, and particular persons, that before the Decree of the Church, we are not He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, though we should either doubt of them or deny them:</hi> because as yet there appears no sufficient reason, that can oblige us to believe them; although <hi>after the Definition of the Church we ought as well to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them as any other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence it appears likewise that <hi>Scotus</hi> is much wronged by his Lordship. For first, he would perswade his Reader, that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour supposed <hi>a real</hi> difference between the Ancient Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Fathers about the Procession of the Holy Ghost: whereas <hi>Scotus,</hi> because neither the one nor the other of them can be esteemed Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, declares, that there was no <hi>real</hi> difference in this point between them: which the Bishop very handsomely leaves out. <hi>Verisimile igitur est</hi> (sayes <hi>Scotus</hi>) <hi>quod non subest dictis verbis contrariis contrariorum Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Sententia Discors;</hi> It is therefore likely, that there is no disagreeing opinion contained in the contrary words of those contrary Saints: and then proves by a very probable Argument, that it is so. Secondly, as he left out the said words in the midst of the sentence, so (to induce his Reader to think, that <hi>Scotus,</hi> (as he would have him understood in the matter of belief) should say, that what was not of the substance of Faith before, was made to be of the substance of the Faith by the Churches Definition, and thereby inferres a contradiction in this Authours as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions) he adds words, and fathers them upon <hi>Scotus</hi> in another part of the sentence, saying first, that <hi>Scotus</hi> sayes <hi>howsoever it was before:</hi> referring his words to the thing controverted, that is to say in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, whether the point in question were of the substance of Faith, or Fundamental before the Churches Definition, or no; whereas <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> speaks not of the Thing, but of the Persons, <hi>viz.</hi> the Greek and Latin Fathers, as appears by his words, <hi>quicquid sit de eis,</hi> (whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be said of them.) Now I think he will have much ado to finde any Dictionary, or Grammer, wherien <hi>eis</hi> signifies <hi>it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done he makes <hi>Scotus</hi> say (by adding to his Text) thus, <hi>yet ex quo,</hi> from the time that the Catholique Church declared it, it is to be held <hi>as of the substance of Faith.</hi> Now <hi>Scotus</hi> has not one word <hi>of the</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:57798:17"/>
                  <hi>substance of Faith,</hi> much less of <hi>Fundamental,</hi> which he imposes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently upon him; but sayes onely thus, <hi>Ex quo Ecclesia declaravit hoc esse tenendum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>tenendum est, quòd Spiritus Sanctus procedat ab utro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que;</hi> (since the Church hath so declared, so it must be held.) Thus he windes his Authours through as many <hi>Meanders</hi> as he finds subservient to his own turn.</p>
               <p>Now to clear the difficulty, the former distinction is here also to be used; that That which was not Fundamental in it self before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not <hi>Fundamental</hi> in the <hi>matter,</hi> or thing attested, but onely by reason of the attestation of the Church, obliging to the acceptation of it, and to be embraced as Fundamental, that is necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be believed as a Divine Truth: and therefore <hi>Scotus</hi> doth not say, that <hi>ex quo,</hi> after it was declared by the Church it becomes to be of <hi>the substance of Faith,</hi> which it was not before, but that it is <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> to <hi>be held,</hi> or believed, <hi>which necessity</hi> was not before.</p>
               <p>By this Doctrine 'tis manifest, that there is no contradiction in <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his Discourse; which his Lordship endeavours to put upon him.</p>
               <p>Now as for that expression of <hi>Scotus</hi> (<hi>Declaravit</hi>) the Church hath declared, &amp;c. out of which the Bishop would infer, that <hi>Scotus</hi> makes for his party, <hi>Because every thing which belongs to the exposition, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 10. num. 7 pag. 31,</note> 
                  <hi>of another, INTUS EST, is not another contrary thing, but is contained within the Bewels, or Nature, of that which is interpreted; from which if the Declaration depart, it is faulty and erroneous; because in stead of Dealaring it, it gives another and contrary sense. Therefore when the Church declares any thing in a Council, either that which she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares was INTV'S</hi> or <hi>EXTRA,</hi> viz. <hi>In the nature and verity of the thing, or out of it. If it were EXTRA, without the nature of the Thing Declared, then the Declaration of the Thing is false; and so far from being Fundamental in the Faith. If it were INTVS, within the compass and nature of the thing (though not open and apparent to every eye) then the Declaration is true, but not otherwise Fundamental, then the thing is which is Declared. For that which is INTVS cannot be larger and deeper, then that in which it is. If it were, it could not be INTVS. Therefore nothing is simply Fundamental, because the Church declares it, but because it is so in the nature of the thing, which the Church Declares.</hi> Thus far his Lordship.</p>
               <p>I answer therefore to this Argument, That his expression is lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly solid and good, and that the Declaration of the Church gives not the thing Declared this <hi>extrà,</hi> viz. that is altered from <hi>intùs,</hi> or its internal being which it had before it was declared. Wherefore in this sense, Those which were not <hi>intùs,</hi> of themselves <hi>prime Articles</hi> of our Faith before the Declaration, change not their nature, nor do they become <hi>prime Articles</hi> by their Declaration: and in this manner, even afterwards, they have no extraneous mutation to become Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. But this doth not hinder them from becoming <hi>Fundamental</hi> in that sense, in which we dispute; that is, <hi>such as cannot be denyed or doubted of under pain of damnation;</hi> although they were not <hi>thus Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> before the Declaration, as not being so clearly proposed to us, as that we were bound to believe them. Neither does this take away
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57798:18"/>
any thing from their <hi>intùs,</hi> or that being which they had of themselves, but onely gives a certainty of their being so, and declares that they ought to be so <hi>quoad nos</hi> as well as <hi>quoad se</hi> and internally. And it is no evasion, but a solid distinction, That the Declaration of the Church varies not the thing in it self, but <hi>quoad nos</hi> in its respect to us. For though he sayes true in this sense, that <hi>no respect to us can va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Foundation, quoad rem attestatam,</hi> that is, make those to be <hi>prime Articles</hi> which are not such in themselves; yet it can binde us, not onely <hi>to peace and external obedience</hi> (as he would have it) but also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us not so much as internally to doubt, or deny, any Articles, after they are declared by the Church to be of Faith; which is to be <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> in the sense we now Dispute, that is, necessary to Salvation to be believed.</p>
               <p>Neither can the Bishop inferre, that if the Church can make any thing to be in this sense <hi>Fundamental</hi> in the Faith, that was not, <hi>then it can take away something from the Foundation,</hi> and make it to be declared not to be <hi>Fundamental.</hi> This, I say, he cannot inferre: because to do this were to define a Thing not to be of Faith, which was before defined to be of Faith; which were to make the Church subject to errour. For as the Church cannot Define any thing to be of Faith, which she had Defined before not to be of Faith; so can she not Define any thing not to be of Faith, which she had defined before to be of Faith. But yet she can define something to be of Faith, which she had not Defined before to be so, because she never before had defined any thing about it. For in this Third case, (which is ours) there is no contradicting of her self, as in the Two former. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> sayes very well, (as the Relator cites him, pag. 32.) <hi>The power of adding any thing contrary, or detracting any thing necessary, are alike, forbidden.</hi> Now to all this discourse <hi>A. C.</hi> said nothing; because perchance it was not in that Disputation urged against him. But I, having found it in his Lordships Book, have said something: and that which, I hope, will abundantly satisfie any judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader. <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 9. pag. 32.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It remains now, that we return to Mr. <hi>Fisher;</hi> who (as his Lordship sayes) endeavoured to prove the Doctrine we have delivered, out of <note place="margin">Aug. Serm. 14. De verb. Apostoli. in fine.</note> St. <hi>Augustin;</hi> who speaks thus. <hi>Fundata res est. In aliis questionibus non diligentèr digestis, nondum plenâ Ecclesiae Authoritate firmatis ferendus est Disputator errans: ibi ferendus error; non tamen progredi debet, ut etiam Fundamentum ipsum Eclesiae quatere moliatur.</hi> In english thus. <q>This is a thing founded. An erring Disputant is to be born with in other questions not diligently digested, nor yet <hi>made firm</hi> by full Authority of the Church. There errour is to be born with. But it ought not to proceed so far, that it should labour to shake <hi>the very Foundation of the Church.</hi>
                  </q> By these words of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> it appears, that though a man may be admitted to dispute freely in other things, yet he is not to be born with, when he goes so far as to question Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>digested</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> by <hi>the full Authority of the Church;</hi> for this is to <hi>shake the foundation.</hi> Now all things that are defined by the Church, are both <hi>digested</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> by the Churches full Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57798:18"/>
Therefore to dispute against such points is to shake the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church, and by consequence all such things are <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> according to St. <hi>Augustin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now consider what his Lordship brings to weaken this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> First, he sayes, this Doctor (St. <hi>Augustine</hi>) speaks of <hi>a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of Doctrine <hi>in Scripture,</hi> not of a <hi>Definition</hi> of the Church. But here the Relatour commits the same offence against St. <hi>Augustin</hi> for which he blamed Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> that is, he <hi>wrongs</hi> both <hi>the Saint</hi> and <hi>the Place.</hi> For I appeal to any indifferent judge, whether St. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks any thing here of a Foundation <hi>of Doctrine in Scripture,</hi> and not rather against those, who impugne the Doctrine of the Church, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be expresly in Scripture, or not. His words are these in the same Sermon. <hi>Detrahunt nobis: ferimus. Canoni Detrahunt: veritati non detrahant. Ecclesiae Sanctae pro remissione peccati originalis parvulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quotidiè labor anti non contradicant.</hi> 
                  <q>They detract from us (sayes he) we suffer it. They detract from the Canon too; let them not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the Truth: Let them not contradict <hi>Holy Church,</hi> daily
labouring for the remission of <hi>the original sinne</hi> of little Children.</q> Where you see, that he will endure any thing spoken against his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or Authority; but nothing against the Truth practised in the Church.</p>
               <p>The Bishop goes on, and endeavours to shew, that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. Num. 10. pag. 33.</note> speaks of a Foundation of <hi>Doctrine in Scripture,</hi> because (immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before) he sayes, <hi>There was a question moved to St.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Baptisme was tyed to the eighth day as well as Circumcision; and no doubt was made then of</hi> the beginning of sin: <hi>and that out of this thing, about which no question was moved, that question that was made, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</hi> And again, <hi>That St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>took that which he gave in answer, from the Foundation of the Church, to confirm a stone that was shaking.</hi> But all this proves nothing against us, but for us: because St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> might answer the question <hi>that was made,</hi> by that which was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all, and questioned by none, although the thing granted and not questioned, were the Doctrine of the Church. For this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, or <hi>Foundation</hi> (as the Bishop calls it) might be given in answer to confirm a <hi>Stone that was shaking,</hi> that is, some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular matter in question: Although whatsoever is taught by the Church may be granted (without contradicting Catholique Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) to be some way or other <hi>infolded</hi> or contained in Scripture. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>all the Definitions</hi> of the Church may be said to be <hi>Foundations</hi> of Doctrine <hi>in Scripture,</hi> although many times they be so <hi>involved</hi> there, that without the Definition of the Church, we could not be bound expresly to believe them: nay, without the Authority of the Church we should not be obliged to believe the Scripture it self, as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi> tells us in the words formerly cited. <hi>Ego vero Evangelio non cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derem, nisi me Catholicae Ecclesiae commoveret Authoritas.</hi> So that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted, but that St. <hi>Augustins</hi> judgement was, that all our Faith <hi>depended</hi> upon the Authority of the Church: and therefore, that he who opposeth himself against this, <hi>endeavoureth</hi> to shake and destroy <hi>the very ground-work and Foundation</hi> of all Divine and Supernatural Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57798:19"/>
Now whether the Bishop, or Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> hath <hi>wronged</hi> the Text of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> we shall presently see. For, first the Bishop sayes, that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks of a doctrine founded in Scripture, not a <hi>Church-Definition.</hi> How untrue this is, <hi>viz.</hi> that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks, <hi>not of the Churches Definition,</hi> let St. <hi>Augustin</hi> himself determine in the very place cited, where speaking of Christs profiting of Children Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, he useth these words. <hi>Hoc habet Authoritas Matris Ecclesiae, Hoc fundatus veritatis obtinet Canon; contra hoc robur, contra hunc inexpug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabilem murum quisquis arietat, ipse confringitur.</hi> 
                  <q>This (saith he) hath the <hi>Authority</hi> of our Mother the Church; this hath the well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Canon, or Rule of Truth; against this <hi>invincible Rampart</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever runneth himself, is sure to be broken in pieces.</q> And again, speaking of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> he tells us that he will shew, <hi>quid senserit de Baptismo parvulorum; imò quiá semper Ecclesiam sensisse monstraverit.</hi> 
                  <q>What that Holy Martyr thought of the Baptisme of Infants; or rather what he demonstrated the Church had alwayes taught con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it: and many such like places are in this very Sermon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore manifest, that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> here speaks <hi>of the Churches Definition;</hi> nay and that so fully, that he acknowledges in another place, that the Baptisme of Infants was not to be believed, but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> it is an Apostolical Tradition. His words are these. <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>De Genes. ad literam. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Consuetudo Matris Ecclesiae in Baptizandis Parvulis nequaquam spernenda est, neque ullo modo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>  deputanda: NEC O M NINO CREDENDA, nisi Apostolica esset Traditio.</hi> 
                  <q>The custom of our Mother the Church to Baptize Infants is by no means to be despised, or counted in any sort superfluous; <hi>nor yet at all to be believed,</hi> if it were not a Tradition of the Apostles.</q> Though therefore St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in those few lines, which St. <hi>Augustin</hi> referres to, doth not expresly mention the Definition of the Church, (as the Bishop objects) yet a man would think St. <hi>Augustins</hi> Authority should be sufficient to assure us, that in those very words, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> shews what was the sense and Doctrine of the Church: in the same manner, as when the Bishop himself proposes any Doctrine contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture 'tis true to say, he delivers a Doctrine contained in Scripture, though himself doth not expresly say, at the propounding of it, <hi>it is in Scripture.</hi> Seeing therefore St. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks here of a point, which he sayes was not to be believed, <hi>if it were not an Apostolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> (which is in effect to say, that it cannot be proved by sole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) how can he be understood to say, that Scripture <hi>is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Church?</p>
               <p>But that he may, one way or other, draw St. <hi>Augustin</hi> to speak, <hi>in appearance,</hi> for him, he gives a most false Translation of his words. For he translates these words of St. <hi>Augustin, ut fundamentum ipsum Ecclesiae, quatere moliatur,</hi> thus; <hi>He shall endeavour to shake the Foundation it self, upon which the whole Church is grounded,</hi> all in a different letter. Whereas in the Latin Text of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> there is nothing that answers to any of those words, which the Bishop thrusts into his English, <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which,</hi> or <hi>whole Church,</hi> or <hi>is grounded:</hi> so that all this latter part is meerly an <hi>Addition</hi> of his own, and no part of St. <hi>Augustins</hi> sentence. But such fraudulent dealing was necessary, to give a gloss to his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57798:19"/>
For he would make St. <hi>Augustin</hi> speak of <hi>a foundation</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Churches Authority, no wit the Scriptures, <hi>whereupon,</hi> sayes he, <hi>the Authority of the Church is grounded;</hi> which is farre from St. <hi>Augustins</hi> meaning. For by <hi>Fundamentum ipsum Ecclefea</hi> (the very foundation of the Church) he means nothing else, but the Church it self, or her Authority; which is the foundation of Christianity: as when St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>superadificati super fundamentum Apostolorum &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetarum,</hi> &amp;c. (being built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets) he means nothing else, but that we are built upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Prophets <hi>as upon a foundation:</hi> or as if one should say of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Laws of a Nation, <hi>Fundamentum ipsum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum quatere molitur;</hi> he endeavours to shake the <hi>very foundation</hi> of our Laws; or of one that rejected the Authority of Scripture, <hi>fundamentum ipsum Scripturarum quatere molitur,</hi> he labours to shake the <hi>very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of holy Scripture; no man would understand him to mean any other <hi>Foundation,</hi> then what the <hi>Laws</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themselves are.</p>
               <p>Now that nothing but this can be the meaning of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> is evident. For in this very sentence he allows of <hi>Disputes</hi> held in such things, as are not yet establish't by the <hi>full Authority of the Church,</hi> (<hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum plenâ Ecclesiae Authoritate firmatis.</hi>) Wherefore all consequence, and coherence of discourse requires, that when he disallows of those disputes, which go so far as to <hi>shake the foundation of the Church,</hi> he must mean those disputes, which properly and directly question matters <hi>fully establish't by the Authority of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordship therefore finding his first solution to fail him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs to a second, much weaker then the first. For granting the Church to be <hi>the foundation</hi> whereof St. <hi>Augustin</hi> spake, he denyes it to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thence, <hi>that all points defined by the Church are Fundamental in Faith.</hi> But against this I thus argue out of St. <hi>Augustin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All those points, the disbelief whereof <hi>shakes the Foundation</hi> are <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> in Faith.</p>
               <p>But all the points establish't by <hi>full Authority</hi> of the Church, (that is, <hi>defined</hi> by the Church) are such, as the disbelief of them <hi>shakes the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> all points establish't by <hi>full Authority</hi> of the Church, that is, Defined by the Church, are <hi>Fundamental</hi> in Faith.</p>
               <p>If he distinguish the <hi>Major,</hi> that they shake <hi>some foundation</hi> of our Religion, but not <hi>every foundation,</hi> I disprove him thus. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shakes the foundation, St. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks of, (which is, the Church) shakes consequentially <hi>every foundation</hi> of our Religion. This I have above proved; because nothing can be infallibly believed, when the Churches foundation is shaken.</p>
               <p>But the denial of points defined by the Church shakes the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on St. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks of, that is, the Church, as the Bishop now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses <hi>foundation</hi> to be taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the disbelief of points defined by the Church shakes <hi>every foundation</hi> of Religion.</p>
               <p>His proving that some things are <hi>founded,</hi> which are not <hi>Fundamental</hi> in Faith, is very true, (for St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Steeple is well <hi>founded,</hi> yet is no <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57798:20"/>
point in Faith) but as little to the present purpose as can be: for, who ever asfirmed, that all things <hi>founded,</hi> even upon the Authority of the Church, are <hi>Fundamental</hi> in Faith? and as little concludes that, which follows about Church Authority. For I have already proved, that the Authority of the Catholique Church <hi>in defining matters of Faith,</hi> (whereof onely we now treat) as it is <hi>infallibly assisted</hi> by the Holy Ghost, is either <hi>Divine</hi> in it felf, to wit, as informed with that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, or so <hi>necessary</hi> for the giving <hi>infallible</hi> assent <hi>to Divine</hi> Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that no man rejecting it, can give an <hi>infallible assent</hi> to any point of Christian Faith. For seeing <hi>upon that Authority only</hi> we are <hi>infallibly</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, that the Articles of our Faith, are <hi>revealed</hi> from God; if in any thing we oppugne <hi>the firmness</hi> of that Authority, we cannot believe <hi>infallibly,</hi> that any one of them is <hi>revealed</hi> from God. Though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were granted, that <hi>Church-Definitive Authority</hi> were not <hi>simply Divine,</hi> yet is it so <hi>necessary</hi> to salvation, that if it be rejected, it <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes salvation;</hi> which is to be <hi>Fundamental</hi> in our present debate.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IN the first place we grant what is here set down, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Things may be founded upon humane Authority, and be very certain, yet not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 10. num. 11. pag. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Fundamental in the Faith:</hi> for we say nothing that hath any sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of contradicting this. But our Assertion is, that those Things are not to be opposed, which are <hi>made firm by full Authority</hi> of the Church; because this is (according to St. <hi>Augustin</hi>) to <hi>shake the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">D. Aug. loc. cit.</note> Therefore all things <hi>made firm</hi> by the full Authority, Definition, Declaration, or Determination (use what tearm you please) of the Church, are <hi>Fundamental,</hi> to wit, in respect of the <hi>formal object</hi> of Gods revelation contained in them, as we have often said.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now concerning what is added, that <hi>full Church-Authority,—when</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>it is at full Sea, is not simply Divine,</hi> I will not dispute with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57798:20"/>
whether it be or no; because it is sufficient that such Authority be <hi>infallible.</hi> For if it be <hi>infallible,</hi> it cannot propose to us any thing as <hi>revealed</hi> by God, but what is so revealed. So that to dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Authority is in effect to take away all Authority from Gods Revelation; we having no other absolute certainty, that <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That</hi> is revealed by God, but onely the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Church propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or attesting it unto us as revealed. Whence also it follows that to doubt, dispute against, or deny any thing that is proposed by the <hi>infallible</hi> Authority of the Church, is to doubt, dispute against, and deny that, which is <hi>Fundamental</hi> in Faith. This Discourse may be granted, (I say) and yet the Church be denyed to be of <hi>Divine</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; notwithstanding that <hi>Infallible</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> seem (to many great Divines) to be tearms Convertible. And <hi>Stapleton</hi> (whom the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop cites in the Margin) is farre from denying it: as would have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appeared, if his words had been fairly cited. For I finde him thus to write. <hi>Si quaeratur, quare Ecclesia est veritatis tam certa testis respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Relect. Con. trovers. 4. q. 1. A. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>quia DEUS PER ILLAM loquitur.</hi> 
                  <q>If it be asked, why the Church is so certain a witness of Truth, we answer, because <hi>God speaks by her.</hi>
                  </q> Thus he. Now if God speaks by the Church, certainly she is of <hi>Divine</hi> Authority. The same doctrine we finde elsewhere taught by him. <hi>Deum per Ecclesiam loqui, non ex solo Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae</hi>

                  <hi>testimonio, sed ex ipsis maximè Scripturis, &amp; Fidei Symbolo, ex communi omnium Christianorum conceptione certò constat.</hi> 
                  <q>That <hi>God speaks by the Church</hi> is most certain, not onely by the Testimony of the Church, but by the Scriptures themselves, the Greed, and the common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of Christians.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Bishop indeed grants thus much to the Church, that <hi>no erring</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>Disputant may be endured to shake the Foundation, which the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils layes;</hi> yet he adds, <hi>that plain Scripture, with evident sense or a full demonstrative Argument, must have room, where a wrangling and erring disputant may not be allowed it. Must have room,</hi> that is, must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to <hi>shake the Foundation, which the Church in General Councils layes.</hi> For that is the necessary sense of his words. An Assertion, truly, worthy of a Protestant Primate. But I shall not here insist upon the manifold inconveniences of it: I onely tell his Lordship at present, that it begs the question, and supposes what never was, nor ever will be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that there can be <hi>plain Scripture</hi> (in the true sense thereof) or a <hi>full Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative Argument</hi> brought against the Definition of a lawfull Generall Council. We deny that any such case can happen, or that the Definitions of a General Council, in points of Faith, can ever be so ill <hi>founded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here therefore (if we observe it) the Bishop frames a notable <hi>Turn</hi> in his Labyrinth, <hi>winding in</hi> the words of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to St. <hi>Augustins</hi> meaning, to make them speak for himself. For, having affirmed in his own Text (as we heard but now) that <hi>plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, with evident sense, or a full Demonstrative Argument must have room, where a wrangling Disputant may not be allowed,</hi> just over against these words, in his own Margent at <hi>Litera</hi> F. he puts these Latin words of St. <hi>Augustin, Quae quidem, si tam manifesta monstratur, ut in dubium ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire non possit, praeponenda est omnibus illis rebus, quibus in Catholicâ teneor.</hi> In English thus. <q>Which truly if it be shewed so clear, that there can
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57798:21"/>
be no doubt of it, is to be preferred before all those things, by which I am held in the Catholique Church.</q> Now by citing these words and no more, but leaving out those immediately precedent, he leaves it also doubtful, to what the word <hi>quae</hi> (<hi>which</hi>) in St. <hi>Augustins</hi> Text is to be referred: but yet by putting <hi>plain Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. in his own Text right over against it, he supposed doubtless his Reader would not judge, that <hi>Quae</hi> could be referred to any thing else, save <hi>Scripture</hi> and that which follows it in his Text: and consequently would conclude that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> and he were of the same opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>plain Scripture, evident sense,</hi> or <hi>a full Demonstrative Argument,</hi> is to be preferred before all the Definitions of the Church. Whereas St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in the place cited hath nothing at all, either of <hi>plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> or <hi>evident sense,</hi> or a <hi>full Demonstrative Argument,</hi> but addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his speech to the <hi>Manichaeans,</hi> he writes th us, <hi>Apud vos autem, ubi nihil horum est quod me invitet ac teneat, sola personat VERITATIS POLLICITATIO,</hi> (and then follow the words cited by the Bishop) <hi>quae quidem si tam manifesta monstratur, ut in dubium venire non possit,</hi> &amp;c. <q>But with you (saith St. <hi>Augustin</hi> to the abovesaid Heretiques) who have nothing at all of those Things, which may invite and hold me, onely a promise <hi>of Truth</hi> makes a noise: <hi>WHICH</hi> (<hi>Truth</hi>) if it be Demonstrated to be so clear, as it cannot be called in doubt, is to be preserred, &amp;c.</q> where it is plain, <hi>Quae,</hi> (<hi>which</hi>) is relative onely to <hi>Truth,</hi> and not to Scripture, or any thing else. Nay it is Relative onely to <hi>that Truth</hi> (in this place) which the <hi>Manichees</hi> bragg'd of and promised: which was so far from being <hi>plain Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. that it was no other, then what was contained in that Epistle of <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> intituled <hi>Fundamentum,</hi> which St. <hi>Augustin</hi> at that present confuted, as appears by the following words.</p>
               <p>Neither indeed could St. <hi>Augustin</hi> be understood to speak of <hi>plain Scripture</hi> in this place, as though that were to be preferred before the Definition of the Catholique Church, or a General Council, and that it were <hi>a possible case</hi> for the Definitions of the Catholique Church, or of General Councils to be contrary to <hi>plain Scripture,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding by <hi>plain Scripture</hi> Scripture <hi>truly</hi> sensed and interpreted; for he Disputes <hi>ex professo</hi> against that supposition or perswasion, and proves, that no clear place of Scripture can be produc'd against the common received Doctrine of the Church, from this <hi>grand inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience</hi> necessarily following upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> That if such a Thing could happen, (that the Doctrine of the Catholique Church could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture, or the Gospel) he should not be able to believe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally and infallibly, either the one or the other. <note n="*" place="margin">Si ad Evan-gelium me te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ego ad eos me teneam, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus praecipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio credidi; &amp; his jubentibus tibi omnino non credam.

St. <hi>Augustin</hi> had said in express terms (as 'tis manifest he doth not) that <hi>clear Scripture is to be preferred before all things</hi> which he had named before, yet he is so far from supposing (as the Bishop here supposes) that evident Scripture can be contrary to the Churches received Doctrines, that he professedly teaches and proves the contrary, and uses the alledged words, (<hi>quae quidem si tam manifesta monstratur,</hi> &amp;c.) onely <hi>ex suppositione impossibili,</hi> in the same manner as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>Si Angelus de caelo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If an Angel from heaven teach otherwise, then we have taught you, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> well knew it was impossible, that an Angel from Heaven should teach contrary to the Gospel: yet so he speaks. And the same may be said in answer to the <hi>evident Reason,</hi> or <hi>full Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative Argument,</hi> which the Bishop talks of: for neither can that (truly and properly speaking) be any more brought against the Churches Authority and Doctrine, then <hi>plain Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Relatours supposition then has no more ground in St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> then if one should prove, that an Angel from Heaven can preach against the doctrine of the Apostles, because St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>Though an Angel from Heaven should denounce unto you, otherwise then we have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let him be accursed.</hi> Now if the Church may be an <hi>erring Definer,</hi> I would gladly know, why an <hi>erring Disputer</hi> may not oppugne it; so long at least, as he is so farre from seeing his errour, that he is fully perswaded he erres not, and that the Church erres in Defining against him; as those Heretiques were perswaded, against whom St. <hi>Augustin</hi> disputes in this place.</p>
               <p>His second <hi>winding</hi> is, that he labours to prove from the fore-cited words of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> that <hi>plain Scripture</hi> is to be preferred before the <hi>Definitions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>may convince the Definition of the Council, if it be ill founded.</hi> Now St. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks as little of the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church, in matters <hi>not Fundamental</hi> according to <hi>the matter</hi> they contain, in this sentence, as he doth of Scripture. For, by those words, <hi>Praeponenda est omnibus illis rebus quibus in Catholica teneor,</hi> there is not once named the Definitions of the Church in matters <hi>not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental;</hi> or any comparison or contrariety mentioned betwixt them. For, the question was not, whether St. <hi>Augustin</hi> might reject some of the Churches <hi>Definitions,</hi> which by plain Scripture he found to be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, <hi>in matters of small moment,</hi> and yet remain still a member of the Church, submitting to her in all <hi>Fundamental</hi> points: but the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was this, whether St. <hi>Augustin</hi> were to forsake the Catholique Church, and become a profest enemy of her (as he once had been) in adhering to <hi>Manichaeus</hi> his Doctrine, if <hi>plain</hi> and undenyable <hi>Truth</hi> should be brought against the Church, and <hi>for Manichaeus.</hi> So that the <hi>Truth</hi> mentioned by him in this place, was to have been so <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi> that it had been able utterly to overthrow the Church, and estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Manichaeisme,</hi> if any such <hi>Truth</hi> could have been undoubtedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated. If therefore this Text could prove any thing, it must prove, that the whole visible Church can erre <hi>Fundamentally,</hi> and so become no Church; which is clearly against his Lordship, <hi>pag.</hi> 65.</p>
               <p>But why joyns he a <hi>wrangling</hi> to an <hi>erring</hi> Disputer? are these (think you) <hi>Synonyma's?</hi> I esteem his Lordship an <hi>erring</hi> Disputer; yet he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57798:22"/>
had reason to think me uncivil, if I should call him a <hi>wrangling</hi> Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If they be not of the same signification, why ha's he added, in the exposition of St. <hi>Augustins</hi> words, the word <hi>wrangling,</hi> seeing in the sentence here debated, there is neither <hi>wrangler,</hi> not any thing like it: Oh! I see now; it is done to distinguish him from such a Disputer, as proceeds <hi>solidly</hi> and <hi>demonstratively</hi> against the Definitions of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, <hi>when they are ill founded.</hi> But where findes he any such Disputer in St. <hi>Augustins</hi> words, upon whose Authority he grounds his Position? Seeing that most holy and learned Doctor is so far from judging, that any one can proceed <hi>solidly aud demonstratively</hi> against the Definitions and Tenets of the Catholique Church and Occumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Councils, that he judges him a <hi>mad man,</hi> who disputes against any <note place="margin">Nulla <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="3">3. After this the Bishop makes mention of one, who should say, That things are Fundamentul in Faith two wayes: one in the matter; such as are all things in themselves: The other in the manner; such as are all things, which the Church hath defined and declared to be of Faith. 'Tis not set down who it was, that spake thus. But whoever he was I am not bound to defend him; neither was his speech so proper. He might have said some thing like it, and have hit the mark: <hi>viz.</hi> That Things are Fundamentall in Faith two wayes one in regard of the <hi>material object;</hi> such as are the prime Articles of our Faith, which are expresly to be believed by all. The other in regard of the <hi>formal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> such as are all Things that the Church hath defined to be of Faith: because he that denies his assent to any one of these, when they are sufficiently proposed, does, in effect, deny his assent to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and word of God declared to him by the Church; and this being to take away, or deny, the very <hi>formal object</hi> of Divine Supernatural Faith, by consequence it destroyes <hi>the Foundation</hi> of all such Faith in any other point whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let any man, with the Bishop, <hi>view</hi> as long as he pleases, <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 13 pag. 35.</note> the <hi>Morter</hi> wherewith this <hi>Foundation</hi> is laid, and (if he consider it rightly) he will finde it well <hi>tempered.</hi> Our assertion is, <hi>That all points defined by the Church are Fundamental; because</hi> (<hi>according to St.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin) <hi>to dispute against any thing settled by full Authority of the Church</hi> (and such are all things defined by her) <hi>is to shake the Foundation.</hi> Hence the Relator would inferre, we intend to maintain, that the point there spoken of (<hi>the remission of original sin in the Baptizing of Infants</hi>) was defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (when <hi>St. Augustin</hi> wrote this) by <hi>full sentence of a General Council.</hi> But I deny, that from urging that place of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> we can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to have any such meaning. For by <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church we mean, (and not unproperly) the Church <hi>generally practising</hi> this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and <hi>defining</hi> it in a National Council confirmed by the Pope. For, this was <hi>plena Authoritas Ecclesiae,</hi> though not <hi>plenissima;</hi> (<hi>full,</hi> though not the <hi>fullest</hi>) and to dispute against what was so <hi>practised</hi> and <hi>defined,</hi> is (in St. <hi>Augustins</hi> sense) <hi>to shake the Foundation</hi> of the Church, if not wholly to destroy it. Wherefore although one grant what <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57798:22"/>
sayes, <hi>That the Pelagian Heresie was never condemn'd in an Oecumenical</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. de Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorit. Concil. cap. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Council,</hi> but onely by a National; yet doubtless whoever should go about to revive that Heresie, would be justly condemn'd without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a General Council, as one that oppos'd himself against <hi>the full Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the Church, and did shake its foundation. But the Bishop sayes, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was deceived in this business, and that the <hi>Pelagian</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Heresie was condemn'd in the first <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council, which was Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical. I answer first, 'cis not credible that <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who writ so much of Controversie, should not have read that Council: nor can there be any suspicion of his concealing the matter, had he found it there, because it would make nothing against the Catholick Church, but rather for it. However, till the Councils words be brought, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be pardoned, if I suspend my Assent to what the Bishop sayes. Truly I have my self viewed that Council upon this occasion, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde it there. I fear therefore his Lordship hath been misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>But suppose all were there which he pretends, yet would it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing against <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> who onely sayes, that the <hi>Pelagian Heresie</hi> was never condemn'd in any General Council; and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to disprove him, shewes that some, who were infected both with the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie and <hi>Nestorianisme</hi> also, were condemned in the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council. But how does this contradict <hi>Bellarmin?</hi> Certain <hi>Pelagians</hi> were indeed condemned in the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council; but it was not for <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> but <hi>Nestorianisme,</hi> that they were condemned. Had they been condemned for <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> his Lordship had hit the mark, but now he shoots wide. He should have observed, that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> denyed onely the condemnation of the <hi>Heresie,</hi> and not of the <hi>persons,</hi> for holding another Heresie wholly distinct from that of <hi>Pelagianisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As for St. <hi>Augustins</hi> not mentioning the Pope, when he speaks, in the place before cited, of the full Authority of the Church, (which the Bishop tearms <hi>an inexpiable omisson, if our Doctrine concerning the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Popes Authority were true,</hi>) It is easie to answer, there was no need of any special mention of the Pope, in speaking of the Authority of the Church; because his Authority is alwayes chiefly supposed, as being Head of the whole Church. His Lordships followers might as well quarrel with me, because I many times speak of the Authority of the Church without naming the Pope; though I do ever, both with that great Doctor and all other Catholiques, acknowledge and understand the Popes Authority compris'd in that of the Church. When my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> findes in ancient Lawyers and Historians, that such and such things were decreed by Act of Parliament, without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King, by whose Authority and consent they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, would he not (think you) condemn those Authors also of <hi>an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piable omission;</hi> and thence conclude, that the King in those dayes, had not the prime Authority in Parliament? and that whatsoever was said to be decreed by Act of Parliament, was not <hi>eo ipso</hi> understood to be done by Authority of the King.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We grant what is urged <hi>that it is one thing in nature, and Religion</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 14</note> 
                  <hi>too, to be firme; and another to be Fundamental.</hi> For every thing that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57798:23"/>
is <hi>Fundamental</hi> is <hi>firme;</hi> but every thing that is <hi>firme</hi> is not <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi> Wherefore we distinguisht before in the <hi>material</hi> object of Faith <hi>Fundamentals</hi> from <hi>not Fundamentals.</hi> In this sense a Superstructure may be said to be exceeding <hi>firme,</hi> and close joyn'd to a sure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not <hi>Fundamental.</hi> But here his Lordship misconceives, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther misalledges <hi>A. C's.</hi> Argument. For it is not, as he frames it, <hi>All points defined are made firme,</hi> ergo <hi>all points defined are Fundamental:</hi> but thus. All points defined are made firme <hi>by the full Authority of the Church, ergo</hi> all points defined are <hi>Fundamental.</hi> And his reason is, because when any thing is made firme <hi>by the full Authority of the Church,</hi> it is so <hi>firme,</hi> that it cannot be denyed without <hi>shaking</hi> the whole <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of Religion, and consequently is <hi>Fundamental.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But the Bishop proceeds further, and makes this Argument. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is Fundamental in the Faith is Fundamental to the Church, which is one by the unity of Faith. Therefore if every thing defined by the Church be Fundamental in the Faith, then the Churches Definition is the Churches foundation; and so upon the matter, the Church can lay her own foundation: and then the Church must be in her absolute and perfect being before so much as her foundation is laid</hi> This Argument will lose all its force by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Reader in minde of the Distinction between <hi>Fundamentals</hi> and <hi>not Fundamentals,</hi> which we admitted in <hi>the material</hi> object of Faith: for if this be reflected on, there will be a foundation for the Church without supposing her to be in <hi>perfect</hi> being, before her foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation be laid.</p>
               <p>We have often declared what we understood by <hi>Fundamental,</hi> viz. <hi>That to which we cannot refuse our assent by denying, or doubting of it, (when it is proposed to us by the Church, as a matter of Faith) without damnation, and without destroying the formal object of Faith, and without making our selves, (during that deliberate doubting or denying) uncapable of believing any thing with Divine and Supernatural Faith.</hi> For surely whatever is of this nature, must needs be <hi>Fundamental</hi> in Religion. So that we admit the distinction of <hi>Fundamentals</hi> and not <hi>Fundamentals</hi> in respect of the <hi>material</hi> object of Faith, but not in respect of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal;</hi> that is, (as we have often said) some matters of Faith are more universally necessary to be expresly known and believed by all, then others; and yet the <hi>Authority revealing,</hi> that is God, and <hi>declaring</hi> them <hi>infallibly</hi> to be revealed, that is, the Church is <hi>truly Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> in both. As in the Scripture it self this Text, <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>And God was the word,</hi> according to the matter it contains, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divinity of our Saviour, is a <hi>Fundamental</hi> point, universally to be known and believed expresly to Salvation; and that St. <hi>Paul left his Cloak at Troas,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the matter it contains, is no <hi>Fundamental</hi> point, nor of any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to Salvation to be universally known and believed expresly: yet the <hi>formal object</hi> revealing both these truths, being the Authority of the Holy Ghost, is <hi>equally Fundamental</hi> in both; and doubtless, if any one, to whom it is as clearly propounded to be affirmed in Scripture, that St. <hi>Paul left his Cloak at Troas,</hi> as that it is affirmed in Scripture, <hi>that the word was God,</hi> should yet deny, or doubt of the first, he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be saved so long as he remained in that misbelief, nor believe the second with divine infallible Faith; as all Christians, both Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57798:23"/>
and Protestants must grant. Had this been well considered by his Lordship, we should not have been forced to so frequent repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the same Doctrine.</p>
               <p>The Bishop thinks, he has got a great advantage by pressing <hi>A. C.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> to this, <hi>That the Churches Definition is the Churches Foundation.</hi> But what absurdity is it to grant, that the Definition of the Church <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is the foundation of the Church <hi>taught?</hi> or the Definition of the Church <hi>representative</hi> is the foundation of the Church <hi>diffusive?</hi> who can doubt, but the Pastours in all ages preserving Christian people from being <hi>carried away with every winde of Doctrine</hi> (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.) are a <hi>foundation</hi> to them of constancy in Doctrine? were not the Apostles in their times (who were <hi>Ecclesia docens</hi>) by their Doctrine and Decrees a <hi>foundation</hi> to the Church, which was taught by them? Doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly affirm it? <hi>Superaedificati supra fundamentum Apostolorum,</hi> &amp;c. Did not the Bishop just now (<hi>pag.</hi> 34.) except the Apostles, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in their Definitions more Authority then the Church had after their times? yea, even so much, as was sufficient to make their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions <hi>Fundamental,</hi> and the opposing of them destructive of the Foundation of Religion; their Authority being truly Divine; which he sayes, that of the Church after them was not.</p>
               <p>Now this doctrine of the Bishop supposed, I urge his own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against himself thus. <hi>Whatever is Fundamental in the Faith, is Fundamental to the Church; which is one by the unity of Faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if every thing Defined by the Church</hi> (in the time of the Apostles) <hi>be Fundamental in the Faith, then the Churches Definition</hi> (in the Apostles time) <hi>is the Churches foundation; and so upon the matter the Church</hi> (in their time) <hi>could lay her own foundation; and then the Church must have been in absolute and perfect being, before so much as her foundation was laid.</hi> Who sees not here how the Bishop fights against himself with his own weapons, and destroyes his own Positions by his own Arguments? And whatever may be answered for him, will satisfie his Argument, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of us. Now the answer is plain to any one who hath his eyes open: for the <hi>Prime foundation</hi> of the Church are the Doctrines deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by our Saviour, and inspired by the Holy Ghost to the Apostles; whereby it took the first being of a Church: and the <hi>Prime foundation</hi> to the insuing Church after the Apostles, is the most certain Assistance of the Holy Ghost promised by our Saviour to his Church. By these two <hi>Prime foundations</hi> the Church is in being, and so continues; the Definitions of the Church grounded in these, are a <hi>secondary foundation;</hi> whereby <hi>Ecclesia docens,</hi> (the Church <hi>teaching</hi> established upon that promised assistance of the Holy Ghost) <hi>fundat Ecclesiam doctam,</hi> founds and establishes, in every age, the Church <hi>taught,</hi> in the true Faith.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But what shall we say in defence of <hi>A. C?</hi> whom we finde bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 37.</note> for these words, <hi>That not onely the PRIMA CREDIBILIA, (or prime Articles of Faith) but all that which so pertains to Supernatural, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and Infallible Faith, as that thereby, Christ doth dwell in our hearts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is the foundation of the Church?</hi> The answer is, these are not the precise words of <hi>A. C.</hi> and therefore no wonder if the Bishop easily confute him, whom he either mistakes, or makes to speak as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pleases. <hi>A. C's.</hi> words are these. <hi>By the word FUMDAMEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAL</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:57798:24"/>
is understood, not onely the PRIMA CREDIBILIA, or Prime Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which do not depend upon any former grounds; for then all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Creed were not (as the Bishop and Dr. <hi>White</hi> say they are) FUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAMENTAL points; but all, which do so pertain to Supernatural, Divine, Infallible, Christian Faith (by which Faith Christ, the onely PRIME FOUNDATION of the Church, doth dwell in our hearts; and which Faith is so to the Church the Substance, Basis, and Foundation of all good things, which are to be hoped for,) as that (being thus confirmed, or made firm, by the Authority of the Church,) if they are wittingly, willingly, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially obstinately denyed, or questioned, all the whole frame, and in a sort the foundation it self of all Supernatural, Divine, Christian Faith is shaken. <hi>Thus he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But who sees not, that there is a main difference betwixt these words of <hi>A. C.</hi> and those which he is made to speak by the Bishop? for he joyns the words <hi>as that</hi> to these <hi>thereby Christ doth dwell in our hearts:</hi> whereas in <hi>A. C's.</hi> discourse they are joyned to these, <hi>if they are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, willingly, and especially obstinately questioned,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>of Faith, whereby Christ dwelleth in our hearts,</hi> &amp;c. being onely a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for greater explication, and not belonging to the substance of his discourse, as the Relatour no less corruptly, then cunningly, makes it belong: which is an other Dedalian Turn in this his Labyrinth.</p>
               <p>Now let us hear the Accusation. First, sayes the Bishop, <hi>A C.</hi> is mistaken; because <hi>all that pertains to Supernatural, Divine, and Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Christian Faith, is not by and by Fundamental in the Faith to all men.</hi> But <hi>A. C.</hi> does not say it is: he speaks onely of those, to whom such points are propos'd, and who deny, or question them, when so propos'd. Although in some sense they may be said <hi>Fundamental to all,</hi> because all are to believe them implicitely; and explicitely, all such as have sufficient reason to know, they are declared by the Church. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>A. C.</hi> is accus'd for confounding the Object with the Act of Faith. But if his words be rightly penetrated, there will appear no confusion. For <hi>A. C.</hi> having first named <hi>Prime Principles,</hi> and then going on with others, which <hi>pertained</hi> to Supernatural, Infallible, Divine, Christian Faith, it is apparent, he understood by those points, <hi>which so apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> not the Act of Faith it self, but the Object. Wherefore <hi>A. C.</hi> doth here no more but explicate the nature of the Object by the Act, (and that onely upon the <hi>By,</hi> and in a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> as appears by his words) in which there is no <hi>Confusion</hi> but <hi>Clarity:</hi> for as the Act of Faith is <hi>the Foundation</hi> of Hope, Charity, and all other Supernatural Acts; so is the Object on which Faith is grounded, <hi>the Foundation</hi> of Faith: and in such a manner as whoever denyes, or questions one point of Faith, doth in effect question all.</p>
               <p>Now I wonder the Bishop should urge as an Argument the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> of the Council of <hi>Trent, That Orders Collated by the Bishop are not void, though they be given without the consent of the people, or any secular power;</hi> and yet saith, <hi>we can produce no Author, that ever acknowledged this Definition to be Fundamental in the Faith.</hi> I wonder, I say, he should urge this; when all Catholique Authors, who maintain, that <hi>whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is defined by the Church is Fundamental,</hi> do in effect hold, that this Decree is Fundamental. For they all affirm, that this is a lawful Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57798:24"/>
Council confirmed by the Pope; and therefore of the same Authority to command our Belief, that any other ever was. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Argument of the Bishop is not <hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> as he pretends, but <hi>petitio principii.</hi> Now if he mean, that this Decree of the Council is no <hi>Fundamental</hi> point of Faith, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise <hi>material</hi> Object, it is true, but nothing against us, who have often granted it; the question being onely about <hi>Fundamental</hi> points in the <hi>formal</hi> Object of Faith, as we perpetually inculeate.</p>

                  <hi>dispute against any one Determination of the Church, then he may do it against another, and another, and so against all; since all are made firme to us by one and the same Divine Revelation, sufficiently applyed by one and the same full Authority of the Church: which being weakened in one, cannot be firme in any other.</hi> Thus far <hi>A. C.</hi> And here the Bishop will needs have <hi>A. C.</hi> to have <hi>horrowed</hi> this doctrine out of <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis,</hi> and that he <hi>might have acknowledged it.</hi> I hope it is no errour against Faith, if he did borrow it, and not acknowledge it; although two wits may sometimes hit on the same thing, or at least come near it, (which is all he here allows to <hi>A. C.</hi>) without taking it one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. However, the Doctrine both of <hi>A. C.</hi> and <hi>Vincentius Lirinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> is true. For the same reason that permits not our questioning, or denying, the <hi>prime Maximes</hi> of Faith, permits not our questioning, or denying any other Doctrine declared by the Church: because (as I said) it is not the greatness, or smallness of the matter, that moves us to give firme Assent in points of Faith; but the <hi>Authority of God</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Church. Wherefore all points of Faith whatsoever may be said to be <hi>deposited</hi> with the Church. For all that the Church doth, even in things of least seeming concernment, is but <hi>ut haec <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Moreover the Church being <hi>Infallible,</hi> 'twere meerly vain to examine her Decrees (which the Relatour requires to be done) to see, if she have not added <hi>Novitia veteribus,</hi> new Doctrines to the old. For the Holy Ghost (as hereafter shall be proved) when we speak of this point) having promised so to direct her as she cannot erre, will never permit her to declare any thing as matter of Faith, which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either expressed, or infolded and implyed in <hi>the word of</hi> God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But why does the Relator print <hi>Catholici dogmatis</hi> in great Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in this sentence of <hi>Lirinensis?</hi> is there any such great mystery in these words? yes, surely. For (sayes he) <hi>Vincentius</hi> speaks there <hi>De Catholico Dogmate,</hi> of <hi>Catholique Maximes.</hi> Well. But though <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> signified a <hi>Maxime,</hi> yet surely it cannot signifie <hi>Maximes,</hi> unless he will here have the <hi>singular</hi> number signifie the <hi>plural,</hi> as before he made the <hi>plural</hi> signifie the <hi>singular; eis, it:</hi> But it was for his Lordships pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to translate it in the <hi>plural</hi> number; and that was sufficient: for had he put it in the <hi>singular</hi> thus, <hi>the Catholique Maxime,</hi> that is, as he expounds it, the <hi>properly Fundamental, and prime Truth deposited in the Church,</hi> there would have seem'd to be but one Fundamental point:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57798:25"/>
which would have marr'd his whole designe. Now because he holds, there are many <hi>Fundamental</hi> points of Faith, <hi>Catholicum Dogma,</hi> in his Grammar, could signifie nothing less, then <hi>Catholique Maximes,</hi> that is, properly Prime and Fundamental Points. But in what Author learn't he, that <hi>Dogma</hi> fignifies <hi>only Maximes,</hi> were it in the plural number? <hi>Dogma,</hi> according to our common English Lexicons, <hi>Rider</hi> and others, signifies a <hi>Decree, or common received opinion,</hi> whether in <hi>prime,</hi> or <hi>less principal</hi> matters: But as the Grammatical, so the Ecclesiastical signification of this word extends it self to all things establisht in the Church as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, whether in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> or <hi>Superstructures.</hi> Thus <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> calls Transubstantiation <hi>Dogma Fidei;</hi> and I would gladly know one Authour, who ever took the word <hi>Dogma</hi> for onely <hi>Fundamental</hi> points. And as for <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis,</hi> first he declares, (in other places) that he means by it such Things, as in general belong to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith without distinction. cap. 23. <hi>Vocum (inquit) id est, DOG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATUM, rerum, sententiarum novitates.</hi> And cap. 28. <hi>Crescat</hi> (saith he speaking of the Church) <hi>sed in suo duntaxat genere, in eodem scilicet DOG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATE, eodem sensu, eademque sententia.</hi> The like he hath, <hi>cap.</hi> 24. where he affirms, that the <hi>Pelagians</hi> erred in <hi>dogmate Fidei;</hi> who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding erred not in a <hi>Prime Maxime,</hi> but in a <hi>Superstructure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for this place cited by the Bishop, 'tis evident that by <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum dogma</hi> he must understand the whole <hi>Complex</hi> of all the points of Catholique Faith, whether Fundamental in <hi>their matter</hi> or not; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of if an Heretick deny any one part whatsoever, (sayes this Authour) he may by the same rule deny all the rest. Nay, 'tis evident that <hi>Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis</hi> could not understand <hi>onely</hi> such points as are Fundamental in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>their matter.</hi> For, seeing this <hi>Catholicum dogma</hi> contains the whole <hi>Systeme</hi> of the Catholique Faith, and in that <hi>Systeme</hi> some are <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> some <hi>Superstructures,</hi> (even according to Protestants) it must necessarily contain both: and <hi>Vincentius</hi> makes it clear in the instances he gives, that he also understood points <hi>not Fundamental</hi> in the Protestant sense. For, in the <hi>Systeme</hi> of Catholique points, which he there enumerates, is contain'd the observation of Easter, decreed by Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> and afterwards defined in the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> and the <hi>not-Rebaptizing</hi> of those, who had been Baptiz'd by Heretiques, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> against St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Firmilian,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise afterwards confirmed in the same Council. Now what I say of <hi>Catholicum Dogma</hi> in the first sentence cited out of <hi>Lirinensis,</hi> I say the same of <hi>Depositorum Dogmatum custos</hi> in the second.</p>
               <p>For what rational man can imagine, that no other Christian verities or revealed Doctrines were <hi>deposited</hi> by our Saviour and the Holy Ghost with the Apostles, and by them with the Church, save onely the Articles of the Creed, wherein are expresly contained all points of Faith, that are Fundamental in respect of <hi>their matter,</hi> as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop presently affirms? was not the whole Canon of Holy Scripture, with every chapter, verse, and sentence contained in it, the matter and form of Sacraments, the Hierarchy of the Church, the Baptisme of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, the not-Rebaptizing of Heretiques, the perpetual Virginity of the ever Blessed Mother of God, and many other such like points De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited with the Church by Christ and his Apostles, whereof no one
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57798:25"/>
is expresly contain'd in the Creed, nor esteemed <hi>Fundamental</hi> by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants? Did not (think you) the Church perform the Office of a <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Keeper</hi> of all these, as well as of the Articles of our Creed? and were not those, who pertinaciously erred in these particulars, esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed throughout all Christendome as Heretiques, above 1200. years ago? Here then, in his wresting and winding <hi>Catholico Dogmate,</hi> he gives us no less then a <hi>Turn and half</hi> in his <hi>Canterburian</hi> Labyrinth.</p>
               <p>The Church then ever did, and ever will so keep those sacred <hi>Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situms,</hi> be they, or be they not, Prime and Fundamental in <hi>their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as that <hi>hoc idem quod antea,</hi> what she receives she delivers to all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, <hi>the very same in Substance,</hi> it ever was; only <hi>unfolding</hi> what was before wrapp'd up, when any thing comes to be call'd in question by <hi>Novellists,</hi> whom she judges to impugne, either <hi>directly,</hi> or <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> and covertly, the Faith (that <hi>Catholicum Dogma</hi>) which she hath received. Upon which occasions she sometimes declares certain Truths, as <hi>necessary to be expresly believ'd</hi> by all, to whom that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is sufficiently propounded; and commands certain errours <hi>to be expresly rejected:</hi> both which were before believ'd or rejected onely <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely,</hi> to wit, by the Belief of those Known and Receiv'd <hi>Divine Truths,</hi> in which these other were contain'd, <hi>tanquam in radice</hi> or <hi>in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> as <hi>Vincentius</hi> speaks.</p>
               <p>For the Church is so tenderly careful of every <hi>Iota,</hi> and Tittle of these Sacred Doctrines (in whatever <hi>matter</hi> they consist, <hi>great or small,</hi>) which were delivered to her by the Divine Authority of Christ and his Apostles, that she uses all possible <hi>industries,</hi> not onely to keep <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemished</hi> what was clearly and plainly expressed in the Doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to her, but whatever else she findes necessary for conserving them in their Primitive integrity and purity. Thus hath she us'd all possible diligence to preserve the <hi>Scriptures</hi> pure and entire, not onely in the <hi>prime Articles</hi> of Faith, but in every the least truth delivered in them. Thus from what she had received concerning Christs being both God and Man, yet but <hi>one Christ;</hi> she declared against <hi>Nestorius</hi> that he had but <hi>one person;</hi> against <hi>Eutyches,</hi> that he consisted of two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct <hi>Natures,</hi> the Divine and the Humane; and against the <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> that he had <hi>Two Wills:</hi> all which particulars, though they were not so fully express'd and reflected on, before those Heresies arose, yet were they virtually and implicitely included in the Doctrine first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and afterwards became <hi>necessary to be expresly believed,</hi> by the Declaration of General Councils.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57798:26"/>
fall the least word, importing that the Church should adde <hi>Novitia veteribus</hi> (Novelties to Ancient truths) and consequently alter and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her own Doctrine, that, (as if he had foreseen such a perversion of his meaning) at the end of the chapter cited, he seems purposely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate his own meaning, and to point out the persons guilty of such practices, in these words. <hi>Sed avertat hoc a suorum mentibus Divina pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, sisque hoc potius IMPIORUM FUROR:</hi> (But God avert (saith he) this evil from the mindes of <hi>his,</hi> and be it rather the fury of the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to do so) whoever therefore are so audacious, as to <hi>adde Novelties</hi> to the Ancient Doctrine of the Church, are judg'd by <hi>Vincentius</hi> to be <hi>impious</hi> persons, raging in <hi>a fury</hi> of madness; which how justly or truly it can be affirmed of Christs true Church, let any discreet man be judge.</p>
               <p>But if this be not sufficient to demonstrate, what this Authours opinion was of Christs Church in this particular, take a further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription which he gives of her, <hi>cap.</hi> 22. <hi>Christi vero Ecclesia sedula &amp; cauta Depositorum apud se Dogmatum custos, nihil in iis unquam permutat, NIHIL MINVIT, NIHIL ADDIT: non amputat necessaria, non appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit superflua, non amittit sua, non usurpat aliena:</hi> Where we see, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to those <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>furious Adders of Novelties,</hi> mentioned in the last words of the precedent chapter, how effectually and fully in the very beginning of this, he clears the Church from that foul aspersion, which the Bishop would cast upon her. <hi>But the Church of Christ</hi> (saith he) <hi>as a careful and wise Depositary, or keeper of the Truths committed to her, NEVER CHANGES any thing at all in them, lessens nothing, ADDES NOTHING; neither cuts away things necessary, nor adjoyns things superfluous; neither loses what is hers, nor usurps what belongs to others,</hi> &amp;c. Words as <hi>Diametrically</hi> contrary to what the Relatour pretends unto in this passage, <hi>viz.</hi> suspicion and possibility of the Churches adding <hi>NOVITIA VETERIBVS,</hi> and of making a <hi>change</hi> in the Doctrine which she first received from Christ and his Apostles, as any thing can be imagined.</p>
               <p>But to return to that lame sentence which he cites out of <hi>Lirinensis,</hi> the very same does clearly shew, that <hi>Lirinensis</hi> never <hi>taught,</hi> or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Church, that she added <hi>New Doctrines to the Old.</hi> For if she be a <hi>Keeper of the Old,</hi> and never labour'd in her Councils to do more then preserve <hi>id quod antea</hi> (that which was before) and that <hi>Vincentius</hi> expresly averres this, how can he in reason be suppos'd to teach, that this very <hi>Keeper</hi> of old Doctrines, and <hi>Rejecter</hi> of Novelties, should either corrupt the one, or introduce the other? nay, the very words the Bishop cites, demonstrate evidently, that the Church cannot (in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors opinion) be understood to make these <hi>Additions.</hi> For those who make them, may at length by such Additions come to change the Church <hi>in errorum Lupanar.</hi> But 'tis impossible, the Church should change her self, or do any thing, whereby to be chang'd <hi>in errorum Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panar;</hi> for so she should be no more the Church of Christ: unless he would have Christs Church, while it remains his Church, to be <hi>erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Lupanar;</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>  as <hi>Vincentius</hi> abhors, so I presume the Bishop himself, would never in terms and directly have admitted.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Bishops own exposition of <hi>Vincentius</hi> his words destroyes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57798:26"/>
this unworthy imputation cast upon the Church. He interprets <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> (as we have seen) to be the <hi>Maximes,</hi> or Prime Principles, of Christian Doctrine; whereof no one part can be rejected, without opening a way to reject another, till the whole be destroyed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (to make <hi>Lirinensis</hi> his discourse uniforme and coherent; who still goes on in the former matter, and gives not the least hint, that he speaks onely of <hi>Fundamentals</hi> in the former part of his discourse, when he mentions changes in <hi>dogmatibus fidei,</hi> and of <hi>not Fundamentals,</hi> in those Additions of Novelties) I say, to make this Discourse of <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> uniforme and coherent, he must understand the <hi>Novitia</hi> (which <hi>Vincentius</hi> sayes are added <hi>Veteribus</hi>) to be added as new <hi>principal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes</hi> to the other principal Maximes of Faith, no less then the Ancient Maximes were. Now such an <hi>Addition</hi> would be a <hi>Fundamental</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, destructive of the Church, as he also grants. Wherefore it is impossible, that the true Church, remaining still the true Church should make any such addition, even according to the Relatours exposition of <hi>Vincentius.</hi> Whence it appears to what straits this place of <hi>Lirinensis</hi> put him; seeing that whilest he labours to avoid one inconvenience, he falls into another, like him, of whom the Poet sings,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare Charybdim,</hi> while he endeavours to avoid the <hi>Charybdis</hi> (as he accounts it) of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging (from thewords and Testimony of <hi>Lirinensis</hi>) the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Infallibility in <hi>not Fundamentals,</hi> he runs and <hi>splits himself</hi> upon <hi>the Scylla</hi> of making the whole Church erre in points <hi>Fundamental.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he is resolv'd to make all seem as fair for himself as he can; to which end, observe a little how he uses the Text. <hi>Ecclesia deposito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum apud se Dogmatum Custos.</hi> Thats well. His Lordship could neither deny, nor dissemble, but that the Church (in the judgement of <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>) is a <hi>Guardian,</hi> or Keeper <hi>of the Truths deposited</hi> with her. But yet, that it might not appear <hi>what kinde of Keeper</hi> she is, whether Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Diligent, or Unfaithful and Negligent; whether apt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Addition of other <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Strange</hi> Doctrines, which she <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not,</hi> or to lose and corrupt any of those which she did <hi>receive,</hi> he unfairly leaves out the first words of the sentence, which would have cleared the doubt. <hi>Sedula &amp; cauta.</hi> The Church is a <hi>diligent,</hi> and <hi>wary</hi> Keeper of the Truths committed to her charge. She suffers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be lost or embezzel'd either through <hi>neglect</hi> of duty, or <hi>unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> to perform it. In brief, that it might not appear, in how <hi>exact</hi> a manner the Church executes this office of <hi>Depositary</hi> and <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> of Divine Truth, he wraps up all the following words, <hi>Nihil in iis unquam permutat, nihil minuit, nihil addit,</hi> and the rest which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, (in which the Churches singular Care and Faithfulness in this affair is most Emphatically and truly avouched,) with an &amp;c. a Fatal, but Faithless &amp;c. Whereas <hi>Vincentius</hi> (as we heard above out of the words themselves) directly and positively asserts, that the Church <hi>never changes</hi> any part of the Doctrine committed to her, <hi>addes nothing, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes nothing,</hi> to wit by any <hi>corruptive</hi> Addition or Diminution, or by any <hi>change,</hi> that perverts or destroyes <hi>the Truth</hi> formerly <hi>Deposited</hi> with her.</p>

But the reason the Bishop brings to prove that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> speaks onely of the <hi>written</hi> word, is very strange. For <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> (sayes he) <hi>treats there of the knowledge a man can have of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his own Salvation: and I hope, that</hi> A. C. <hi>will not tell us, that there is any Tradition extant unwritten, by which particular men may have assurance of their several Salvations.</hi> Thus he. Now first we say not, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> speaks of the word <hi>unwritten,</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> of the word <hi>written,</hi> but that <hi>Stapleton</hi> speaks of the <hi>unwritten</hi> word onely, and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> of both the <hi>written</hi> and <hi>unwritten</hi> word; which he calls <hi>the compleat</hi> word of God. Secondly, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was not to affirme, there was any <hi>unwritten</hi> Tradition, by which particular men may have assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their several Salvations; but the contrary, That there was no such unwriten Tradition to be found. For had he intended to prove any such <hi>unwritten</hi> Tradition, he should have consequently proved the foresaid <hi>assurance</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> and equal to the <hi>Certainty of Faith;</hi> which he there professedly labours to prove fallible and not <hi>of the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of Faith: which had been a <hi>Turn</hi> like one of his Lordships, the quite contrary way. And for <hi>Stapleton,</hi> he purposely proves that the Church hath not power to make <hi>new Articles</hi> of Faith; but onely to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> and <hi>explain</hi> those already delivered.</p>
               <p>His Lordship cannot believe, that <hi>all Determinations of the Church</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. pag. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>are sufficiently applyed by one and the same full Authority of the Church. For the Authority of the Church,</hi> (saith he) <hi>though it be of the same fulness in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of it self, and of the power it commits to General Councills lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; yet it is not alwayes of the same fulness of knowledge and sufficiency, nor of the same fulness of Conscience and Integrity,</hi> &amp;c. To this I answer, that these Ornaments of Knowledge, Sufficiency, Conscience, and Integrity are not <hi>the Causes</hi> of Infallibility, either in the Church or Councils; for that proceeds onely from the promised Assistance of the Holy Ghost; which is of the same <hi>power</hi> in weaker and stronger In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, as it appear'd by the Apostles; who being of themselves persons altogether ignorant of Divine matters, yet by the Assistance of the Holy Ghost became not onely <hi>able</hi> to Teach them, but also <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> in their Teaching. Neither doth the want of <hi>Conscience</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity</hi> in some particular persons deprive either the Church, or a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council of this promised Infallibility, any more then <hi>the same want</hi> deprived the Scribes and Pharisees in old time, of their Authority: concerning whom, notwithstanding their manifest and great defects in point of Conscience and Integrity, &amp;c. our Saviour himself pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 2. <hi>Upon the Chaire of Moses have sitten the Scribes and</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:57798:28"/>
Pharisees: all things therefore they shall say to you, observe you and do.</p>
               <p>The Relatour again repeats, that all Propositions of Canonical <note place="margin">§ 10. num. 17. pag. 41.</note> Scripture are not alike <hi>Fundamental</hi> in the Faith. But this is answer'd by the Doctrine we have so often delivered (to clear his often mistaking) touching Fundamentals; that some are in this sense Fundamental, to wit, <hi>of necessity to be believ'd by all, and known expresly of all:</hi> others not Fundamental, that is, <hi>not of necessity to be known and believed expresly by all.</hi> In this sense (I say) we agree with his Lordship and his party, touching the Distinction of Fundamentals and not-Fundamentals. Our onely controversie is, whether there be in the Catholique Church any points of Faith <hi>not-Fundamental</hi> in this sense, that is, such as being declared by the Church to us <hi>as points of Faith,</hi> may lawfully, that is, without peril of sin and damnation, be denyed or doubted of. For in this they hold the Affirmative; we the Negative.</p>
               <p>The reason why we have no occasion in this Controversie, to treat this distinction in any sense, save this, is, because it relates onely to our Adversaries, who maintain they are not obliged under pain of damnation to believe some Definitions of the Church made in lawful General Councils, even whilest they expresly know them to be so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; because, say they, those Councils may erre in such Definitions, by reason the matter they contain is <hi>not-Fundamental.</hi> Wherefore we neither say, nor intend to shew it <hi>Sub Anulo Piscator is</hi> (which are his Lordships tearms) that 'tis as necessary to believe St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> were made Fishers of men, as that Christ dyed and rose again the Third Day. We hold the contrary; the one being a Prime Article and Fundamental in the first explicated sense, the other neither Prime nor Fundamental, But we stand to this, That whoever shall finde in Scripture, <hi>That St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Andrew <hi>were made Fishers of men,</hi> and yet question, or deny, the truth of it, <hi>cannot,</hi> for that time, believe any thing with Divine Faith. Therefore in the second sense it is Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, to believe that <hi>St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Andrew <hi>were made Fishers of men:</hi> and though the contrary should be shewed under the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I would not believe it. Now if the belief of every point of Faith decreed by the Church be as necessary to Salvation, when suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propounded to us for a point decreed by the Church, as it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to believe, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Andrew</hi> were made by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Fishers of men,</hi> when it is sufficiently propounded to us as clearly delivered in Scripture, then it will be as <hi>necessary to Salvation</hi> (that is, as much a <hi>Fundamental</hi> point, by reason of the Authority which delivers it) as the other.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. 'TWas a very pertinent question, which Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> afterwards <note place="margin">§ 11. num. 1. pag. 42.</note> moved, requiring to know, <hi>what points the Bishop would account Fundamental.</hi> For if he will have some <hi>Fundamental,</hi> which we are bound to believe under pain of Damnation, and others <hi>not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,</hi> which we may without sin question, or deny; it behoves us much to know which they are. I have ever desir'd a fatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer from Protestants to this question, but could never yet have it in the sense demanded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> call the Creed the <hi>onely Foundation,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sess. 3.</note> it containing the Prime points of our Faith, which all are obliged to know, and expresly believe? yet I hope his Lordships followers will not grant, that we may question, or deny, every thing that is not exprest in the Creed: and yet this must be done, if the Creed <hi>onely</hi> be held for <hi>Fundamental</hi> in the sense the question was propounded in.</p>
               <p>If they should reply, that not onely those points are <hi>Fundamental</hi> which are <hi>exprest</hi> in the Creed, but those also which are there <hi>infolded,</hi> by this means they may (as the Bishop speaks) <hi>lap up</hi> in the Creed all <note place="margin">Ibidem. pag. 43, 44.</note> 
                  <hi>particular</hi> points of Faith whatever. And truly, seeing his Lordship goes so far as to include all <hi>the Scripture</hi> in the Creed, there appears no great reason of Scruple, why the same should not be said of <hi>Traditions</hi> and other points; especially of <hi>that Tradition,</hi> for which we admit Scripture it self. For this would not make <hi>the fold much larger</hi> then it was before; and if it did, yet I see no hurt in it.</p>
               <p>But let us briefly reflect, how well the Bishops Answer satisfies the question propounded by Mr. <hi>Fisher.</hi> The matter proceeded thus. The <note place="margin">§ 11. num. 1. 2.</note> Jesuit had said, that the Greek Church <hi>was not right,</hi> because it held an errour concerning the Holy Ghost. The Bishop confessed, that what the Greeks held in that point was an errour, and <hi>a grievous one in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:57798:29"/>

but not <hi>Fundamental;</hi> and so hindered them not from being a True Church. Whereupon, that it might appear whether the errour of the Greek Church were <hi>Fundamental,</hi> or not, Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> demanded of the Bishop, <hi>what points he would account Fundamental.</hi> To this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the Bishop (after diverse artificial flourishes, serving to little or no purpose, but to draw the Readers attention from the Obligation he had to give <hi>a perfect list</hi> of his <hi>Fundamentals</hi>) answered, <hi>All points in the Creed, as they are there expressed are Fundamental:</hi> but soon after affirms, that <hi>he never either said or meant, that they onely are Fundamental.</hi> By which it evidently appears, his Lordship neither gave, nor meant to give a Categorical Answer to the question, but did industriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it; while granting there were other points Fundamental beside those contain'd in the Apostles Creed, he would not assign them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Wherefore, though the Greeks errour were not contrary to any point expressed in the Creed, yet seeing it might be contrary to some other <hi>Fundamental</hi> point not contained therein, Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> must needs remain as unsatisfied, as before, whether the Greeks erred in a <hi>Fundamental</hi> point or not. Is not this fine shuffling?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Before I leave this §, I shall note by the way, that to prove this Proposition, that <hi>the Belief of Scripture to be the word of God and Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is an equal, or rather preceding Principle of Faith, with or to the whole Body of the Creed,</hi> he cites <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> in these words, <hi>Regula <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  Concors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  Articulis Fidei,</hi> &amp;c. (the Rule of Faith is the Concordant sense of Scripture with Articles of Faith.) Now first, here's nothing of believing the Scripture to be <hi>the word of God and Infallible,</hi> (for that's presupposed) but onely <hi>what sense</hi> the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture must have to be <hi>the Rule of Faith.</hi> Secondly, here's no mention of the Creed, but of <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> which <hi>Albertus</hi> held to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, then those specified in the Creed. Thirdly, this sentence of <hi>Albertus</hi> makes the Scripture no further <hi>a Rule</hi> of Faith, then as it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords with <hi>the Articles</hi> of Faith first delivered by Tradition.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By what hath been said, is confuted whatever the Bishop hath to <hi>pag.</hi> 44. where Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> is brought in by Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> as acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>the English Church is not yet resolved, what is the right sense of the Article of Christs Descending into Hell.</hi> But the Bishop will needs have the English Church resolved in this point. I will not much trouble my self about it, as being not Fundamental, either in his Lordships sense, or ours. But Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> grounded his speech upon those words of Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> viz. <hi>In the interpretation of this Article there is not that consent that were to be wished.</hi> Thus he. Whereupon the Relatour also confeffeth, <hi>That some have been too busie in Crucifying this Article.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Catholiques (upon whom the Bishop would lay the same <note place="margin">§ 12. num. 1. pag. 44.</note> charge) they all believe it as it lyes in the Creed, and is proposed by the Church. But it being not defined by the Church, whether we have this Article from Tradition onely, or also from Scripture, I hope, Divines may be permitted to hold different opinions about it, without prejudice to the <hi>Unity</hi> or <hi>Integrity</hi> of Faith. <hi>Durand</hi> may also be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to teach, (though somewhat contrary to the common opinion) that the Soul of Christ, in the time of his death, did not go down into
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57798:30"/>
Hell <hi>really,</hi> but <hi>virtually</hi> and by effects onely. The like may be said of that other question, whether the Soul of Christ did descend <hi>really</hi> and in its <hi>Essence</hi> into the <hi>Lower Pit,</hi> and place of the Damned; or <hi>really</hi> onely into that place, or Region of Hell, which is called <hi>Limbus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,</hi> but <hi>Virtually</hi> from thence into the Lower Hell: Our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries may know, that all Catholique Divines agree, <hi>Durand</hi> excepted, that Christ our Saviour, in his Blessed Soul, did <hi>really</hi> descend into Hell, our School Disputes and Differences being into what part of Hell he <hi>really</hi> descended: as likewise touching the <hi>manner</hi> of exhibiting his Divine Presence amongst the Dead, and of the <hi>measure</hi> of its effects, to wit, of <hi>Consolation</hi> and <hi>Deliverance</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Good, or of <hi>Terrour, Confusion,</hi> and <hi>Punishment</hi> towards the Bad. And though they should differ in their opinions more then they do, in this or any other question concerning Religion, yet they all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their judgements (as they do) to the Censure and Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, when ever she thinks fit to interpose her Authority and define the matter, all these seeming Tempests of Controversie amongst us will end in a quiet calme. I could wish his Lordship had been, in his time, and that his Followers would now be of the same Temper: for then all Disputes and Differences in matters of Faith would cease; yet School-Divinity remain entire.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to what the Bishop asserts, <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <note place="margin">§ 12. num. 3. pag. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>takes the words as they are in the Creed, and believes them without further Dispute, and in that sense, which the Primitive Fathers of the Church agreed in,</hi> I answer, all Catholiques profess to do the same: so that the question can onely be touching the sense of the words as they lye in the Creed, and the sense of the Primitive Church concerning them.</p>
               <p>Now as for <hi>Stapletons</hi> affirming, <hi>That the Scripture is silent in the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 13. num. 1. pag. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>point of Christs descending into Hell,</hi> and in mentioning that there is a <hi>Catholique and Apostolique Church,</hi> suppose we should grant, that Christs Descent into Hell were not <hi>exprest</hi> in Scripture, yet his Lordships par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will not deny it to be sufficient, that it is in the Creed. And for the other point, <hi>Stapleton</hi> was not so ignorant as to think, there was no mention of the Church of Christ in Scripture; for every ordinary Scholar knows that place of <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church.</hi> Nor that she was to be (even by the testimony of Scripture) both Catholique and Apostolical: for how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and invincibly doth this most worthy Doctor prove both these points from Scripture, in several parts of his works? wherefore, in the place alledged, 'tis evident his meaning was onely to deny, that the words <hi>Catholique and Apostolique</hi> were <hi>expresly</hi> in Scripture, though they be there in sense and effect, as (I presume) our Opponents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves will not be so hardy as to deny. So that his Lordships facetious discourse here, upon <hi>Stapleton</hi> and some Texts of Scripture, may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taken for a jeast to please his own humour, then for an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against us.</p>
               <p>This Incidental quarrel with <hi>Stapleton</hi> being over, the Bishop fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 3. pag. 48.</note> again falls to expostulate both with Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> and <hi>A. C.</hi> for citing Mr. <hi>Rogers Authority</hi> for the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57798:31"/>
with how little reason, it appears by the very Title of Mr. <hi>Rogers's</hi> Book; which, as the Bishop himself acknowledges, runs thus, <hi>The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England; and for this gives him a jerk, that possibly he might <hi>think a little too well of his own pains, and gave his Book too high a Title.</hi> Truly I conceive it of small importance to bestow much time upon this Subject, either in relation to the Bishops Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with Master <hi>Rogers,</hi> or the pretended variance between <hi>Vega</hi> and <hi>Soto</hi> touching mens <hi>certain assurance</hi> of Justification or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: which jarre is denyed by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who cites both of them for the Common opinion, that a man cannot be certain of his Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or Salvation, <hi>by certainty of Faith,</hi> without an especial Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. However I cannot but observe, that though <hi>Catharinus</hi> disagrees from <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the Common opinion concerning the foresaid point (as the Bishop objects) yet he dissents not <hi>formally</hi> from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and Doctrine of the Church; whose sense he professeth to follow, submitting himself in that, and all other his opinions, to her Censure. So that though I grant him to have fallen into an errour, yet he is not accusable of Heresie, as not being obstinate in his mistake.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Bishop is our good friend in saying, that <hi>all Protestants</hi> (he <note place="margin">§ 14. num. 1. pag. 50.</note> might have added, all other profest enemies of the Catholique Church) <hi>do agree with the Church of.</hi> England <hi>in the main exceptions, which they joyntly take against the Roman Church, as appears by their several Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> For by their agreeing in this, but in little or nothing else, they sufficiently shew themselves enemies to the true Church; which is <hi>one,</hi> (and onely <hi>one</hi>) by unity of Doctrine; from whence they must needs be judged to depart, by reason of their Divisions. Now that our Authours disagree not in Faith, we have shewed a little before. The Relatour doth much perplex himself about the Catholique <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Churches pronouncing <hi>Anathema:</hi> But this is not done so <hi>easily</hi> as he imagined. For this <hi>Anathema</hi> falls onely upon such as <hi>obstinately</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Catholique Church. And if in <hi>such cases</hi> it should not be pronounced, we should be so far from being <hi>in peace</hi> and <hi>quietness,</hi> that all would be brought to <hi>confusion,</hi> as appears by <hi>the concord</hi> we finde in our own Church; and those sad <hi>Dissentions and Disorders</hi> most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in theirs. Wherefore I believe, that reason will rather ascribe the troubles of Christendome, to the <hi>freedom,</hi> which others take and give in matters of Faith, by permitting every one to believe what he pleases, then to any <hi>severity</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> which is known to be a <hi>pious Mother,</hi> and never proceeds to Excommunication, but when <hi>obstinacy</hi> and <hi>perverseness</hi> enforce her. As to what the Bishop <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 51.</note> objects, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church makes many points to be of <hi>necessary</hi> belief, which had for many hundred of years passed onely for <hi>pious opinions,</hi> if his Lordship had assigned any <hi>such</hi> points in particular, they should have received an answer.</p>
               <p>The Relatour dislikes Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> for saying, <hi>The Church of</hi> England <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>in her Book of Canons Excommunicates every man, who shall hold any thing contrary to any part of the said Articles,</hi> viz, the 39. Articles. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though these were not the precise words of their Canon, yet the Church of <hi>England,</hi> excommunicating all such, <hi>as affirme they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:57798:31"/>
                  <hi>with a good Conscience submit unto them</hi> (as 'tis manifest she does, by the very Canon which the Bishop cites) she doth in effect excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all that <hi>hold any thing contrary to the said Articles.</hi> As for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>severity</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, we have answer'd it already, and shew'd, that the <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> granted by her enemies, would afford no more prosperity to her, then it hath done to them. 'Tis true, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as his Lordship takes notice) imposes <hi>her Doctrine,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 52.</note>

Secondly, he addes <hi>and perhaps not the sense;</hi> because, <hi>privately holding within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> and <hi>boldly and publickly affirming</hi> are different things. True. But where doth <hi>A.

And as to the sense of the Article, the Bishop himself durst not <hi>boldly</hi> and <hi>publickly</hi> affirme, that <hi>A.

But without all <hi>perhaps</hi> and <hi>peradventure,</hi> he gave the genuine sense of the Canon; seeing 'tis against all reason to imagine, that a man should be held punishable with <hi>Excommunication</hi> for a meer <hi>internal</hi> Act. He must mean therefore by the word <hi>holding</hi> an <hi>external</hi> Act, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not amount to less then <hi>Affirming.</hi>

                     </gap> ,</hi> be not <hi>unreasonable;</hi> supposing, she be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to errour in defining those Articles. For what is it less then <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable</hi> Tyranny, to cast men out of their Church (which they esteem <hi>a True one</hi>) deliver them up to Satan, and lay Gods and their Churches curse upon them, for affirming that to be <hi>erroneous,</hi> which (for ought they know) may <hi>possibly</hi> be such indeed? especially when the Impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fully perswades himself, that what he affirms to be <hi>erroneous</hi> in them, is <hi>really</hi> so. For <hi>Excommunication</hi> being the most grievous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment the Church can inflict, must require a Crime proportionable to it. But can any man perswade himself, that to oppose a Doctrine, against which the opposer verily perswades himself, he hath either an <hi>evidence</hi> from Scripture, or a <hi>Demonstrative</hi> reason (in which cases the Bishop grants, that one <hi>may,</hi> yea <hi>ought</hi> to oppugne the Churches er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours) can any man, I say, perswade himself that this is a <hi>Crime propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable,</hi> or a sufficient cause of Excommunication? Every just Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication therefore, inflicted for the <hi>opposing</hi> of Doctrine, must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily suppose the Doctrine <hi>opposed</hi> to be <hi>infallibly true</hi> and absolutely exempt from errour, otherwise the sentence it self would be <hi>unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> and <hi>unjust,</hi> as wanting sufficient ground. Whence likewise it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that Protestants, while they confess on the one side, that all their thirty nine Articles are not <hi>Fundamental</hi> points of Faith, (and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57798:32"/>
in their sense and according to their principles, not <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true,</hi> but <hi>subject to errour</hi>) yet on the other side proceed to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication against any, that affirm <hi>them, or any part of them, to be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious or erroneous,</hi> do themselves exercise a greater Tyranny and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice towards their people, then they can, with any colour or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reason, charge upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: which (as they well know) excommunicates no man, but for denying such Doctrine, as is both <hi>Infallibly true,</hi> and also <hi>Fundamental,</hi> at least according to <hi>the formal</hi> Object.</p>
               <p>As little is it the question, whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications be of a <hi>much larger extent,</hi> then those of the English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants; (for this argues no more, then that one is the <hi>Universal</hi> Church, the other not) but the question is (as hath been said) whether Protestants Excommunications be not <hi>unreasonable,</hi> nay, most <hi>enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> as inflicted by those, who acknowledge themselves fallible, and <hi>subject to errour</hi> in that very point for which they Excommunicate. Again, as to the <hi>larger extent</hi> of our excommunications, might not the same have been objected against the excommunications of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves, by any particular Heretical Conventicles in those times, to wit, that their (pretended) Excommunications reached no further then the bounds of their own private Congregations, whereas the Apostolical Excommunications extended to the utmost limits of the whole Christian World.</p>
               <p>What follows ha's been often answered: For we grant, <hi>the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 15. num. 1. pag. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>is sufficient for some mens Salvation,</hi> if we regard the <hi>material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> onely, or the chief points of Faith; because all the Prime Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Faith are expressed in Scripture: which Prime Articles are Fundamental onely in the first sense, so often declared. But hence it follows not that some things <hi>not exprest</hi> in Scripture, are not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the second sense formerly delivered. Amongst these, <hi>Tradition</hi> must be numbered; for which we admit Scripture it self. In this tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (to use his Lordships Rhetorique) <hi>the Fathers are plain, the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not strangeis,</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> (whom he stiles an <hi>angry opposite) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses</hi> as much. Moreover, where there is any difficulty about the sense of Scripture, or the point to be believed, we are not so to stand to Scripture, as that we refuse to hear the Church appointed by Christ to interpret it, and to declare what ought to be believed. For otherwise there would be no end of Controversies; every Heretique pretending Scripture, and crying it up as much, as the Bishop or any other of his party can do.</p>
               <p>Nor can the Church obtrude any thing as Fundamental in the Faith, <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 2. pag. 53.</note> which is not so in it self; she being <hi>Infallible</hi> as shall hereafter be proved; the Bishop here wrongfully supposing the contrary. Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> sayes, <hi>'Tis true, That the Church of</hi> England <hi>grounds her POSITIVE Articles upon Scripture, that is, 'tis true, if themselves may be competent judges in their own cause.</hi> But his Lordship (not liking that Qualification of his speech) professeth for himself and his party, that they are willing to be judged by the <hi>joynt consent and constant belief of the Fathers, which lived within the first Four or Five hundred years after Christ, when the Church was</hi> (as he sayes) <hi>at the best; and by the Councils held within those times; and</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:57798:32"/>
                  <hi>that they will submit to them in all those points of Doctrine.</hi> This offer is very fair, and we do (for our selves) as Solemnly promise the same, and will make it good upon all occasions.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But to shew the Bishop cannot perform what he hath undertaken, Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> endeavours to confute him in the point of Infant-Baptisme; which (saith he) is not <hi>expresly (at least not evidently) affirmed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor directly (at least not demonstratively) concluded out of it:</hi> words not <hi>vainly and cunningly</hi> (as the Relatour pretends) but soberly and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly spoken. For a point may be exprest, and yet not <hi>evidently</hi> exprest. Otherwise there could never be any doubt concerning what were <hi>exprest</hi> in Scripture: since men never question things that are <hi>evident.</hi> Now the Baptisme of Infants must not onely be exprest, but <hi>evidently</hi> exprest, to prove it <hi>sufficiently</hi> (that is undenyably) by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture alone. For, if it be there exprest onely <hi>probably,</hi> it may be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably denyed</hi> to be expressed: and so Disputations can never have an end out of the Scriptures expression alone. For the same reason he addes, that Infant-Baptisme is not (at least <hi>demonstratively</hi>) concluded out of Scripture: because if it be prov'd <hi>directly</hi> yet onely <hi>probably</hi> (as was said) it may <hi>probably</hi> be denyed: and so we shall finde no more end here then in the former Dispute. Wherefore our Adversaries cannot in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son mislike this addition of <hi>evidently exprest</hi> and <hi>demonstratively conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;</hi> because without this we shall never have an end of Disputations. This was it, made Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> adde those words; though the Bishop knew full well, that there are many things in good Logick concluded <hi>directly,</hi> which are not concluded <hi>Demonstratively,</hi> as he well shewes: But he is much out, nay contradicts himself in what he urges, <hi>That whatsoever is by direct consequence proved out of Scripture, is Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>and Scientifically proved.</hi> For, first he supposes Scripture to be a <hi>prime principle</hi> in Christian Religion, that is, such a principles as has no dependance on any other to declare it such <hi>infallibly</hi> to Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which he knowes all Catholiques deny. Secondly, though I should grant Scripture, and every Text of it, to be <hi>a principle amongst all Christians, whereof no man should desire any further proof;</hi> yet unless both Propositions, the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi>) were <hi>evidently</hi> in Scripture, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion might <hi>directly</hi> be inferred, but not <hi>evidently,</hi> out of Scripture. For, in case one Proposition onely be <hi>evidently</hi> express'd, and the other <hi>inevidently,</hi> or but <hi>probably,</hi> the Conclusion indeed will follow <hi>directly,</hi> but not <hi>demonstratively.</hi> This is much more clear, if but one Proposition be <hi>evidently</hi> express'd in Scripture, and the other nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Scripture, nor evident to natural reason, but onely <hi>probable:</hi> For, (as Logicians speaks) <hi>Conclusio sequitur debiliorem partem,</hi> The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion alwayes follows the nature of the weaker Proposition. This will appear to be so in Infant-Baptisme. For, though no man ought to deny, but that many things are <hi>Demonstrable</hi> in Divinity; yet all are not. For, in this respect, as <hi>Canus</hi> here cited affirms, <hi>Divinity is like</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>other Sciences;</hi> which prove not all things Demonstratively, but many things onely Topically, or probably.</p>
               <p>To illustrate this doctrine a little further by instances. First, that a Thing may be <hi>expresly</hi> in Scripture, and yet not <hi>evidently</hi> exprest, even according to some Protestants. Our Saviour sayes, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. &amp;c.)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57798:33"/>
                  <hi>This is my Body:</hi> where he affirms <hi>expresly</hi> that what he had then in his hands was his Body; and yet (according to the <hi>Zuinglians</hi>) this is no <hi>evident</hi> expression to signifie his reall Body: for if that were <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> exprest by these words, no man, that believes Scripture, could deny it, as those Heretiques do. For, 'tis impossible to deny an <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> Thus again, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. it is exprest, <hi>Qui crediderit &amp; Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zatus fuerit, Salvus erit:</hi> yet is it not <hi>evidently</hi> exprest, that every one, who believes and is Baptized, shall be saved; because many are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and Believe, who are afterward damned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that a thing may be <hi>directly</hi> deduced from Scripture; and yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  
                  <hi>demonstratively,</hi> I give these instances. All Scripture <hi>Divinely inspired,</hi> &amp;c. is <hi>profitable,</hi> &amp;c. (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.) But St. <hi>James</hi> his Epistle is <hi>Scripture Divinely inspired: Ergo</hi> it is <hi>profitable,</hi> &amp;c. This conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is <hi>directly</hi> deduced, in perfect forme, from Scripture; yet is it not evidently deduced from it: for if it were, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> could not deny the consequence; as they do, because the <hi>Minor</hi> is not <hi>evident</hi> in Scripture. Or thus. <hi>Unless one be born again of water and the Holy Ghost he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> John 3. 5. But children unbaptized are not <hi>born again of water and the Holy Ghost: Ergo</hi> they cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, This is <hi>directly</hi> deduced from Scripture; yet all Calvinists must say, it is not <hi>evidently</hi> deduced. Or lastly thus. That which our Saviour Consecrated in his last Supper was the usual Bread of that place and time: but no Bread, save what was made of Wheat was the usual Bread of that place and time: <hi>Ergo</hi> that which our Saviour Consecrated was no other, save that which was made of Wheat. The <hi>Major</hi> is clear in Scripture; but the <hi>Minor</hi> is onely historically certain: so that the consequence is deduced <hi>directly,</hi> but not <hi>Demonstratively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. His Lordships first Demonstration therefore, <hi>of the necessity of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid pag. 56.</note> 
                  <hi>Baptisme to the salvation of Infants,</hi> is much defective, if we stick to sole Scripture, as now he is to do. For a <hi>Pelagian Anabaptist</hi> will most easily answer, that the Text of <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>Except a man be born again by water and the Holy Ghost; he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> speaks onely of such as can be <hi>born again.</hi> Now none can be born again, save those who were <hi>dead in sinne:</hi> wherefore Infants having no sin at all, (as <hi>Pelagians</hi> hold) cannot be <hi>born again,</hi> and consequently must not be Baptized: insomuch that this Text is so far from proving against such <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> that Infants must be Baptized, that it rather proves the contrary.</p>
               <p>His second, <hi>That Infants ought to be baptized,</hi> (which he sayes <hi>is very</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>near an expression in Scripture it self,</hi>) hath nothing in it at all either of an <hi>expression,</hi> or <hi>demonstration.</hi> For to omit, that the word <hi>children</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <note place="margin">Acts 2. 38, 39.</note> not <hi>Infants,</hi> but <hi>filios,</hi> or <hi>liberos</hi> (children grown up to years;) and that by <hi>promise</hi> is not meant the particular promise there mentioned, but the promise of the new Law in Christ; the very Text it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes him. For, if the promise be made to their Children, (which is, that <hi>they amend their lives, and be Baptized, and they shall receive the Holy Ghost,</hi>) it cannot appertain to their Children, till they be capable of mending their lives; which Infants, (as all know) are not. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by a <hi>new Turn</hi> he tells us, <hi>the means to receive the Holy Ghost was</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:57798:33"/>
                  <hi>Baptisme;</hi> as if nothing but Baptisme had been exacted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in that place, when he expresly requires <hi>amendment of life,</hi> as well as Baptisme.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Notwithstanding all this, I would not have it thought, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to weaken the Argument out of <hi>John</hi> 3. for proving the Baptisme of Infants: for I have onely endeavoured to shew, that it cannot be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively</hi> proved out of that Text of Scripture alone against a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Heretique. We must therefore embrace St. <hi>Augustins</hi> counsel <note place="margin">num. 5. pag. 57.</note> (cited by his Lordship) who fayes, <hi>The custom of our Mother the Church in Baptizing Infants is by no means to be contemned, or thought superfluous; nor yet at all to be believed unless it were an Apostolical Tradition.</hi> In which words St. <hi>Augustin</hi> expresly asfirmeth, that the point of Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were not at all to be believ'd, but for <hi>Tradition.</hi> Therefore it is not demonstrable out of Scripture alone; for if it were, we should be bound to believe it, though we had it not from Tradition; which is contrary to St. <hi>Augustins</hi> words. 'Tis true, this Father having first learn't the abovesaid Doctrine from Tradition, proves it, or rather confirms it, out of Scripture; and so do other Catholique Authours. But all these proofs would be far from <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> were it not for Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Writing against <hi>Pelagius,</hi> he applyes that saying of our Saviour <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 58.</note> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 14.) <hi>Suffer little ones to come unto me,</hi> to the Baptizing of Infants; yet no man ever brought this place for a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> or a Text <hi>evidently</hi> proving of it self without Tradition, that Infants ought to be Baptized. For, those our Saviour spake of came not unto him to be Baptized, but to receive his Benediction. And 'tis clear, that he spake of the Children of the Jews, who were either circumcized or otherwise justified: and if we stick to the <hi>sole words</hi> they may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of such as were capable to understand what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or forbidden them, and consequently had some use of reason, which the Text it self intimates, <hi>nolite prohibere eos</hi> (forbid them not.)</p>
               <p>For, as I have said, we grant that Tradition being supposed, this point is proveable out of Scripture. Wherefore 'tis true, that it hath a <hi>root,</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> in Scripture; yet so obscurely, that it could not be sufficiently discovered without Tradition; because an <hi>Anabaptist</hi> might give a <hi>probable</hi> solution to all our Arguments, had we onely Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and not Tradition, for this point of Faith. Wherefore though Scripture may in some general sense, be said to contain in it all things necessary, yet it cannot be said to contain expresly and evidently all things necessary in particular.</p>
               <p n="12">12. I prove my Assertion, that Infant-Baptisme must be believed by <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> as 'tis an Apostolical Tradition, that is, considered purely as delivered <hi>orally</hi> by the Apostles, whether it can be prov'd by Scripture, or no. My Argument is <hi>ad hominem,</hi> against the Bishop thus. He grants expresly (<hi>pag.</hi> 66. and 67.) that <hi>unwritten</hi> Apostolical Traditions, if any such can be produced, are as properly and formally <hi>the word of God,</hi> and to be believed with <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> as Scripture it self. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Baptisme of Infants, considered onely as an unwritten A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Tradition, (as he considers it) precedently to its being drawn from Scripture, is to be believed with <hi>Divine Faith;</hi> being in that <hi>precise</hi> consideration the proper and formal object of Faith, to wit, <hi>the</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57798:34"/>
                  <hi>true word of God.</hi> So that according to this his doctrine, not onely such Traditions as are not at all <hi>written,</hi> are Gods word; but such as are both delivered by word of mouth and also by writing, are <hi>the word of God,</hi> as well by reason they were delivered <hi>by word of mouth,</hi> as by <hi>writing;</hi> because God hath <hi>equally</hi> revealed them by both these means. When therefore he sayes, (<hi>pag.</hi> 52.) that <hi>the Scriptures onely are the Foundation of Faith,</hi> it must be acknowledg'd, that he speaks contrary to what he sayes, <hi>pag.</hi> 57. <hi>That Baptisme of Infants is an Apostolical Tradition</hi> (which he there takes as contradistinguisht from <hi>Scripture</hi>) <hi>and therefore to be believed.</hi> For, if it be <hi>therefore,</hi> that is, because it is an Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tradition, even precedently to Scripture proofs, <hi>to be believed,</hi> not onely the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> also, as contradistinguisht from Scripture, will be a foundation of Faith. If he should reply that when he sayes <hi>therefore to be believed,</hi> he means not as the <hi>formal</hi> object and <hi>foundation</hi> of Faith, but as a <hi>disposition,</hi> preparing us to found the belief of it in Scripture, (as he seems to insinuate, though something obscurely, <hi>pag.</hi> 57) he contradicts himself, <hi>pag.</hi> 66, 67. where he grants, that assured unwritten Tradition is <hi>the true word of God,</hi> and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence properly to be believed, as having in it <hi>the formal object</hi> of Faith, to wit, Gods Revelation.</p>

These are <hi>believ'd</hi> to be the word of God, though not proved so out of any place of Scripture, but onely by Gods <hi>unwritten</hi> word, Tradition.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57798:34"/>
is, that though this question hath no difficulty at all in our principles, (who say, we believe them to be the true and undoubted word of God, <hi>because the Catholique Church delivers them as such to us</hi>) yet was it so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superably hard to be solved in Protestant principles, that I fear, the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour had rather have given it a <hi>put off</hi> by a Turn in his Labyrinth, then engaged himself therein, could the business have been conveniently avoided. Now if some do prove <hi>Scripture</hi> by <hi>Tradition,</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> by <hi>Scripture,</hi> falling into that faulty kinde of Argumentation, which the Schools call <hi>Circulus vitiosus,</hi> the blame lyes not in him that asks the question, but in them who answer it ill.

               <p>The Bishop therefore proposeth <hi>diverse wayes</hi> of proving Scripture <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 20 pag. 60.</note> to be the word of God, and in the first place falls to attaque our way; who prove it by the Tradition and Authority of the Church. For he urgeth, that <hi>it may be further asked, why he should believe the Churches Tradition. And if it be answered,</hi> that we believe it, <hi>because the Church is Infallibly governed by the Holy Ghost,</hi> he proceeds and demands, <hi>how that may appear?</hi> where he thinks, we are brought to those straits, that we must either say, we believe it <hi>by special Revelation,</hi> which is <hi>the private Spirit</hi> we object to others, or else must <hi>attempt to prove it by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;</hi> which were a <hi>vicious Circle:</hi> and yet he affirms <hi>we all do so.</hi> But with his Lordships favour, he conceives amiss; and I desire his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to give us leave hereafter to answer for our selves, and that <hi>they</hi> would not do it for us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wherefore to this last demand, (in which onely there is difficulty,) viz. <hi>How we know the Church to be infallibly governed by the Holy Ghost,</hi> we answer, that we prove it first in general, not by <hi>the Scripture,</hi> but by the <hi>Motives of credibility,</hi> which belong to the Church: in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Infallibility of <hi>Moyses</hi> and other Prophets, of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles, was proved; which was by the Miracles they wrought, and by other Signes of an <hi>Infallible Spirit, Direction</hi> and <hi>Guidance</hi> from God, which appeared in them. Whence it is clear, that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre no Circle. 'Tis true, after we have prov'd the Churches Infallibility by these Signs and Motives, namely by <hi>Sanctity of Life, Miracles, Efficacy, Purity, and Excellency of Doctrine, Fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Prophesies, Succession of lawfully-sent Pastours, Unity, Antiquity, and the very Name of Catholique,</hi> &amp;c. I say, after we have prov'd in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral her Infallibility by these and the like Motives; then, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Scripture by this Infallible Authority, (proved, as we see, another way and independently of Scripture) we may (and Authours commonly do) without any shadow of a <hi>vicious</hi> circle, confirme the same by Scripture: which Scripture-proofs are onely <hi>secondary</hi> and <hi>ex suppositione,</hi> not Prime and absolute; and most usually contain a proof <hi>ad hominem,</hi> or <hi>ex principles concessis</hi> against Sectaries, who denying the Infallibility of the Church, and questioning many times, or cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about our Motives of Credibility, yet admitting the <hi>Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of Scripture, are more easily convinced by clear Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57798:35"/>
then by the other proofs. And in this we do no otherwise, then St. <hi>Augustin</hi> hath done before us, writing against Heretiques.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But because we have often promised to prove <hi>the Infallibility</hi> of the Church, it will be necessary to insist some what longer upon this point, and declare the matter at large. We say then, that the Church is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in general to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> the same way that <hi>Moyses</hi> with other Prophets, <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> were first prov'd to be <hi>Infallible.</hi> For, the <hi>Israelites</hi> seeing <hi>Moyses</hi> to be a person very Devout, Milde, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, Chaste, and endowed with the gift of working Miracles, were upon that ground obliged to receive him for a <hi>true Prophet,</hi> and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him <hi>Infallible,</hi> by acknowledging as <hi>true and certain</hi> whatever he proposed to them from God. <hi>They believed our Lord and Moyses,</hi> saith <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 31.</note> the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>for the Testimony of Moyses</hi> the Israelites believed the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and other things more clearly; and in particular concerning <hi>Moyses</hi> himself, that in the House of God he was <hi>most faithful,</hi> and <hi>that God spake to him mouth to mouth,</hi> and the like. The same we may say of <note place="margin">Num. 12. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour. For, there appear'd in him so great <hi>Sanctity of life,</hi> such <hi>Grace</hi> of speech, and <hi>Glory</hi> of Miracles, that all, to whom he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were bound to acknowledge him for <hi>the great Prophet and Messias;</hi> as St. <hi>Andrew</hi> with the rest of <hi>Christs</hi> Disciples did, when they said, <hi>we have found the Messias.</hi> Thus they were bound <hi>at first</hi> to receive <note place="margin">John 1. 41.</note> him as <hi>Infallible,</hi> and <hi>afterwards</hi> to believe whatsoever he taught them; as that he was <hi>true God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> that he was <hi>to redeem</hi> the world with his blood upon the Cross, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Neither can any man justly here reply, that the Disciples and first Christians were obliged thus to receive our Blessed Saviour <hi>for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> which gives Testimony of him. Thus I say, no man can just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reply. For the Gentiles receiv'd not that Scripture; and yet they were <hi>bound</hi> to acknowledge Christ, and believe him <hi>Infallible.</hi> And though some learned <hi>Jews</hi> might perhaps gather this out of Scripture, yet even without the Scripture the <hi>works of Christ</hi> were of themselves abundantly <hi>sufficient</hi> to prove who he was, both to the learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. Wherefore our Saviour alwayes referred them to his works, as giving abundant <hi>Testimony</hi> of him. <hi>I have</hi> (said he) <hi>greater Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 5. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>then John; for the works which the Father hath given me to perfect them, the very works (which I do) give Testimony of me, that the Father sent me.</hi> The like we finde him saying elsewhere. <hi>The works that I do in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 25, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>the Name of my Father give Testimony of me.</hi> And, <hi>if you will not believe me, believe my works.</hi> By these places it appears, that the works of <note place="margin">John 14. 11.</note> Christ, <hi>without Scripture,</hi> proved him to be the <hi>true Messias</hi> and <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine is also verified in the Apostles, who receiv'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from Christ <hi>to preach every where, and TO CONFIRME THEIR WORDS with Signs that followed:</hi> by which signs all their Hearers were <note place="margin">Mark. 14. 19.</note> bound to submit themselves unto them, and to acknowledge their words for <hi>Infallible Oracles</hi> of Truth; as the Apostles themselves testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 28. Where we finde, that a Controversie arising in those Primitive times among the Christians, the <hi>Apostles and Ancients</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together; and having first concluded by themselves what was to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57798:35"/>
                  <hi>be held for Truth</hi> in the matters controverted, imposed their Decree as <hi>Infallible Doctrine,</hi> upon all others, in these words, <hi>It hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and Us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As therefore <hi>Moyses,</hi> our Blessed Saviour and his Apostles, were prov'd Infallible by their <hi>works, signs,</hi> and <hi>miracles, without Scripture,</hi> so is the Church, without help of the same, sufficiently prov'd to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> by the Motives of Credibility: which being the effects and properties of the Church, do Declare, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Wherefore though Heretiques have the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, yet being out of the true Church, they do wholly want these signs of Infallibility: of which see <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and other Catholique Authours discoursing more at large, <hi>De notis Ecclesiae.</hi> 'Tis sufficient for the present to have declared <hi>how Catholiques fall not into a Circle,</hi> as <note place="margin">Ibid. num. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> , and not <hi>by Scripture:</hi> though <hi>afterwards,</hi> and as it were secondarily (as we said before) they prove it also (especially to those who admit Scripture, as Protestants do) by the Scripture it self; which we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with the Relatour, to be a <hi>higher proof,</hi> (especially against them) then the Churches Tradition. Yet we deny, that those other proofs from the Motives of Credibility, can be in reason <hi>questionable,</hi> (as he sayes they are) <hi>until we come to Scripture.</hi> Neither do any Catholique Authours disagree in this; because they unanimously teach, that <hi>the Motives of Credibility make our Church EVIDENTLY CREDIBLE; and by consequence she is sufficiently proved to be True by them alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as concerning that Assertion, which the Bishop urges, that <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>the principles of any Conclusion must be of more credit, then the Conclusion it self;</hi> and his inference thereupon, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Articles of Faith, the Trinity, the Resurrection, and the rest being Conclusions, and the Principles by which they are concluded, being onely Ecclesiastical Tradition, it must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Tradition is more Infallible, then the Articles of Faith, if the Faith, which we have of the Articles, should be finally resolved into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of the Churches Testimony.</hi> I answer, the ground of all this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> is the Authority of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whose words the Bishop thus cites in the Margent. 1. <hi>Poster. c.</hi> 2. <hi>T.</hi> 16. <hi>Quocirca si <gap reason="foreign">

In which words we confess, the Philosopher doth very well declare the proceeding of the Understanding, (or Minde of Man) when it works <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>necessarily;</hi> by and from the <hi>evidence,</hi> or clearness of its Object: but not when it works <hi>supernaturally,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth <hi>supernatural</hi> and <hi>Free</hi> Acts, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ,</hi> or at least <hi>principally</hi> from the Impulse and Inclination of the will; for in such cases the Maxime holds not, <hi>viz. That the Principles of a Conclusion must be of more Credit, then the Conclusion it self.</hi> Now the Act of Believing is such an Act; that is, which the Understanding Elicites, rather by a Voluntary and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57798:36"/>
                  <hi>Free</hi> inclination and <hi>Consent</hi> of the will, then from any <hi>Evident Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in the Object, whereto it <hi>assents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That this may further appear, I distinguish a double proceeding in Probations; the one is <hi>per principia intrinseca,</hi> (by intrinsecal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) that is, such as have a necessary, natural connexion with the things proved, and do manifest and lay open the <hi>objects</hi> themselves. The other is <hi>per principia extrinseca</hi> (by extrinsecal Principles) that is, such as have no natural or necessary connexion with, nor do produce any such <hi>evident</hi> manifestation of the Thing proved; but their efficacy, <hi>viz.</hi> whereby they determine the Understanding to Assent, doth wholly depend on the worth and vertue of that external Principle whereby such Probations are made. And this kinde of proof is called <hi>Probatio ab Authoritate</hi> (an Argument from Authority:) which Authority is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the veracity, knowledge, and vertue of him, to whom we give assent, when we receive such or such an affirmation from him. Now (as I said above,) we our selves either hear <hi>immediately</hi> what he affirms, and then we assent immediately, and solely for <hi>his Authority;</hi> or we hear it <hi>mediately</hi> from the report of others: who, if of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable credit, we assent that he did affirm it, upon the Authority of the Reporters: yet so as we should not give an <hi>undoubted</hi> assent to the thing it self, but for the <hi>undenyable Authority</hi> of the <hi>First</hi> Deliverer.</p>
               <p>To apply this doctrine: when we believe any thing with <hi>Divine</hi> Faith, it proceeds not from any probation <hi>per principia intrinseca,</hi> from any thing that hath natural connexion, dependence, or inference of, or with the thing believed; but is purely <hi>propter principia extrinseca,</hi> for and from extrinsecal principles, to wit, the Authority, Veracity, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Knowledge of God affirming it. Now the Prophets and Apostles, assented to what God spake immediately unto them. And the like is Affirmable, in some proportion, of their immediate Hearers. But succeeding Ages had it, (<hi>viz. Gods Revelation</hi>) both from Christ and his Apostles onely <hi>mediately,</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> from their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Pastours. Now that we may be assured hereof <hi>Infallibly,</hi> we must have some infallible Testimony to ascertain it unto us; which can be no other then the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Neither will it be necessary, <hi>precisely for this reason,</hi> to affirm in the <hi>Resolution</hi> of our Faith, That the Churches <hi>Declaration</hi> in matters of Faith is <hi>absolutely and simply Divine,</hi> or that God speaks <hi>immediately</hi> by her Definitions; or that our Faith is <hi>Resolved</hi> into <hi>the voice</hi> of the Church, as into its <hi>formal object:</hi> but it is enough to say our Faith is <hi>Resolved</hi> into Gods Revelations (whether <hi>written or unwritten</hi>) as its <hi>formal object:</hi> and our <hi>Infallible Assurance,</hi> that the Things we believe as <hi>Gods Revelations,</hi> are revealed from him, is <hi>Resolved</hi> into the <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Churches Definitions,</hi> teaching us, that they are his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Seeing therefore our Faith (in this way of proceeding) is not <hi>resolved</hi> into the Churches Authority, as <hi>the formal</hi> Motive of our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but onely as an <hi>assured</hi> Testimony, that such and such Articles, as the Church defines to be matters of Faith, are <hi>truly revealed</hi> from God, (as she assures us they are,) it is not necessary, the Churches Testimony should be a <hi>new immediate</hi> Revelation from God, but onely <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Infallible,</hi> by the Assistance of the Holy Ghost preserving her
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57798:36"/>
from all errour, in defining any thing as a point of Christian Faith, that is, as a Truth revealed from God, which is not truly and really so revealed.</p>
               <p>If then it be demanded, why we believe such Books as are contain'd in the Bible to be the <hi>word of God,</hi> we answer, because it is a Divine <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Tradition,</hi> that they are his word; and this <hi>Divine</hi> Tradition is the <hi>formal object,</hi> whereon our Faith relyes: But if it be further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, how we are <hi>certain</hi> that it is a <hi>Divine</hi> Tradition, we answer, the <hi>certainty</hi> we have thereof is from the <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> of the Church, teaching us it is such a Tradition. Thus the Articles of our Faith are <hi>delivered</hi> from God, but <hi>kept</hi> by the Church; they <hi>spring</hi> from God as the <hi>Fountain,</hi> but run down in a full <hi>Stream</hi> through the <hi>Channel,</hi> and within the <hi>Banks</hi> of the Church: they are <hi>sowed</hi> by the hand of God, but <hi>grow up</hi> in the field of the Church: They are <hi>spoken</hi> by the mouth of God, but we <hi>hear</hi> them by the voice of the Church, assuring us that God spake them; which we could never <hi>elevate</hi> our hearts to believe with <hi>Divine</hi> Faith, but by the <hi>Testimony</hi> of Gods Church, which gives us <hi>a full assurance</hi> of his Revelation.</p>
               <p>Thus then the Church being <hi>supernaturally Infallible</hi> in all her Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of Faith, will be a sufficient ground to ascertain us of those Holy writings, which God by <hi>unwritten Tradition</hi> revealed to the Church, in time of the Apostles, to be his <hi>written word.</hi> For if her Definition herein be absolutely infallible, then what she defines as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd from God to be his written word, is undoubtedly such: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that Christians being irrefregably assured thereof by the Churches <hi>Infallible</hi> declaration, believe this Article with Divine Faith, <hi>because revealed from God,</hi> who cannot deceive them; that Revelation being the onely <hi>formal object</hi> into which they <hi>resolve</hi> their Faith; and the Churches Assurance the ground to perswade them that it is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly a Divine Revelation, or Tradition. The Churches Definition therefore is like <hi>Approximation</hi> in the working of natural causes; to wit, a <hi>necessary condition,</hi> prerequired to their working by their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force; yet is it self no <hi>cause,</hi> but an <hi>application</hi> onely of the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>cause</hi> to the subject, on which it works; seeing nothing can work <hi>immediately</hi> on what is distant from it.</p>
               <p>Thus Gods Revelations delivered to the Church <hi>without writing</hi> were, and are, the onely <hi>formal cause</hi> of our assent in Divine Faith; but because they are as it were <hi>distant</hi> from us, having been <hi>delivered</hi> (that is revealed) so many ages past, they are <hi>approximated,</hi> or <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> applyed to us, by the Infallible Declaration of the present Church; which still confirming by her doctrine and practice what was first <hi>revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> makes it as firmly believed by us, as it was by the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to whom it was first revealed. So a Common-wealth, by still maintaining, practising, and approving the Laws enacted in its first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, makes them as much <hi>observ'd</hi> and <hi>esteem'd</hi> by the people, in all succeeding Ages, for <hi>their Primitive Laws,</hi> as they were by those who liv'd in the time of their first Institution.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears our Faith rests onely upon Gods <hi>immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as its <hi>formal object;</hi> though the Churches voice be a <hi>condition</hi> so necessary for its resting thereon, that it can never attain that <hi>formal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:57798:37"/>
without it. By which Discourse the Bishops Argument is solv'd, as also his Text out of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> For, seeing here is no Scientifical proof <hi>per principia intrinseca,</hi> there can be no necessary and natural Connexion of Principles, <hi>evidencing</hi> the Thing proved, as is required in <hi>Demonstrative</hi> Knowledge: the thing it self, which is <hi>believed,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining still <hi>obscure,</hi> and all the <hi>Assurance</hi> we have of it, depending on the Authority of Him that testifies it unto us.</p>
               <p>Lastly, hence are solved the Authorities of <hi>Canus,</hi> (cited also by his Lordship) who onely affirms, what I have here confessed, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Faith is not <hi>resolv'd</hi> into the Authority of the Church, as the <hi>formal object</hi> of it; and that of <hi>pag.</hi> 65. where he contends, that the Church gives not <hi>the Truth</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> to the Scriptures, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>teaches</hi> them, with Infallible Certainty, to be Canonical, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Word of God, &amp;c. the very same thing, with what I here maintain.</p>
               <p>The Churches Authority then being <hi>more known unto us,</hi> then the Scriptures, may well be <hi>some reason</hi> of our admitting them, yet the Scriptures still retain their <hi>Prerogative</hi> above the Church. For, being Gods <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> they require a greater respect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, then <hi>the meer Tradition</hi> of the Church. Whence it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that our Authours do here commonly distinguish Two Sorts of <hi>Certainty;</hi> the one <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ;</hi> the other <hi>ex parte subjecti.</hi> The first proceeds from <hi>the Clearness</hi> of the <hi>Object;</hi> the other from <hi>the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion</hi> (as Philosophers call it) of the <hi>Will,</hi> which makes the <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> stick so close to the <hi>Object,</hi> that it cannot be separated from it. This latter kinde of <hi>Certainty</hi> hath chiefly place in Faith; a thing unknown to <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Whence it is, that when we <hi>believe,</hi> we do adhere more firmly to the Articles of Faith, then to any Principle whatsoever, though evident to natural reason: which <hi>firme Adhesion</hi> of ours is grounded partly on the <hi>Greatness</hi> and <hi>Nobleness</hi> of the <hi>Object,</hi> and partly on <hi>the importance</hi> of the matter; which is such, that our Salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it. For that <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> namely the Scripture, being in it self of so much greater <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> then the Churches <hi>meer</hi> Tradition, doth worthily more draw our affection, then the other; notwithstanding the other be <hi>more known to us,</hi> and <hi>the Cause</hi> of our admitting his.</p>
               <p>Thus we have shew'n, that we hold not the Churches Definition for the <hi>formal object</hi> of Faith, (as the Relatour by disputing so much against it, would seem to impose on us) though our present Faith ('tis true) relyes upon it, as an <hi>Infallible Witness</hi> both of <hi>the written</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written</hi> word of God, which is the <hi>Formal Object.</hi> Wherefore, when we say <hi>we believe the Catholique Church,</hi> we profess to believe not onely <hi>the Things</hi> which she teacheth, but <hi>the Church her self so teaching,</hi> as an <hi>Infallible witness:</hi> and the contrary we shall never believe, till it be prov'd otherwise; then by saying (as the Bishop here does) <hi>it were no hard thing to prove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what hath been said it appears, that there is no <hi>Devise,</hi> or <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> at all (as the Relatour would have it thought of us) either in taking away any thing due to the <hi>Fathers, Councils,</hi> or <hi>Scripture,</hi> or in giving too much to the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the present Church. For we acknowledge
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57798:37"/>
all due respect to the Fathers, and as much (to speak modestly) as any of our Adversaries party. But they must pardon us, if we preferre the general <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the present Church before the <hi>result</hi> of any mans particular Phansie. As for Scripture, we ever extoll it above the Definitions of the Church; yet affirm it to be in many places so <hi>obscure,</hi> that we cannot be <hi>certain</hi> of its true sense, without the help of a living, Infallible Judge, to determine and declare it: which can be no other then the Present Church. And what we say of Scripture, may with proportion be applyed to Ancient General Councils. For, though we willingly submit to them all; yet where they happen to be obscure in matters requiring Determination, we seek the Assistance and Direction of the same living <hi>Infallible</hi> Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tradition, or the Sentence of the present Church.</p>
               <p>This being the Substance of our Doctrine, concerning the <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Faith, as we have osten intimated, 'tis evident, <hi>the cunning</hi> of the <hi>Device</hi> the Bishop speaks of, is none of ours, but his own, while he falsly chargeth us, that we <hi>finally resolve all Authorities of the Fathers, Councils, and Scriptures into the Authority of the present Roman Church:</hi> whereas in points of Faith we ever <hi>resolve</hi> them <hi>finally</hi> into Gods word, <note place="margin">

               <p>But the Bishop thought this injury not great enough, unless he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled it by any additional false Imputation of other two absurdities, which he avers to follow evidently from our doctrine. To the first, viz. <hi>That we ascribe as great Authority (if not greater) to a part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church as we do to the whole,</hi> I answer, there follows no such thing from any Doctrine of ours, but from his Lordships wilfully-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken Notion of the Catholique Church; which he most desperately extends to all that bear the name of Christians, without exception of either Schismatiques or Heretiques, that so he might be sure to include himself within her Pale, and make the Reader absurdly believe, that the Roman Church, taken in her full latitude, is but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> , or Parcel of the Catholique Church believed in the Creed. This indeed, (to use his Lordships phrase) is <hi>full of Absurdity</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> in <hi>Reason, in all things.</hi> For, it is to pretend an Addition of Integral parts to a Body already entire in all its Integrals: seeing the Roman Church, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the sense it ought to be, as comprising all Christians that are in her Communion, is <hi>the sole</hi> and <hi>whole</hi> Catholique Church; as is evident in Ecclesiastical History, which clearly shews throughout all Ages, that none condemn'd of Heresie or Schisme, by the Roman Church, were ever accounted any part of the Catholique Church. And this I would have prov'd at large, had his Lordship done any more then barely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the contrary.</p>
               <p>If any man shall object, that the Bishop charges the absurdity upon us in respect of the Roman Church, that <hi>we ascribe as great Authority, (if not greater) to a part of it, as we do to the whole,</hi> viz. In our General Councils, I answer, that is so far from being an absurdity, that it were absurd to suppose it can be otherwise: which the Objecter himself will clearly fee, when he considers, that the like must needs be granted even in Civil Governments. For instance, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57798:38"/>
is but a handful of men compar'd with the whole Nation, yet have they <hi>greater</hi> Authority, in order to the making, or repealing of Laws, then the whole Nation, were they met together in a Body, Men, Women, and Children: which would produce nothing but an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute confusion. The Application is so easie, I leave it to the Objecter himself to make.</p>
               <p>The second accusation which the Bishop layes to our charge, is this; That in our Doctrine concerning the Infallibility of our Church, our proceeding is most unreasonable, in regard we will not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to Texts of Scripture, exposition of Fathers, Propriety of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Conference of Places, &amp;c. but argue that the Doctrine of the present Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is true and Catholique, because she professeth it to be such: which, sayes he, is to prove <hi>Idem per Idem.</hi> Whereas tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we most willingly embrace, and have frequent recourse to all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops mentioned helps; and that with much more Candour, then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants can with any ground of reason pretend to, considering their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold <hi>wrestings</hi> both of Scripture and Fathers, when they either urge them against us, or endeavour to evade their clear Testimonies for us.</p>
               <p>Neither are we in any danger of committing a Circle, or proving <note place="margin">Ibidem. pag. 63. 64.</note> 
                  <hi>Idem per Idem,</hi> because his Lordship sees not how we can possibly winde our selves out. The business is not so insuperably difficult in our Doctrine. For if we be asked, <hi>how we know the Church to be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> our <hi>last</hi> answer is not (as he feigns) <hi>because she professes her self to be such;</hi> but we <hi>know</hi> her to be <hi>Infallible</hi> by the Motives of Credibility, which sufficiently prove her to be such. So the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles were, in their time, known to be <hi>Infallible Oracles</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of Truth, by the <hi>like signs</hi> and <hi>Motives:</hi> onely this difference there is: that these (<hi>viz. Christ</hi> and his Apostles, &amp;c.) confirming their Doctrine, gave Infallible Testimony, that what they taught, was the <hi>Immediate Revelation</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of God, whereas the Motives, which confirme the <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church, do onely shew, that she <hi>Infallibly</hi> delivers to us <hi>the same Revelations</hi> (I mean the <hi>same</hi> for sense and substance of Doctrine) which the other received <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> from God. And that to rest in this manner upon the Authority of the present Church, in the <hi>Resolution of our Faith,</hi> is not to prove <hi>Idem per Idem,</hi> (as the Bishop falsly imputes to us) I clearly shew by two several Instances, which even those of his party must of necessity allow.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The first Instance is of the Church in time of the Apostles. For who sees not, that a Sectary might in those dayes have argued against the Apostolical Church by the very same Method his Lordship here uses against the present Catholique Church? might he not have taxed those Christians of <hi>unreasonable proceeding</hi> in their belief, and have set it forth (as the Bishop does) thus? For, if you ask them why they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the whole Doctrine of the Apostles to be the sole True Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Faith, their answer is, because it is agreeable to the Doctrine of Christ. If you ask them how they know it to be so, they will produce the Words, Sentences, and Works of Christ, who taught it. But if you ask a third time, by what means they are assured, that those Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies do indeed make for them and their cause, or are really the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57798:38"/>
and Doctrine of Christ, they will not then have recourse to those Testimonies (or doctrine) but their final answer is, they know it to be so, because the present Apostolique Church doth witness it. And so by consequence prove <hi>Idem per Idem.</hi> Thus the Sectary.</p>
               <p>By which it is clear, that the Bishops objection against the present Roman Church (wherein he would seem to make a discovery of her Corruptions and Politique Interests) is equally applyable to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Apostolique Church in its undeniable purity. But at once to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer both the Bishops and Sectaries objection, I affirm, that <hi>the prime and precise reason</hi> to be given, why we believe the voice of the present Church, <hi>witnessing,</hi> or giving <hi>Assurance</hi> of Divine Revelation to us, is neither <hi>Scripture, Councils,</hi> nor <hi>Fathers,</hi> no, nor the <hi>Oral</hi> Doctrine of Christ himself, but the pregnant and convincing <hi>Motives</hi> of Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which moved both the Primitive Christians and us, in our respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive times, to believe the Church. Not that we are necessitated to <hi>resolve</hi> our Faith into the Motives, as its <hi>Formal Object,</hi> or <hi>ultimate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of Assent, (for that can be no other, then the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing) but as into <hi>most certain</hi> Inducements, powerfully and prudently inclining our will, to accept the present Church as the <hi>Infallible Organ</hi> ordained by <hi>Divine Authority</hi> to teach us the <hi>sure</hi> way of salvation.</p>
               <p>The second Instance is <hi>ad hominem,</hi> against the Bishop, in relation to those <hi>Fundamental</hi> Truths, wherein he confesses the whole Church neither doth nor can erre. For, suppose a Separatist should thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with his Lordship, your Doctrine concerning the Infallibility of the Church in <hi>Fundamentals</hi> is most <hi>unreasonable.</hi> For, if a man ask you, why you believe all those points, which you hold for <hi>Fundamental</hi> (for example <hi>the Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> and <hi>life everlasting</hi>) your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer will be, because they are agreeable to the Doctrine and Tradition of Christ. And if you be asked, how <hi>you know them to be so,</hi> you will (no doubt) produce the <hi>Words, Sentences,</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of Christ, who taught the said <hi>Fundamental</hi> points. But if he ask you a third time, by <hi>what means</hi> you are assured, that those <hi>Testimonies</hi> do make for you, or are indeed the <hi>Words, Sentences,</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of Christ, you will not then have recourse to the <hi>Testimonies</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> themselves (that is, to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) but your <hi>final Answer</hi> will be, you <hi>know them to be so,</hi> and that they <hi>do make for you,</hi> because <hi>the present</hi> Church doth Infallibly witness so much to you from Tradition, and according to Tradition: which is to prove <hi>Idem per Idem,</hi> as much as we.</p>
               <p>And if the said Separatist, further enquiring about the precedent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of <hi>Scriptures, Councils, Fathers, Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> himself (while he lived on Earth) shall ask, why such <hi>Fundamentals</hi> are believed upon the sole Authority of the <hi>Present</hi> Church, as <hi>the last Testimony Infallibly assuring,</hi> that those <hi>Fundamental</hi> Points, and all the precedent Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of them, are from God, 'tis evident, the Bishops party has no other way to avoid a Circle, but by answering, they believe the Scriptures, Councils, &amp;c. by reason of the Convincing Motives of Credibility, powerfully inducing and inclining the will to accept <hi>the Present</hi> Church, as the <hi>Infallible Organ,</hi> Ordain'd by <hi>Divine Authority</hi> to teach us. Which Infallibity must come from the Holy Ghost, and be more then <hi>Humane</hi> or <hi>Moral;</hi> and therefore must be truly <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57798:39"/>
and proceed from Gods most absolute and Divine Veracity, (in fulfilling his Promises) as from its <hi>Radical Principle,</hi> and from the <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the Holy Ghost, as the <hi>immediate Cause,</hi> preserving the Church from errour in all such points.</p>
               <p>Thus we are easily got out of the Circle, leaving the Bishop still tumbling himself in it. For we do not finally rest on <hi>the Present Church,</hi> as consisting of men subject to errour, as his Lordship vainly suggests: Nor do we rest upon the Motives of Credibility as the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Object</hi> of our Faith, but as inducing us to rely on the said Church, ordain'd by <hi>Divine Authority</hi> to teach us; and is consequently <hi>Infallible.</hi> Whereas the Bishop does but dance in a <hi>Round,</hi> while enquiring for some <hi>Infallible</hi> warrant of the <hi>Word</hi> of God, he thus concludes, pag. 66. <hi>'Tis agreed on by me, it can be nothing but the Word of God;</hi> which must needs end in an apparent Circle, as proving <hi>Idem per Idem.</hi> And whereas immediately after he runs on prolixly, in Distinguishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gods <hi>written</hi> and <hi>unwritten</hi> Word, as though he would make the <hi>latter</hi> serve for Infallible proof of <hi>the former,</hi> he never reflects, that the said <hi>latter, viz.</hi> Gods <hi>unwritten</hi> Word, does necessarily stand in as much need of proof as the former.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the Authority of the Church, of which the Motives of Credibility do ascertain us, 'tis not necessary, that it be esteem'd or stiled <hi>absolutely Divine,</hi> as the Bishop would have it: yet as <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 6.</note> to this purpose, and so far as concerns <hi>precise Infallibility,</hi> or <hi>certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion</hi> with Truth, it is so truly <hi>supernatural</hi> and <hi>certain,</hi> that in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it yields nothing to the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self; I mean in respect of the <hi>precise Infallibility</hi> and <hi>absolute veracity</hi> of whatsoever it Declares and Testifies to be matter of Divine Faith: though in many other respects we do not deny, but the Authority of the Church is much <hi>inferiour</hi> to that of Scripture. For first, the Holy Scripture hath a larger extent of Truth; because <hi>there</hi> not onely every reason, but every word and tittle is matter of Faith, at least <hi>implicitely,</hi> and necessarily to be believ'd by all that know it to be a part of Scripture: but in the Definitions of the Church neither the Arguments, Reasons, nor Words are, absolutely speaking, matters of Faith, but onely <hi>the Thing Declared</hi> to be such. Besides, the Church has certain limits, and can Define nothing, but what was either Reveal'd before, or hath such connexion with it, as it may be Rationally and Logically deduced from it, as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Declaration and Defence of that which was before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. Moreover the Church hath <hi>the Receiving</hi> and <hi>Interpreting</hi> of Scripture for its <hi>End,</hi> and consequently is in that respect <hi>inferiour</hi> to it. Hence it is, that Holy Scripture is <hi>per Excellentiam</hi> called <hi>the Word of God</hi> and <hi>Divine:</hi> whereas the Testimony of the Church is onely said by Catholique Divines (and in particular by <hi>A. C.</hi>) <hi>IN SOME SORT,</hi> or <hi>IN A MANNER Divine.</hi> By which manner of speaking, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is not to deny it to be <hi>equal</hi> even to <hi>Scripture</hi> it self in point of <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but onely to shew the Prerogatives of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture above the Definitions of the Church.</p>
               <p>Adde, that although we hold it necessary (and therein agree with our Adversary) that we are to <hi>believe</hi> the Scriptures to be the word of God, <hi>upon DIVINE Authority;</hi> yet standnig precisely in what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57798:39"/>
by <hi>Mr. Fisher,</hi> pag. 59. (<hi>How the Bishop knew Scripture to be Scripture</hi>) there will be no necessity of Defending the Churches Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be <hi>simply Divine.</hi> For if it be but <hi>Infallible by the promised Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the Holy Ghost, it must give such <hi>Assurance</hi> that whatever is Defined by it to be Scripture is <hi>most certainly Scripture,</hi> that no Christian can doubt of it without Mortal Sin, and shaking the Foundation of Christian Faith, as hath been often Declared.</p>
               <p>And the immediate reason, why the Authority teaching Scripture to be the Word of God, must be <hi>absolutely Infallible,</hi> is because it is an Article of Christian Faith, that all those Books, which the Church has Defined for Canonical Scripture, are the Word of God; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Article of Faith must be <hi>Reveal'd,</hi> or taught by <hi>Divine</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, this also must be so revealed; and consequently no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty less then <hi>Divine,</hi> is sufficient to move us to believe it as <hi>an Article of Faith.</hi> Now it is to be remembred, (and <hi>A. C.</hi> notes it pag. 49, 50.) that the <hi>Prime Authority,</hi> for which we believe Scripture to be the Word of God, is <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> or the <hi>unwritten Word</hi> of God; which moves us (as <hi>the formal Object</hi> of our Faith) to believe that Scripture is the <hi>Written</hi> Word of God; and the Definition of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church, <hi>assuring us Infallibly</hi> that there is such a Tradition, applies this Article of our Faith unto us, as it does all the rest, whether the Voice, or Definition of the Present Church <hi>in it self</hi> be <hi>absolutely Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> or no. Neither can there be shew'n any more difficulty in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>this</hi> as an <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> upon the Infallible Declaration of the Church, then in believing <hi>any other</hi> Apostolical Tradition whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, upon the like Declaration.</p>
               <p>His Lordships Argument, (<hi>that the whole may erre, because every part may erre</hi>) is disproved by himself; because <hi>in Fundamentals</hi> he grants the whole Church <hi>cannot erre,</hi> and yet that any particular man may erre, even in those points. Wherefore he must needs agree with us in this, that the perfection of <hi>Infallibility</hi> may be applied to the whole Church, though not to every particular Member thereof.</p>
               <p>Now further concerning the Churches <hi>Infallibility,</hi> though she be so tyed to <hi>means,</hi> as that she is bound to use them, yet in her Definitions she receives not her <hi>Infallibility</hi> from the <hi>Means,</hi> (as the Bishop must also affirm of his <hi>Fundamentals</hi>) but from the assistance of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> promised to the Church: which makes her Definitions truly <hi>Infallible,</hi> though they be not <hi>New Revelations,</hi> but onely Declarations of what was formerly Revealed. For, as the <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> it self is for no other reason <hi>Infallible,</hi> but because it proceeds from God; and in case it should happen to be <hi>not true</hi> and <hi>Certain,</hi> the Errour would be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God: So in the Definitions of the Church, if she should fall into Errour, it would likewise be ascrib'd to God himself.</p>
               <p>Neither is it necessary for us to affirm, that the Definition of the Church is Gods <hi>immediate Revelation;</hi> as, if the Definition were false, Gods <hi>Revelation</hi> must be also <hi>such:</hi> It is enough for us to averre, that <hi>Gods promise would be infring'd;</hi> as truly it would in that Supposition. For did he not so preserve his Church in her Definitions of Faith (by <hi>Assistance</hi> of the Holy Ghost) as that she should never Define any thing for a point of Catholick Faith, which were not <hi>Revealed</hi> from God, it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57798:40"/>
would imply a destruction of Gods <hi>veracity,</hi> and make him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. All which Doctrine is so well grounded on Christs Promise, assuring us he will alwayes assist his Church, that the Bishop has little reason to accuse us of <hi>rather maintaining a party, then seeking Truth:</hi> as though we set Doctrines on foot to foment Division, and were rather lead by <hi>Animosity,</hi> then <hi>Reason.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. THe Bishop having been hardly put to it in the precedent Chapter, to finde some way, whereby to prove Scripture to be <hi>the Word</hi> of God, he continually treading on the brink of a <hi>Circle,</hi> at length falls on the <hi>unwritten Word.</hi> It seems he is afraid, he shall be forc'd to come stooping to the Church to shew it him, and finally depend on her Authority. But being loath to trust her, he grows so wary, that hee'l admit no <hi>unwritten word,</hi> but what is <hi>shew'n him deliver'd</hi> by the Prophets and Apostles. Would he read it in their Books? Now if you hearken to his Discourse, he presently cryes out, he <hi>cannot swallow into his belief that every thing which his Adversary sayes is the unwritten word of God, is so indeed.</hi> Nor is it our desire he should. But we crave the indifferent Readers Patience to hear reason.</p>
               <p>According to which it is apparent, that there must be some Authority to <hi>assure</hi> us of this main Principle of Faith, <hi>that Scripture is the Word of God.</hi> This our <hi>Ensurancer</hi> is Apostolical Tradition: and well may it be so: for such Tradition Declared by the Church, is the <hi>unwritten Word</hi> of God. We do not pretend (as the Bishop objects) that every Doctrine, which any particular Person, as <hi>A. C. Bellarmin,</hi> or other private Doctour, may please to call <hi>Tradition,</hi> is therefore to be receiv'd as Gods <hi>unwritten Word;</hi> but such Doctrinal <hi>Traditions</hi> onely, as are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to us by the Church for truly Apostolical; which are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Gods <hi>unwritten word.</hi> Of which kinde are those, which not I,

It is so natural to Protestants to build upon false grounds, that they cannot enter into a question without supposing a Falshood; so his Lordship here feeds his humour, and obtrudes many. He makes <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi> and all Catholique Doctours maintain, that whatever they please to call <hi>Tradition,</hi> must presently be received by all as Gods <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Word.</hi> After, he keeps a fluttering between <hi>Tradition,</hi> and the <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> asking, if they be <hi>Convertible Terms;</hi> and then whether any <hi>Word</hi> of God be <hi>unwritten,</hi> &amp;c. Which digressive Discourse is nothing, but a new Turn in his Labyrinth, to avoid the foil he foresaw himself in danger of, in case he did here grapple with <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> who clearly delivers his Doctrine in the place cited by the Bishop, cap. 2. <hi>viz.</hi> That the word <hi>Tradition</hi> is general, and signifies any Doctrine communicated <hi>from one to another,</hi> whether it be <hi>written</hi> or <hi>unwritten.</hi> By which 'tis evident, he makes not <hi>Tradition</hi> and the <hi>unwritten Word</hi> of God Convertible. Afterwards he divides <hi>Traditions</hi> into <hi>Divine, Apostolical,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical:</hi> and again into <hi>Traditions</hi> belonging to <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Traditions</hi> belonging to <hi>Manners.</hi> So that according to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> 'tis clear, there are some <hi>Traditions,</hi> which are not Gods <hi>unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word.</hi> Nevertheless <hi>Bellarmin, A. C.</hi> and all Catholiques agree against the Bishop, that we believe by <hi>Divine</hi> Faith <hi>that Scripture is Gods Word,</hi> and that there is no other <hi>Word of God</hi> to <hi>assure</hi> us of this point, but the <hi>Tradition</hi> deliver'd to us by the Church; and that such <hi>Tradition</hi> so delivered must be the <hi>unwritten Word</hi> of God. I say <hi>such Tradition;</hi> for that we admit in practise divers <hi>Ecclesiastical Traditions,</hi> but neither in quality of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> or <hi>Divine Traditions:</hi> nor are any of them contrary to <hi>the Word of God,</hi> whether <hi>written</hi> or <hi>unwritten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now to return to his Lordship we grant, there are many <hi>unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Words</hi> of God, never deliver'd over to the Church, for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; and that there are many <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Church, which are not the <hi>unwritten</hi> word of God; yet not contrary to it. Wherefore his Lordship might herein have spared his labour, since he proves but what we grant. And if the Church hath received by <hi>Tradition</hi> some <hi>Words</hi> of Christ <hi>not written,</hi> as well as <hi>written,</hi> and hath delivered them by <hi>Tradition</hi> to her Children, such <hi>written</hi> and <hi>unwritten</hi> Word of God cannot be contrary to one another. For as the Church was <hi>Infallible</hi> in Defining what was <hi>written,</hi> so is she also <hi>Infallible</hi> in Defining what was not <hi>written.</hi> And so she can neither <hi>tradere non traditum,</hi> (as the Bishop urgeth) that is, <hi>make Tradition of that, which was not deliver'd to her;</hi> nor can she be <hi>unfaithful</hi> to God in not faithfully keeping the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum</hi> committed to her Trust. Neither can <hi>her Sons</hi> ever justly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse her of the contrary, (as he insinuates, they may) but are bound to believe her <hi>Tradition,</hi> because she being <hi>Infallible,</hi> the <hi>Tradition</hi> she deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, can never be against <hi>the Word of their Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whereas the Bishop so confidently averrs, that <hi>whereever Christ held his peace, and that his words are not registred, no man may dare without rashness to say they were THESE or THESE,</hi> his Lordship must give me leave to tell him, I must binde up his whole Assertion with this <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, But according as the Church shall declare:</hi> for it is her Authority whereon we depend to know, when and in what Christ held his peace, or whether <hi>his words,</hi> some or none, were <hi>registred;</hi> as much, as we
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57798:41"/>
depend on her to know, <hi>whether Scripture be the Word of God,</hi> or not. This our proceeding does unqestionably free us from all shadow of <hi>rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Neither doth St. <hi>Augustin</hi> say any thing in contradiction hereof. For he onely speaks against determining of a mans own head, what was spoken by Christ, without ground or warrant from the Church. In like manner we grant, <hi>there were many unwritten Words</hi> of God, which were never deliver'd over to the Church, and therefore never esteem'd <hi>Tradition:</hi> As there are many <hi>Traditions,</hi> according to <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> which we cannot own for Gods <hi>unwritten Word;</hi> yet all such as the Church receives, are conformable, at least <hi>not contrary</hi> to his <hi>Word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or unwritten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such are the Ceremonies used in Baptisme, of which the Relatour here speaketh. For the party to be baptiz'd is <hi>Anointed,</hi> to signifie, that like a <hi>Wrestler</hi> he is to enter the list. So St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">D. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost. Hom <hi>6.</hi> in cap. <hi>2.</hi> ad Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loss.</note> 
                  <hi>Inungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur baptizandus more Athletarum, qui stadium jam ingressuri sunt. Spittle</hi> is applied to their Ears and Nostrils, as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">D. Ambros. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> saith in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that our Saviour did, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. who <hi>spitting</hi> touched the tongue, and put his Fingers into the <hi>ears</hi> of the deaf and dumb man, before he cured him. The like he did (<hi>John</hi> 9. 3.) to the blinde man: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Ceremonies are conformable to Scripture. Three <hi>Dippings</hi> were used in Baptisme to signifie the <hi>Three Persons</hi> of the Blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; or our Saviours remaining for <hi>three dayes</hi> in the Sepulcher, as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">D. Gregor. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Epist. <hi>41.</hi> ad Leandr.</note> teacheth. But this Ceremony is not us'd at all times, nor in all places, as being not <hi>absolutely</hi> commanded by the Church. Wherefore <note n="d" place="margin">Bellarm. de verb. Dei non script. cap. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> (who proveth the Ceremonies us'd in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme to be Apostolical <hi>Traditions</hi>) sayes not, that <hi>every Tradition</hi> is Gods <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> but that we must necessarily believe Scripture to be <hi>the Word of God:</hi> which seeing we cannot believe for any <hi>written</hi> Word of his, we must either admit some Word of God <hi>not written,</hi> to ground this our Belief on, (which can be no other then <hi>Apostolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> applied to us by the voice of the Church) or we shall have no <hi>Divine Faith</hi> at all of this point; because all <hi>Divine Faith</hi> must relie upon some <hi>Word</hi> of God. The Bishop therefore hath no reason to go on with his <hi>Enquiry;</hi> but must either fix here, or he will finde no firm ground whereon to rest his foot: as will appear both by the other wayes of <hi>Resolving</hi> Faith by him confuted; and by his own, which is every whit as confutable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the second way of proving Scripture to be <hi>the Word</hi> of God, to wit, that it should be fully and sufficiently known, as by Divine and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 10. p. 69.</note> Testimony, <hi>lumine proprio,</hi> by the sole resplendency of the light it hath <hi>in it self,</hi> and by the witness it can so give <hi>to it self;</hi> this the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour himself sufficiently confutes, and we agree with him in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation. However though the Bishop knew full well, that we deny this Doctrine <hi>of knowing Scripture for Gods Word by its own light,</hi> as much as himself or any of his party can do, yet, as it were to justifie the more my late accusation of his obtruding Falshoods to asperse us, he will needs suppose another here, <hi>viz.</hi> that the said Doctrine may well agree with our grounds, in regard we hold (if you will believe him) That Tradition may be known for Gods Word <hi>by its own Light;</hi> and consequently the like may be said of Scripture. Which Inference
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57798:42"/>
indeed would be true, were it not drawn from a false supposition; as most certainly it is. For all Catholicks hold it ridiculous, to believe, that either Scripture or Tradition is discernable for Gods Word by its own Lustre.</p>
               <p>Nor is <hi>A. C.</hi> justly accusable in this point, as the Bishop would make him, by misconstruing his words to signifie, that Tradition is discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>by its own Light</hi> to be <hi>the Word</hi> of God. For <hi>A. C's</hi> words, even as they are lamely cited by the Bishop, do sufficiently vindicate him <note place="margin">Ibidem. pag. 71.</note> from having any such meaning, as his Lordship would impose on him. The cited words are these, <hi>Tradition of the Church is of a company which by its own light shews it self to be Infallibly assisted, &amp;c.</hi> where any man may easily see, that the word <hi>which</hi> must properly relate to the immediate preceding word <hi>company,</hi> even to make sense, and not to the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote word <hi>Tradition.</hi> 'Tis therefore clear, that <hi>A. C's</hi> Intention is onely to affirm, that the Church is known by her <hi>Motives of Credibility,</hi> which ever accompany her, and may very properly be called <hi>her own Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As concerning the Question propounded by Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> to be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Dr. W.</hi> I finde not one word, of <hi>Tradition being known by its own light,</hi> in it. If therefore this Proposition, That <hi>a Tradition may be known to be such,</hi> (that is, to be <hi>Gods unwritten Word) by the light it hath in it self,</hi> be a matter to be made sport with, (as the Bishop sayes it is) we shall not grudge him the mirth he may have found in his own fiction. But before I leave this point, I desire the Reader to consider what the Relatour grants, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Church now admits of St. <hi>James and St.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. pag. 70.pag. 16. num. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Jude's Epistles, and the Apocalypse, which were not received for divers years, after the rest of the New Testament:</hi> Yet would he elsewhere conclude against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  in receiving more Books into the Canon, then were received in <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his time. But if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, some Books are now to be admitted <hi>without errour</hi> for Canonical, which were not <hi>alwayes acknowledged</hi> to be such, certainly without errour also, and upon the same Authority, some Books may <hi>now</hi> be received into the Canon, which were not so in <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his time. But this onely by way of Digression.</p>
               <p>As for the third way of proving Scripture to be Gods word, to wit, by <hi>the Private Spirit,</hi> 'tis true, the Bishop professes to reject <hi>the Phrensie,</hi> as he calls it, of <hi>Private Revelation,</hi> (except in some extraordinary Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances) both as a thing that would render a man obnoxious to all the whisperings of <hi>a seducing Private Spirit,</hi> and from whence can be <note place="margin">num. 12. pag. 74.</note> drawn no proof to others, <hi>being</hi> (as he sayes) <hi>neither seen, nor felt of any, but him that hath it:</hi> Yet concerning this point he delivers himself in such a roving way of discourse, as signifies nothing in effect, to what he would seem to drive at; and so leaves the Reader wholly unsatisfied, how to prove Scripture to be the Word of God Infallibly, without recourse, at last, to <hi>the Private Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was it possible for him to free himself from that Imputation, of recurring to the <hi>Private Spirit,</hi> against any that should press the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness home, notwithstanding his Brags to the contrary, and his Thanks to <hi>A. C.</hi> whose imperfectly-cited words he would fain improve to a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> himself from necessity of recurring to the <hi>Private Spirit:</hi> which is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57798:42"/>
opposite to <hi>A. C's</hi> meaning, who thus urges against him by name of the Chaplain. <hi>The Chaplain therefore, who, as it seems, will not admit Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be in any sort Divine and Infallible, while it introduces the Belief of Scripture to be Divine Books, cannot sufficiently defend the Faith introduced of that point to be Infallible, unless he admit an Infallible Impulsion of the Private Spirit EX PARTE SUBJECTI, without any Infallible suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently applied Reason EX PARTE OBJECTI, which he seemeth not, nor hath reason to do,</hi> &amp;c. Now I leave it to any Indifferent mans judgement, whether the sense of those words be not this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Chaplain, or Bishop, <hi>seems</hi> indeed to reject <hi>the Private Spirit,</hi> and hath <hi>reason</hi> so to do: yet since he admits not <hi>Tradition</hi> to be in any sort <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> he cannot sufficiently defend the Faith of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures being <hi>the Word of God</hi> to be Infallible, unless he admit an <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Impulsion of the Private Spirit.</hi> But this part of <hi>A. C.'s</hi> Speech his Lordship very prudently supprest, to make way for a perversion of the other part: which taken both together signifie no less then what I have said, That the Bishop professeth to reject the Doctrine of the <hi>Private Spirit,</hi> yet neither did, nor could prove Scripture to be the Word of God <hi>Infallibly,</hi> without recourse to <hi>Private Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. However, the Bishop was so far from avowedly countenancing this opinion, that he chose rather to seem ignorant, then freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that any Protestant did hold it. For he grants no more, then that <hi>either</hi> some do think, there is no other sufficient Warrant for this, then <note place="margin">num. 11. pag. 72.</note>

                     <hi>Principles,</hi> which cannot be proved; if even in the Mathematiques, <hi>where are the exactest Demonstrations,</hi> there be <hi>quaedam postulata, some things to be first demanded and granted, before the Demonstration can proceed,</hi> who can justly deny that to Divinity, (<hi>a Science of the highest object</hi>) which he easily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <q>
                     <hi>Heath.</hi> I did not think to finde your Lordship so disingenuous, as not onely to contradict your self, by unsaying all that you had said before by way of proof upon the Account of Naturall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but to put so gross a fallacy upon me: That because <hi>Naturall Sciences</hi> admit some <hi>Principles</hi> without proof, as being so clear in themselves, that there needs no more then the bare apprehension of their tearms; therefore in Reason <hi>the Bible</hi> must be supposed for Gods word, and admitted, without probation, for <hi>an unquestionable Principle.</hi> May not any Religion pretend the like? The Turks for example; may they not say their <hi>Alcoran</hi> is the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and consequently unquestionable? You know very well, and confess it too elsewhere, <hi>That the Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi>

                     <hi>Knowledge appear manifest by intuitive light of understanding.</hi> And you know as well, that there is an infinite disparity in the case, between such <hi>Principles</hi> and your <hi>Bible.</hi> The later having exercis'd the wit and learning of a world of <hi>Expositors,</hi> in regard of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity; and the former being uncapable of proof, by reason of their evident clearness. I may therefore rationally conclude, that your Bible cannot justly challenge an infallible Belief of being
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57798:44"/>
Gods word, by conviction of <hi>Natur all Reason.</hi> This was my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of your Bible before I met you; and I am now more confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it by your Lordships discourse: of whom I take my leave.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this Interlocutory Discourse of the <hi>Bishop</hi> with the <hi>Heathen,</hi> (wherein I have not wrong'd him, by either falsly imposing on him, or dissembling the force of his Arguments) a man may easily discern, how irrationall it is to take <hi>the Bible</hi> for <hi>the sole Rule</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith. A Doctrine, which had it been held in the Primitive Church, would have laid the World under an impossibility of ever being converted to Christianity. But now 'tis high time to return to our Church-Tradition; which I press a little further in this manner.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Child is brought up, and instructed in the Roman Church, till he arrives to some ripeness of years. Amongst other things, he is commanded to believe the Bible is the True word of God, that he must neither doubt of this, nor of any other Article of Faith, receiv'd universally amongst Christians. He gives therefore the same Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assent to the Scriptures being the word of God, that he gives to the other Articles of Faith; and so, without once looking into the Scripture, departs this life. I demand, had this Christian saving Faith, or not? if he had, then upon <hi>the Churches Authority</hi> he suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently believed the Scriptures to be the word of God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Churches Authority was sufficient to ground an Infallible Faith in this point. If he had not saving Faith in this Article, he could not have it in any of the rest; for he had them all from the very same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church. Therefore he had no saving Faith at all: <hi>Ergo,</hi> such a Christian could not be saved. Would his Lordship have ventured to affirm this?</p>
               <p>But let us suppose now, that this young Christian yet lives, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himself to study, makes progress in learning, becomes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Philosopher, a learned Divine, an expert Historian: then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himself (upon the Churches recommendation) to the reading of Scriptures; discovers a new light in them; and by force of that light, discerns also, that the Faith he had before was onely a humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, and that he had no divine Faith at all, before he found by that light in Scripture, that they were the undoubted word of God, and sole foundation of Faith: and consequently, that not having that foundation, he had no saving Faith of any Article of Christian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and for want thereof was out of the state of Salvation. What gripes and torture of spirit would spring out of such a Doctrine amongst Christians.</p>
               <p>Moreover, either the Church, whereof he is suppos'd a member, taught that he was to believe Scripture infallibly to be the word of God, upon her sole Tradition as an infallible Testimony thereof, (as we before supposed) or not. If the first, then he reflects, that this Church has plainly deceiv'd him: and if she have deceiv'd him in assuming that Infallibility to her self, and teaching him that by rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon her Authority he had saving Faith, when he had nothing but humane and uncertain perswasion, she had deceived all her other Subjects as well as himself, and consequently expos'd them all to the hazard of eternall damnation by following her Doctrine; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57798:45"/>
was no true Church, but a seducer and deceiver. Hence he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that her recommendation of Scripture is as much as nothing; and so at last is left to the sole letter of Scripture without any credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voyce of the Church; and then must either gather the Divine Authority of Scripture <hi>from sole Scripture,</hi> (which the Bishop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) or there will he no means left him to believe (even according to the Bishops principles) infallibly that Scripture is Divine and the true word of God.</p>
               <p>If the Church teach him onely, that her testimony of Scripture is no more then Humane and Fallible, but that <hi>the Belief it self</hi> that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is Gods word rests upon sole Scripture, as his Lordship speaks, <note place="margin">§. 16. n. 21. pag. 84.</note> he begins presently to consider, what then becomes of so many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Souls, who both in former and present times, either were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to read and examine Scripture, by reason of their want of learning, or made little use of that means, as assuring themselves to have infallible Faith without it? Had such Christians a morall and fallible perswasion onely, and no divine Faith? then they were all uncapable of salvation. This consequence seems very severe to our supposed Christian. Wherefore he begins to make a further reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and discourses in this manner; <q>Is the Tradition and Definition of the Church, touching the Divine Authority and Canon of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, onely Humane and Fallible, how then can I rationally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that my single perswasion of its being the word of God, is Divine and Infallible? The Bishops, Pastours, and Doctors of the Church have both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  and understood it upon the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of former Tradition, and thereby discover'd its Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority much more fully and exactly, then I alone am able to do. If therefore notwithstanding all their labour and exactness, their perswasion concerning Scriptures being <hi>Gods word,</hi> was onely Humane and Fallible, what reason have I to think, I am <hi>Divinely and Infallibly</hi> certain, by my reading of Scripture, that it is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth?</q>
               </p>
               <p>He goes on. <q>If the light of Scripture (on the other side) be so weak and dim, that it is not able to shew it self, unless first intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the recommendation of the Church, how came <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius, Huss, Wickless,</hi> &amp;c. to be so sharp-sighted, as to discover this light of Scripture, seeing they rejected the Authority of all visible Churches in the world, coexistent with them, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent immediately before them, and consequently of the true Church?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence he proceeds to a higher enquiry. <q>Had not (sayes he) the Ancient Primitive Fathers in the first three hundred years after Christ, as much reason and ability to finde this light in Scripture, as I can pretend to? Yet many Books, which seem to me to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themselves to be the word of God by that divine light which shines in them, sent no such light to their eyes, but were under que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion amongst them, whether they were the word of God or not, till they were declar'd such by the Catholique Church.

and press no other reason, notwithstanding they hold the Church may deceive us in the whole Canon of Scripture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Further, sayes this discoursing Christian, <q>If one, who hath not yet examin'd the light of Scripture it self, but onely taken it upon the account of <hi>Church-Tradition,</hi> should deny (for example) St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew's</hi> Gospel to be <hi>the written word of God,</hi> he could not, in this opinion, be counted an Heretique, because it was not sufficiently propounded to him to be Gods word. Nay hence it follows, that even our Blessed Saviour, who is Wisdom it self, would have been esteemed by all the world, not a wise Law-giver, but a meer Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus and Impostour. For had he not framed (think you) a strange and chimericall Common-wealth, were it alone destitute of a full and absolute power, (which all other well-ordered Republiques en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy) to give an Authentical and unquestionable Declaration, which is the genuine and true Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now he comes closer to the matter it self, and examines, how this pretended light should be <hi>Infallible</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> supposing the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Testimony of the Scriptures being Gods word was <hi>Humane</hi> onely and <hi>Fallible.</hi> 
                  <q>When I came (discourses he with himself) first to settle my thoughts to a serious reading of Scripture, I had no more then a <hi>fallible</hi> Authority recommending Scripture to me. That <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> Authority could be no Foundation, much less a <hi>Formall object</hi> for a Divine and Infallible assent to rest upon. Therefore before I thus began to read Scripture, I had no Infallible and Divine Faith, that it was the written word of God. The Tradition therefore of the Church to me was no more then a Tradition of wise, prudent, and honest men, who had no such assistance from God, as was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to preserve them from Errour. Suppose therefore, that as the Church might, so she had err'd in testifying some Books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be Gods word, which really are not such; in this supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I should have them all equally recommended to me as Gods word, by the very same Authority of the Church. Then I fall to reading seriously, and peruse all those which are call'd <hi>Canonicall Books</hi> in the Bible: shall I ever think, by my diligence in reading to discover, that the light of Gods word shines not in those Books wherein the Church err'd, as it shines in the rest? Shall I discern <hi>Canonicall</hi> Books wherein she err'd not, from the not-Canonicall, by the light I finde in them, when the whole Church, and so many thousand learned Bishops, who had read them more studiously and knowingly then I can do, never discern'd any such different light more in the one then in the other? But put case I were able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern this difference in Scripture by <hi>the sole light</hi> of Scripture, what follows? seeing the Church ha's as universally recommended also very many unwritten Traditions for <hi>Apostolicall</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some at least (as the not-rebaptizing of those who were Baptized by Heretiques, &amp;c.) are most certainly true, and as properly the word of God in their first delivery from Christ and his Apostles (which the Bishop confesses) as Scripture it self; why can I not, by that light, which shines in a true Apostolicall Tradition, as well distinguish it from a false one, as by the light that shines in a true
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57798:46"/>
Book of Canonicall Scripture, distinguish that from a false one: Since God speaks equally in both, why should there not be an equal light shining in both? Nay, seeing the Church, in the Definition of <hi>Superstructures</hi> (wherein his Lordship makes her fallible) very often defines aright, why may not I finde, by the light which shines in such a definition, that it is a Divine Truth, and distinguish it from that which is not the true voyce of God? and so take no other guide, or judge, to my self in Divine matters, then onely my own knowledge of God speaking to me?</q>

               <p>Here his Dedalian windings are disintricated, and his Reasons <note place="margin">§. 16. n. 19.</note> easily solv'd.

               <p>But what if this <hi>Singular-Plural</hi> sayes no such thing, as the words alledged by the Bishop signifie? would not this be a notable <hi>Turn?

               <p>His Lordships objection, <hi>That the Tradition of the present Church</hi>

                  <hi>must be as Infallible, as that of the Primitive,</hi> I distinguish.

               <p>Those <hi>two ends</hi> alone mentioned by the Relatour, fall short of <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> the end of Tradition; which not onely <hi>induces Infidels,</hi> and <hi>instructs Novices</hi> and weaklings, but <hi>founds</hi> and <hi>establishes</hi> Believers, even the greatest Doctors in the Church. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> was neither Infidell, Novice, Weakling, nor Doubter in the Faith, but the very learnedst of Bishops and Doctors: yet it serv'd him so much, that he would not have believ'd, no nor could believe Scripture without it, as he himself testifies of himself in the place above cited, <hi>contr.

                  <hi>viz.</hi> that we are <hi>first and more bound</hi> to believe the Church, then the Gospel, it is not altogether true.

                  <hi>Locis. cap.</hi> 8. treats (as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> did) how one comes to believe, who hath no belief in the Scripture, and resolves, that this must be done by the Authority of the Church; and that such as reject the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57798:47"/>
Churches Authority, can never believe the Scripture. Hence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently asserts <hi>sive Infideles, sive in fide Novicii,</hi> &amp;c. that Infidels and Novices in the Faith are brought to the belief of Scripture by this means. But here's the <hi>Turn.</hi> He cites <hi>sive Infideles, sive in fide Novicii</hi> lamely, without a Verb, or any full sense, thinking thereby to perswade his Reader, that the Church induces onely such to read Scriptures, by a <hi>fallible</hi> authority, and that all their <hi>Infallible</hi> Faith of Scripture streams from the pretended light that is in Scripture. Whereas if he had cited the whole Sentence, it would have appear'd most clearly, that <hi>Canus</hi> makes Infidels and Novices in Faith so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd to believe Scripture for the Infallible word of God, by the authority of the Church, that the said authority is not a <hi>fallible,</hi> but a <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>sure</hi> way to make them believe it. For he asserts, that an Infidel is <hi>victus</hi> (convinc'd) by that Authority; that it is <hi>via certa</hi> (a sure and <hi>certain</hi> way) and that we take <hi>argumentum certum</hi> (a <hi>certain</hi> and assured argument of this) from the Churches Authority.</p>
               <p>Again, by this citing of <hi>Nominatives</hi> without <hi>Verbs,</hi> he puts off, by a <hi>nimble Turn,</hi> the esteem that <hi>Infideles &amp; Novicii</hi> make of the Churches Authority in regard of Scripture: <hi>sive Infideles, sive in fide Novicii, ad sacras literas ingrediantur,</hi> the Churches Authority is <hi>a sure way, and none but that.</hi> Observe I pray you, those words, <hi>None but that;</hi> whereby he excludes all others, and consequenly this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Light of Scripture it self, from being a <hi>sure</hi> and infallible way of <hi>entring into the Scriptures,</hi> that is, of beginning to believe them expresly to be the word of God. This <hi>Verb</hi> therefore (<hi>ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diantur</hi>) which was omitted, would have given light to <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                  </hi> his full meaning? For though the greatest Doctours of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Scriptures upon this sole Authority, as a <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>infallible foundation,</hi> yet onely <hi>Infideles &amp; Novicii</hi> (Infidels and Novices in Faith) <hi>enter into Scriptures,</hi> that is, make their first beginning to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, by the same authority. As for <hi>Stapleton,</hi> he never so much as mentions, in the cited place, this Text of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> but <note place="margin">Relect. Contr. <hi>4.</hi> q. <hi>1.</hi> art. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> onely averres, that nothing can be prov'd from Scripture against such an one, as is either <hi>ignorant</hi> of Scripture, or <hi>denies</hi> it.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Augustin</hi> therefore in this place, speaking (according to those cited Authors) of a <hi>sure way</hi> for believing Scripture to be the word of God, cannot possibly favour the Bishops assertion, who makes the Authority of the Church in this case to be but fallible and unsure. Neither doth this great Doctour any where affirm, that this way of Church authority is <hi>onely for Infidels,</hi> (as the Bishops explication of him seems to insinuate) but both affirms and proves, that neither <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels</hi> nor <hi>Believers</hi> can be any other way convinc'd. When therefore his Lordship cites St. <hi>Augustins</hi> Text, <hi>Quibus ergo obtemper avi dicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus CREDITE EVANGELIO,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Whom therefore I have obeyed, saying, BELIEVE THE GOSPEL,</hi> &amp;c.) and thence gathers, that St. <hi>Augustin speaks of himself when he did not believe,</hi> I see very little consequence in this his Illation, unless he suppose, that Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> never obeyed this command of Gods Church, but onely at his first Conversion from Infidelity. For certainly his meaning was, that he had, and did alwayes, even till that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57798:48"/>
from his first Conversion, obey that command of the Church.</p>
               <p>One thing (I am sure) may be far better inferr'd from those words, against the Relatour, then this was against us. For St. <hi>Augustin</hi> sayes not, <hi>Quibus obtemperavi dicentibus, LEGITE EVANGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIUM, vel INSPICITE EVANGELIUM,</hi> &amp;c. whom I obeyed saying, <hi>Read the Gospel,</hi> or <hi>persue the Gospel</hi>) but <hi>Credite Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio,</hi> (believe the Gospel.) The Church commanded St. <hi>Augustin</hi> to believe the Gospel. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Church in St. <hi>Augustins</hi> time esteem'd her self most undoubtedly <hi>certain</hi> that the Gospel (and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence all other Scriptures, which she recommended to her children to believe) were the Infallible word of God. For otherwise to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a command of so high a nature in that wherein she might be deceiv'd her self, and deceive them, had been to expose her Authority to the hazard of commanding Christians to do that, which had been a grievous injury to God; namely to believe that to be his Divine Word; which was onely the word of man.</p>

Secondly, how few will be able to come to the sight of them? Thirdly, what certainty have we that they are the Authenticall <hi>Autographa's,</hi> but by Tradition? Fourthly, may not every Universall Tradition be carried up, as clearly at east, to the Apostles times, as the Scriptures, by most credible Authors, who wrote in their respective succeeding ages?</p>
               <p>If therefore, when he sayes <hi>there's a double Authority, &amp;c.</hi> he mean <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 21.</note> onely, that in the Apostles time Christians had a <hi>double Authority</hi> to believe Scripture, <hi>viz. Tradition</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> it self, he brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the present purpose: for our dispute is not of that, but of <hi>Our present</hi> time. If he say we have <hi>now</hi> that <hi>double Authority,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himself, and puts a foundation of our Faith beside Scripture, and so denies that <hi>Scripture alone is the foundation of our Faith.</hi> Yet it seems by speaking in the present Tense, <hi>Here's a double Authority,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>that confirms Scripture to be the word of God,</hi> he means that we have <hi>now</hi> both Apostolicall Tradition and Scripture it self, as two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, and each containing, the <hi>Formal Object</hi> of Faith, to believe Scripture to be the word of God: which is also sutable to his words §. 16. <hi>num.</hi> 22. <hi>We resolve,</hi> (saith he, meaning Faith) <hi>into Prime Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Apostolicall and Scriptures it self;</hi> and yet confesses we have no means to be <hi>infallibly certain</hi> that Scripture is the word of God, but by the Testimony of Church-Tradition. He would fain have the difference betwixt us to consist onely in this, that we affirm Church-Traditions to be the <hi>Formal Object, Prime Motive,</hi> and <hi>last Resolution</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and that they deny it to be so. But the difference (as it appears in the Resolution we have already given) is not in that. For <note place="margin">Chap. 5. num. 1, 2.</note> we are now both agreed, that it is not necessary to say, the Faith of Scripture is resolv'd into the Tradition of the present Church as its <hi>Formall Object,</hi> or <hi>Prime Motive, &amp;c.</hi> but the onely substantiall Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is this: We say the Tradition of the present Church is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and that necessarily, to the end it may <hi>infallibly</hi> apply the <hi>Formal Object</hi> to us; you say, 'tis Fallible. Grant us once, that the Tradition of the Church is Infallible, and the controversie in this is ended.</p>
               <p>How our Antagonist can resolve his Faith (as here he speaks) <hi>into</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>the Prime Apostostolical Tradition</hi> Infallibly, without the Infallibility of the present Church, I see not, unless he could tell how to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly certain of that Tradition, without it; which he knows not well how to compass, as appears in the next number. So that now he abandons his Fort again, by not shewing how we can know <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly</hi> that Apostolicall Tradition is <hi>Divine,</hi> otherwise then by the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57798:49"/>
Tradition of the present Church. For as to what he asserted <hi>num.</hi> 21. that <hi>there's a double Authority,</hi> and both <hi>Divine, viz.</hi> Apostolical Tradition and Scripture, even in respect of us, it doth not satisfie the difficulty, as I have prov'd, but serves onely to make one contrary <hi>Turn</hi> upon another in his Labyrinth, so that you know not where to follow him. For if Church-Tradition fail to ascertain us <hi>infallibly</hi> of that Divine Apostolicall Tradition, we are left without all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine certainty whether Scripture it self be the Infallible word of God, or no.</p>
               <p>That the Authority then of the present Church is Infallible, may be thus sufficiently prov'd. We cannot be <hi>infallibly</hi> certaine that Scripture is the word of God, unless the Authority of the present Church be Infallible. For we acknowledge many Books for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scripture, which Protestants admit not; and they <hi>now</hi> hold some for such, which have not been <hi>alwayes</hi> approv'd for such. And those Books of Scripture which Protestants have, are said by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques to be corrupted. Others also cry up some Books for Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Scripture, which both Catholiques and Protestants disallow. If therefore the Church can erre in this point, with what shadow of truth can <hi>Protestants</hi> pretend to bring an Infallible ground, that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the word of God? The Tradition therefore of the Church serves to assure us <hi>infallibly,</hi> that Scripture is the word of God, and not onely (as his Lordship would have it) <hi>to work upon the mindes of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 16. n. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>unbelievers, to move them to read and consider the Scripture, or among Novices, Weaklings, and Doubters of Faith, to instruct and confirme them, till they may acquaint themselves with, and understand the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither can the often cited place of St. <hi>Austin, I would not believe the Gospel,</hi> &amp;c. be rationally understood of the foresaid <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, Weaklings,</hi> and <hi>Doubters in the Faith.</hi> For it is clear, that St. <hi>Austin,</hi> by those words, gives a reason, why he, then a Bishop, would not follow the Doctrine of <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> and why no Christian ought to follow it. As if a man should say, he that believes the Gospel, believes it onely for the Authority of the Church; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> it is impossible (rationally proceeding) to admit the Gospel and follow <hi>Manichaeus.</hi> Neither is the contrary any wayes deducible out of those words cited by the Bishop §. 16. <hi>num.</hi> 21. <hi>If thou shouldst finde one, who did not yet believe the Gospel, what wouldst thou do to make him believe?</hi> For the holy Doctor there speaks to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichaeus,</hi> and shewes, how neither <hi>Infidels,</hi> nor <hi>Christians</hi> had reason to believe the Apostleship of <hi>Manicheus:</hi> Not Infidels; because <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi> proves this onely out of Scriptures, which they not admitting, might rationally enough slight his proof: Not Christians, because they receiving the Scripture upon the sole Authority of the Church, could no more approve of the Apostleship of <hi>Manicheus</hi> condemned by the Church, then if they admitted not of Scripture at all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>A. C.</hi> had no reason to pass by this place of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> which his Lordship sayes (pag. 82.) <hi>he urged at the Conference,</hi> unless it were, because he did not then remember it.</p>
               <p>As for the Catholique Authors cited by the Relatour, certainly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57798:49"/>
they all hold, that the Authority of the present Church is an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof, that Scripture is the word of God. And though they teach, that the fore-mentioned place of St. <hi>Austin</hi> is of force for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, Novices, and those who deny, or doubt of Scripture, yet they averre not, that it is of less force for all others. But their meaning is, that the Authority of the Church appears <hi>more clearly necessary</hi> against Infidels, and those who doubt of the Faith. For suppose a learned man be an Infidel, or doubt of Scripture, he will say, if the Church may erre, he can have no infallible certainty that Scripture is Gods word. If you tell him, the Church, though subject to errour, is yet of authority enough to make him esteem the Scripture, and read it diligently, and that then he will finde such an <hi>inbred light</hi> in it, as will assure him infallibly that 'tis the word of God; he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, he hath done what you require, and yet findes no more <hi>inbred light</hi> in those Books, which Protestants receive for Canonical, then he doth in others which Catholiques admit, but Protestants reject as Apocryphall; no, no more then he doth in other <hi>counterfeit pieces,</hi> disapprov'd both by Catholiques and Protestants.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Who doth not here most clearly see, that we cannot deal with such a man without the unerring, or Infallible Authority of the Church? unless we will have recourse to the <hi>Private Spirit;</hi> from which though the Bishop would seem so free, that he excludes it <hi>from the very state of the Question,</hi> yet he falls into it, and palliates it under the specious title of <hi>Grace:</hi> and where others us'd to say they were <hi>infallibly</hi> resolv'd that Scripture was the word of God, <hi>by the testimony of the Spirit within them,</hi> his Lordship pag. 83, 84. averres, that he hath the same assurance <hi>by Grace:</hi> so holding the same thing with the <hi>Calvinists</hi> in this particular, he onely changeth their words.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Relatour is very much out, when he maintains on the one side, that the Church is fallible in her Tradition of Scriptures, and yet still supposes throughout his whole discourse, that whoever comes to read Scriptures deliver'd by the Church, findes them still to correspond with the Churches recommendation (that is, to be the word of God) by <hi>the inbred light</hi> that is in them; which is a very Artificiall <hi>Turn,</hi> and needs an <hi>Ariadne's</hi> clew to pass through it. For by this means he never enters into, nay, never comes near the main difficulty: which is, how one shall discover <hi>true Scripture,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it clearly from <hi>false,</hi> when the Church through errour delivers as well <hi>false</hi> as <hi>true</hi> to be the word of God, as she may do, if she be fallible. Yea, how shall it be <hi>certainly known,</hi> whether <hi>de facto</hi> she now erres not in her delivery of it? And seeing either Theirs, or Ours must erre, who is such a <hi>Lynceus,</hi> that by the <hi>sole light</hi> of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, upon the recommendation of our respective Churches, can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover which erres in the number and designation of Canonicall Books, and which doth not?</p>
               <p>Neither can it be gather'd by his discourse, what they are to do, who are unresolv'd which is the true Church, and go about, as most of our late Sectaries do, to finde out the true Church by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. For seeing such have not the ushering and <hi>in-leading</hi> direction
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57798:50"/>
of the Church (whereof the Bishop speaks) they must either finde out the true Scriptures by their <hi>sole light,</hi> or by the <hi>private Spirit,</hi> or lastly by the light of <hi>naturall Reason;</hi> which are all equally against our Adversary.</p>
               <p>Should he say, they are first to finde out the Church by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Credibility, as we hold, and then take Scripture from her <hi>inducing,</hi> though <hi>fallible,</hi> Authority, I demand, whether by those <hi>Motives,</hi> in his opinion, one may become sufficiently <hi>certain,</hi> that the Congregation of Christians which is invested with the same, is the true Church? If one can; then antecedently to Scripture one may <hi>infallibly</hi> believe this main Article of our Creed, <hi>the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church;</hi> and consequently may have divine and saving Faith: which being suppos'd, <hi>sole Scripture</hi> will not be the foundation of our Faith, as the Bishop every where contends. If one cannot be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>certain</hi> which is the true Church, by those Motives (as he must say) then one may still doubt, notwithstanding those Motives, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be the true Church, or no; and consequently shall not have <hi>undoubtedly</hi> the Tradition of the true Church to <hi>induce</hi> him into the esteem and reading of Scripture: and in this case Scripture must be known by its own light, independently of the recommendation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from the Church.</p>
               <p>The Instance he brings of Logick evinces not the truth of that, for <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 21.</note> which it is brought; since there is not any such Analogy between Logick and Church-Tradition, as he labours to perswade his Reader. For though Logick ('tis true) does help, as he sayes, to open a mans understanding, and prepares him to be able to demonstrate a Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> in Naturall Sciences, wherewith it hath a kinde of connexion; they all depending on Naturall Reason: yet Church-Tradition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so qualifie the understanding, as to enable it to see the Scripture to be Gods word; but either makes a man believe, and receive it for such upon its sole Authority, or leaves him as much in the dark, touching this point, as it did finde him. And for the Scriptures themselves they appear no more to be the word of God, then the Stars to be of a certain determinate number, or the distinction of colours to a blinde man. Wherefore if the Church may erre in this point, yea and hath err'd according to the Doctrine of Protestants, (because we hold many Books for Canonicall Scripture, which they reject as Apocryphall) we shall be so far from having <hi>Infallible Certainty,</hi> that Scripture is the word of God, that we shall have no certainty at all; no, nor so much <hi>light,</hi> as to make a rationall man lean more to one part of the Contradiction, then to the other, neither at the first read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture, nor afterwards.</p>
               <p>The same may be urg'd in the interpretation of Scripture. For Protestants hold, that the Church may erre, yea and hath err'd in this, and not onely in small matters, but in such, which (as they say) have made us guilty of Superstition and Idolatry. How then can one, that doubts in any point of Faith, resolve what he ought to believe? For (to speak modestly) he findes as many and as learned men, defending our Canon of Scripture against theirs, as there are, that defend their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non against ours; and as many standing for our Interpretation, as for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57798:50"/>
theirs. Its impossible therefore to satisfie such a man without the Infallible Authority of the Church; unless you will betake your self to the <hi>Private Spirit,</hi> which in other respects would bring you into as great straits, and make way for all Heretiques to allow, or disallow what Scripture they please, and interpret each place according to their own fancy, pretending still, and with as much reason as you can do, <hi>the private Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Bishop here requires so many conditions, <hi>viz. Grammar, <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Logick, Study, Comparison of Scripture with it self and other writings, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Grace, a minde morally induc'd and reasonably perswaded by the voyce of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. that he scarce makes any one capable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Scripture-light, and consequently attain <hi>the formall object</hi> of Faith, (without which no true Faith can subsist, or be found in any person) save onely men of extraordinary parts and learning; which is a very obscure passage indeed in this his Labyrinth, much darker, then our Saviour ever made the way to heaven: for that is a way so <note place="margin">Haec crit vobis directa via, ita ut stulti non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>But how comes he now to require <hi>Grace,</hi> which himself before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected under the title of <hi>private Spirit,</hi> as not pertinent to the present question; Grace belonging onely to the <hi>subject</hi> that believes, not to the <hi>object</hi> believed; nor to the manner of proposing it, to fit it for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? If the Scripture hath that <hi>light</hi> he speaks of, it will be able to <hi>shew it self</hi> so clearly, that every one may see it, who will but seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously look upon it and consider it: for if it be not so clear, 'tis a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest sign, that 'tis not the <hi>light of certainty,</hi> and consequently needs some <hi>other light</hi> to certifie us that Scripture is the word of God. For seeing this certainty is not such, as makes the thing revealed <hi>evident,</hi> but onely <hi>certifies</hi> it self to be a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> or the word of God, if our Faith can rest hereupon, it must make it self <hi>so certain,</hi> that to whomsoever it is sufficiently propounded, 'tis no less sin to <hi>dissent</hi> from it, then it was to <hi>dissent</hi> from the voyce of Christ, or his Apostles, in those to whom their Authority was sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p>Scripture therefore must either shew its <hi>Divine Authority</hi> as clearly by it self (in his opinion) as either Christ or his Apostles did <hi>theirs,</hi> by their miracles and other signs of Credibility; or it will not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently manifest it self to be the word of God, so far as to induce an obligation of not dissenting from it. Again, as Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles shew'd they had <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> to all who had the <hi>Grace</hi> to believe them, and none, to whom their preaching was <hi>sufficiently</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, could <hi>disbelieve</hi> them without damnable sin; so also if the Scripture hath <hi>light</hi> enough, after the recommendation of the Church, to be seen by all that have <hi>Grace,</hi> whoever <hi>dissents</hi> from that <hi>light,</hi> commits a damnable sin in not believing it to be the word of God. Now to affirm, that all who <hi>dissent</hi> from that <hi>light,</hi> commit damnable sin, were to condemne not onely all the <hi>Luther an Protestants,</hi> but many of the holy <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> of damnable sin, who read some of those Books, which other Protestants account Scripture, even upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of the Church, and yet dissented from their being the word of God, at least accounted it not <hi>infallibly</hi> certain that they were.</p>

6. Thus we have seen (quite contrary to the Bishops Doctrine) that Scripture gives not so great and high <hi>Reasons of Credibility</hi> to it self, that the Believer may rest his <hi>last and full assent</hi> that Scripture is of <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> upon that <hi>Divine light</hi> which Scripture hath in self. For there appears no such <hi>light</hi> to any, but to the Bishop and those who pretend to the <hi>private Spirit.</hi> 'Tis true, the Scripture is said by the Royal Prophet to be a <hi>Light;</hi> because after we have once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it from the Infallible Authority of the Church, it teacheth what we are to do and believe. Therefore <hi>David</hi> saith not <hi>Verba scripta in Bibliis, lumen pedibus meis,</hi> but <hi>Verbum tuum, THY WORD is a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psalm 118. 105.</note> 
                  <hi>light to my feet:</hi> so that he first believ'd the Scripture to be the word of God, and then said it was <hi>a light,</hi> &amp;c. But without this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority 'tis neither <hi>lumen manifestativum sui, nec alterius</hi> (neither <hi>a light</hi> that evidences it self, nor any thing else) because without this we may with just reason doubt as well of Scripture, as of the true sense thereof.</p>
               <p>Wherefore though <hi>Origen</hi> prove by the Scriptures themselves that they were inspir'd from God, yet he doth never avow, that this could be prov'd out of them, unless they were receiv'd by the Infallible Authority of the Church. And <hi>Henricus a Gandavo</hi> quoted by his Lordship, for affirming, that <hi>Christians in the Primitive Church did</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>principally believe for the Authority of God, and not of the Apostles,</hi> means onely, that Christians were not mov'd to believe for any <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Authority of the Apostles, but for the Authority of God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them. So that this argument must be solv'd as well by the Bishop, as by us; for he has already granted, that the Authority of the Apostles was <hi>Divine,</hi> as well as we. And <hi>Origen</hi> whom he cites <note place="margin">§ 16. n. 20.</note> in the Margent, speaks to such as believ'd that Scriptures were the word of God: whom by those proofs out of Scripture he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to confirm and settle in their Faith, by shewing how Scripture it self testified as much. We may therefore assert, that 'tis not any <hi>humane,</hi> or <hi>fallible</hi> Authority of the Church, that moves us to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Scripture as the Infallible word of God, but the voyce of God speaking by the Church, or the Authority of God declar'd to us <hi>infallibly</hi> by the present Church. And this Infallible Authority is no less requisite to the knowledge of <hi>the first</hi> Apostolicall Tradition of the Scriptures, then it is to know the Scripture it self.</p>
               <p>But I finde another handsome Turn or two, in this discourse of the Bishop. He undertook to evince, that the Scripture hath such <hi>light</hi> in it self, that being introduc'd by the Tradition of the Church, it can shew it self to be the most undoubted <hi>Divine</hi> word of God: which to perform, he assumes this <hi>medium.</hi> The Scripture is a <hi>light;</hi> Therefore it can manifest not onely other things, but also it self, by it self, to be a <hi>light. Ergo,</hi> it can manifest it self to be the word of God. This must be his consequence, if he will conclude his intent. But what windings are here? The Scripture is <hi>a light</hi> I grant it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis able to manifest it self to be <hi>a light.</hi> I grant that too. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it can manifest it self to be an <hi>infallible light,</hi> or the undoubted word of God: That I deny; and this (which was the onely thing to be prov'd) he never so much as goes about to prove. For unless he could shew, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57798:51"/>
there are no other <hi>lights</hi> save the word of God, and such as are Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, he can never make good his consequence.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Seneca,</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> I read many <hi>lights,</hi> and those <hi>lights</hi> manifest themselves to be <hi>lights: Ergo,</hi> they manifest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Infallible <hi>lights,</hi> or the very Divine word of God, what consequence is this? The Scripture teacheth that there is one God; this is a <hi>light,</hi> and manifests it self to be a <hi>light: Ergo,</hi> it manifests it self to be the word of God, how follows that? May not the <hi>same light</hi> be found in hundreds of Books, even in the <hi>Talmud</hi> of the Jews, and <hi>Alcoran</hi> of the Turks, as well as in Scripture? The same may be said of a thousand Moral Instructions, which (either the very same, or much like to them) may be sound in other Moral Writers, as well Christians, as Jews and Heathens; which all manifest themselves to be <hi>lights:</hi> but follows it thence, that they manifest themselves to be <hi>Divine lights,</hi> or <hi>lights</hi> undoubtedly proceeding from the mouth of God?</p>
               <p>The intricacy therefore of this <hi>Meander</hi> consists in making a sly Transition from <hi>the light</hi> to the person, who is cause of this <hi>light.</hi> I finde (for example) a candle lighted in a room; it is a light, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens all the room, and shews it self to be a light by its own light: but it shews not by that light, who lighted it. I see some good sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence written on a wall; it manifests it self by it self to be good; but it manifests not whether it were written by Man, Angel, or God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; this must be evinc'd some other way. Thus the words, and sentences in Scripture are <hi>lights,</hi> and shew themselves by themselves to be <hi>lights;</hi> yet because the very same, or such as are perfectly like (and so <hi>the same</hi> in substance and sense) may have been conceiv'd and express'd, not onely by God, but by good Men, or Angels, it follows not (as he would have it) they shew themselves to be <hi>lights</hi> by their own <hi>light; Ergo,</hi> they shew themselves to be <hi>Gods-lights,</hi> or Infallible <hi>lights</hi> produc'd by none but God himself.</p>
               <p>We have made, I hope, a pretty good progress through this <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> But no looner is one past over, but we fall into another. He was to prove that Scripture <hi>has light enough in it self</hi> to give Divine Infallible proof that 'tis the word of God, so as our Faith may rest upon <hi>that light</hi> as on its proper <hi>formall object:</hi> and to evince this he cites (here and there) Authorities of the Fathers, where they took some proofs out of Scripture to conclude Scripture to be the word of God. We grant they did so; but what follows thence? <hi>Ergo,</hi> Scripture gives <hi>sufficient Divine proof</hi> to it self, before it be believ'd <hi>infallibly</hi> to be Gods word. This he was to inferre from it: but how proves he this consequence, which is the onely difficulty? He doth it thus, or no way at all. The Fathers, who precedently to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture believ'd <hi>infallibly</hi> that Scripture was the word of God, prov'd by Scripture that it was such; <hi>Ergo,</hi> those; who believe not <hi>infallibly</hi> that Scripture is Gods word, may evince by Scripture that 'tis the word of God. Is not this a strong inference?</p>
               <p>The difficulties occurring in this his Lordships Doctrine (though <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 22.</note> slighted by him) are as many, as in that of the <hi>private Spirit;</hi> the <hi>odium</hi> of which opinion he will never be able to avoid by desiring not to have it so much as nam'd <hi>in the state of the question.</hi> For if the Church
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57798:52"/>
may erre, yea and hath err'd (according to Protestants) in this point, how can we have Infallible assurance, either of the Prime Apostolical Tradition, or of the Scripture it self? We read, esteem, nay very highly reverence the Scripture, yet see we not such convincing and infallible arguments, as can give us assurance, that those Books are <hi>infallibly</hi> the word of God, which Protestants admit, and no other. Now when he sayes they resolve their Faith into Prime Tradition Apostolical, and in the next number knows not <hi>how to be certain</hi> of that Tradition, he dissolves what he resolv'd before, and makes one part of his Resolution impossible. Yet could he derive <hi>infallibly</hi> the Resolution of his Faith into Prime Apostolicall Tradition, he would quite undoe what he said before, that Scripture is the onely foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Faith, and not Tradition. Thus he turns quite opposite wayes in his Labyrinth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Here therefore to averre, without any further proof, that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>such light</hi> to Protestants, and no others, is in effect to challenge <hi>the Private Spirit</hi> to himself and his party; which is something more then onely to allow it in general. For if there be <hi>sufficient light</hi> in Scripture to shew it self, why do not we see it as well as they? see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we read it as diligently, and esteem it as highly as they do. To say that all are <hi>blinde</hi> besides themselves, or that all, beside themselves, have such <hi>perverse</hi> eyes, such <hi>unsanctified</hi> understandings, that they cannot see, nor reach that <hi>light,</hi> which Protestants most easily discern, is very great presumption; and the same may with as much reason be challeng'd by every Heretique, for the admitting of what Books he pleaseth into the Canon, and for giving whatsoever Glosses and Interpretations upon them, as shall occurre to his fancy.</p>
               <p>Nor can he, upon any just ground, make the Scripture to be like those <hi>Principles,</hi> which are known of themselves, so soon as the Terms are understood. For such <hi>Principles</hi> are either <hi>evidently,</hi> or <hi>probably</hi> known of themselves. Of the former sort are these, and others of like nature, <hi>The whole is greater then a part thereof. The same thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, and not be at the sametime.</hi> Of the latter sort is this, and such others, <hi>Every mother loves her childe;</hi> from which 'tis probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that <hi>Katharine</hi> (for example) loves her childe; by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Every mother loves her childe: But <hi>Katharine</hi> is a mother; Therefore <hi>Katharine</hi> loves her childe. Now if we speak of principles of the first kinde, the Relatour grants, that Scripture is no such prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; and 'tis manifest in it self that it is not; otherwise all men would agree which is the word of God, as all agree in those Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall Principles above-named. Neither is the Scripture a Principle of the second sort; for of it self it appears not so much as probably to be more the word of God, then some other Book which is not truly such. And though it had some probability that it were such, yet were it not sufficient; for we must have <hi>certainty,</hi> and infallible <hi>certainty</hi> too, as his Lordship grants. But how that can be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the infallible Authority of the Church, I am confident, neither he, nor any of his party, will ever be able to shew.</p>
               <p>But if we betake our selves to the infallible Authority of the Church, we may be as <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>infallibly</hi> assured, that Scripture
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57798:52"/>
is the word of God, as those, who heard the Apostles say that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was Gods word. For as the Signs and Motives, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Apostles, prov'd them to be Infallible; so the Motives of Credibility prove the True Church to be Infallible: insomuch that we can no more erre in taking the Scripture from the Church, then the Christians of the Primitive Church could erre in taking it from the Apostles. And yet as their <hi>Faith was of things not seen,</hi> both in regard of the <hi>Object,</hi> which is not <hi>seen,</hi> and of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> that <hi>sees</hi> onely <hi>in aenigmate,</hi> enigmatically and darkly; so is ours.</p>
               <p>Will the Bishop then account the greatest part, or rather all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <note place="margin">Ibid. §. 16. num. 24.</note> either <hi>blinde,</hi> or <hi>sensual</hi> men, who saw no such <hi>light</hi> for some hundreds of years after Christ, as Protestants, with his Lordship here, pretend they see in some Books of Scripture? Were all those of the Roman Church, for so many ages before, <hi>blinde,</hi> when you of the new-found Church first began, who discovered no such Infallible and Divine <hi>light</hi> in Scripture, as could evince it self to be the word of God, to such as before believ'd it not to be so, with Divine cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty? Or will Protestants be content, that we, upon this their own principle, account them all <hi>blinde,</hi> and <hi>sensual</hi> men, because they see not <hi>the light</hi> of many other Books, which our Church recommends to them and us, and which we believe to be Divine Scripture, as a great part of the Ancient Fathers did before us? What do any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries in the world more then this, either against us or them, or one against another, in asserting <hi>the Private Spirit?</hi> For the Bishop and his party affirm themselves to be so enlightned, that they can see and discover that in Scriptures which no other Christians beside them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ever did, or could, even before, they believe it <hi>infallibly</hi> to be Scripture.</p>

And if his Lordship had not too hastily run over <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> he would have found, that he <hi>distinguishes times,</hi> as well as <hi>Gandavo</hi> cited in the same page. For he saith, that <hi>to believe there are any Divine Scriptures, 'tis not</hi> absolutely <hi>necessary to salvation,</hi> (for his <hi>omnino</hi> signifies no more) because many were saved, who lived before Divine Scriptures were written: and since they were written, some may, and 'tis not unlikely have been saved without any knowledge of Divine Scripture. Such they are, as have alwayes lived among Barbarous Nations, where they have never heard of Divine Scripture: for having invincible ignorance of this, and believing other necessary points sufficiently propounded to them, if they offend not God mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally in other things, they will undoubtedly be saved. Had some ignorant Calvinist cavill'd against this, it had been no great marvell: but I wonder so great a Scholar, and so wise a man, as the Bishop is presum'd to be, should pick so deep a quarrell with nothing And
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57798:53"/>
questionless had it been so necessary a point, the Apostles would have inserted the Belief thereof into their Creed. Nay St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and St. <hi>Austin</hi> (whom <hi>Bellarmin</hi> cites) would have been in as deep an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as he. Seeing therefore <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and all Catholiques with him, hold that Christians may <hi>sufficiently</hi> arrive to a <hi>Divine Belief</hi> of all the Fundamental Mysteries of Faith, without an <hi>explicite Belief</hi> of Scripture, what errour could he commit in his Assertion? But it was some secret Project, or other, which made the Bishop here inveigh and argue so hotly against <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> and by conjecture, most likely this. Scripture, in his principles, is the <hi>Sole soundation</hi> of Faith. Therefore none can be saved without express belief of Scripture. I think, I have hit the nail on the head. Let them first convince <hi>Bellarmin</hi> of this, and then Ile confess, he deliver'd a great errour.</p>
               <p>What he addes asterwards, <hi>that being granted, which is among all Christians, that there is a Scripture,</hi> is a meer cavill; the question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not understood onely of Christians. For I urge, is it also grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst all Heathens, <hi>that there is a Scripture?</hi> What if a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then should be brought to believe all that is contained in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Creed, and being Baptized should dye, before he hear there is any Scripture; cannot he be saved? Questionless he may. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> therefore speaks onely in such <hi>rare cases</hi> as these. When his Lordship subjoyns, God would never have given a <hi>supernatural unnecessary thing,</hi> who sayes he would? May not many <hi>supernatural</hi> things be <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> for the whole Church, or for many states therein, which are not necessary to salvation for every particular person? What thinks he of Holy Orders, Vowes, Virginity, &amp;c? Again, are there not hundreds of Histories, and thousands of Sentences in Scripture, which for every one in the Church to believe expresly is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to salvation? Who denyes the Scripture to be very <hi>necessary</hi> in all ages? The question is, whether it be <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>simply</hi> necessary for every one to Salvation, to believe expresly, that there is Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Bishop here imagines, he has given a great defeat to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and that (as he sayes) <hi>upon Roman grounds,</hi> in this his Marginall Syllogisme.</p>
               <p>That which the Tradition of the present Church delivers as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to believe, is <hi>omnino</hi> necessary to salvation.</p>
               <p>But that there are Divine Scriptures, the Tradition of the present Church delivers as necessary to believe.</p>
               <p>Therefore, to believe there are Divine Scriptures, is <hi>omnino</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>The fallacy of this Argument lies in the words <hi>necessary to believe:</hi> there being some Articles of Faith so absolutely necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that a man cannot be sav'd without an express belief of them; which therefore School-Divines call necessary <hi>necessitate medii:</hi> whereas there are other Articles of Faith, which in some cases 'tis enough to believe <hi>implicitely,</hi> though all men are bound to an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite belief of them, when they are sufficiently propounded to them by the Church; and these Divines tearm necessary <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi>

                  <hi>praecepti.</hi> This distinction suppos'd, I answer thus in form.</p>
               <p>That which the Tradition of the present Church delivers as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> is <hi>omnino</hi> necessary to salvation, I grant the <hi>Major.</hi> That which the Tradition of the present Church delivers as necessary to believe <hi>necessitate praecepti</hi> onely, is <hi>omnino,</hi> or absolutely necessary to salvation, I deny the <hi>Major.</hi> To the <hi>Minor</hi> I apply the very same distinction, and deny the consequence. By which you may easily perceive, that <hi>Bellarmin stands firm</hi> upon his feet, and with a wet finger wipes off all that the Bishop here layes to his charge.</p>

               <p>Now concerning Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Authority, which the Bishop af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms to be cited with want of <hi>fidelity</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> by <hi>Brierley,</hi> I answer, it is not <hi>Brierley,</hi> but his Lordship, who wants both these in quoting <hi>Hookers</hi> words. For first, <hi>Brierley</hi> cites Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> words most faithfully, as they stand in the places mentioned by him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what he affirms <hi>Hooker</hi> to acknowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>motive,</hi> which assures us that Scripture is the word of God, is <hi>the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods Church,</hi> is likewise true. For that Author first speaks thus, <hi>Finally we all believe the Scriptures of God are sacred, and that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from God: our selves we assure, that we do right well in so belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. We have for this point a demonstration SOUND AND INFAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIBLE. But it is not the word God,</hi> &amp;c. as it follows in his words cited by <hi>Brierley.</hi> Now seeing <hi>Hooker</hi> affirms, that this <hi>sound and infallible Demonstration</hi> that Scripture proceeds from God, is <hi>not the word of God,</hi> or Scripture it self, he must either settle no <hi>infallible</hi> ground at all (even in his Lordships principles) or must say, that the Tradition of the Church is <hi>that ground.</hi> For seeing he assigns no other save <hi>the Authority of man</hi> (which, as the Bishop here acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, is <hi>the name he gives to Tradition</hi>) it must necessarily follow, that either we have no <hi>infallible ground</hi> at all to believe Scripture to be the word of God, or it is Tradition. Now that it is Tradition onely, which is all the ground he puts of believing Scripture to be the word of God, <hi>Hooker</hi> delivers clearly enough in that place, where he addes these words, <hi>Yea (that which is more) utterly to infringe the force of MANS AUTHORITY</hi> (that is Tradition) <hi>were to shake the very Fortress of Gods Truth:</hi> by which <hi>Fortress</hi> he means the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as the following words declare. Now how can this <hi>Fortress</hi> be <hi>shaken</hi> by infringing <hi>Mans Authority,</hi> were not that Authority esteem'd by him <hi>the ground</hi> of that <hi>Fortress?</hi> And presently after he inferres, <hi>Some way therefore, notwithstanding mans infirmity, his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may inforce assent.</hi> If mans Authority may inforce assent, it must necessarily be <hi>the ground</hi> of our assent, to assure us (as
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57798:54"/>
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> afterward affirms it doth) that Scripture is the word of God.</p>
               <p>But now let us see the dextrous Windings the Bishop makes, to turn <hi>Hookers</hi> words another way. He first would inferre from these words of <hi>Hooker, So that unless beside Scripture there were some thing, that might assure,</hi> &amp;c. that therefore <hi>he excludes not Scripture, though he call for another proof to lead it in, and help in assurance, namely Tradition,</hi> supposing that <hi>Hooker</hi> spake of proving Scripture to be the word of God. But I wonder by what Daedalian art his Lordship discourses thus. Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> adversaries (the Puritans) had affirmed, <hi>that Scripture prov'd it self to be the word of God by its own light and authority.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> asserts it impossible for Scripture to be <hi>its own proof.</hi> After he had demonstrated this, he tells his Adversaries, that <hi>unless besides Scripture</hi> there be another proof, &amp;c. Scripture can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be <hi>sufficiently</hi> evinced to be the word of God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> sayes the Bishop, he himself (against himself) holds Scripture to prove it self; when every one, that has his eyes open; may see, that <hi>Hookers</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, there must be some other thing, different from Scripture, to prove the Scriptures to be Gods word; and that this manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing himself <hi>unless beside Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. was occasioned by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries opinion. As if he had said, <q>unless beside Scripture (which you, Puritans, have ungroundedly put for its own proof) there be some other, it can never be prov'd sufficiently to be Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have demonstrated, that Scripture (which you falsly suppose to be that proof) is no such proof at all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let us hear Mr.</hi> Hooker <hi>make his Apology for himself in his own words.</hi> It is not the word of God, which doth, or possibly can assure us, that we do well to think it is his word. For if any one Book of Scripture did give testimony to all, yet still that Scripture, which giveth credit to the rest, would require another to give credit unto it. Nor could we ever come to any pause, to rest our assurance this way. So that unless beside Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture there were something, that might assure us that we do well, we could not think we do well, no not in being assured, that Scripture is a sacred and holy Rule of doing well. <hi>Hooker. lib. 2. §. 4. Is there any thing here, which proves Scripture to be a ground to it self, that 'tis the word of God? Nay, is not the impossibility hereof clearly asserted? Is not</hi> Hooker <hi>in search after an</hi> assuring ground, <hi>upon which Scripture must stand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Bishop will have this ground (whether Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> will or no) onely concomitant with Scripture, that is, Church-Tradition onely <hi>to lead in and help in assurance,</hi> which <hi>assurance</hi> we get by <hi>the sole light of Scripture;</hi> whereas Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> will have that <hi>assurance,</hi> both that <hi>Scripture is a rule of living well,</hi> and that we <hi>do well in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be so,</hi> and also <hi>that it is the word of God</hi> (as his words now cited declare) to be precedent to Scripture, and no other then Church-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. If therefore Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> be understood to speak of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures-being proof to it self, that it is the word of God, in his own opinion, he maintains the very same in effect that we say, and the quite contrary to the Bishop, <hi>viz.</hi> that supposing we are assured by a proof precedent to Scripture, that Scripture is the word of God, this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57798:54"/>
(I say) presupposed) Scripture as by <hi>a secondary proof,</hi> can confirm its own Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> either where it teacheth that we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Church (which so assures us <hi>primarily</hi>) or that it self is the word of God.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Turn</hi> being ended he begins another, and that a <hi>double</hi> one; and endeavours to shew, that <hi>Brierley</hi> has <hi>shamefully falsified Hooker,</hi> in saying that the main proof which <hi>Hooker</hi> brings to shew that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the word of God, is the Tradition of the Church. <hi>For that Author</hi> (sayes he) <hi>states the question in these words, The Scripture is the ground of our Belief; the Authority of man,</hi> (<hi>that's the name</hi> Hooker <hi>gives to Tradition</hi>) <hi>is the key, which opens the door of entrance into the knowledge of the Scripture.</hi> Now see his <hi>Meanders. Hooker</hi> (sayes the Bishop) <hi>affirms, that Scripture is the ground of our Belief.</hi> But are those all <hi>Hookers</hi> words in that Sentence? No; for I finde amongst them a <hi>therein,</hi> which is <hi>neatly</hi> hidden in a dark corner. <hi>Although</hi> (sayes <hi>Hooker the Scripture THEREIN be the ground of our Belief.</hi> This one concealed word relates to something, which would have quite spoil'd the Bishops market, had it been fairly express'd. What means he by <hi>Therein?</hi> The words immediately going before tell us. <hi>Whatsoever</hi> (sayes <hi>Hooker</hi>) <hi>we believe concerning Salvation by Christ, although the Scripture THEREIN be the ground of our Belief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence it appears, that <hi>Hooker</hi> rather excludes Scripture from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a ground of our Belief,</hi> concerning that which the Bishop here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Scripture is the word of God.</hi> For the word <hi>therein</hi> (which <hi>Hooker</hi> useth) is in this place clearly <hi>relative</hi> and <hi>restrictive,</hi> and tyes his speech to the particular matter precedent, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>all things concerning Salvation by Christ.</hi> As if <hi>Hooker</hi> should say, <q>Good assurance being presupposed, by some antecedent proof, that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the word of God, Scripture it self may then be a ground of our Belief touching all other things, which concern our Salvation by Christ.</q> How does this place of <hi>Hooker,</hi> now fully and faithfully cited, favour his Lordship? There is no man, <hi>that has his brains about</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>him,</hi> (to use his own words) but sees, how little it makes to his purpose.</p>
               <p>But let us go on. <hi>The Authority of man</hi> (sayes <hi>Hooker</hi> cited by the Bishop) <hi>is the Key, which opens the Door of entrance into the knowledge of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>the Scripture.</hi> What <hi>knowledge of Scripture</hi> speaks he of? Let Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> be his own Interpreter, and shew what he means <hi>by opening the knowledge of Scripture.</hi> He speaks thus. <hi>The Scriptures do not teach us the things that are of God, unless we did credit men, who have taught us, that the words of Scripture do signifie those things.</hi> Stay a while. By this Key therefore, which <hi>opens the entrance into the knowledge of Scriptures,</hi> is not meant in this place, that Church-Tradition <hi>fallibly</hi> assures us, that Scripture is the word of God, (as the Bishop would fain interpret <hi>Hooker</hi>) but that it teaches us the meaning of the words of Scripture, and thereby opens to us the knowledge of Scripture.</p>
               <p>By what hath been said, 'tis evident, his Lordship had very little reason to fall so hotly upon <hi>Brierley,</hi> as to tax him of falsification, as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57798:55"/>
he does <hi>num.</hi> 25. For <hi>Hooker</hi> clearly teaching, that <hi>besides Scripture</hi> we must have the Authority, or Tradition, of the Church, to assure us, that Scripture is Gods word; and <hi>Brierley</hi> affirming no more of him then this, I wonder, that for speaking truth he should be thought to deserve so sharp a censure from his Lordship.</p>

THe Bishop, <hi>num.</hi> 26. of this Paragraph, to withdraw his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">§. 16. n. 26.</note> from the <hi>Thesis,</hi> or main matter in question, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church, descends (very dextrously indeed, but yet without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity) to the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> or Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For though <hi>A. C.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, that the <hi>Roman,</hi> in a true sense, is the Catholique Church, yet here he abstracts from that question, and means no more then he plainly asserts, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Tradition of the Catholique Church is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> &amp;c. But whether theirs, or ours, or some other Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christians be the Catholique Church, that's another questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; of which <hi>A. C.</hi> affirms nothing in this place: yet the Relatour (as if he were somewhat nettled) is pleas'd to say, that <hi>after a long</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>silence he thrusts himself in again,</hi> and desires the Bishop <hi>to consider the Tradition of the Church, not onely as it is the Tradition of a company of fallible men, but as a Tradition of a company of men assisted by Christ and his holy Spirit; in which sense he might easily finde it to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly, in my opinion, <hi>A. C.</hi> deserv'd no rough language for his respects to the Bishop, in being so long and silently attentive to his discourse; though at length, through zeale he became something
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57798:55"/>
earnest in the business, out of a desire to bring his Adversary into the right way: and to this end urged him to consider the Tradition of the Church, not onely as it is a <hi>Tradition of a company of fallible men, but as a Tradition of a company of men assisted by Christ and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit;</hi> and not assisted by them in any common way, but in such a manner as reacheth to Infallibility. For such assistance is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as well to have sufficient assurance of the true Canon of holy Scripture, as to come to the true meaning and interpretation thereof. Such assistance the Relatour confesseth <hi>the Prophets to have had under</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>the Old Testament, and the Apostles under the New.</hi> The like (we say) <hi>the High Priest with his Clergy</hi> had in the Old Testament, as we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the 17. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> verse 8. &amp;c. where, in doubts, the people were bound, not onely to have recourse to the High Priest, and his Clergy, but to submit and stand to their judgement. Much more then ought we to think, that there is such <hi>an obligation</hi> in the New Testament; which could not stand without Infallibility. Witness the infinite dissentions and divisions in points of Faith amongst all the different Sects of Christians, that deny it. Neither had he any reason to break forth into those exclamations, <hi>Good God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>whither will these men go?</hi> For they go no further then Christ himself leads them, by promises made unto them in the places of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which shall be set down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> . And the Pastours of the Catholique Church may very well acknowledge this Infallibility, yet make it no occasion to <hi>Lord it over others,</hi> unless he will also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the Apostles upon the same account. Neither do they equal the Tradition of <hi>the present Church</hi> (as the Relatour urgeth) to <hi>the written</hi> word of God; and this hath been shew'd before.</p>
               <p>Touching what he writes of <hi>Divine Infallibility,</hi> we have already declar'd, that 'tis sufficient to our present purpose to assert Church-Tradition to be Infallible; whether it be <hi>simply Divine,</hi> or no, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other question, to be determin'd when time and place requires. Whence it follows, that there's no necessity of equalizing Church-Tradition to the Word of God. For we have already acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, that 'tis not <hi>in all respects</hi> equal to Scripture. Again he falls from the <hi>Thesis</hi> to the <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> We have nothing now to do with this question, whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop and his Clergy be the Head of the Catholique Church, or no; but whether that, which is the Catholique Church, be able to breed in us Divine Faith, or no, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Congregation of Christians it be. So that his impeaching the <hi>Roman</hi> Church of errours here, whilst we are in dispute about an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other question, is wholly out of season.</p>
               <p>His answer to St. <hi>Basils</hi> Text, <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. de Spirit. sanct. cap. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Parem vim habent ad pietatem,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> (that <hi>unwritten Traditions</hi> have <hi>equal force to stir up piety, with the written word</hi>) is very deficient. First, 'tis true he speaks of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Traditions; yet of such as were come down from their times to St. <hi>Basils:</hi> For otherwise how should they have had in his time any force at all to move to piety, as he said they then had? <hi>Parem vim habent ad pietatem.</hi> Secondly, his exception taken against that <hi>Work</hi> of St. <hi>Basil,</hi> from Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> and that borrowed from <hi>Erasmus,</hi> and he collecting it onely from the stile, (which yet others far more
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57798:56"/>
ancient, and better acquainted with St. <hi>Basils</hi> stile, then <hi>Erasmus,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be his) this exception, I say, we esteem of no great force. Thirdly, St. <hi>Basils</hi> making the <hi>unwritten</hi> Traditions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he speaks, to be such as are not <hi>contrary</hi> to Scripture, proves not Scripture it self so to be the <hi>Touch-stone</hi> of Apostolical Tradition, as that Scripture must therefore needs be of <hi>greater force,</hi> and <hi>superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our dignity,</hi> then that of Tradition. For the Bishop himself grants <hi>Prime</hi> Apostolical Tradition to be <hi>equally divine</hi> with Scripture: and yet 'tis true to say, that those <hi>Prime Traditions</hi> are such, as are <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the sense of <hi>Stapletons</hi> words is quite perverted by the Bishop. For he speaks (as his words clearly intimate) of <hi>later and fresher</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, then are the <hi>Prime</hi> Apostolical, <hi>viz.</hi> such as were begun by General Councils, or perhaps in some particular Church. His words are <hi>recentiorem &amp; posteriorem, sicut &amp; particularem,</hi> &amp;c. which do not signifie such Traditions, as we now treat of, <hi>viz.</hi> Traditions <hi>prime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Apostolical, deliver'd from hand to hand, in all succeeding ages, by the universal and constant Tradition of the Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed <hi>as such</hi> unto us by the Tradition of the present Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A. C.</hi> urging <hi>the present</hi> Copies of Scripture, &amp;c. presses the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour very hard, as I have already shew'd. Now I adde, what if the <hi>Ancienter</hi> Copies disagree. How shall we know which is the true Word of God? His saying that true Scripture may be <hi>more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>known,</hi> then true Tradition, because the one is <hi>written,</hi> and not the other, is not consequent. For <hi>Universal</hi> Traditions are recorded in Authours of every succeeding age: and it seems much more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident</hi> to have errours slip into writings of so great bulk as is the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which in their Editions pass onely through the hands of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men, then that there should be errours in publique, <hi>Universal,</hi> and <hi>Immemorial Traditions,</hi> which are openly practis'd throughout all Christendome, and taken notice of by every one in all ages.</p>
               <p>To shew the difference therefore betwixt Scripture and Tradition, not onely in their <hi>Originals,</hi> but in their <hi>successive deliverers</hi> from hand to hand, let us compare them together. St. <hi>John</hi> (for example) writes one of his Epistles, and St. <hi>Luke</hi> his Gospel, to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. These, upon the credit of the persons to whom they were written, were deliver'd as <hi>Authentical</hi> Apostolical writings to other Christians, and so by degrees came to be publickly deliver'd, that is, <hi>made known</hi> to the whole <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, and <hi>received</hi> by it: And thence in like manner the Church receiv'd and deliver'd them in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages. On the other side the Apostles (to descend to some particulars) observ'd the first day of the week as <hi>sacred,</hi> in place of the Sabbath, Baptized Infants, used Altars, &amp;c. This in the very <hi>prime</hi> Institution and practice of it, was not done privately, onely by some one Apostle, or in the presence of one single person onely, but publiquely by all the Apostles, and universally practis'd by all Christians. It was therefore incomparably harder (morally speaking) to doubt (in the beginning) of these Traditions, then whether Saint <hi>John's</hi> Epistle, or St. <hi>Luke's</hi> Gospel were <hi>really</hi> theirs, or no. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we see, that many Books of the New Testament were <hi>doubted of,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:57798:56"/>
for many years, in some particular Churches: whereas all, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, accounted these said Traditions, and their like, to be most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Apostolical, by the <hi>universal</hi> uncontradicted practice of them, being deliver'd from age to age under this Notion, <hi>as truly and really descending from the Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here his Lordship supposes <hi>A. C's.</hi> pen <hi>to be troubled</hi> and <hi>forsake</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>him,</hi> insinuating thereby to his Reader, that <hi>this trouble</hi> proceeds out of some <hi>check of Conscience.</hi> But under favour, it is not so much <hi>A. C's</hi> pen, as his own, that is <hi>here troubled.</hi> For he sets down in a different letter above eight lines, as written by <hi>A. C.</hi> which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing were none of his. This indeed hath something of a <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled pen,</hi> and peradventure of a troubled conscience also: unless we may rather take it for a piece of art, to make <hi>A. C.</hi> seem to say, that the Copies of Scripture may be considered as printed by men assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gods Spirit, whereas he onely sayes they <hi>may be considered as printed, and by authority of men assisted by Gods Spirit, approved to be true Copies.</hi> Was not this a pretty sleight, to blast the credit of his Adversary?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, is it not strange to see, how he restrains the Infallible Assistance of the Holy Ghost onely <hi>to the Apostles times?</hi> How come Christians then to inferre, from the places cited by <hi>A. C.</hi> that the Church shall never fall away and perish? For if the assistance be not to preserve the succeeding Church, at least from some kinde of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours <hi>infallibly,</hi> it may, notwithstanding all the assistance he allows it here, fall into all kinde of errours one after another; and so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the whole Church might fall into a general Apostacy, and thereby <hi>perish.</hi> There must therefore be some kinde of Infallible Assistance in the <hi>Apostles Successours,</hi> by vertue of these promises. For otherwise how would this Doctrine of his agree with that of other Modern Protestant Authours, who grant, that our Saviour by those Texts promis'd an Infallible Assistance to his visible Church, and her Pastours lawfully assembled in a General Council, in all points belonging to the foundation of Religion? Nay, how comes he here to take away all Infallible Assistance of the Holy Ghost from the Apostles Successours, and yet grant above, that the present Church is Infallible in all Fundamentals? Comes not this Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from the Holy Ghost? and proceeds it not from the said pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of our Saviour?</p>
               <p>But what shall we say to an Adversary, that forges what Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Doctrine he pleases, and then fights against it? He would fain impose upon his Reader, that <hi>A. C.</hi> in the words cited by him (<hi>num.</hi> 28.) contends, that not onely the Pastours met together in a full Representative of the Church, but severally and apart are each of them Infallible; which he inveighs against, and presses so far that he would perswade the ignorant, that <hi>the Jesuits also have a moneths minde to this Infallibility.</hi> Whence draws he, I pray, this consequence? Forsooth, because <hi>A. C.</hi> averres, that the Holy Ghost through Christs promise, is to assist <hi>infallibly the Successours of the Apostles, the lawfully-sent Pastours and Doctours of the Church in all ages.</hi> But what if <hi>A. C's</hi> words cannot be understood of <hi>every</hi> Pastour, or
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57798:57"/>
Doctour <hi>apart?</hi> but rather of Pastours and Doctours lawfully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in an Oecumenical Council? as indeed he doth; which thus I shew.</p>
               <p>Every Authour is to be understood to mean by his words, what they will properly bear, and is consonant with the meaning of his other words. Now the whole dispute wherein the Bishop and <hi>A. C.</hi> were then engag'd, was whether <hi>the whole</hi> Church might erre in her Tradition of Scripture. So that it was necessary for him to apply the promises of our Saviour to the Pastours of the Church, onely so far, as those Pastours were the Representative Church, and their Tradition the Churches-Tradition. This <hi>A. C.</hi> signifies expresly by his words immediately before these here cited by his Lordship, which the Relatour handsomely conceals, to make his windings the less perceptible. For <hi>A. C.</hi> speaks thus. <hi>I see no reason, why the like two-fold consideration of the Tradition of the present Church may not be admitted; especially when as the promise of Christ, and his holy Spirits, continual presence, is not onely to the Apostles, but to their Successours also, the lawfully-sent Pastours and Doctours of the Church in all ages.</hi> Where it is evident he took those words as a <hi>Medium</hi> to prove the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Tradition of the present Church, thereby tying those promises to the Pastours and Doctours of the Church, as they may be said to be the Church, not as they are separate and <hi>apart,</hi> but as assembled in a full Representative of the Church, that is, a General Council.</p>
               <p>All therefore that follows, either of <hi>the Pope</hi> as a <hi>private Pastour,</hi> or of <hi>the Jesuits,</hi> &amp;c. is to no purpose, as proceeding meerly from a misunderstanding (or rather perverting) of <hi>A. C's</hi> words. Yet I cannot omit a consequence, which the Bishop will needs extort from the Jesuits <hi>meaning,</hi> as though he had been in his heart, when he wrote those words. <hi>And though</hi> A. C. <hi>out of his bounty</hi> (sayes he) <hi>is content</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>to extend it to all the lawfully-sent Pastours of the Church,</hi> (where <hi>all</hi> is handsomely juggled into <hi>A. C's</hi> Text) <hi>yet his own Society questionless he means chiefly.</hi> Is it not fine sport, the Bishop here makes, that <hi>A. C.</hi> by <hi>Pastours of the Church</hi> must <hi>chiefly</hi> mean (and that without all question, or dispute) <hi>those of his own Society?</hi> When 'tis well known, there are scarce two <hi>Pastours</hi> of the Church amongst all the <hi>Jesuits</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> And then (to mend the matter) that he will have Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> and <hi>A. C.</hi> to be those two <hi>Pastours,</hi> when they neither were <hi>Pastours,</hi> nor could be, unless he will suppose likewise they would break their vow made to Almighty God (for by <hi>Pastours,</hi> the Apostles Successours, are meant Bishops) never to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any such dignity without express command of the Pope. But how proves the Bishop the <hi>Iesuits</hi> perswade themselves they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible? Rabbi <hi>Casaubon,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, must help him out. An Apologist (sayes <hi>Casaubon</hi>) averres, 'tis impossible for a <hi>Iesuit</hi> to erre. Who is this <hi>Anonymus</hi> Apologist? A <hi>Iesuit,</hi> or a <hi>Minister?</hi> For an Apologist and a Jesuit are no more <hi>convertible terms,</hi> then a <hi>Iesuit</hi> and a <hi>Minister.</hi> How shall we know then, whether this name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Apologist was a <hi>Iesuit</hi> or a <hi>Minister</hi> personating a Jesuit? The Gospel will tell us; <hi>Ex fructibus corum cognoscetis eos.</hi> Is it possible <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 20.</note>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:57798:57"/>
his Lordship should think himself everable to move wise men with such non-proofs as these?</p>
               <p>The Relatour having been so positive in denying the Infallibility of the Church, 'tis strange he should think it needless for <hi>A. C.</hi> to urge passages of Scripture in proof of it: which though they be <hi>well known in this Controversie;</hi> yet are they not therefore of lesse force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first is in St.</hi> Luke; <hi>where Christ saith,</hi> He that heareth you, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16.</note> heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The second in St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> where Christ tells us, <hi>I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>unto the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is in St. <hi>John;</hi> where 'tis written, <hi>The Comforter, the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joan.</hi> 14. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Holy Ghost, shall abide with you for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the first of these passages, viz, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. alledg'd by <hi>A. C.</hi> the Bishop answers, that those who hear the Successours of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>hear Christ, viz.</hi> when they speak the <hi>words of Christ,</hi> but not when they speak their <hi>own words.</hi> But that this is rather to pervert our Saviours words, then to interpret them, is manifest. For can the Bishop bring any ground from the Text, that this restraint may not, by some other Sectary, who denies the Apostles Infallibility no less then the Churches, be applied to the Apostles themselves, as well as he now applies it to their Successors? But his Lordship has haply ground for what he sayes, if not here, yet in St. <hi>Matthew, chap.</hi> 28. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. where they are commanded to teach <hi>all things which Christ commanded them. Ergo,</hi> say I, (and with more reason; for the command was given expresly and immediately to the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) the Apostles were neither to be heard, when they preach'd other things, then what Christ had commanded them: and so both these Texts will either include an Infallibility in the Successors of the Apostles, or exclude it from the Apostles themselves.</p>
               <p>If he reply, we our selves must acknowledge a difference in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Text to the Apostles and their Successours, (for it was true in every one of the Apostles <hi>apart,</hi> but it is not so, as we confess, in every one of the succeeding Pastours) I answer first, the difference alledged by us is so clear and unquestionable, that our very Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries agree with us in it. Secondly, 'tis manifest by experience it self, that many Pastours, even of very eminent authority in the Church, have not onely err'd, but invented and maintain'd Heresies. Thirdly, we have the universal Tradition and consent in all ages, that all Pastours <hi>apart</hi> are not Infallible. Fourthly, we have plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for it; <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 30. where the Apostle sayes, that even <hi>from amongst themselves,</hi> that is, from amongst the Pastours and Bishops of the Church, (to whom he there speaks, ver. 17, 28.) there should arise some, in future ages; that should speak <hi>perverse things.</hi> Fifthly, we so interpret the words for future ages, that what is necessary for preserving the Church in the purity of Christs doctrine, is still sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent in all ages, in the Infallibility of lawful General Councils; whereby we make the words of Christ (in both Texts) absolutely true, without all <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>conditions;</hi> which our Adversaries expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does utterly frustrate in relation to the Church. Sixthly, we (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57798:58"/>
to the most receiv'd perswasion amongst us) preserve that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in one Supream Pastour of the Church, the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> successively, which they continue neither in one, nor in all the Pastours of the Church assembled together. Let those therefore of his Lordships party bring as strong reasons for the Bishops expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of this Text of St. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. as we do for ours, and we shall not be unwilling to yield to it: but we (and they too) know that to be impossible.</p>
               <p>His answer to the second place (Matth. 28. 20. <hi>I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, even unto the end of the world</hi>) runs in the same strain, with his answer to the former Text; and so requires not our further refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We extend those words, <hi>I am with you alwayes,</hi> &amp;c. to the whole Church <hi>Representative,</hi> not to every Pastour <hi>apart:</hi> whereby St. <note n="*" place="margin">In illis donis quibus salus aliorum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But whether the Fathers ground their Doctrine in this point, upon this particular Text or no, is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle material. 'Tis sufficient they acknowledge the thing we contend for, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prerogative of Infallibility and Immunity from errour, in the Church, and that they generally derive it from our Saviours <hi>special Promises</hi> unto the Church, and his <hi>Presence</hi> with it; which <hi>Presence</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> this Text (with others of like nature) do clearly contain, as the Bishop himself acknowledges. Wherefore with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57798:58"/>
far greater reason we return the challenge upon himself, and press the Relatours party to produce <hi>any one Father,</hi> that ever deny'd the sense of this place to reach to <hi>infallible assistance,</hi> granted thereby <hi>to all the Apostles Successours,</hi> in such manner as we maintain it.</p>
               <p>The like answer of our satisfies his exposition of the third place, (<hi>John</hi> 14. 16.) For what was promis'd there <hi>for ever</hi> must, in some absolute sense (so far as is necessary to the preservation of the Church from errour) be verified in future ages.</p>
               <p>He frames also an answer to a fourth place, <hi>viz. John</hi> 16. 13. which speaks of <hi>leading</hi> the Apostles <hi>into all truth.</hi> This he restrains to the persons of the Apostles onely. And he needs not tells us so often of <hi>simply all:</hi> For surely none is so simple as not to know that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his telling it. But we contend, that in whatsoever sense <hi>all truth</hi> is to be understood in respect of each Apostle <hi>apart,</hi> 'tis also to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in relation to their Successours, assembled in a full <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi> of the whole Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now one main reason of this difference between the Apostles, and succeeding Pastours of the Church, I take to be this, that every Apostle <hi>apart</hi> had receiv'd an immediate Power from our Saviour over the whole Church; so that whatever any one of them taught as Christian Faith, all the Church was oblig'd to believe: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently had he err'd in any thing, the whole Church would have been oblig'd to follow and believe that errour. Whereas on the other side, the succeeding Bishops (generally speaking) were not to be Pastours of the whole Church, but each of his own respective Diocess; so that if particular Pastours preach'd any errour in Faith, the <hi>whole</hi> Church was unconcern'd in it, having no obligation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</p>
               <p>But in regard those <hi>respective</hi> Pastours, when they are assembled in a lawful <hi>Representative,</hi> or General Council, are in quality of the Pastours of <hi>the whole</hi> Church, if they should erre, in such a body, <hi>the whole</hi> Church would be oblig'd to erre with them; which is against the promises of our Saviour. Hence also it follows in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> being Pastour of <hi>the whole</hi> Church, when he teacheth any thing in that quality, <hi>viz.</hi> as Pastour of <hi>the whole</hi> Church, and intending to oblige the whole Church by his Definition, cannot (in the common opinion) erre, for the same reason.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To give also the Fundamentall Reason for this Exposition; one, and that a certain way to know, when our Saviours words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken immediately to the Apostles, are to be extended to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours in all ages, is this; that when the necessary good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Church requires the performance of Christs words <hi>in future ages,</hi> no less then it requir'd it in the Apostles times, then we are to understand that his words extend themselves to those ages, unless there be some express limitation added to his words, tying them to the Apostles onely. Thus, when our Saviour commanded his Apostles to Preach, Baptize, Remit sins, Feed their Flocks, &amp;c. Seeing these actions are as necessary for all future ages, as they were
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57798:59"/>
in the Apostles time, 'tis manifest, they were to reach to all succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inga ges. Again, in regard he also promised (<hi>John</hi> 16. 13.) to lead the Apostles, by his Holy Spirit, <hi>into all truth:</hi> and seeing 'tis as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <hi>now,</hi> for those who act as Pastours of <hi>the whole</hi> Church (as all succeeding Bishops do, when they meet in a lawful Oecumenicall Council) to be led <hi>into all those truths,</hi> into which he promis'd to lead the Apostles, for the reason but now alledged, it evidently follows by vertue of our Saviours promise, that they are alwayes and effectually so led. And though it would be <hi>boldness</hi> (as the Relatour terms it) to enlarge that promise, <hi>in the fulness of it,</hi> beyond the persons of the Apostles, so far as to give to every single succeeding Bishop as Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible a leading <hi>into all truth,</hi> as each of the Apostles had; yet may it without any boldness at all be affirmed, that the succeeding Bishops, assembled as abovesaid, have an infallible leading <hi>into all truth,</hi> as being then Representative Pastours of <hi>the whole</hi> Church, to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct her what she is to believe.</p>

                  <hi>'Tis manifest</hi> (sayes he) <hi>that when the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples first received the Body and Blood of our Lord, they did not receive Fasting.

For this cause this Custom is observ'd throughout the world.</hi> I might easily produce several other instances to the same effect, if this one were not sufficient, as I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it is.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Neither hath the Bishop any ground to averre, that this promise of settling the Apostles <hi>in all truth,</hi> was for the persons of the Apostles onely; because the Truths, in which the Apostles were settled, were to continue inviolably in the Church. What wise man would go about to raise a stately Building to continue for many ages, and satisfie himself with laying a Foundation to last but for few years? Our Saviour, the wisest of Architects, is not to be thought to have founded this incomparable Building of the Church upon sand; which must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly have happened, had he not intended to afford his continuall Assistance also to the succeeding Pastours of the Church, to lead them, when assembled in a General Council, <hi>into all those Truths,</hi> wherein he first settled the Apostles, as <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> above

What would the Relatour do in that case? Call you this answering, or rather making <hi>Meanders?</hi> He'l grant to <hi>A. C.</hi> what he cannot deny by reason of its evidence, if in return thereof <hi>A. C.</hi> will acquiesce to that which is so apparently false, that he had already refus'd to grant it: and in the mean time his Lordship gives no absolute answer to the difficulty.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To <hi>A. C's</hi> similitude of the <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Letters Credential</hi> of an <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 31.</note> Embassador, he sayes, that the Kings Letters confirm the Embassadors Authority <hi>infallibly,</hi> and the Embassadours word <hi>probably</hi> onely. But to whom do those Letters confirm it <hi>infallibly? To all that know the Seal and hand,</hi> sayes the Bishop. That's pretty. Suppose then he go to a Forreign King, who neither knows Seal nor Hand; how will those Letters confirm infallibly the Embassadours authority? To this here's not a word of answer: yet this is the question. For we now dispute, how we come to know <hi>infallibly,</hi> that the Scripture is Gods Word; and this is neatly put off by a dexterous <hi>Turn.</hi> 'Tis true, the Kings Letters may give some moral Testimony to purchase credit to the Embassadour, supposing, that he who gives himself out for an Embassadour, do either by private Letters, Informations, or other Motives, gain so much credit, as to merit the repute of a person of worth and honour, and therefore not likely to wrong his King and himself in a matter of so high concern.</p>
               <p>Wherefore standing in this similitude, the Kings Letters are <hi>Letters of Credence,</hi> because they are written in the usual form of such Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and deliver'd from the hand of such a person, as for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons deserves the repute of an honest man, so as (according to the style of all Royal Courts) he is not to be receiv'd as Embassadour without those Letters. Where we see (to fit this instance to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose) that the first Motive, inducing the Forreign King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive either the Person, or the Letters, are those reasons, whereby the King is perswaded the Embassadour is a person of credit, to which correspond our Motives of Credibility, for receiving the Church as most deserving all credit with us; who afterward affirming her self in her Prelates to be Christs Embassadour, we receive her as such, and give credit to what she sayes or does; next she producing also Christs <hi>Letters of Credence,</hi> the holy Scriptures, which affirm that her Prelates are his Embassadours, we are yet further confirm'd in the whole affair. But in case we should so far give way to the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57798:60"/>
Relatours answer in this particular, as to yield that the Letters <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> give credit to all that know the Seal and Hand; sure he must say, that if this make them <hi>infallibly certain,</hi> they must also <hi>know infallibly</hi> that Seal and Hand: for by knowing them onely <hi>probably,</hi> they can never be <hi>infallibly</hi> certain of the Letters. Now if they know that Seal and Hand <hi>infallibly,</hi> they will also <hi>infallibly</hi> know that they are true Letters of Credence, even independently of the Embassadours assertion. Whence it follows, that if we can be <hi>infallibly</hi> certain of any thing corresponding to the Seal and Hand of God in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, we likewise shall be <hi>infallibly</hi> certain, that they are his Letters, whether the Church, as Gods Embassadour, attest them or not. So that this way reduces all to the <hi>sole light</hi> of Scripture, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Lordship, and already rejected by him.</p>
               <p>But after all how can one be <hi>infallibly</hi> certain of that Seal and Hand, unless he be as certain of the Embassadours sincerity, who brought them? otherwise there can be no Infallibity of his Embassie. How many wayes are there of counterfeiting both Seal and Hand? Nay, how many wayes of obtaining them surreptitiously? May not the Embassadour himself, or some other interessed person, procure them by some artificial practice? May they not combine with the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State to impose upon his Majesty, by drawing him to sign one thing for another. But enough of this, it being a matter so obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the understanding.</p>
               <p>Let us now follow the Bishop page by page; who stomacks very much at this Assertion of <hi>A. C. That these Letters</hi> (the Scriptures) <hi>do warrant, that the people may hear and give credit to those Legates of Christ, as to Christ himself. Soft,</hi> (sayes the Bishop) <hi>this is too high a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>great deal; no Legat was ever of so great credit, as the King himself.</hi> Durst I be so bold, I might <hi>soft</hi> it to his Lordship too, and tell him he sayes too much a great deal. Where, I beseech him, doth <hi>A. C.</hi> say in the forecited words, <hi>that a Legat is of as great credit, as the King himself.</hi> I'm sure in his words there is no such sentence. He averres indeed, <hi>that we may give credit to those Legats, as to Christ the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi> but he sayes not that we may give <hi>as much,</hi> or <hi>as high</hi> credit to the one as to the other. This was the Bishops <hi>Turn</hi> onely. There is therefore a more eminent degree of credit to be given to a King then to his Legate, and yet we give credit to the Legate as to the King himself, that is, we doubt no more of the one then of the other. And I would gladly know, if his Lordship had heard our Saviour speak in his life time, and his Apostles preach after our Saviours death, whether he would have doubted of the truth of the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, any more then of the doctrine of Christ himself, whose Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates they were. To give credit therefore to them as to Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, is as undoubtedly to believe them as Christ himself, though with a higher degree of respect and regard to Christ, then to them. And our Saviour affirm'd as much, when he said, <hi>He that hears you, hears me,</hi> Luke 10. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next he tells us, that</hi> A. C. <hi>sayes,</hi> that company of men, which deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> the present Churches Tradition, hath in them Divine and Infallible Authority, and consequently are worthy of Divine and Infallible Credit,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57798:60"/>
                  <hi>sufficient to breed in us Divine and Infallible Faith.</hi> Has he not here plaid the Divine and Rhetorician both at once? What means this Rhetorical repetition thrice together? But the worst is, <hi>A. C's</hi> words are misapply'd, and miscited by an artificial <hi>Turn</hi> in the Labyrinth. He accuses <hi>A. C.</hi> of attributing <hi>Divine Authority</hi> twice over, and that absolutely, without any restriction or modification, to that company of men, which delivers the present Churches Tradition: and then sayes, their <hi>Divine Authority</hi> and credit is so great, that 'tis sufficient to breed in us <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi> Faith. Now, Reader, judge, whether <hi>A. C.</hi> applies this <hi>Divine</hi> Authority to that company of men, or to the Holy Scriptures. <hi>A. C.</hi> there discoursing of one, who considers Church-Tradition as 'tis deliver'd from a company of men assisted by the Holy Ghost, speaks thus, <hi>He would finde no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in that respect to account the Authority of Church-Tradition to be Infallible, and consequently not onely able to be an Introduction, but also an Infallible motive, or reason, or at least a condition EX PARTE OB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECTI, to make both it self and the Books of Scripture appear infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (though obscurely) to have in them Divine and Infallible Authority, and to be worthy of Divine and Infallible credit, sufficient to breed in us Divine and Infallible Faith.</hi> These words <hi>in them</hi> are clearly referr'd to <hi>Books of Scripture,</hi> not to any <hi>company of men;</hi> and those words <hi>sufficient to breed in us divine Faith</hi> have relation to the Authority of the Books of Scripture, and not to <hi>those men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For though he put before two Antecedents, <hi>it self,</hi> (that is, Church Tradition) and <hi>Books of Scripture,</hi> to both which <hi>in them</hi> may seem to have relation, yet it is one thing to affirm that Church-Tradition hath <hi>in it Divine and Infallible Authority,</hi> and another to affirm, that <hi>those men</hi> so assisted have <hi>in them</hi> Divine and Infallible Authority, as he accuses <hi>A. C.</hi> to have said. For seeing that in <hi>Church-Tradition</hi> is included <hi>Apostolical</hi> Tradition, in <hi>A. C's</hi> principles, and that, even according to our Adversary, Apostolical Tradition is of <hi>Divine</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it will be true to assert, that Church-Tradition hath <hi>in it</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, even though those men delivering it had not <hi>in them</hi> any <hi>absolute Divine,</hi> but onely <hi>Infallible</hi> Authority.</p>
               <p>Our Apology for <hi>A. C.</hi> being ended, let us see how his Lordship goes about to prove Scripture to be Gods Word. For the better understanding whereof, 'tis necessary to know what he is to prove. He tells us, that <hi>this his Method and manner of proving Scripture to be the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Word of God, is the same, which the Ancient Church ever held, &amp;c.</hi> Now his Lordships <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of proving this includes two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. The first that Church-Tradition is onely a humane, moral, and fallible inducement, able onely to found a <hi>moral perswasion</hi> that Scripture is the Word of God; but insufficient to conveigh <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> to us the <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> of the Scriptures-being. Gods word: whence he concludes, that before <hi>the reading</hi> of Scripture we cannot, in vertue of that <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> thus conveighed to us, believe with Divine Faith that Scripture is the Word of God. This is the first part of his Position. The second is, that Scripture, by <hi>the internal light</hi> which is in it, founds a <hi>Divine</hi> Faith that it is the Word of God, when we frame a high <hi>Moral</hi> esteem of it, and are induc'd to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57798:61"/>
read it as a thing most likely to be Gods Word, by the <hi>fallible</hi> Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church. While therefore he here undertakes to prove, that his <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of proving Scripture to be the Word of God, is according to the use of the ancient Church, let us have an eye to these two points, and see whether his Authorities prove them, or no. First then his Authorities must prove, that before we read Scripture it self, we have not <hi>Divine</hi> Faith, but onely a <hi>Moral</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by Church-Tradition, that it is the Word of God.</p>

                  <hi>Lirinensis, (lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.) who makes our Faith to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed both by <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> of <hi>the Catholique Church.</hi> The Faith he here speaks of is not any <hi>humane, fallible</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but <hi>true, Christian,</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Faith; for he opposes it to Heresie, and calls it <hi>Sound Faith,</hi> and <hi>his Faith, (Fidem suam,</hi> the Faith of a Christian) nay, he sayes <hi>the Tradition</hi> of the Catholique Church must needs as truly <hi>munire fidem,</hi> (confirm <hi>Divine</hi> Faith) as Scripture, though Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture does it in a more high and noble manner, as being the <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, prime Revelation</hi> of God. This then proves not his intent, but the quite contrary. Secondly, <hi>Henricus à Gandavo</hi> sayes expresly, <hi>Credunt per istam famam,</hi> (they <hi>believe</hi> by this Relation of Church-Tradition) and this is such a Belief, that Christ is said <hi>to enter their hearts</hi> by means of the Church. <hi>Christus intrat per mulierem, id est, Ecclesiam.</hi> But Christ cannot enter into a Soul by a meer <hi>humane fallible</hi> perswasion, but by <hi>Divine</hi> Faith onely. <hi>A Gandavo</hi> goes on. <hi>Plus verbis Christi in Scripturis credit, quam Ecclesiae testificanti; ergo credit Ecclesiae.</hi> He believes the Church; but how can he believe without Faith? A little after <hi>à Gandavo</hi> sayes, <hi>Primam fidem tribua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Scripturis Canonicis, secundam subistâ Definitionibus &amp; Consuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Ecclesiae Catholicae.</hi> Here's <hi>prima &amp; secunda fides:</hi> But yet both of them are properly and truly Faith. And to the end all may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand he means no other, but <hi>Supernatural</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Faith, as to be given both to the Scriptures and the Church, he addes a third manner of giving credit to others, <hi>Post istas studiosis viris, non sub poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>perfidiae, sed proterviae.</hi> After these two, viz. Scriptures and Church-Definitions, he sayes we <hi>believe</hi> also <hi>learned men,</hi> but in a far other degree of assent, from that which was given to the Scriptures, and to the Church; <hi>non sub poenâ perfidiae, sed proterviae:</hi> For the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit we give to them obliges not under pain of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> or errour in Faith, (if we dissent from them) but under pain of <hi>pertinacious pride,</hi> in preferring our selves before them.</p>
               <p>Seeing therfore he addes this limitation to the third kinde of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief onely, he tacitely grants, that if we contradict either Scripture, or Church, it is <hi>sub poenâ perfidiae,</hi> under pain of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and not of <hi>Proterviousness</hi> onely. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he accounts the Definitions of the Church sufficient to assure us <hi>infallibly</hi> of Divine Truths; otherwise it would not be <hi>Infidelity,</hi> Errour in Faith, or Heresie, to contradict them. Lastly, <hi>à Gandavo</hi> is cited in these words, <hi>Quod autem credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:57798:61"/>
Faith, in regard of the Church: for he asserts presently, that it is clear, (<hi>constat</hi>) that the writings of the Scripture, and other Articles of Faith, preach'd by the former Pastours, are not changed by their Successours; and this does <hi>constare ex consensione concordi in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>  ad tempor a nostra,</hi> by the unanimous consent of all Succeeders, even to our present times. But sure a thing that is fallible, uncertain, and questionable, cannot be said <hi>constare</hi> (to be clear and unquestionable) as he affirms the unanimous consent of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages to be. Now the Bishop minces it in his Translation of the word <hi>constat,</hi> turning it <hi>now it appears.</hi> For a thing may be said to <hi>appear</hi> either clearly, or obscurely. He should therefore have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther translated it, <hi>now it evidently appears,</hi> had he not intended to make some pretty Turn by his Translation. Hence is evinced, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of his Authorities, brought to prove, that Church-Tradition founds onely a <hi>probable humane</hi> perswasion that Scripture is Gods Word, rather evince the quite contrary.</p>
               <p>The second point to be concluded is, that Scripture, thus led in by the Church, proves it self Infallibly and Divinely, by its internall light to such as had no supernatural Faith precedently. This he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to evince from some expressions of the Fathers, who use some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the like proofs, to shew that Scripture is the Word of God. But first, do they alwayes bring these proofs to such as had no Divine Faith before of Scriptures-being Gods Word? Do they not use them, both for themselves and others, who precedently had a Divine Faith of that point? Secondly, do the Fathers say, that those proofs of theirs are the <hi>Primary, Infallible,</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> proofs of Scriptures<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being the word of God? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  do they not rather use them as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary</hi> arguments, perswasive onely to such as believed Scripture to be Gods Word precedently to them? Thirdly, do they use one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such proofs, as are <hi>wholly internal</hi> to Scripture it self? All these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions must be made good, to make a full proof for his purpose, out of them.</p>
               <p>Now touching the two first conditions, 'tis evident these proofs were made by Christians, namely the Holy Fathers, and commonly to Christians, who lived in their times. And as clear is it, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pronounced them to be the <hi>Primary, Infallible,</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of their belief in that point, not used they them as such. And for the third condition, <hi>viz.</hi> of the proofs being <hi>internal</hi> to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they are not all such. For first that of <hi>Miracles</hi> is externall. The Scriptures themselves work none; neither were ever any Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought, to confirm; that all the Books now in the Canon (and no more) are the word of God. Secondly, the Conversion of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people and Nations, by the doctrine contain'd in Scripture, is also external to Scripture, unless haply it came by reading the Scripture, and not by the declaration and preaching of the Church; which he proves not, and the contrary is rather manifest. Again, many other Books beside Scripture contain the same doctrine, yet are not thereby prov'd to be Gods Word. Were not many thousands converted to that <hi>humble</hi> doctrine of Christ, before divers of the Canonical Books were written? Nay, many whole Nations (as St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> already
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57798:62"/>
alledged, witnesses, some hundreds of years after the said Books were written) who knew nothing at all of Scripture.</p>
               <p>But suppose these four proofs mentioned by the Bishop, <hi>viz.</hi> first <hi>Miracles;</hi> secondly <hi>Doctrine nothing carnal;</hi> thirdly <hi>performance of it;</hi> Fourthly, <hi>The Conversion almost of the whole world by this Doctrine,</hi> had been, all of them, <hi>internal</hi> to Scripture, yet how prove they <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly</hi> and <hi>Divinely</hi> that Scripture is the Word of God. <hi>Perswade</hi> truly they may, but <hi>convince</hi> they cannot. Touching the first, how will it appear, that Miracles were ever wrought in <hi>immediate</hi> proof of the whole Bible, as it is receiv'd in the Canon? As for the second, how many Books are there, beside Scripture, which have nothing of <hi>Carnal Doctrine</hi> at all in them? Concerning the third and fourth, how can it ever be prov'd, that either <hi>the performance</hi> of this Doctrine, or <hi>the Conversion</hi> of Nations is <hi>internal</hi> to Scripture?</p>
               <p>But who can sufficiently wonder, that his Lordship for these four Motives should so easily make the Scripture give <hi>Divine</hi> Testimony to it self, upon which our Faith must rest, and yet deny the same pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to the Church? Seeing it cannot be deny'd, but that every one of these Motives are much more immediately and clearly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Church, then to Scripture. For first, <hi>Miracles</hi> have most copiously and familiarly confirmed the Authority and lawful Mission of the Pastours. Secondly, the Doctrine of Gods true Church hath nothing of <hi>Carnal</hi> in it. The <hi>Performance,</hi> or verifying of this Doctrine, is onely found in the Members of the Church. Lastly, it is the Church that hath preach'd this <hi>humble Doctrine</hi> of Christ, and that hath converted, and still doth convert Nations to the belief of it, and submission to it. Who sees not by this, that while he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes most eagerly against the present Churches Infallibility, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues mainly for it?</p>

'Tis now high time to put a Period to this Controversie touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Churches <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and <hi>Resolution</hi> of Faith; which I should have done long since, had not our Antagonist led us so long, and so intricate a Dance, through the redoubled Meanders of his Labyrinth.

For St. <hi>Austin</hi> often urges Arguments, which are onely <hi>Secondary</hi> and probable, yea sometimes purely conjectural, in this kinde. See an example of this in the <note n="a" place="margin">Sicut ergo ego credo illum librum esse Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaei, quoniam ex ipso tempore, que Manichaeus vivebat in carne, per Discipulos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> margin. What the Bishop quotes out of <hi>Thomas Waldensis,</hi> Doct. Fid. Tom. 1. lib. 2. Art. 2. cap. 23. num. 9. (<hi>that if the Church should speak anything contrary to Scripture, he would not believe her</hi>) is most true; but it is likewise as true, (what St. <hi>Austin</hi> said above, <hi>contr. Epist. Fundament. cap.</hi> 5.) that if the Scripture should speak any thing contrary to the Church, we could not believe <hi>that</hi> neither. The truth is, both the one and the other, that is, both <hi>Waldensis</hi> and St. <hi>Austins</hi> expressions proceed <hi>ex suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitione impossibili;</hi> and are wholly like that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (<hi>Gal.</hi> 1.) <hi>If an Angel from heaven preach any thing, otherwise then we have preached, let him be accursed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But for all these <hi>Turns and Windings</hi> it will be hard to free the Bishop from a vicious Circle. For if he allow not Scripture to be believ'd with <hi>Divine</hi> Faith by vertue of the Churches Testimony and Tradition, what answer can be made to this Question, <hi>Why believe you infallibly that Scripture is Gods Word?</hi> If he say, for the Tradition of the Church, it will not serve: seeing he is suppos'd to have no <hi>Divine</hi> Faith, that Scripture is Gods Word, from the sole Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Church. Yet when both partles press this Circle against each other, they alwayes suppose, that Scripture is <hi>Infallibly</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely</hi> believ'd for Gods Word, in some true sense, by means of the Churches Testimony. Otherwise it were as impertinent to press this Question to a Christian, (<hi>why believe you the Scripture to be the Word of God</hi>) that has no further certainty of it, then what is drawn from a probable and humane Testimony of the Church, as if it were propounded to a Heathen, who had onely heard Scripture recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for Gods Word, by persons very worthy of credit. For both of these were equally to answer, that they deny'd the suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an <hi>Infallible</hi> Belief, since they did not believe (as Christians take the word <hi>Belief</hi>) that it is Gods Word. And then no marvel if there be no Circle committed, when there is no <hi>Christian</hi> Belief,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57798:63"/>
which both sides presuppose as a ground of this Circle, where ever it is found.</p>
               <p>When therefore the Relatour speaks of <hi>proving Scripture by the Church,</hi> unless he mean <hi>proving</hi> it by a <hi>Medium</hi> sufficient to assure us <hi>infallibly</hi> that it is the Word of God, (which he constantly refuses to grant) though he fall not into a Circle, yet he falls into a Semi-Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that is, a <hi>Crooked Turn</hi> in his Labyrinth, by mis-stating the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bowing it another way, then it ought to be, and alwayes is propounded in this Controversie, as I said above. Wherefore if the Church give onely a humane Testimony to induce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  a <hi>fallible</hi> assent that Scripture is the Word of God; and Scripture afterwards by its own light gives me an infallible Certainty, that the Testimony of the Church was true, there could never have been the least ground for wise and learned men to move this difficulty of a <hi>vicious Circle</hi> one against another; no more, then when I believe it probable, that to morrow will be a fair day, because <hi>Peter</hi> tells me so, and after I know certainly that <hi>Peter</hi> told me true, because I see the next day to be fair, by its own light.</p>
               <p>His Lordship therefore was either to suppose, that those <hi>Beginners</hi> and <hi>Weaklings</hi> he speaks of, have some degree of <hi>Divine</hi> Faith, that Scripture is the Word of God, by means of the Churches Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, antecedently to the reading of Scripture, or he commits the fallacy term'd <hi>ex falso supposito,</hi> (of making a false supposition) and so by avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one errour falls into another. For unless he believe <hi>infallibly</hi> that Scripture is Gods word, upon the Testimony of the Church, as a true Cause and Motive of his Infallible Belief, he doth not answer the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, seeing all that affirm they believe this for the Churches Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, understand it so: and if he do, he forsakes his own principles, falls to us, and consequently into that pretended Circle he objects against us, if his objections be of force.</p>
               <p>His Lordships Resolution of Faith into <hi>Prime Apostolical Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> we have <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 6. num. 1, 2.</note> above evinced to be impossible, supposing the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, or present Church-Tradition to be fallible: but were it possible, we have also evidenced, that it destroys his own grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>sole</hi> Scriptures-being the Foundation of our belief. When therefore he averres, <hi>that we may resolve our Faith into Prime Tradition when it is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>known to be such,</hi> if he means by <hi>known</hi> (as he must) such a knowledge as may suffice to make that <hi>Prime</hi> Tradition <hi>an object</hi> of Faith, he wheels quite about to amuse his Reader, and sayes in effect, <hi>we may then</hi> resolve our Faith into Tradition, when that comes to pass, which himself holds impossible ever to happen. For if <hi>Prime Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> can be onely gather'd by the perpetual succeeding Tradition of the Church, (as 'tis certain it can onely be) and that Tradition be fallible, (as the Bishop perpetually contends) how shall any <hi>Prime Tradition</hi> be known sufficiently to make it self <hi>an object</hi> of Faith, since nothing can do that, but an Authority Infallible, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  us <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> certain of that Tradition?</p>
               <p>Hence he runs two contrary wayes at once; desirous on the one side to resolve Faith into <hi>Prime Tradition,</hi> that he may not seem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Ancient Fathers; and yet on the other so willing to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57798:63"/>
be repugnant to us, that by his grounds he makes that Resolution wholly impossible: and to blinde these contrarieties, pretends that Church-Tradition, being not <hi>simply Divine,</hi> cannot be such as may suffice for a <hi>formal object</hi> of Faith, whereinto it is to be resolv'd; when yet he knew full well the difficulty lay not there, and that his Adversaries never affirm'd it was <hi>simply Divine,</hi> or the <hi>formal object</hi> of Faith, but spake alwayes warily and reservedly, abstracting from that question as not necessary for the solving of his arguments, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Catholick Faith against him. Let the Bishops Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents but confess, that the Testimony and Tradition of the Church is truly <hi>infallible,</hi> and we for the present shall require no more of them. For that <hi>Infallibility</hi> suppos'd, we have made it manifest, that <hi>Prime Tradition</hi> is sufficiently derived to us in quality of <hi>the formal object</hi> of our Faith, whereon to rest: which in his Lordships princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is impossible to be done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Concerning the Relators endeavor to reconcile the Fathers, whom he conceives to speak sometimes contrary to one another, <hi>touching Scripture and Tradition,</hi> though he doth not much oblige us in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those he brings in favour of our assertion, (for he names one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two, and one of them somewhat lamely cited with an &amp;c.) yet surely we are to thank him for his fair and candid exposition of those, he quotes against us. For he professes, that when ever the Fathers speak of relying <hi>upon Scripture onely, they are never to be understood with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of Tradition;</hi> wherein doubtless his Lordship delivers a great truth, and nothing contrary to us. But as for his challenge which follows, we cannot but say that's loud indeed; but the sound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes its emptiness. He will oblige us to shew that the holy Fathers maintain that, which we need not affirm to be held by them. For we never yet said, that our Faith of the Scriptures-being Gods Word is <hi>resolved into the Tradition of the present Church,</hi> but into <hi>Prime</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Tradition; of which we are <hi>infallibly</hi> certified by the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the present Church: it being a <hi>condition,</hi> or <hi>application</hi> of <hi>Prime</hi> Tradition to us. And by this manner of defending our Tenets, we have both gone along with <hi>A. C.</hi> and those Divines, who affirm the voice of the Church not to be so <hi>simply</hi> and <hi>absolutely Divine,</hi> as is the holy Scripture; and given a full solution to all the Relatours ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: the most of which suppose us, upon a false ground, necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to acknowledge the voice of the Church, to be so <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>simply</hi> Divine, that our Faith is to rest upon it, as its <hi>ultimate Motive</hi> and <hi>formall Object,</hi> which must be no lesse then <hi>absolute Divine</hi> Authority.</p>
               <p>But supposing we held our Faith to be so <hi>resolv'd,</hi> would his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship press us to shew those very terms, <hi>resolving of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. in the Ancient Fathers; it being a <hi>School-term,</hi> not used in their times? It seems he would, by his false citation of St. <hi>Austin</hi> in these words, <hi>Fidei ultima resolutio est in Deum illuminantem. S. Aug. contr. Fund.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>cap.</hi> 14. where there is no such Text to be found; nor any where else (I am confident) in all St. <hi>Austin.</hi> For us it is sufficient, that the Fathers frequently say, <hi>We believe Scripture for Tradition, we would not believe Scripture, unless the Authority of the Church moved</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:57798:64"/>
                  <hi>us, that Traditions move to piety, no less then Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. But since he urges to have our Resolution of Faith shewed him in those terms, in the Fathers, we challenge his Defenders to shew any Father, who saith, that we cannot believe Scripture to be the Word of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly, for the Churches authority, but must resolve it into the light of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I come now to his <hi>Considerations,</hi> and begin with the first point, touching his proving Scripture to be a Principle in Theology, that must be pre-suppos'd without proof, because <hi>in all Sciences there are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. Num. 34. Punct. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>ever some Principles presupposed.</hi> I answer first, he confounds Theology, a Discursive Science, with Faith, which is an act of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing produced by an Impulse of the will, for Gods Authority reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not deduced by discursive Principles; and consequently holds no parallel with any Science whatsoever, in this particular. Secondly, I say, I have already answered this matter to the full, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>num.</hi> 7. and <hi>chap.</hi> 6. <hi>num.</hi> 5. in the Dialogue: to which places I refer the Reader for further satisfaction. Must we make that a <hi>Prime</hi> principle in the Resolution of our Faith, which has further princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and clearer <hi>quoad nos</hi> to move our assent to them? He himself acknowledges, that Scripture was <hi>ascertained</hi> for Gods Word to those of the Apostles times, by the Authority of <hi>Prime Apostolical</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: how was it then a Principle? which cannot, ought not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but must be presupposed by all Christians.</p>
               <p>Concerning his second point, the difference betwixt Faith and <note place="margin">Punct. 2.</note> other Sciences we acknowledge. For there the thing assented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains obscure; which in Sciences is made clear: and all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, to be certifi'd of the Divine Authority, assuring us that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is Gods Word; of which we cannot be <hi>ascertain'd</hi> without sufficient Motives, inducing us to give an <hi>Infallible</hi> Assent to it. But no <hi>fallible</hi> Motives can produce <hi>Certainty.</hi> There must be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some <hi>Infallible</hi> Motive to assure us; and seeing he denies the Church to be it, and we have prov'd that it cannot be <hi>the sole light</hi> of Scripture, we must have some further light, clearer <hi>quoad nos,</hi> then God hath reveal'd to us in Scripture: which is plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to his Proposition.</p>
               <p>His third point contains no more in summe, then what I have said <note place="margin">Punct. 3.</note> above in my first Answer to his first point of Consideration. I shall not therefore quarrel with it.</p>
               <p>As to his fourth point we grant, that the <hi>Incarnation of our Saviour,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Punct. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>the Resurrection of the dead, and the like Mysteries cannot finally be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd into the sole Testimony of the Church,</hi> (nor did we ever do it) but into the Infallible Authority of God, as we have often confessed.</p>
               <p>In his fifth point recommended to <hi>Consideration,</hi> there are also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <note place="margin">Punct. 5.</note> things, which the Relatour himself should have better consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before they fell from his pen. For first, he asserts on the one side, <hi>that Faith was never held a matter of Evidence;</hi> and <hi>that had it been clear, in its own light, to the Hearers of the Apostles, that they were inspir'd in what they preacht and writ, they had apprehended all the Mysteries of Divinity by Knowledge, and not by Faith.</hi> Yet on the other side, almost
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57798:64"/>
with the same breath, avoucheth, that <hi>it appeared clear to the Prophets, and Apostles, that what ever they taught, was Divine and Infallible Truth,</hi> and <hi>that they had clear Revelation.</hi> What is this in effect, (supposing the Truth of his first Proposition) but to exclude the Prophets and Apostles from the number of the Faithful, and make them, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, like the Blessed in Heaven, <hi>Comprehensores,</hi> while they were yet in <hi>the way?</hi> Which is manifestly contrary to their own frequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, that they <hi>walked by Faith,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 7. 1 Cor. 13. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>not by Sight,</hi> and that they saw onely <hi>per speculum, in aenigmate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, in point of Miracles he avers, that they are not <hi>convincing</hi> proofs alone and of themselves. Sure the Bishop thought no proof <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing,</hi> but what is actually <hi>converting:</hi> which is a great mistake. For true Miracles are in themselves <hi>convincing</hi> proofs, since in themselves they <hi>deserve</hi> belief, whether they actually convert, or not, and leave the Hearers <hi>inexcusable</hi> in Gods sight for not believing. Otherwise why should our Blessed Saviour have said, <hi>Had I not done among them</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joan. 15. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>the works, which no other man did, they had not sinned;</hi> and again, <hi>Woe be to thee Corozain, woe be to thee Bethsaida; for had the Miracles,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>done amongst you, been wrought in Tyrus and Sidon, they had long since done Pennance in sackcloth and ashes.</hi> Likewise, <hi>The works, which I do in my Fathers name, bear witness of me:</hi> and, <hi>though you believe not me,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joan. 10. 26, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>believe my works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Bishops reasons, brought in disparagement of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, seem as strange as his Doctrine. First (saith he) the Apostles Miracles were no <hi>convincing</hi> proofs alone of the Truth they attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because (forsooth) <hi>there may be Counterfeit Miracles;</hi> just as if a man should say, <hi>Simon Peters</hi> Miracles did not convincingly oblige men to believe, because <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  Magus's</hi> did not. Secondly, they are not <hi>convincing</hi> proofs, <hi>because even true Miracles may be marks of false Doctrine in the highest degree.</hi> Is not this a strange Paradox? Do not all Divines, even Protestants themselves, confess, that true Miracles are not feasable, but by the <hi>special</hi> and extraordinary power of God? That they are <hi>Divine</hi> Testimonies? and that by them God sets, as it were, his Hand and Seal to the truth of the Doctrine attested by them? Say they not 'tis Blasphemy to affirm, that God bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to a Lye? <note n="b" place="margin">Nam quis vel cogitet abs<expan>

                  </note> See the Margin. It may well suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice therefore to leave our Adversary to the reproof of his own Party. Neither need we take notice of his Scripture-Texts, since they cannot without impiety be understood of any other, then <hi>false</hi> and <hi>feigned</hi> Miracles.</p>
               <p>The sixth Point, concerning the <hi>light of Scripture,</hi> hath nothing <note place="margin">Punct. 6.</note> but what is already answered, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>num.</hi> 5, 6, and 7. Were Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, by its own light, capable of being the <hi>Prime,</hi> Infallible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of our Belief that 'tis Gods Word, though it need not be so evident as the Motives of Knowledge, yet at least it must have something in it, to make that <hi>Infallible</hi> Belief not <hi>imprudent:</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:57798:65"/>
Which in the Relatours Principles is not found.</p>
               <p>The Flourishes of his seventh <hi>Consideration</hi> are very handsome; <note place="margin">Punct. 7.</note> but the <hi>Dilemma</hi> in his Consequence flows not immediately from his Premises, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>either there is no revelation, or Scripture is it.</hi> For if he would prove, that Scripture must be it if there be any, by the sole light of Scripture, (as he hath hitherto pretended) I have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc'd it to be inconsequent. Would he prove Scripture to be that Revelation (supposing there be any) by the intervention of Church-Tradition, assuring us that it is such, it is true, but Diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to his Principles. Again he wheels a little about. For no man ever deny'd that Scripture is Gods <hi>Revelation,</hi> supposing he hath made Revelations, so that in proving this he hurts not his Adversary: but his Province was to prove that Scripture <hi>onely</hi> was Gods Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Why then omits he here the word <hi>onely,</hi> which caused the whole Controversie?</p>
               <p>His last <hi>Consideration</hi> is a dark <hi>Meander.</hi> For the Motives of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility <note place="margin">Punct. 8.</note> he there musters up, preceding the light of Scripture, are indeed of force to justifie ones Belief that Scripture is Gods Word, when 'tis receiv'd, as the Ancients did receive it, upon the Infallible Authority of Church-Tradition; but never otherwayes. And our present Question is not, whether his Lordship does well in believing Scripture to be the Word of God, as all those Motives of Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, here mentioned by him, perswade; but whether he doth well in teaching, that Scripture ought to be believ'd with <hi>Divine</hi> Faith, for its onely inbred light, as <hi>the formal Object.</hi> And in this opinion I would gladly know, how the recounted Motives can justifie his proceeding. For though no man can doubt, but most of those Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives may be applied to our Belief in the Articles of our Creed, yet (in his opinion) they will not justifie the Believing those Articles with <hi>Divine</hi> Faith, independently of Scripture, which he makes the whole Foundation of believing them with Divine Faith.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Its worth noting, what we hear him now at last acknowledge, <note place="margin">Punct. 9.</note> (for all the rest in this page is a meer repetition of what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready answered) <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>being arrived to the Light of the Text it self, and meeting with the Spirit of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then and not before, we are certain that Scripture is the word of God, both by Divine and Infallible proof.</hi> So that here he manifestly acknowledges, that those, who are not arrived to the light of Scripture in it self, have no <hi>divine</hi> nor <hi>infallible</hi> proof of its being Gods Word; and consequently have no Divine Faith of the mysteries of Christian Religion; and so are neither truly Christians, nor capable of salvation: which consequences how horridly they will sound in the ears of the unlearned, I leave to the Reader.</p>
               <p>And to make them more sensible of the foulness of this errour, let them consider, that when young and unlearned Christians are taught to say their <hi>Creed,</hi> and profess their belief of the Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, before they read Scripture, they are taught <hi>to lye,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess to do that, which they neither do, nor can do in his Tenet: and consequently, since it is unlawfull to <hi>lye,</hi> (and much more in matters of Religion, then in others) it will also follow, that it is unlawfull
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57798:65"/>
for any one to teach unlearned persons their Creed, and as unlawfull for them either to learn it, or rehearse it, before they have seen those Articles proved by Scripture. For by this word <hi>Believe</hi> there must be meant (as all agree) a <hi>formal,</hi> Christian, and <hi>Divine</hi> Faith of those Articles.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Finally we are told of his Lordships good intention in having proceeded <hi>in a Synthetical way, to build up the Truth for the Benefit of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>Church, and the satisfaction of all Christianly disposed.</hi> But he had done much better, had he proceeded in an <hi>Analytical</hi> way; for in that was the difficulty, namely to assign the first Principle, on which our Faith is grounded, in the Resolution of Faith; which we are far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending by this <hi>Synthetical</hi> way; which confounds the Reader with Multiplicity of Arguments, and weakens the Authority of the Church: without which he might tire himself and others, but never be able to make a clear Resolutionof Faith.</p>
               <p>Well therefore might <hi>A. C.</hi> without note of <hi>Captiousness,</hi> require the <hi>Analytical</hi> way, yet give all <hi>all due respect to Scripture.;</hi> though the Relatour (it seems) would willingly insinuate the contrary. For the Question being started, <hi>whether the Scriptures onely, or besides them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions, were the Foundation of our Faith;</hi> the Bishop main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the first, and <hi>A. C.</hi> the second. Now <hi>A. C.</hi> could not more directly, nor efficaciously overthrow his Lordships Tenet, then by proving, that the Assurance we have even of Scriptures themselves relyes upon Tradition, or the unwritten Word of God: which therefore must necessarily be the Foundation of our Faith.</p>
               <p>His endeavour to bring <hi>A. C.</hi> and us into a Labyrinth (like his own) of a <hi>vicious Circle,</hi> by retorting the Question (which he calls <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> it may be, because himself was taken in it) I have already prov'd ineffectual; because both <hi>A. C.</hi> and our other Authours, give the motives of Credibility, as a preceding and <hi>uncircular</hi> ground for the Infallibility of Church-Tradition. So that the Relator cannot retort the Question so easily as he imagines, nor rid his hands so soon of the <hi>Jesuit,</hi> by demanding, <hi>How he knows the Testimony of the Church to be Divine and Infallible?</hi> falsely supposing us to say, that the Churches Infallibility is founded upon the Testimony of Scripture, and the Scriptures Infallibility upon the Testimony of the Church: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof I have sufficiently deliver'd and declared, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. When therefore he demands, <hi>how we know the Testimony of the Church to be infallible,</hi> we answer, that we prove it independently of Scripture, by the Motives of Credibility, immediately shewing it to be evidently credible in it self; as the like motives made this point evidently cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to the Faithful heretofore, that the Prophets and Apostles were Infallible. And 'tis evident to any judicious man, that herein is not the least shadow of a Circle.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Relatour will not yet permit us to put a period to this Question; but wrangles with <hi>A. C.</hi> for telling him, what he thought his Lordship said. But I had rather dispute, what he doth, or can say in this matter. He expounds his own minde thus, <hi>That the Books of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Scripture are Principles to be supposed, and need no proof in regard of those men, who are born in the Church, and in their very Christian Education,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:57798:66"/>
                  <hi>suck it in, and are taught, so soon as they are apt to learn it, that the Books, commonly called the Bible, or Scripture, are the Word of God.</hi> But here he ought to have reflected, that to make good this supposition, so far as to the breeding in us a <hi>Supernatural</hi> Act of Faith, it must also of necessity be supposed, at least tacitely, that the Scriptures are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by the Infallible Authority of the Church. Wherefore in this assertion that Scripture <hi>onely</hi> is the Foundation of Faith, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts what he ought to have presuppos'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that Scripture was held to be Gods Word for the Authority of the Church. So that though it be against Art and Reason <hi>to question the Subject,</hi> or put our Adversary to prove Scripture to be the Word of God, when we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute whether Transubstantiation, Purgatory, or the like <hi>Predicates,</hi> be contain'd in Scripture; yet against one that denies the necessity of Tradition, we require a proof of Scripture it self, as knowing he could not have any other good ground of supposing Scripture to be Gods Word, besides the Tradition of the Church: which he now denying, doth either contradict himself, or deprive the Scripture of all Authority.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I make no difference at all in this point between a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man,</hi> and a man <hi>newly entring,</hi> or <hi>doubting in Faith,</hi> and those who pretend <hi>to be grown up in Faith,</hi> and yet impugne the Tradition of the Church. For all these are after one and the same Method to be dealt with, that so they may be brought to admit the true grounds of proving Scripture to be the Word of God. It was therefore no <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with impiety,</hi> nor desire to <hi>catch</hi> advantage, that mov'd <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> and <hi>A. C.</hi> to demand, how Scripture could be prov'd the Word of God: for they were forced to it by their Adversaries denying the Necessity of Tradition. And the advantage is to your selves; that by this <hi>Medium</hi> (which Protestants ever decline) you may discern the weakness of your own Foundation.</p>
               <p>In the very Porch of this Paragraph the Bishop (as if he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied <note place="margin">§. 18. n. 1.</note> the <hi>Gordian</hi> knot of Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> Arguments) brags <hi>he set him to his Book again.</hi> But I am confident, it was rather the <hi>not untying</hi> this knot, that mov'd him to repeat what he had writ before. For this repetition shew'd clearly, the Bishop said no more then what Dr. <hi>White</hi> had said before him; and consequently that Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> words spoken to the Doctour, were sufficient to solve all the Bishop had said. Wherefore as the Bishop did <hi>actum agere,</hi> (do onely what was done by the Doctour before) so he made Mr. <hi>Fisher dictum dicere,</hi> (to say again what was said before) since there needs no <hi>new Solution,</hi> where no <hi>new difficulty</hi> is propounded. And when we hear him talking of <hi>Metaphysical Principles,</hi> it seems they are too clear to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; and therefore he waves them, as too quaint niceties to be reflected upon by the Reader.</p>
               <p>Neither does <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> artificially cited in his Margin, any way favour his Lordship. For when he gives an Advertisement, that all Hereticks suppose with Catholicks, as a general Principle, <hi>that the Word of God is a rule of Faith,</hi> he speaks not of the <hi>sole written</hi> Word, (as the Bishop will needs misinterpret him) but of the Word of God <hi>abstractively,</hi> or as it embraces both <hi>the written</hi> and <hi>unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:57798:66"/>
Word. <hi>His omnibus Quaestionibus</hi> (sayes he) <hi>praemittenda est Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversia de VERBO DEI,</hi> &amp;c. even as our Adversary cites him; he sayes not <hi>de VERBO DEI SCRIPTO,</hi> but <hi>de VERBO DEI.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bishop and <hi>Hooker</hi> avoid not the difficulty by calling it a <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Principle amongst Christians.</hi> For if they <hi>suppose</hi> this with any <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> ground, they must <hi>suppose</hi> it founded upon <hi>Tradition.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>A. C's</hi> Argument has still the same force, even in this suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Praecognitum,</hi> as before. For when a thing is admitted as a Principle by both parties, in any particular Debate touching Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis presupposed onely as a <hi>Praecognitum</hi> to that difficulty, not as an <hi>absolute Prime</hi> Principle in Religion; and is left in that Order of <hi>Priority</hi> or <hi>Posteriority</hi> of Principles, which its proper nature requires. Wherefore though both the Relatour and Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> had supposed Scripture as a Principle agreed on by both parties, in order to some further Question, depending of Scripture, (which notwithstanding could not be done in this present Controversie, where the Question was about the Priority of <hi>Tradition,</hi> in order of Principles before <hi>Scripture</hi>) yet Scripture is then to be presupposed onely as a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to that particular Dispute, and cannot be thereby made a <hi>Prime</hi> Principle, absolutely and universally in Faith. Suppose (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) the Dispute were <hi>whether Extream Unction were a Sacrament,</hi> in this Dispute 'tis to be supposed as a Principle granted by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>that there are some Sacraments.</hi> But hence follows not, that it is supposed as an <hi>absolute prime</hi> Principle in Religion, which neither can nor ought to be proved by other precedent Principles, (to wit, <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Tradition</hi>) that there <hi>are some Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordship confesseth again, that Tradition must lead the way, <hi>like a preparing Morning-light to Sun-shine;</hi> but then we <hi>settle</hi> not for our direction <hi>upon the first opening of the Morning-light,</hi> but upon <hi>the Sun it self.</hi> His meaning is, that although Tradition must go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet we ought not to rely upon it <hi>as the ground</hi> for which we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Scripture, but we are to fix our eyes onely upon <hi>the brightness</hi> of Scripture it self. But I demand, how knows the Relatour, this Light is rather <hi>a Beam</hi> then a <hi>Dream,</hi> by which he is deceiv'd by the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enemy of Mankinde, who <hi>transforms himself into an Angel of Light?</hi> 'Tis true, the Scripture is called <hi>a Light;</hi> but 'tis like a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in a dark Lanthorn; or the Sun under a Cloud, in regard of all those, who deny the Infallibility of the Church, and appears in full light onely to them who acknowledge it.</p>
               <p>After some flourishes the Bishop mindes us, that there is less light in Principles of <hi>Faith,</hi> then those of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> But <hi>A. C.</hi> urgeth thus. <q>Though a <hi>Praecognitum</hi> in Faith need not be so clearly known, as a <hi>Praecognitum</hi> in Science, yet there must be this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that as <hi>primum praecognitum,</hi> the first thing foreknown in a <hi>Science,</hi> must be <hi>primo cognitum,</hi> needing not another thing, pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Science, <hi>prius cognitum,</hi> (known before it:) so if in <hi>Faith</hi> Scripture be the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>onely Foundation,</hi> and consequently the first thing foreknown, (<hi>primum praecognitum</hi>) it must be in <hi>Faith primò cognitum,</hi> needing not any other thing pertaining to Faith,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57798:67"/>
                     <hi>prius cognitum,</hi> (known before it.) This supposed Church-Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is one thing pertaining to Faith, could not (as the Bishop saith it is, and as indeed it is) be <hi>known first,</hi> and be an Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Knowledge of Scripture.</q> These are <hi>A. C's</hi> words, pag. 51. not those set down by his Lordship, and therefore he had no reason to say he <hi>is sorry to see, in a man very learned, such wilfull mistakes;</hi> but had rather cause to employ his sorrow for himself, since he could not otherwise avoid the difficulty, then by corrupting his words, whom he pretends to answer. For by omitting the <hi>Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> and changing the words he makes <hi>A. C.</hi> teach, not his own, but in part the Bishops Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. C.</hi> therefore mistook not at all, but prest home his Argument in this manner: which the Bishop solves not by saying, <hi>he consesseth every where Tradition to be the Introducer to the knowledge of Scripture.</hi> For the <hi>primum praecognitum</hi> we seek for, is not such a one as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour makes Tradition, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>Introducer</hi> onely, but such a one, as we may rely upon for an Infallible Testimony in the Resolution of Faith. Nay I adde, Scripture is not a <hi>primum praecognitum</hi> even to this Question, <hi>Whether the Scriptures contain in them all things necessary to salvation.</hi> For if in this Proposition it be suppos'd that Scripture is the Word of God, it must also, at least implicitely, be suppos'd as prov'd by Tradition: and consequently both in this and all other Questions, Tradition must be the <hi>praecognitum,</hi> and <hi>primò cognitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. But put case, the Bishop held the Scriptures-being the Word of God, as a <hi>supposed Principle,</hi> meerly <hi>in materiâ subjectâ;</hi> yet should he not have said absolutely, (as he doth) <hi>That the Books of Scripture are Principles to be supposed, and need not to be proved;</hi> but should have said, <hi>We are now to suppose Scripture to be the Word of God in order to this Question, and are not to prove it.</hi> But the truth is, in this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> viz. <hi>How the Bishop knew Scripture to be Scripture,</hi> even as it related to the present Controversie betwixt them, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was not to be supposed, <hi>as a Principle,</hi> to be Gods Word. For the Question then agitated was not, <hi>Whether Scriptures contain in them all things necessary to Salvation,</hi> there being no mention of that, but onely <hi>whether the Creed contained all Fundamental Points?</hi> And the immediate occasion of Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> demanding this Question, was this answer of the Bishop, <hi>viz. That the Scriptures onely, not any unwritten Tradition, was the Foundation of their Faith.</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> demanded, <hi>how he knew Scripture to be Scripture,</hi> and in particular, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis, Exodus,</hi> &amp;c. These are believed (sayes Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi>) to be Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, yet not <hi>proved</hi> out of any place of Scripture. Now 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that in this Debate Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> had Logically right to demand this Question, it being a direct <hi>Medium</hi> and Argument to infringe the Bishops Tenet. For by this means his Doctrine was evinced to be false; because if there be <hi>some point</hi> of Protestant Faith not founded in Scripture, <hi>Scriptures onely</hi> are not the Foundation of their Faith. Whence it follows, that even though the Question had been <hi>whether Scriptures contain in them all things necessary to Salvation,</hi> yet Scriptures in order to that were not to be <hi>suppos'd</hi> to be the Word of God, since
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57798:67"/>
the very believing them to be so (at least in his principles) is a point necessary to salvation; which gives right to his Antagonist to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his assertion, by instancing that Scriptures-being the word of God is not contained in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="10">10. His Lordship here undertakes a hard task, and pretends to make it appear to <hi>A. C.</hi> how Scripture is a <hi>praecognitum</hi> even in the <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 4.</note> strictest sense. But behold his reason. Scripture is a <hi>praecognitum, because 'tis known in clear light by God, and the Blessed in heaven.</hi> Is not this an invincible argument? I am sorry to see him so much mistake the Question. For we are not in search after a <hi>praecognitum</hi> in order to God and the Saints in heaven, but in relation to us upon earth; to whom it is as much unknown, whether God and the Saints see Scriptures to be his Divine Oracles, as it is, whether the same Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures be Gods word, or not, abstracting from Tradition. Is not this (in respect of us) to bring <hi>non-cognita</hi> for <hi>praecognita?</hi> Besides, what avails it me for the Resolution of my Faith, that the Revelation is clear to God and his Saints, unless I know it be so? who have no other light for its admittance, then the Tradition of the Church.</p>
               <p>Having labour'd to prove, that <hi>Scriptures are the Oracles of God,</hi> from the clear science God and the Saints have of them (which <hi>clear Science</hi> of theirs is derived by Apostolical Tradition to the Church) the Relatour drawes a conclusion quite contrary to his Premises, namely, that <hi>Scripture is to be supposed Gods word,</hi> and needs no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent proof. If it needs no proof, why does his Lordship endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove it by such a strange kinde of Argument? Had he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed said, Scriptures being prov'd by another principle to be the word of God, must be suppos'd to be so by all that admit that proof, he had said a manifest truth. But on the one side to hold it must be prov'd by a further principle, and on the other to maintain, that it needs not be prov'd at all, cannot but seem a strange <hi>Vertigo</hi> to any Logical head. As to his conclusion in these words, <hi>And therefore now to be suppos'd (at least by all Christians) that the Scripture is the word of God,</hi> I answer, if he means by <hi>now to be suppos'd for Gods word</hi> as prov'd such by Apostolical Tradition 'tis most true: but if he mean 'tis to be <hi>suppos'd</hi> the word of God, without any <hi>precedent</hi> proof in order to us, its all out of joynt, and his answer contrary to his own principles.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Touching the Jewes, they had the like proof for <hi>the Old</hi> Testaments-being the word of God, that we have for <hi>the New.</hi> For <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 5.</note> theirs was delivered by <hi>Moyses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and ours by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;</hi> who were <hi>Prophets</hi> too. And as they that came after, received the Old Testament from the Tradition of the Church; so do we now. And this is it that St. <hi>Chysostome</hi> affirms. <hi>We know why. By</hi>

                  <hi>whose Testimony do we know?

Now the Jewes, who liv'd many hundred years after <hi>Moyses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> did not, could not hear <hi>them</hi> immediately, therefore <hi>Moyses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> could not give them an <hi>immediate</hi> testimony.

               <p>As to what the Bishop observes touching the word <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which is attributed to the Jews by holy Scripture, as also by St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in the place above cited, it imports not <hi>evident,</hi> or Scientificall Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge properly so called, but a firm and perfect <hi>assurance</hi> onely; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise our Faith would neither be <hi>free,</hi> nor meritorious. His distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therefore betwixt <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> is but a slender one, both because the Royall Prophet intimates, that the succeeding ages <hi>know</hi> the prodigious works of God by <hi>hearing</hi> them from their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Ancestors (<hi>Psalm</hi> 77. 6.) and because they that heard <hi>Moyses,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> speak, <hi>knew</hi> as perfectly by that <hi>hearing,</hi> as could be <hi>known</hi> in matters of Faith; and likewise because St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17.) <hi>Fides ex auditu,</hi> (Faith comes by hearing) and lastly, because his Lordship himself asserts, that Scripture is <hi>known</hi> (in this sense) to be the word of God, by <hi>hearing</hi> from the mouthes of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>Now to averre, that they resolved their Faith <hi>higher and into a more inward principle, then an ear to their immediate Ancestors and their Tradition,</hi> is a truth delivered by me all along this debate. For I have always held the voice of the <hi>present</hi> Church to be onely an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Application to us of the <hi>Prime Divine</hi> Tradition concerning Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, for which <hi>prime</hi> Tradition <hi>onely</hi> we believe Scripture to be the word of God, as for the <hi>formal</hi> motive of our Belief. To his <hi>Quere</hi> therefore touching the Jewes proceeding in the like contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, I answer, when it shall be shewn, that any of the Jewes held the Old Testament for their <hi>sole rule</hi> of Faith, to the exclusion of Tradition, I shall then be ready to shew what the Bishop here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>viz,</hi> that in controversies of Religion <hi>one Jew put another to prove, that the Old Testament was Gods word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to their resolution of Faith, certain it is, they had alwayes, at least very often, <hi>Prophets</hi> amongst them: insomuch that <hi>Calvin</hi> himself confesseth, <hi>that God promised to provide, there should</hi>

well known, there was in the Jewish Church a permanent <hi>infallible Authority,</hi> consisting of the High Priest and his Clergy, to which all were bound to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Wherefore we have not the least reason to doubt, but the Jews would have proceeded the same way in all difficulties concerning Scripture and Tradition, that we do, though his Lordship would perswade us the contrary.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> is here brought in (as he was once before) for aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <note place="margin">§. 19. n. 1.</note> that <hi>no other answer could be made</hi> of the Scriptures-being Gods word, <hi>but by admitting some word of God unwritten to assure us of this point:</hi> to which the Relatour replies, that <hi>the Argument would have been stronger,</hi> had he said, to assure us of this point by <hi>Divine Faith.</hi> But certainly Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> meant such an assurance, and no other, as appears by the expression he uses, <hi>viz. to assure us in this point.</hi> What <hi>point?</hi> That Scriptures are the Word of God: which being <hi>a point of Faith,</hi> he could not be thought in reason, but to require an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>proportionable</hi> to a point of Faith, that is, infallible assurance, sufficient to breed in us Divine Faith; though it be also true, that no <hi>certain</hi> assurance at all, touching this matter, could be had, without admitting the infallible Authority of the Church. For, (as it hath been urged heretofore) many Books of Holy Writ have been doubted of upon very good grounds, and the rest questioned as corrupted: So that without the infallible assistance of the Holy Ghost it were impossible in this case to come to any <hi>certain</hi> determination at all: much less could we arrive to an infallible certainty.</p>
               <p>Sure I am, the School doth not maintain, with his Lordship here, that <hi>Moral certainty is infallible.</hi> Philosophers are so far from this, as to admit, that even Physical certainty falls short of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as being lyable to deception. As for example, when I have my eyes open, and look upon the wall, I have Physical certainty, that it is the wall which I see; but I have no infallible certainty of it: for by the power of God it may be otherwise.</p>
               <p>Now the reason, why a moral and humane authority, so long as 'tis <hi>fallible,</hi> can never produce an <hi>infallible</hi> assurance is, because all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty grounded upon <hi>sole Authority,</hi> can be no greater, then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that grounds it. Since therefore (according to the Relator) all humane Authority is <hi>absolutely fallible,</hi> 'tis impossible it should ground in us an infallible certainty. This Doctrine is expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Bishop, §. 16. <hi>num.</hi> 6. where speaking of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures he saith, <hi>If they be warranted unto us by any Authority LESS THEN DIVINE, then all things contained in them (which have no greater assurance then the Scripture, in which they are contained) are not objects of Divine Belief, which once granted, will inforce us to yield, that all the Articles of Christian Belief have no greater assurance, then humane and moral Faith, or Credulity, can afford. An Authority then SIMPLY DIVINE must make good the Scriptures infallibity, at least in the last resolution of our Faith in that point. This authority cannot be any testimony, or voice of the Church alone: for the Church consists of men subject to errour.</hi> Thus he. No <hi>humane</hi> testimony therefore (in the Bishops opinion) can <hi>make good</hi> the Scriptures infallibility,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57798:69"/>
that is, give us an infallible assurance of that, or any other point of Faith. But how this can stand, with what he delivers §. 19. <hi>num.</hi> 1. (when speaking of the very same question, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Scriptures-being Gods Word,</hi> he positively affirms, we may be even <hi>infallibly assured thereof by Ecclesiastical and Humane proof</hi>) I see not, let the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er judge. This is not the first contradiction we have observed in his Lordships discourses.</p>
               <p>Nor will it serve his turn to say (as he doth) that by <hi>infallible assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> may be understood no more, <hi>then that the thing believed is true, and truth, QUA TALIS, cannot be false.</hi> For however he playes with the word <hi>infallible,</hi> yet that cannot touch <hi>assurance.</hi> For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibity he there talks of is onely in the <hi>object,</hi> and that in <hi>sensu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posito</hi> too, <hi>viz.</hi> onely so long as the object remains so. But <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> relates to the <hi>subject,</hi> or person believing, and his act; which is the thing we chiefly mean, when we teach that Faith is of divine and infallible certainty. For otherwise in the Bishops sense of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, there is no true proposition (how <hi>contingent</hi> and uncertain soever in it self) of which we might not be said to be infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. So (for example) should I say meerly by guess, <hi>The Pope is now at Rome,</hi> or <hi>in the Conclave,</hi> and it were so <hi>de facto,</hi> I might be said to be <hi>infallibly</hi> certain of it; which is extreamly absurd, as confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>verity</hi> with <hi>infallibility,</hi> which no true Philosophy will admit. Wherefore it is ridiculous to distinguish (as the Bishop does here) one infallibility <hi>cui non subest falsum,</hi> (viz. which is not <hi>de facto</hi> false, yet may be false) and another <hi>cui non potest subesse falsum,</hi> (which neither is false, nor can be false) since all Infallibility is such, <hi>cui non potest subesse falsum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To obtain therefore an infallible assurance of Scriptures-being the Word of God, we must of necessity rely upon the never-erring Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Gods Church: all other grounds assignable are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and consequently insufficient to breed in us supernatural and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith. But enough of this. Yet before I go further, I cannot omit to observe the Bishops earnest endeavour to possess the Reader, that the Scriptures (both the old and new) are come down to us so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably by meer humane Authority, <hi>that a man may thereby be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>infallibly assured that they are the word of God, by an acquired Habit of Faith:</hi> when he could not be ignorant, that there is hardly any Book of Scripture, which hath not been rejected by some Sect, or other, of Christians, and that several parts, even of the new Testament (which most concerns us) were long doubted of by divers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ancient Orthodox Writers, till the Church decided the Controversie. Nay, that their great reformer, <hi>Luther</hi> himself, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not for Canonical Scripture the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Saint <hi>James,</hi> the Epistle of Saint <hi>Jude,</hi> nor any part of the Apocalypse, or Revelation. Call you this candid dealing? is it not rather to say and unsay? or indeed to say any thing, in defence of a ruinous Cause? <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>After this the Relatour, pretending <hi>to come close to the particular,</hi> sayes, <hi>The time was, before this miserable rent in the Church of Christ, that you and wee were all of one belief.</hi> I wonder whom he means by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57798:69"/>
that <hi>WEE</hi> of his before the Rent, seeing the said <hi>WEE</hi> began with and by that Rent, not made <hi>by us,</hi> but by those that <hi>went out from us,</hi> and deserted the Catholique Church and Faith, in which they were bred up; and so became a <hi>WEE</hi> by themselves: which before <hi>the Rent</hi> so made, had no other then a meer <hi>Utopian,</hi> or <hi>Chimerical</hi> Being. Yet (as it seems by his Lordships discourse) they are pleas'd in fancying themselves <hi>Reformers of our Corruptions,</hi> while they themselves are the <hi>Corrupters.</hi> They think themselves safe in <hi>holding the Creed, and other common Principles of Belief;</hi> but so did many of the ancient Heretiques, who yet were condemn'd for such by lawfull oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Councills. They glory <hi>in ascribing</hi> (as he sayes) <hi>more sufficiency to the Scripture, then is done by us,</hi> in that they affirm it <hi>to contain all things necessary to Salvation:</hi> while by so doing (in the sense they mean it) they contradict the Scriptures themselves; which often sends them to Traditions. Call you this <hi>giving honour</hi> to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? This indeed is not onely enough; but <hi>more then enough,</hi> as the <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Bishop expresses it himself.</p>
               <p>He tells us, that for <hi>begetting and settling a Belief of this Principle,</hi> viz. <hi>that the Scripture is the Word of God, they go the same way with us, and a better too.</hi> He means they go some part of the way with us, and the rest by themselves. But certainly he ought rather to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in our way to the end, then for want of a good reason why he left it, to pin this falshood upon us, <hi>That we make the present Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition alwayes an Infallible Word of God unwritten.</hi> Apostolicall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions we hold for such indeed, since to be <hi>written</hi> or <hi>not-written</hi> are conditions meerly accidental to Gods Word: but the Tradition of the present Church, by which we are <hi>infallibly ascertain'd</hi> of the truth of those Apostolical Traditions as much as of the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, we oblige not any man to receive it for Gods <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> as the Bishop would make you believe.</p>
               <p>Their way (sayes the Bishop) is better then ours, <hi>because they resolve</hi>

                  <hi>their Faith</hi> (touching this Principle) <hi>into the written Word:</hi> which is, in plain English, that they resolve their Faith of the Scriptures-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Word into no Word of God at all: since there is not any <hi>written</hi> Word of God to tell them, that this or that Book, or indeed any Book of their whole Bible is the Word of God. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ultimately resolve their Faith of this point into little more then their own fancies; and consequently have no Divine or Supernatural Faith of this Article at all: which neverthelesse is by them laid for the <hi>Basis,</hi> or ground-work of their Belief of all other points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. Behold the excellency of their <hi>better way then ours:</hi> who ultimately resolve our Faith hereof into Gods <hi>unwritten</hi> Word, <hi>viz.</hi> the Testimony of the Apostles <hi>orally</hi> teaching it to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of their own dayes. And of this <hi>Apostolical Testimony, Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or <hi>unwritten Word</hi> of God, all the succeeding Christians of Gods Church, even to this day, have been rendred certain by the Infallible (I say not <hi>Divine</hi>) Testimony, or Tradition of the said Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Bishop to close this Dispute, speaks again to that well known place of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Contr. Epist. Fund. cap <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ego vero Evangelio non crederem, nisi me</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:57798:70"/>
                  <hi>Catholicae Ecclesiae commoveret authoritas:</hi> which he attempts to solve by telling us, that the Verb <hi>commovere</hi> is not applyable to <hi>one Motive alone,</hi> but must signifie to <hi>move together with other Motives.</hi> To this I answer, that he must be a mean Grammarian, who knows not this to be a great mistake, when no plurality of Motives is expressed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that in case St. <hi>Austins</hi> word <hi>commoveret</hi> were to be taken in the sense the Bishop gives it, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>move together</hi> with Scripture, yet his Lordship would gain little by it: since his Faith were conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be resolv'd into it, as being a <hi>Partial Motive</hi> of his Faith. Now it cannot be denyed in true Philosophy, that if one <hi>partial Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> be fallible, the Act produced by that <hi>Motive</hi> must of necessity have a mixture of Fallibility in it; every effect participating the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its cause. So even in Logick should a Syllogism have for one of its Premises a Sentence of Scripture, and for the other but a probable Proposition, the Conclusion could be no more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. And this Doctrine is according to what St. <hi>Austin</hi> delivers in the place above cited, when speaking of the Churches Authority he sayes, <hi>Quâ infirmatâ, jam nec Evangelio oredere potero,</hi> which being weakened, (or call'd in question) I shall no longer be able to believe the Gospel it self.</p>
               <p>Thus, by Gods favour, we are come to the end of this grand Controversie, touching <hi>the Resolution</hi> of Faith: wherein I have not onely shewn the insufficiency of the several <hi>wayes</hi> and <hi>methods</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Bishop; but cleared and established our own Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick way of <hi>Resolving</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>The Infallible Tradition of the present Church is the sole Clew, that guides us through the dark and intricate <hi>Meanders</hi> of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries Labyrinth. 'Tis the onely expedient, by which we can Infallibly resolve our Faith into its <hi>Prime</hi> and <hi>Formal</hi> Object, Gods Revelation. This thred is fastened to the undeniable Motives of <hi>Credibility,</hi> accompanying and pointing out the true Church: which Motives are the ground, or reason, why we believe the Church to be Infallible independently of Scripture: whereby we avoid even the shadow of a Circle.</p>
               <p>Now our Adversary, on the other side, though he grants true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith to be essentially Divine and Infallible, and that Divine Revelation, or Gods Word, is the ultimate Foundation, or Formal Object, of Faith; as also that we cannot believe with true Divine Faith, unless we have some <hi>infallible</hi> ground and Authority to assure us of the said Divine Revelation, or Word of God: yet does he not ('tis therefore to be suppos'd he could not) shew any such <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> Authority, or ground for his believing Scripture, or any other point of Faith, to be Divine Revelation, or the Word of God. The <hi>private Spirit,</hi> however mask'd under the title of Grace, hath been found to come far short in that respect: the <hi>inbred Light</hi> of Scripture it self has been evidenc'd to be too weak and dimme for that purpose. Neither can these defective means, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>private Spirit</hi> and <hi>inbred Light</hi> of Scripture, be ever heightened, or improved to that Prerogative, to wit, of giving <hi>Infallible assurance,</hi> by the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the present Church, unless that Tradition be granted to be
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57798:70"/>
                  <hi>Infallible:</hi> which the Bishop absolutely refuses to admit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by leaves both himself and his own Party, destitute of such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ground for beleeving Scripture to be Gods Word, as himself confesses necessary for attaining Supernatural and Divine Faith. The consequence I leave to the serious consideration of the judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I beseech God he may make benefit of it to his Eternal Felicity.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe Lady at length cuts off the the thred of his Lordships long Discourse, and by a Quere gives a rise to a new one. Her demand (according to Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> relation) was, <hi>Whether the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 20. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>would grant the Romane Church to be the right Church?</hi> What was the Bishops answer to this? He granted <hi>that it was.</hi> But since (it seems) he repented himself for granting so much. For afterwards in his Book he deny'd, that either the Question was askt in this form, or that the Answer was such.</p>
               <p>Had we the Ladies Question in some Authenticall Autography of her own hand, it would decide this verbal Controversie. However 'tis very likely the Lady asked not this Question <hi>out of curiosity,</hi> since she desired onely to know that which might settle her in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, being at that time so deeply perplexed as she was. Now what satisfaction would it have given her to know, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>true</hi> Church, in the precise Essence of a Church, in which she might <hi>possibly</hi> be saved, if it were neither <hi>THE true Church,</hi> that is the Catholique Church, out of which she could not be saved; nor <hi>the right Church,</hi> in which she might <hi>certainly</hi> be saved. This onely was her doubt, as appears by the whole Dispute; this having been inculcated to her by those of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church: and 'tis likely, she fram'd her question according to her doubt. But whatever her words were, she was to be understood to demand this alone, viz. <hi>Whether the Romane were not the True, Visible, Infallible</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:57798:71"/>
                  <hi>Church, out of which none could be saved:</hi> for herein she had from the beginning of the Conference desired satisfaction. See Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> Relation, pag. 42. wherein it is said, The Lady <hi>desired—to have proof brought to shew, which was that Continual, Infallible, Visible Church, in which one may, and out of which one cannot attain Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To our present purpose 'tis all one, in which of these terms the Question was demanded. For in the present subject the <hi>Romane</hi> Church could not be any Church at all, unless it were <hi>THE Church,</hi> and <hi>a right Church.</hi> The reason is, because St. <hi>Peters Successor</hi> being <hi>the Bishop of Rome,</hi> and <hi>Head of the whole Church,</hi> (as I shall fully prove anon) that must needs be <hi>THE Church</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, if it be any Church at all. In like manner if it were not <hi>a right Church,</hi> it might be a <hi>Synagogue,</hi> or <hi>Conventicle,</hi> but not a <hi>True Church of Christ.</hi> For <q>that implies a company of men agreeing in the profession of the same Christian Faith, and Communion of the same Sacraments, under the Government of lawfull Pastours; and chiefly of one Vicar of Christ upon Earth.</q> 'Tis evident, this Church can be but One; and therefore if it be a <hi>True</hi> Church, it is a <hi>Right</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>This notwithstanding hinders not the <hi>Universal</hi> Church from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided into many Diocesses; all which agreeing in the same Faith and Communion of the same Sacraments, and in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the same <hi>Vicar of Christ,</hi> make up One and the same <hi>Universal Church.</hi> But where there is difference in any of these, the Congregation that departs from the abovesaid <hi>One Faith, Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> of necessity ceases to be a Church any longer. Why so? Because <hi>Bonum ex integrâ causâ, malum ex quolibet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, <hi>THE Church</hi> signifies most properly either <hi>the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church;</hi> or if it be applied to a particular Church, <hi>the Chief Church,</hi> and by consequence the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> having fixed his Chair to that place, and by that means made his Successor Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> But had St. <hi>Peter</hi> placed his Chair elsewhere, that Church, where ever it had been, would have been called <hi>THE Church,</hi> as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church now is. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church therefore is stiled <hi>THE Church,</hi> because 'tis the Seat of the Vicar of Christ, and chief Pastour of the Church <hi>Universal:</hi> yet all other Churches are <hi>true, right,</hi> and <hi>Orthodox</hi> Churches of Christ, otherwise they would be no Churches at all. In a word, I would fain see some grave Ancient Father, who ever maintained a Congregation of Christians to be a <hi>true</hi> Church, and yet held it not to be Orthodox.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This being so, all his Lordships subtleties fall to the ground: which suppose, that some Congregation of Christians may remain a <hi>True</hi> Church, and yet teach false Doctrine in matters of Faith. For how can you call that <hi>a True</hi> Church, in which men are not taught the way to Heaven, but to eternall perdition? Such needs must be all false Doctrine in matters of Faith; because it either teacheth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be the Word of God, which is not; or denyes that to be his Word, which is: to erre in this sort is certainly to commit high and mortal offence against the honour and veracity of God; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57798:71"/>
the direct way to eternal perdition: yea, whatever Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Christians teaches in this manner, if it be done through malice, they are <hi>Seducers;</hi> if through ignorance, they are <hi>seduced, and blinde Guides,</hi> and so lead the blinde into the same destruction with themselves: to neither of which inconveniences can <hi>the whole</hi> Church be lyable, if there be Truth in the Promises of Christ.</p>
               <p>The example then of a man, who may be tearm'd <hi>a man,</hi> though <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 2.</note> he be not honest, comes not home to our case. Had the Bishop in lieu of the word <hi>Man</hi> put <hi>Saint,</hi> (which essentially includes both <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi>) the Parallel would have held better. For the word <hi>Church,</hi> in our present debate, implies not a simple, or uncompound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed term, as that of <hi>man,</hi> but is a compound of <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Accidents</hi> together: which Accidents signifie Perfection and Integrity of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and exclude the contrary Defects, <hi>viz.</hi> Heresie, Schisme, and Errour in Faith.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be (as the Relatour feigns it) so corrupt, as <hi>to misuse the Sacraments</hi> of Christ, and to make Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <hi>an imperfect Rule of Faith,</hi> when Christ had made it a perfect one, it would be unchurched. This a man may learn even out of the Apostles Creed, by which he professes to believe <hi>the Holy Catholique Church.</hi> Moreover, St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his <hi>Creed</hi> teaches, that unless a man keep the whole Catholique Faith <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>inviolate,</hi> he shall without all doubt perish. Its undeniable then, no Salvation is to be had, where such false doctrine is taught; and by consequence no true Church. Again, the Church is the Spouse of Christ, and a pure Virgin; who loses her Honour by prostituting her self to errour; much more by forcing all under pain of damnation to believe those very errours for Gods word. To say then, that a Congregation so grosly <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>seducing</hi> is <hi>a true</hi> Church, is in effect to say, that Christ hath a Harlot to his Spouse.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is yet much skirmishing about the form of words, in which the Lady asked the question. <hi>A. C.</hi> averres he is certain, that she desired to know of the Bishop, <hi>whether he would grant the Romane Church to be a right Church,</hi> because he had particularly spoken with her before, and wisht her to insist upon that point: whereupon his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship makes a special reflection <hi>with what cunning Adversaries the Clergy</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>of</hi> England <hi>hath to deal,</hi> who <hi>prepare their Disciples, and instruct them before hand, upon what points to insist.</hi> But this was no <hi>cunning,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> to wish the Lady to require satisfaction in those points, wherein she had the greatest difficulty, and which it most imported her to understand. Certainly, had any of the Roman Church addressed themselves to the Bishop for satisfaction in matters of Religion, he would never, for fear of being accounted a <hi>cunning Disputant,</hi> have scrupl'd to instruct them to make the strongest objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he could against the <hi>Roman</hi> Tenets.</p>
               <p>But the Bishop goes on, and acquaints the Reader with <hi>a perfect</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Jesuitisme,</hi> (if you believe him) <hi>viz.</hi> which <hi>measures the Catholique</hi> Church by that which is <hi>in the City, or Diocess of</hi> Rome, and not <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>the Catholique,</hi> as it was in the Primitive times. But this is no <hi>Jesuitisme,</hi> but rather a Soloecisme against Truth, and a falsifying of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57798:72"/>
the Text. For I finde not those words in <hi>A. C.</hi> which are cited, <hi>viz. The Lady would know, not whether that were the Catholique Church, to which</hi> Rome <hi>agreed, but whether that were not the Holy Catholique Church, which agreed with</hi> Rome. No such Quere as this, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Lady, as appears in the former words of <hi>A. C.</hi> It was all one to her, whether <hi>Rome</hi> must alwayes agree with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, or the Catholick Church alwayes agree with <hi>Rome.</hi> Such <hi>Punctilio's</hi> as these the Lady never dreamt of; nor were they so much as hinted at by <hi>A. C.</hi> It was enough for the Ladies satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to know, whether <hi>Rome,</hi> and all particular Churches agreeing with her in Doctrine and Communion, or <hi>Constantinople,</hi> (if you please) and those which communicate with her, or the <hi>English-Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Church, and they who consent with it, be the Catholique Church. Thus that the Jesuits may be thought to have singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and novelties in their doctrine, finding none of their own, he has endeavour'd to coin one for them; which he esteems a strange Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, though indeed it be none. For put case <hi>A. C.</hi> had affirm'd, that the Church is styled <hi>Catholick</hi> by agreeing with <hi>Rome,</hi> yet had it been no <hi>Jesuitism,</hi> but a received and known Truth in the Ancient Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For the better understanding of this we are to note, the word <hi>Catholick</hi> may be used in <hi>three</hi> different acceptions, <hi>viz.</hi> either <hi>formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, causally,</hi> or by way of <hi>participation. Formally</hi> the Universal Church, that is the Society of all true particular Churches, united together in one Body, in one Communion, and under one Head, is called <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Causally</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is stiled <hi>Catholick,</hi> because it hath an influence and force to cause Universality in the whole Body of the <hi>Catholique</hi> Church: to which Universality two things are necessary. One is <hi>Multitude,</hi> which serves as an Analogical <hi>Matter,</hi> whereof it consists: for where there is no <hi>Multitude,</hi> there can be no <hi>Universali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> The other is in place of <hi>Form,</hi> viz. <hi>Unity:</hi> For <hi>Multitude</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Unity</hi> will never make <hi>Universality. Take away</hi> (sayes St. <hi>Austin</hi>) <note place="margin">D. Aug. de verb Dom. sec. Lucam. cap. <hi>26.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Unity from Multitude, and it is TURBA, (a Rout) but joyn to it Unity, an it becomes POPULUS (a Community,)</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which as a Centre of Ecclesiastical Communion, infuses this <hi>Unity,</hi> which is the Form of Universality, into the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, and thereby causes in her <hi>Universality,</hi> may be called Catholick <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally,</hi> though she be but a <hi>particular</hi> Church. So he that commands in chief over an whole Army, and makes an unity in that Military Body, is stiled <hi>General,</hi> though he be but a <hi>particular</hi> person. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, every particular <hi>Orthodox</hi> Church is termed Catholick <hi>participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi> by way of <hi>participation,</hi> because they agree in and participate of the Doctrine and Communion of the Catholique Church. In this sense the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> addresses her Epistle thus. <hi>To the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church of Philomilion, and to all the Catholique Churches, which are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. Hist. lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>spread through the whole world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we see both how properly <hi>the Roman</hi> Church is called <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> and how the Catholick Church it self takes <hi>causally</hi> the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Universal,</hi> or Catholick, from the <hi>Romane,</hi> considered as the chief particular Church, infusing <hi>Unity</hi> to all the rest, as having

               <p n="6">6. Hence it appears, that what his Lordship is pleas'd to tearm a <hi>perfect Jesuitisme</hi> in <hi>A. C.</hi> is a perfect mistake of the Bishop, and a losing himself in his own Labyrinth. Neither is that vulgar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception against <hi>Romane Catholick</hi> any better. For as all Countreys, how distant soever from one another, under the Command and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Roman Emperour, were called the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken collectively, because the chief Seat of their Emperour was at <hi>Rome:</hi> So all the Churches subject to the <hi>Romane</hi> Bishop, are call'd the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, because their Supream Head and Pastour, under Christ, sits at <hi>Rome.</hi> And seeing in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> the whole Church of the Israelites was properly called <hi>the Jewish</hi> Church, (which name strictly taken belong'd onely to the Tribe of <hi>Juda</hi>) because the chief City of it appertained to that Tribe, where the High Priest resided and officiated, why may not also the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Christian Church be nam'd the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, because its Supream Bishop keeps his Residence in the <hi>Romane</hi> City.</p>
               <p>The truth is, in all doubts concerning matter of Doctrine, recourse is to be had to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successor, who (at least with a Generall Council) can <hi>infallibly</hi> resolve all difficulties. This Infallibility is independent of all places; insomuch, that as St. <hi>Peter</hi> had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, though he had never been at <hi>Rome;</hi> so though his Successor should leave to reside in that City, yet should he not leave to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in the manner specified; and should as well <hi>then,</hi> as <hi>now,</hi> judge both the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, and the Faith of all other Churches. This I have said to shew, how the Faith of every particular Church is to be examin'd, and prov'd to be Catholique, to wit, by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Faith of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church: concluding nothing, whither the Pope can transferre his Chair from <hi>Rome,</hi> or not; and whether the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> can desert him, and the true Faith, or not: for these Questions make nothing to our present purpose.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Hence his other Explication also vanishes into smoak, viz. when he asserts, that <hi>

Nay this interpretation gives no more Prerogative to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then to that of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or <hi>

               <p>At length, after much ado, he grants <hi>perfidia</hi> may be taken for <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in Faith,</hi> or for <hi>perfidious Misbelievers and Schismaticks, who had</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 3. num. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>betray'd their Faith;</hi> but then he cavils with the word <hi>Romanos.</hi> This must be limited onely to those Christians, who then lived in <hi>Rome;</hi> to whom <hi>quatales, as long as they continued such,</hi> Errour in Faith could have no access. Is not this a great praise? As if St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> should say, St. <hi>Peters</hi> Sea could not erre, so long as it continued constant in the Truth. What Nationall Church, nay what faithfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian then living, might not have challenged as much priviledge as this?</p>
               <p>Finally he concludes, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> meant no Infallibility in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church by the sentence alledged, because he himself had some <hi>Contrast</hi> afterward with Pope <hi>Stephen,</hi> touching <hi>the Rebaptization of those, that were Baptized by Heretiques.</hi> But his Lordship should have remembred that common distinction of Divines, whereby they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57798:74"/>
consider the Pope sometimes as a <hi>Private Doctour,</hi> and sometimes as the <hi>Doctour,</hi> or Pastour, universall of all Christians: and that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> might very well be suppos'd to think the Pope err'd onely in the first sense. For Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> did not properly define any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in that contestation, which was between them, but onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that those in <hi>Africa</hi> should <hi>alter nothing</hi> that was observed in the ancient practice, about receiving such into the Church as had been Baptized by Heretiques. <hi>Nihil innovetur; nisi quod Traditum est:</hi> neither had the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> any just cause to mention it as an errour in St <hi>Cypirian,</hi> for thinking the Pope might erre in quality of a <hi>Private Doctour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if this be a good Argument against the Infallibility of Popes, <hi>viz. St. Cyprian held Pope Stephen err'd, therefore the Pope may erre in matters of Faith,</hi> it will be good consequence also to say, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> held Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> err'd, <hi>even whilst he maintain'd an universal immemorial Tradition,</hi> receiv'd and practis'd as such by the whole <hi>Catholick</hi> Church ever since the Apostles; <hi>ergo</hi> the Pope may erre, even whilst he follows such an <hi>Universal, Immemorial</hi> Tradition. By this manner of arguing, not onely the Popes infallible Authority, but the infallible Authority of the most Universal, Immemorial Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in the Church will be infring'd, through St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous judgement: and if it be <hi>plain enough</hi> to prove St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had no great opinion of <hi>the Roman</hi> infallibility (as the Relatour here sayes it is) it will be also <hi>plain enough</hi> to prove, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had no great opinion of the infallibility of such an Universal Tradition; which is altogether absurd.</p>
               <p>The Bishops exceptions therefore to this Text of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of no force, it remains, that his meaning must be this, and no other, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Sea of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which is <hi>the principall of all Churches,</hi> was so infallibly directed by the Holy Ghost, that <hi>no errour in Faith</hi> could have access to it, or be admitted by it; if not as a <hi>particular</hi> Church (which is a School-question, and <hi>as such</hi> disputed here by <hi>Bellarmin</hi>) yet at least, as <hi>the Head</hi> of the Universal Church of Christ, and as <hi>the Fountain of Priestly Unity:</hi> which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> here plainly affirms that Church and Sea to be.</p>
               <p>The second Authority is out of St <hi>Jerome,</hi> who speaks in this manner to <hi>Ruffinus, Scito Romanam fidem, Apostolica voce laudatam,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hieronym. lib. <hi>3.</hi> Apol. contr. Ruffin.</note> 
                  <hi>cjusmodi praestigias non admittere: etiamsi Angelus aliter annunciet, quàm semel praedicatum est, Pauli auctoritate munitam non posse mutari.</hi> I will not here dispute, whether <hi>Bellarmin</hi> by <hi>Romanam Fidem</hi> means <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos Fideles,</hi> or no: yea I most willingly agree with his Lordship in this, that by <hi>Romanam Fidem</hi> St. <hi>Jerome</hi> understands the <hi>Catholique Faith of Christ.</hi> But by the way 'tis worth noting how inconsequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Adversaries speak; who usually condemn us for joyning as <hi>Synonyma's, Roman</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> together, <hi>viz.</hi> when we say the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholick Faith, or the Roman-Catholick Church; and yet the Bishop has no other way to avoid the force of St. <hi>Jeromes</hi> words, but by acknowledging, in this place, that the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> is all one.</p>
               <p>Well then; be it granted, that in St. <hi>Jeromes</hi> time the <hi>Roman</hi> was
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57798:74"/>
accounted the Catholique Faith: what will this advantage the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop? Very much, as he imagins at least. For thus he discourses. The <hi>Roman</hi> being here taken for the <hi>Catholique</hi> Faith, and the Catholique Faith being uncapable of any change, or of admitting any <hi>praestigias,</hi> that is, <hi>Illusions</hi> or <hi>Alterations,</hi> it will of necessity follow, that Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> words evince not the perpetuall unchangeableness of the Faith, as <hi>taught and professed in the Church of Rome.</hi> Excellent! But did not his Lordship see, how easily this exposition of his might be blown away? Can it be thought a thing any way suitable to Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> wisdom, to tell <hi>Ruffinus</hi> (so great a Scholar as he was known to be) that the Catholique Faith <hi>in abstracto</hi> (in its own precise na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) can never be any other, then what it is? knew not <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> as well as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> himself, that neither Faith nor any thing else, can change its <hi>essence?</hi> would he make St. <hi>Hierome</hi> so simple, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> not to go about to undermine the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> for such a reason as this, because the Catholique Faith, abstracted from those who teach and maintain it, can never be but what it is essentially? Seeing that notwithstanding any such <hi>Immutability,</hi> it might easily enough be extirpated out of the hearts of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the contrary errours admitted, how <hi>unalterable</hi> soever the Faith in it self be. The <hi>unchangeableness</hi> therefore of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Faith in this sense could no way hinder <hi>Ruffinus</hi> from spreading such Books among the <hi>Romans,</hi> as might endanger their perversion; but rather the Immutable Faith of the Sea Apostolique, so highly commended both by the Apostle and St. <hi>Hierome;</hi> which is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon such a <hi>Rock,</hi> that even an Angel himself is not able to shake it.</p>
               <p>The third Authority is taken out of St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> whose <hi>Elogium</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is very Emphatical. <hi>Vetus</hi>

                     </gap>  habere.</hi> For the clearing of which passage I say first, the Bishop is not faithful in his Translation of him; for he leaves out the word <hi>Ever</hi> in the latter part of the sentence: whereas St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> speaking of the <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>entire</hi> Faith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, sayes that <hi>Rome alwayes holds it, as becomes that City, which is Governess over the whole world, to have EVER an entire Faith in and concerning God.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in his Gloss upon the Sentence he omits the same word again, saying onely <hi>it became that City very well to keep the Faith sound and entire.</hi> Well; but how long? for some years onely, or an age, or two? doth St. <hi>Gregory</hi> limit any time? No: he saith <hi>semper,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes that city <hi>alwayes</hi> to hold the true Faith, not onely till St. <hi>Gregories</hi> time, but for <hi>ever,</hi> to all posterity.</p>
               <p>The Bishop indeed sufficiently intimates what he drives at, in those words of his, <hi>In St.</hi> Gregory Nazianzens <hi>time</hi> Rome <hi>did certainly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 3. num. 10</note> 
                  <hi>hold both RECTAM ET INTEGRAM FIDEM (the right and the entire Faith of Christ;) but there is no promise, nor prophesie in St.</hi> Gregory, <hi>that</hi> Rome <hi>shall ever do so.</hi> I answer, though there be no <hi>prophesie,</hi> yet there is a sufficient <hi>acknowledgement,</hi> in those words of St. <hi>Gregory, that</hi> Rome <hi>shall ever do so.</hi> For are not these his very
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57798:75"/>
words? <hi>Rome</hi> (saith he) <hi>of old hath the right Faith, and alwayes holds it, as becomes the City, which rules over the whole world, to have EVER the entire Faith concerning God.</hi> Does he not expresly affirm, <hi>Rome had the right Faith of old,</hi> and that she <hi>alwayes holds it,</hi> as becomes such a City to hold the right Faith of God. I put my Argument into form thus.</p>
               <p>It <hi>alwayes becomes</hi> that great City <hi>to have,</hi> and likewise <hi>to hold, IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEGRAM FIDEM,</hi> the entire Faith of Christ.</p>
               <p>But St. <hi>Gregory</hi> here affirms, that <hi>Rome</hi> alwayes holds the entire Faith, as becomes that great City to <hi>have</hi> and <hi>hold it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> he affirms, that <hi>Rome</hi> holds <hi>alwayes</hi> the entire Faith of Christ, and not for some ages onely, or to St. <hi>Gregories</hi> time.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is his Lordships own words. The <hi>Minor</hi> is prov'd from St. <hi>Gregory's</hi> express words, which are, even according to that Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of them, which the Bishop cites, <hi>semper eam retinet, sicut decet urbem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>semper de Deo integram fidem habere.</hi> He sayes not onely <hi>Rome ever holds</hi> the true Faith, but that it ever holds it <hi>as becomes that City EVER to hold it,</hi> which presides over the whole world, that is, with full Authority teaching it, and by continual profession main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it in all future ages.</p>
               <p>The Bishop at length acknowledges a double <hi>semper</hi> in St. <hi>Gregories</hi> words, but misplaceth the latter; with what pure intention let any indifferent man judge. <hi>His words are plain</hi> (sayes the Bishop) <hi>semper</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>decet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it alwayes becomes that City to have and hold the entire Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas St. <hi>Gregory</hi> sayes not <hi>semper decet</hi> (it alwayes becomes) but <hi>decet,</hi> it becomes that City which governs the whole world, <hi>alwayes to have</hi> the entire Faith of God. Now who sees not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest difference betwixt these two Propositions, <hi>It alwayes becomes that City to have,</hi> and <hi>it becomes that City to have alwayes?</hi> even as it is one thing to say, <hi>It alwayes becomes a man to keep honest company,</hi> and another thing to say, <hi>It becomes a man to keep honest company alwayes;</hi> seeing this last implies, that a man must never cease from keeping such company, or never be out of such company. In like manner, 'tis one thing to affirm <hi>it alwayes becomes</hi> Rome <hi>to hold the entire Faith;</hi> for this onely signifies, the keeping of the Faith entire, whensoever it is done, is a thing well-becoming the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> and another thing to say, <hi>It becomes that City to</hi> keep the entire Faith <hi>alwayes;</hi> for that signifies, it must never fail, or cease, to keep it.</p>
               <p>His Criticizing upon the present Tense of the Verb <hi>retinet</hi> (<hi>holds,</hi> saith he, not <hi>shall hold</hi>) is a meer impertinency, derected sufficiently by what we said in the first Chapter. For, to speak nothing of the Tautology he fastens upon St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> if the Verbs <hi>habet</hi> and <hi>retinet</hi> relate to the <hi>present,</hi> or <hi>past,</hi> time onely, 'tis to be observ'd, St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> sayes not barely <hi>it holds ever the true Faith,</hi> but it holds it <hi>sicut decet,</hi> &amp;c. in such manner <hi>as becomes</hi> that Capital City to hold it, <hi>viz.</hi> for ever; which of necessity relates to all <hi>future</hi> times, and therefore is as much as <hi>semper retinebit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Bishop passes to, (or rather, by) St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> pretending that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> names indeed these Authors, but neither tells us where, nor cites their words. Truly no small fault
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57798:75"/>
(if not untruly objected) especially in a man so learned, to amuse his Reader with empty names onely. But surely his Lordship read <hi>Bellarmin</hi> but superficially, and perhaps with other mens eyes more then his own, when he wrote this.

               </p>
               <p>But the Relatour seems willing to make us amends; and seeing <hi>change is no robbery,</hi> he restores <hi>Bellarmin</hi> another Text of St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> in lieu of that he took from him, yea (if we believe his Lordship) <hi>the most pregnant place</hi> in all St. <hi>Cyril.</hi> But it is not his part to finde Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities for us, but fairly and ingenuously to satisfie those we urge against him.

But our Answer is, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> brings it onely in favour of his own private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, touching the Infallibility of <hi>the particular Church of</hi> Rome: which being onely matter of probable and disputable opinion, not of Catholique and necessary Belief, as I resolv'd in the beginning not to undertake the defence of any such points, so I hold not my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to maintain the proofs of them.</p>
               <p>I return therefore to his Lordship, who taking his best advantage from St. <hi>Cyrils pregnant place,</hi> builds the Catholique Church upon <note place="margin">D. Cyril. Alex. Dial. de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. lib. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the Faith</hi> onely, and not upon <hi>the Person</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi> professing that Faith. But first, this assertion of the Bishop is refuted by the words of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> himself, who calls the Faith (upon which he sayes <hi>the Church is founded. &amp;c) inconcussam &amp; firmissimam Discipuli Fidem,</hi> (the <hi>invincible and most firm</hi> Faith of Christs Disciple) which words clearly include St. <hi>Peters Person</hi> with his <hi>Faith.</hi> For in what sense can the Faith be said to be <hi>invincible</hi> and <hi>most sirm,</hi> but onely in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the person invincibly and most firmly confessing it? We our selves do not say the Church is built upon St. <hi>Peters Shoulders,</hi> but upon his <hi>Faith, viz.</hi> as 'tis constantly and inviolably taught and confessed by his <hi>Person,</hi> and the person of his <hi>Successors,</hi> as occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. Secondly, 'tis no less contrary to the words of Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57798:76"/>
Matth. 16. 18. <hi>I say unto thee</hi> (Peter) <hi>Thou art A ROCK, and upon THIS ROCK I will build my Church,</hi> &amp;c. where 'tis plain that by these words <hi>This Rock</hi> Christ meant no other Rock, then that whereof he made mention in the preceding words <hi>Thou art a Rock.</hi> For our Saviour spake in the Hebrew (or Syriack) Language, <hi>Thou art CEPHAS,</hi> (which signifies <hi>a Rock</hi>) <hi>and upon this CEPHAS,</hi> that is, upon this <hi>Rock, will I build my Church.</hi> The same is in the Greek Translation. For even there <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signisies a <hi>Rock,</hi> as well as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And though the Catholique Translators of the New Testament (who follow the vulgar Latine Translation) render it thus, <hi>Thou art PETER, and upon THIS ROCK</hi> will I build my Church; yet have they noted, that the word <hi>Peter</hi> signifies a <hi>Rock,</hi> and that our Blessed Saviour used not two, but one and the same word, to wit, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> (which signifies a Rock) when he made that promise to Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make this plain by an instance drawn from our own affaires. Suppose <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> presently after he was consecrated Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> accompanied with <hi>John Scory, Miles Coverdale, William Barlow, Jobn Hodgskins,</hi> &amp;c. his Associates and Consecrators (as Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> will have have it) should have addressed themselves to the Queens Presence-Chamber to kiss her hand, and the Queen should have asked them, <hi>Quid dicitis vos de Filiâ Henrici octavi,</hi> (what say you of the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth?) and <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> as chief among them, answering according to the then-newly-enacted Belief, <hi>Tu es Elizabetha, Supremum Caput Ecclesiae,</hi> &amp;c. (Thou art <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, Supream Head</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) if the Queen thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should have return'd him this gracious Answer, <hi>Et ego dico tibi, TU ES PRIMAS, &amp; super HUNC PRIMATEM aedificabo Ecclesiam meam,</hi> (And I say to thee <hi>Thou art Primate,</hi> and upon <hi>this Primate</hi> I will build my English Church) had this I say happened, would any one have been so simple, as to doubt whether by <hi>hunc Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matem</hi> (this Primate) she meant any other then <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> to whom onely she then spake?</p>
               <p>Neither indeed can the words <hi>This Rock</hi> in Grammatical rigour be referr'd to the Confession of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> For, that being a remote An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, mention'd onely in the verse before, and <hi>Peter</hi> (or Rock) the immediate, mention'd in one and the same verse with <hi>hanc Petram,</hi> the words in question, had our Saviour understood by <hi>hanc Petram</hi> (This Rock) not St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself, but the <hi>Confession</hi> he made of Christs Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he should not have said <hi>super HANC Petram,</hi> but <hi>super ILLAM Petram,</hi> not <hi>upon THIS Rock</hi> will I build my Church, but <hi>upon THAT Rock, viz,</hi> thy Confession; because, I say, that was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Antecedent mention'd in the former verse, and was not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately precedent to those words of our Saviour, <hi>Super hanc Petram,</hi> &amp;c. Seeing therefore our Saviour sayes not <hi>That,</hi> but <hi>This</hi> Rock, he must be understood, according to strict rules of Grammar, by the Demonstrative <hi>hanc</hi> (or <hi>This</hi>) to mean the immediate, or next Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself, not that which was further off, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Confession</hi> of Christs Divinity.</p>
               <p>I adde, that if our Saviour had meant St. <hi>Peters</hi> Confession onely
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57798:76"/>
without his Person, he should have used not the Conjunction Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative <hi>And,</hi> saying <hi>Thou art Peter, AND upon this Rock,</hi> &amp;c. but he should have us'd the Conjunction Discretive, or Exceptive, <hi>But,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> (that is a Rock, in name) <hi>BUT upon that Rock</hi> of thy Confession <hi>will I build my Church.</hi> Wherefore seeing our Saviour doth not so speak, but uses the Conjunction Copulative <hi>And,</hi> he plainly tyes his speech to the Person of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom onely he spake in the words immediately precedent: and this as necessarily, as the subsequent <hi>And</hi> in the next following sentence (<hi>AND to thee will I give the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c.) doth shew the said words, or sentence, to belong to St. <hi>Peter</hi> onely. Beside, what cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence do you think our Saviours discourse will have, if the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end of it shall be understood of St. <hi>Peters</hi> person onely, and the middle of a quite different thing?</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his Lordship is of opinion, that he neither did, <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 12.</note> nor could account the <hi>Roman</hi> Church Infallible, because he reckons up the Canonical Books of Scripture in a different maner, from that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth now adayes. <hi>And therefore</hi> (sayes he) <hi>either</hi> Ruffinus <hi>did not think the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>Infallible; or else the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>this day reckons up more Books in the Canon, then heretofore she did. If she do so, then she is changed in a main point of Faith, viz. the Canon of Scripture, and is absolutely convinced not to be Infallible.</hi> But this Argument of the Bishop is far from being <hi>convincing.</hi> For though it should be granted, that the Catholick Church at present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares more Books to be contained in the Canon, then she did in <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his time, yet this could prove no errour in her; unless it could be likewise shew'd, (which I am sure cannot be) that she condemned those Books then, as not <hi>Divine Scripture,</hi> or <hi>not Canonical,</hi> which now she declares to be <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Canonical.</hi> For as now she defines some Truths, which in former times were left under dispute, without the least shadow of errour: so without errour may she now admit some Books for Canonical and Divine Scripture, which before she left under dispute, that is, <hi>so undeclared</hi> by her for Canonical, that Christians were not obliged to receive them for such Books; which now after her Declaration they are obliged to do.</p>
               <p>What he says here of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not, I conceive, be <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> found very pressing, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>she is driven to a hard strait,</hi> for using the Authority of <hi>her Adversary</hi> (meaning <hi>Ruffinus</hi>) to prove her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. For, though it should be granted, that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> was an Adversary of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, yea a condemned Adversary, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi> and <hi>branded</hi> by her, as the Bishop speaks, yet certainly this is so far from <hi>driving</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome to a hard strait,</hi> that it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently argues the truth and uncorruptedness of that Church: which is so clear, that even her Adversaries cannot but confess it. Neither did the <hi>Roman</hi> Church reject all that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> writ, even in that Book, wherein he exprest his Heresie; but onely such parts of it, as were dissonant to the received Doctrine of the Catholique Church. And if one condemned of errour by another, may not be cited in any thing, wherein he favours the party that condemned him, why does the Relatour so often cite our Authours (whom he condemns
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57798:77"/>
of errours in Faith, when they seem to favour him.</p>
               <p>The Bishop, having examin'd <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Authorities in the manner you see, returns again to <hi>A.C.</hi> and the Jesuit, telling us in very positive <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 14.</note> terms, <hi>that no Jesuit, nor any other, is able to prove any particular Church In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi> But to this I have often answer'd, that it was neither to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies purpose, nor ours, to dispute concerning <hi>a particular</hi> Infallible Church: it sufficeth, that the Pope is infallible, at least with a General Council: which question, as I have often observ'd, the Relatour wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declines, and diverts another way, namely to an unnecessary dispute with <hi>Bellarmin</hi> about the Infallibility of <hi>the particular</hi> Church, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy can at any time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Pope and his Doctrine, or not: or whether the Chair of St. <hi>Peter</hi> can be transferred to another place, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account be left subject to errour, as being no longer the Sea Apostolique: both which are matters of that nature, that they do no way engage me to contend with his Lordship about them; further, then to tell him, that they are nothing at all to his purpose, nor to the satisfaction of the Lady; and seem to have been thrust into his book onely to fill up some vacant pages, and to avoid the question which he was obliged, but not able, <hi>directly</hi> to answer.</p>
               <p>In the same page I observe the Bishop charges the <hi>Romane</hi> Church with erring <hi>in the Worship of Images, in altering Christs Institution in the</hi>

                  <hi>Blessed Sacrament, by taking away the Cup from the people, and divers other particulars:</hi> but because he endeavours not in any sort to prove his charge, I presume I may take liberty to answer in a more convenient place, to wit, where the Bishop disputes formally against them.</p>
               <p>But his Lordship will not part without another fling at <hi>Bellarmin:</hi> he thinks he hath spy'd a great inconsistency in some words of the Cardinal: The matter thus. <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Rom. Pont. cap.</hi> 4. §. 2. as the Bishop cites him) of this Proposition <hi>The particular Church of</hi> Rome <hi>cannot erre in Faith, so long as St.</hi> Peters <hi>Chair is at</hi> Rome, sayes <hi>'tis A MOST TRUE Proposition:</hi> but presenty after speaking of it, sayes onely <hi>PERADVENTURE 'TIS AS TRUE AS THIS,</hi> viz. <hi>the Pope, when he teacheth the whole Church in matters of Faith, cannot erre.</hi> At this the Bishop exclaims, as at a great absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of speech. <hi>What</hi> (sayes he) <hi>A Proposition MOST TRUE, and yet</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>but PERADVENTURE as true as another?</hi> That's not possible with him. But soft and fair. What needs so much noise? Let's see what grounds the Relatour has for this Criticisme. First, he should have reflected, that in such expressions as this, there is alwayes a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of moral sense and meaning to be allow'd, even by common right and custom of speaking. When I say (for example) such a man is <hi>vir prudentissimus,</hi> or <hi>vir optimus,</hi> (a <hi>most wise,</hi> and <hi>most honest</hi> man) I am not presently thought to prefer him in those respects before all the men in the world: nor shall I be counted (I hope) a lyar, though some other men be found as wise and honest as he. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might have been excus'd, with indifferent Judges, for saying what he did, upon no other ground but this.</p>
               <p>But I shall not here use this plea: let the word <hi>Verissima</hi> be taken in the strictest rigour of Scholastical sense that can be; yet may not a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57798:77"/>
Proposition be rightly said <hi>most true,</hi> viz. in its proper Rank and order of such Propositions, and yet be but <hi>peradventure as true,</hi> as a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another and higher rank for certainty, or infallibility of Truth? 'Tis manifest, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> held his first Proposition, touching the Popes Infallibility when he teaches the whole Church, to be true <hi>Veritate fidei,</hi> for he holds it to be a proposition of Faith: but this other, touching the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergies not erring, or not departing from the Popes Doctrine so long as the Sea Apostolique continued there, to be true onely <hi>Veritate Theologiae,</hi> as other Theological Propositions are True; which are not <hi>Divinely revealed,</hi> but meerly by humane Discourse and way of Argument deduced from other Theological Propositions and Principles: whose Truth consequently is never so absolutely infallible, as that of matters of Faith; but onely more or less certain, according as the Principles, or Propositions, whence we deduce them, are more or less Infallible; and the Deduction of them from such Principles more or less <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>necessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What absurdity then was it for <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to say, <hi>this Proposition,</hi> viz. of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergies never forsaking the Popes Doctrine, &amp;c. <hi>is most true,</hi> meaning in the quality of a Theological Conclusion, and yet <hi>but peradventure as true</hi> as that other, viz. of the Popes not erring when he teacheth the whole Church; which latter Proposition <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> undoubtedly held to be a Proposition of Divine Faith, but did not hold the other to be such? Truly just as much absurdity, as 'tis to say of a little man, that in comparison of a Pygmie he is a tall Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but in comparison of some Yeoman of the Guard he is but a Dwarf.</p>
               <p>Thus having acquitted my self of what I stood obliged by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, at the beginning of this Treatise, I return again to the Bishop in pursuit of his present Discourse.</p>

THe Relatour is still making personal reflexions upon <hi>A. C.</hi> Here he will have him <hi>troubled</hi> again about the form of the Ladies que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: <note place="margin">§. 20. n. 5.</note> but I see no reason he had to be troubled, whether the Lady askt her question by <hi>Be,</hi> or <hi>Was;</hi> because, if the <hi>Roman</hi> was the right Church, it still is so, seeing no change can be shew'n in her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. If there have been a change, let it appear, when and in what the change was made. For the same reason also, if it be now <hi>the true</hi> Church, it was ever so, having alwayes adhered to St. <hi>Peters Successor,</hi> and the Doctrine by him delivered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But the Relatour asserts, that <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>was not, a right and Orthodox Church, before</hi> Luther <hi>made a breach from it. For in the prime times of it, it was a most right and Orthodox Church: but if we look upon the immediate times before</hi> Luther, <hi>then it was a corrupt and tainted Church.</hi> In this, I say, the Relatour begs the question: for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church remained alwayes <hi>the same</hi> it was from the beginning; because, in this dispute, the <hi>Roman</hi> signifies <hi>the Catholique</hi> Church, according to that of Dr. <hi>Stapleton, Apud veteres</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Relect. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trov. <hi>1.</hi> q. <hi>5.</hi> ar. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>pro eodem habita fuit Ecclesia Romana, &amp; Ecclesia Catholica,</hi> (amongst the Ancients, (saith he, <hi>the Roman</hi> Church and <hi>the Catholique</hi> Church were taken for the same.) We adde, they are <hi>now</hi> also to be held for the same: and the reason given by <hi>Stapleton</hi> (whatever the Bishop thinks) doth not at all destroy the said Identity. His reason is, <hi>quia ejus communio erat evidenter &amp; certissimè cum totâ Catholicâ,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was most certainly and evidently with the whole Catholique, and by consequence the whole Catholique with it. Wherefore as the Catholique Church continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever <hi>the same</hi> and <hi>incorrupt,</hi> so did the <hi>Roman,</hi> which is the same with the Catholique.</p>
               <p>This <hi>A. C.</hi> sufficiently express'd, when he mention'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, not onely as it contain'd the City and Diocess of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>all that agreed with it in Doctrine and Communion.</hi> For 'tis clear, by <hi>Roman</hi> Church in that sense, he could understand no other but the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique.</hi> We deny then, that any abuses, or errours, did at any time more corrupt or taint, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, then they did the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. Wherefore it seems very strange to hear his Lordship say, that <hi>the Roman Church never was, nor ever can be, THE RIGHT, or the HOLY CATHOLIQUE Church.</hi> For when it was <hi>a right Church</hi> (as he himself grants it once was) if we take it in <hi>A. C's.</hi> sense, <hi>viz.</hi> not onely for that Church, which is within the City, or Diocess of <hi>Rome,</hi> but for <hi>all that agree with it,</hi> what difference will he finde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>the Holy Catholique</hi> Church, and all others agreeing with the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What he asserts of the <hi>immediate times before</hi> Luther, <hi>or some ages before,</hi> that then <hi>the Roman Church was a corrupt and tainted Church, and far from being a right Church,</hi> sounds very harshly in a Christians ears. For if in all those ages the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, (that is, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all other Churches agreeing with her) were <hi>wrong, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,</hi> and <hi>tainted;</hi> and all those likewise that disagreed from her, viz. <hi>Hussites, Albigenses, Waldenses, Wickleffists, Greeks, Abyssins, Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> &amp;c. had in them <hi>corrupt</hi> Doctrine, during those ages (as 'tis
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57798:78"/>
certain they had, neither could the Relatour deny it) I say, if <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church was thus corrupt, it follows, that not onely for some time, but for many ages before <hi>Luther,</hi> yea even up to the Apostles times, there was no one visible Church <hi>untainted, incorrupt, right, Orthodox,</hi> throughout the whole world. And consequently that during the said ages, every good Christian was in conscience oblig'd, in some point of Christian belief or other, to contradict the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and desert the Communion of all visible Churches in the world: since no Church, not confessedly Hereticall, can be shew'n, that did not communicate both in Doctrine and Discipline with the Roman, during all that time. Whence, it would further fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Schisme, or Separation from the externall Communion of the whole Church might be not onely <hi>lawfull,</hi> (which is contrary to all the Holy Fathers, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> well proves in his Book of <note place="margin">Treatise of Schism. cap. <hi>1, 2.</hi>
                  </note> Schisme) but even <hi>necessary;</hi> which is impossible, as being contrary to the very essentiall <hi>Predicates</hi> of Schisme, which is defined to be a <hi>voluntary,</hi> or <hi>wilfull</hi> Departure (such, as no <hi>just cause,</hi> or reason, can be given of it) from the Communion of the whole Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His great Marginal Note out of <hi>Petrus de Alliaco</hi> signifies but little. For as it mentions not any false Doctrines taught by <hi>the Roman</hi> Church, so neither doth it threaten, that any shall be taught by it after his time: but clearly speaks of Schismes and Heresies rais'd against the Church (not foster'd by her) in all parts of Christendom. Otherwise we must esteem that learned Cardinal, a man either very ignorant, or very impious, to make the Church it self (<hi>Ecclesiam Dei,</hi> as he speaks) <hi>guilty</hi> of Schismes and Heresies; which even in our Adversaries opinion are held to be incompatible with the Church of God, and destructive of it.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> acknowledges no errours in Popes, but onely as they were private Doctours: he admits not any errours to have been defined by them by Authority properly Papall, or <hi>ex Cathedrâ,</hi> for Christs Doctrine, or to be believ'd by the whole Church. And indeed, he even clears them of Errours in the first kinde, so far as to shew, that they did never so much as personally, or in quality of <hi>private Doctors,</hi> erre, or teach any errour in matter of Faith publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defined and admitted for such by the whole Church: which though it be a very pious opinion, yet no man is oblig'd to embrace it as a point of Faith. For Catholique Faith (in this particular) one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliges us to maintain, that the Pope is Infallible, when he defines with a General Council. To what good purpose then does the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour (in his Margin) pin this following assertion upon <hi>Bellarmin, Et Papas quosdam graves errores seminasse in Ecclesiâ Christi, luce clarius est;</hi> there being nothing, like such a Proposition, in the whole Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter cited by the Bishop?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almainus</hi> speaks not of Errours in Faith at all, (much less doth he <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> say the Popes taught the whole Church such errours) but onely of errours, or rather abuses in point of <hi>Manners;</hi> which might happen by the bad examples of Popes, or their remissness in the execution of their Pastoral office. But what if some of them should be prov'd to have taught errours in Doctrine, as <hi>private men?</hi> that destroyes not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57798:79"/>
the Infallibility of the Church, nor of the Pope, as we maintain it? no more, then his permitting, or suffering others, through his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to teach such errours.</p>
               <p>Hence also his <hi>Simile</hi> of <hi>Tares sow'n among Wheat</hi> is nothing to the purpose. For if he means by <hi>Tares sow'n,</hi> false Doctrine publiquely and <hi>definitively</hi> taught by the Pope, or receiv'd by the Church, in this sense we absolutely deny, that ever any <hi>Tares</hi> were <hi>sow'n,</hi> or ever shall be <hi>sow'n</hi> in the field of Gods Church. But if he mean <hi>sow'n</hi> onely by private persons, and growing up but for some time, through negligence of particular Pastours, until the Supreme Pastour, either by himself, or assisted with his Council, take due notice of them, and weed them up, 'tis a thing we confess, and the Bishop gains nothing by it. No more doth he gain by alledging <hi>Cassander,</hi> whose credit among Catholiques is so little, that his testimony would be of no great weight, were it positive and home to the purpose; whereas 'tis manifest he speaks doubtfully, and dares not absolutely averre, the Bishops <hi>had taught</hi> any Superstitions: all he ventures to say is, <note n="a" place="margin">Utinam il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, à quibus, &amp;c. non ipsi harum super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitionum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctores essent, vel certè eas in animis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="3">3. 'Tis true, there have been Schismes at <hi>Rome,</hi> as it happened in the time of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> when <hi>Novatus</hi> leaving <hi>Africk</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there raisd troubles. Yea after him <hi>Novatianus</hi> proceeded so far, as to cause himself to be made <hi>Antipope</hi> against <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and <note place="margin">Cyprian. epist. <hi>42, 52.</hi>
                  </note> had many followers, by which means a Schisme sprung up: but still a great part stuck to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the true Pope. Wherefore, even du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Schisme, as well as before, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church rightly and truly so called, continued <hi>the Catholique,</hi> and as <hi>incorrupt</hi> as ever. And why? because they that left the Communion of the true Pope, and made the Schisme, corrupted themselves, but not the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Catholique</hi> Church, which adhered to him; and were for the time of their separation, of no Church at all, but of the Synagogue of Satan. Whence it appears, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> could not imploy <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cyprian, ubi suprà.</note> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> to bring the <hi>Roman Church to the Communion of the Catholique</hi> (as the Bishop pretends) but onely to reclaim the <note place="margin">Ibid. in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. n. <hi>4.</hi>

Still therefore the <hi>Roman,</hi> or <hi>Catholique</hi> Church, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed free and exempt from errour, either of Schisme or Heresie; and so shall ever continue, maugre the malice of Hell, and whatever vain objections to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A. C.</hi> further charges the Relatour to have confes'd, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 21. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>had made a Rent, and Division, from the Roman, or Catholique Church;</hi> here the Bishop is not a little nettled, and flatly denies that ever he affirm'd, or thought, that Protestants made it. For my part I think it an unprofitable dispute to question much what was said: it more concerns us to see what could, or can be said in this point. Our Assertion is, <q>That Protestants made this Rent, or Schisme, by their obstinate and pertinacious maintaining erroneous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57798:79"/>
contrary to the Faith of the <hi>Roman,</hi> or <hi>Catholique</hi> Church; by their rejecting the Authority of their lawful Ecclesiastical Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, both immediate and mediate; by aggregating themselves into a <hi>Separate</hi> body, or company of pretended Christians, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of any Pastours at all, that were in lawfull and quiet pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of Jurisdiction over them; by making themselves Pastours and Teachers of others, and administring Sacraments without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given them by any, that were lawfully empower'd to give it; by instituting new Rites and Ceremonies of their own, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion, contrary to those anciently receiv'd throughout all Christendom; by violently excluding and dispossessing other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Pastours of and from their respective Seas, Cures, and Benefices, and intruding themselves into their places, in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where they could get footing, the said Prelates and Pastours for the most part yet living.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These, and the like practices (not <hi>the calling for truth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress of abuses,</hi> as the Bishop vainly pretends) we averre to have been the True and Real Causes of Protestants-being <hi>thrust</hi> out of the Church. For as Almighty God leaves no man, who leaves not him first: so neither doth the Church separate her self from any man, or thrust him from her Communion, who doth not first depart, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate himself from her, by obstinate adhering to novel opinions contrary to the true Faith, or by his wicked and enormous demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, contrary to true Charity, or by both together. The Orthodox <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> therefore did very well in departing from the Arrians, (as the Relatour notes in the Margin) because the Arrians were already departed from the Church by their false Doctrine: and we are so far from denying that the sin of Schisme is theirs who depart first, that we charge it upon our Adversaries; for as the Arrians then departed first from the Church, not the Church from them; so did the Protestants now of late: and the Faithful did well in both cases to avoid all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in matters of Religion, both with the one and the other.</p>
               <p>Nor does the Bishop vindicate the Protestant party, by saying the <hi>cause of Schisme was</hi> ours, and that <hi>we</hi> (Catholiques) <hi>thrust</hi> Protestants <hi>from us,</hi> because they <hi>called for truth and redress of abuses.</hi> For, first, there can be no <hi>just cause</hi> of Schisme; this has been granted already, even by <note n="b" place="margin">See Dr. Hammond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-cited.</note> Protestants: and to his <hi>calling for Truth,</hi> &amp;c. I answer, what Heretiques ever yet forsook the Church of God, but pretended truth, and complain'd they were <hi>thrust out</hi> and hardly dealt with, meerly because they <hi>call'd for Truth and redress of Abuses?</hi> But he should have reflected, that the Church of God is styled <hi>a City of Truth</hi>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57798:80"/>
Church and making a Schisme. A thing so clear and undeniable, that (to use the Relatours own expression) our Adversaries may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defend their cause <hi>before a Judge and a Jury,</hi> then before an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of learned Divines.</p>
               <p>After this the Bishop quarrels with <hi>A. C.</hi> for vindicating the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit. But what's the subject of their quarrel?

C.</hi> stood upon the brink of a Contradiction. But I answer, there is not here the least shew of a contradiction. For though his Lordships words were very <hi>few,</hi> though writ down by the Jesuit in <hi>fresh memory,</hi> and upon <hi>special notice taken,</hi> yet might the Jesuit well enough be said to quote them either <hi>iisdem,</hi> or <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollentibus verbis.</hi> For timorous and tender Consciences think they can never speak with caution enough, for fear of telling a lye. But whether the Bishop said the Protestants did make <hi>the Schisme,</hi> or <hi>the Rent,</hi> or a <hi>Division,</hi> or <hi>Breach,</hi> 'tis not a straw's matter. The words ('tis true) are different; but the sense is the same. Well therefore might the Jesuit be said to relate <hi>at least in sense what the Bishop ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,</hi> without either <hi>enterfeiring,</hi> or <hi>shuffling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordship therefore ought not to have boggled at this, but clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have granted, <hi>That Protestants did depart from the Roman Church,</hi> and gat the name of Protestants by Protesting against her; for this is so apparent, that the whole world acknowledges it: and the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour himself cannot deny it without retracting his own words § 20. <hi>num.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 131. where speaking of <hi>Luther</hi> he grants he <hi>made a breach from it.</hi> And 'tis a very poor shift to say, Protestants gat not that name by <hi>protesting against the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>but against her Errours and Superstitions:</hi> for who sees not, that this is the common pretext of all Heretiques, when they sever themselves from the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> Church? There is nothing more ordinary with Protestants then to reproach <hi>the Roman</hi> Church, and belch out virulent execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against her; yet all must be understood (forsooth) not against the Church, but against her Errours. As if Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> and <hi>A. C.</hi> could be ignorant of this, or stood in need of such a needless Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to understand what Protestants mean, when they protest, or use uncivil language against the Church. But (sayes the Bishop) if <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 3.</note> you take <hi>the whole Body and Cause</hi> of Protestants together, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so easily charge them with departing from the Church. I know not well, what this passage means: but desire to have any either <hi>whole Body, or part,</hi> of Protestants shew'n, who, by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions and practices, did not effectively make a true and real depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Roman Church, and in so doing, remained separate from <hi>the whole</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Nor doth it much mend the matter to say (as he doth in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent) <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> that the Protestation made by his party in the Year 1529. (from whence they took their name of Protestants) <hi>was not simply against</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:57798:80"/>
                  <hi>the Roman Church, but against an Edict</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Worms</hi>) which commanded <hi>the restoring of all things to their former Estate, without any Reformation.</hi> For to stand (as they did) for Innovation in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and to protest <hi>against restoring of things</hi> to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer estate, which had been unwarrantably and wickedly alter'd by certain lawless people, without any colour of Authority, was surely in effect to protest against the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: and seeing the things protested against were points of Faith and Christian piety, wherein the <hi>Roman</hi> and all other true visible Churches in the world agreed, to protest against them was, with the same breath, to protest against all the particular true visible Churches in the Christian world; which none but notorious Heretiques, or Schismatiques, use to do. It is not then <hi>the word</hi> (Protestation) that we dislike so much, but the <hi>Thing,</hi> that is, the Protesting and standing for novel and corrupt Tenets, against the ancient and undefiled Doctrine of the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique</hi> Church. Besides, 'tis worth the noting, that the Relatour here addes a little to his Author, when he sayes, the Edict of <hi>Worms</hi> was for the restoring of all things to their former estatc <hi>without any Reformation</hi> at all: as if the Edict had cut off all hopes of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in those things which needed it, <hi>viz.</hi> Abuses in Manners and Discipline: which is most false, and confuted by evidence of fact. For even the Popes themselves alwayes professed reformation in such things to be necessary, and intended by them; according as it was not long after effectually ordain'd by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But <hi>A. C.</hi> (sayes the Bishop) goes on and tells us, that <hi>though the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>did thrust Protestants from her by Excommunication, yet they had first divided themselves by obstinate holding and teaching Opinions contrary to the Roman Faith and practice of the Church: which to do, St.</hi> Bernard <hi>thinks is pride, and St.</hi> Austin <hi>madness.</hi> At this his Lordship takes several exceptions; and first begins with the supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Errors and Superstitions in the Roman Church;</hi> which <hi>in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> (saith he) <hi>were the prime cause of the Division, and forced many men to hold and teach contrary to the Roman Faith.</hi> To which we answer, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> being St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successor in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and Infallible (at least with a General Council) it is impossible, that Protestants, or other Sectaries, should ever finde such <hi>Errors or Corruptions</hi> definitively taught by him, or receiv'd by the Church, as should either warrant them to preach against her Doctrine, or (in case she refuses to conform to their preaching) lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to forsake her Communion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he quarrels with <hi>A. C.</hi> for styling it the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, when he speaks of the general Faith of all Christians. <hi>It was wont</hi> (sayes the Bishop) <hi>to be the Christian Faith; but now all's Roman with</hi> A. C. <hi>and the Jesuit.</hi> But first, 'tis no incongruity of speech to style <hi>the Christian,</hi> or <hi>Catholique</hi> Faith, sometimes the <hi>Roman.</hi> For the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> being <hi>Head</hi> of the whole <hi>Christian,</hi> or <hi>Catholique</hi> Church, the Faith approv'd and taught by him as <hi>Head</hi> thereof, though it be <hi>de facto</hi> the general Faith and profession of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, may yet very well be called the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith: why? because the Root, Origin, and chief Foundation under Christ, of its being<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preach't
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57798:81"/>
and believ'd by Christians, is at <hi>Rome.</hi> And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more frequent then Denominations taken <hi>à parte digniori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, here's a manifest robbery of part of <hi>A. C's.</hi> words, for which his Lordship is bound to restitution. <hi>A. C.</hi> as it were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing this cavil, warily addes <hi>to Roman Faith</hi> these words, <hi>and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church,</hi> which the Relatour, for reasons best known to himself, craftily leaves out, and makes him speak, as if the opinions, by which the Protestants stand divided from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and for which they are excommunicated by her, were onely contrary to <hi>the Roman</hi> Faith, as Protestants usually understand the word <hi>Roman,</hi> viz. as contradistinguisht from <hi>Catholique,</hi> or <hi>the Church in general:</hi> whereas <hi>A. C.</hi> to prevent any such mistake, as expresly as he could, said, they were contrary both to <hi>the Roman Faith and practice of the Church.</hi> But we must excuse our Adversary for this slip, though it be an unhandsome one. For the truth is, he had no other way to hide the guiltiness of his own pen, in styling the Doctrines and practices of the Church, <hi>Corruptions and Superstitions.</hi> For to have charg'd <hi>the whole</hi> Church with <hi>Superstitions</hi> and <hi>Corruptions,</hi> had been (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) a little too bold a check, especially for a person of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships temper, and would have brought him too apparently under the lash of St. <hi>Bernards</hi> and St. <hi>Austins</hi> Censures, intimated by <hi>A. C.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to charge onely <hi>the Church of Rome</hi> with them, is a thing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destest man in all that party findes no difficulty to do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, his Lordship excepts against the Application of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces brought by <hi>A. C.</hi> out of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> and St. <hi>Austin.</hi> But we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, his Exceptions do not weaken the force of the said places. For first, concerning that of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> let us suppose (as the Relatour contends) that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> by those words, <hi>Quae major superbia,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Serm. <hi>3.</hi> de Resurrect.</note> 
                  <hi>What greater pride can there be, then for one man to preferre his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the whole Congregation, as if he alone had the Spirit of God?</hi> mean't onely that <hi>particular Congregation,</hi> to which he was then preaching; yet is his saying not unaptly apply'd by <hi>A. C.</hi> to our present purpose, by an Argument <hi>à minore ad majus,</hi> to shew the more exorbitant pride of those, who preferre their private fanatick opinions, before the judgement of the whole Catholique Church. This certainly Protestants did by their <hi>Solemne Protestation,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate maintaining their private opinions. What the Relatour addes, That <hi>it is one thing for a private man to preferre his judgement before the whole Congregation, and another thing for an intelligent man, in some things unsatisfied, modestly to propose his doubts even to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church,</hi> is of no advantage to him. For first, though we should grant his Lordship, that <hi>Martin Luther, Ulrick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> , John Calvin, Theodore Beza, John Knox,</hi> and the rest of that crew, were to be accounted <hi>Intelligent Persons,</hi> yet will he, or can he say they <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd their Doubts modestly to the Church?</hi> surely not: and whoever sayes so, will easily be convinc'd of ignorance in their opinions, or practices. But put case a more <hi>modest propounding</hi> of Doubts had been used, (as the Bishop seems to wish) yet unless the Doubts were in points undecided by the Church, the modest proposall of them could not at all help the Protestant cause, in regard their Doubts were
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57798:81"/>
in points of Faith already determined for such by authority of the Catholique Church; to question any of which, with what seeming modesty soever, is sinful, Heretical, and damnable.</p>
               <p>His exceptions against <hi>A. C's.</hi> interpretation of St. <hi>Austin</hi> are no less weak. The Holy Doctor affirms, that it is <hi>a most insolent mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for a man to dispute, <hi>whether that ought to be to be done,</hi> which is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist. ad Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuar.</hi> 118. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> usually <hi>held and done by the whole Church.</hi> The Bishop first excepts, that <hi>there is not a word of the Roman Church,</hi> but onely of <hi>the Catholique:</hi> yet having often shew'n, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the <hi>Catholique</hi> are all one, and seeing <hi>A. C.</hi> adds to <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, <hi>the practice of the Church,</hi> this Authority remains still entire against him. Next he sayes, <hi>A. C.</hi> applies this Text of St. <hi>Austin</hi> to the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> whereas 'tis spoken of <hi>the Rites and Ceremonies</hi> of the Church. But first I answer, <hi>A. C.</hi> applies the place both to the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> and <hi>practice of the Church;</hi> of which <hi>practice</hi> the place is most properly understood, even in that sense, which the Bishop himself gives to the words: Secondly, if it were <hi>madness</hi> to dispute against the <hi>Rites and Ceremonies</hi> of the Church, much greater would it be to dispute against any point of Faith held by the Church: so that the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the place is still good by the Rule <hi>à minore ad majus,</hi> and reaches to every person, that in any matter whatever obstinately opposes himself against the Church of God. The reason may be, because there is alwayes some point, or matter of faith involv'd in every universally-practis'd Rite and Ceremony of the Church. Wherefore a pertinacious defending of any point whatsoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the Catholique Church teacheth, is by St. <hi>Austin</hi> tearm'd a <hi>most insolent madness.</hi> We deny not, but a <hi>right-sober man,</hi> modestly proceeding, may in some case, dispute a point with the <hi>Roman</hi> either Church, or Prelate, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did with Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> in the Controversie, which arose toward the end of the second Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; provided it be done with <hi>Submission</hi> and profession of <hi>Due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to that Church and Prelate; which can never be, unless the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute be about matters as yet undecided by the Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Touching <hi>A. C's</hi> illation, I answer, since it is certain, the whole <hi>Catholique</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in the sense often explicated, cannot erre, <hi>A. C.</hi> doth well inferre, that there can be no just cause to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, or Schism, from it. The Relatour grants, that <hi>the whole Church</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>cannot universally erre in absolute fundamental Doctrine;</hi> and blames <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for needlesly busying himself to prove, that <hi>the visible Church can never fall into Heresie.</hi> But I answer, <hi>Bellarmins</hi> labour was not needless, since Protestants grant not the Church exempt from <hi>all</hi> Errours, save onely in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> as they call them: whereas <hi>Bellarmin</hi> proves it equally of all, <hi>Fundamentals or not-Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals.</hi> Moreover <hi>Bellarmin</hi> well observes, that Protestants gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally grant this onely to the <hi>Invisible</hi> Church; whereas he proves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57798:82"/>
this restriction, <hi>if she do not propose Doctrine besides the Scripture:</hi> So that if she do, it seems according to him, she may erre.</p>
               <p>But I must confess I have often desired, and do yet much long to know, which are Doctrines <hi>absolutely Fundamental and necessary to all mens salvation,</hi> according to the opinion of Protestants. I believe scarce any man will be able to set them down. <q>Our Tenet is, that the Catholique Church is Infallible in all points of Faith, and that whatever is sufficiently proposed to us by the Catholique Church, cannot be denied under pain of damnation, and consequently is  <hi>Fundamental</hi> to us, and to all true Christians.</q> So that these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words of the Bishop, <hi>viz. That she may erre in Superstructures, and Deductions, and other by, and unnecessary Truths, if her curiosity, or other weakness, carry her beyond, or cause her to fall short of her Rule,</hi> are injurious to the Church, and inconsistent with that Prerogative of <hi>Holiness,</hi> which (as he himself in this very place confesses) alwayes accompanies the true Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This <hi>Holiness</hi> consists chiefly in the <hi>verity of Faith.</hi> So the Relatour himself professes in these words, <hi>The Holiness of the Church</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>consists as much, if not more, in the Verity of the Faith, as in the Integrity of Manners,</hi> &amp;c. Insomuch that if the Church failed in the verity of Faith, she could be no longer <hi>Holy;</hi> nay it would follow, that the Gates of Hell had prevailed much against her, contrary to the promse of Christ. I assert therefore, that the present Church is <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> no more liable to errour, <hi>through curiosity or weakness,</hi> then was the Primitive; nor the Vicar of Christ (with a General Council) more subject to erre, upon that account, then were the Apostles of Christ.</p>
               <p>In the following words the Relatour (to use his own language) <hi>enterfeires</hi> shrewdly. For, speaking of the whole Church Militant, he tells us, <hi>if she can erre, either FROM the Foundation, or IN it, she can be no longer Holy, and that Article of the Creed is gone, I BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEVE THE HOLY CATHOLIQUE CHURCH:</hi> yet presently after, speaking of the same Church, he saith, <hi>If she erre IN the Foundation, that is, in some one or more Fundamental points of Faith, then she may be a Church of Christ still, but not Holy, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Heretical.</hi> These words I say, hang not well together; for an <hi>Heretical</hi> Congregation cannot be a Church of Christ, because by pertinacious and obstinate erring, especially against the Fundamental and prime Articles of the Creed, it becomes neither <hi>Holy,</hi> nor <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> believing no more any part of Christian Doctrine with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Supernatural <hi>Faith,</hi> then if it had faln into a general Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy from the whole Foundation. 'Tis therefore very strange, to hear him say, that if the Church erre in one or more Fundamental points, <hi>then she may be a Church of Christ still,</hi> though <hi>not Holy,</hi> but <hi>Heretical.</hi> Are there two sorts of Christs-Churches upon earth; one <hi>Holy,</hi> the other <hi>unholy;</hi> one <hi>Catholique,</hi> the other <hi>Heretical?</hi> Is a Church erring in the very Foundation it self, and that in more then one point of it, <hi>a Church of Christ still?</hi> what calls he then (I pray) <hi>the Synagogue of Satan?</hi> Had he so quite forgot, that by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous consent of all Christians, both Ancient and Modern, all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57798:82"/>
Congregations whatever are esteemed sever'd from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church.</p>
               <p>I adde therefore, and confidently averre, that any errour in Faith whatever, (much more in and against the Foundation) pertinaciously defended against the Church, renders the Congregation that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, no Church of Christ. No errours thus defended are to be accounted of <hi>mean alloy,</hi> or weak tincture; they are all <hi>dyed in grain;</hi> they all remove <hi>Holiness</hi> from the Assembly, that so erres, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly un-Church it. The reason hereof hath been given above, <hi>viz.</hi> because all such errour, implicitely and virtually at least, either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms something to be Gods word, which is not; or denies that to be his word, which is; it either asserts errour to be Gods word, or Gods word to be an errour: both which, being in so high a degree injurious and derogatory to the Veracity of God, can be no less then Mortal Sins against the vertue of Divine Faith, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence destructive of it: which is also in effect warranted by that saying of our Saviour in the Gofpel, <hi>Si Ecclesiam non audierit,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>If he will not hear the Church, let him be to thee as a Heathen, or a Publican;</hi> that is, account him no Christian, whatever he seems to profess.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears that <hi>A. C's.</hi> inference was very reasonable, when <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> he told the Bishop, <hi>he might safely grant not onely that Protestants did make the Division, but further, that it was ill done of them, who first made the Separation.</hi> I may justly adde, it is likewise ill done of those, who continue in it. For (as all the Fathers teach, and the most learned <note n="a" place="margin">See Dr. Hammond Treatise of Schisme, cap. <hi>1, 2.</hi>
                  </note> of English Protestants acknowledge) there neither was, nor ever can be <hi>just cause</hi> given, for any man, or number of men, particular Church, or Churches, to separate themselves, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Schisme, out of the Communion of the Holy Catholique Church.</p>

1. MR. <hi>Fisher</hi> having in the precedent discourse briefly, yet very justly and truly, charged Protestants with the Crime of Schisme, <hi>A. C.</hi> prosecutes the matter, and undertakes to justifie and clear the Church's proceedings towards them, from such imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as they usually cast upon her. To this purpose he thinks fit to minde his Adversary, <hi>that after this Breach was made, the Church</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 21. num. 7</note> 
                  <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>did invite the Protestants publickly with Safe Conduct to</hi> Rome <hi>to a General Council, freely to speak what they could for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> This passage of <hi>A. C.</hi> gives the Bishop a new Theme, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning <hi>keeping Faith with Heretiques:</hi> a Theme, which (for the most part) our Adversaries love to dwell upon, as thinking they have some great advantage against us therein. The Relatour glosses upon <hi>A. C's.</hi> words, and tells us, this kinde Invitation was onely to bring them <hi>within our Net;</hi> that the Conduct granted was <hi>Safe</hi> for going thither, (<hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>) but not for coming thence; that the Jesuits write and maintain, <hi>That Faith given is not to be kept with Heretiques; that</hi> John Huss <hi>and</hi> Hierome of Prague <hi>were burnt for all their Safe Conduct.</hi> Thus the Bishop. <hi>Beoanus,</hi> treating this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">Becan. Tract. de Fide Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. servand. praefat.</note> very well observes, that our Adversaries in this are like the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees of old, who, though they heard from our Saviours own mouth, that <hi>they should give to Caesar the things which belong to Caesar,</hi> yet had the face, openly before <hi>Pilate</hi> to accuse him of <hi>forbidding Tribute to be given to Caesar.</hi> In like manner, we do both privately and publiquely, in word and writing, teach and profess <hi>that Faith is to be kept as well with Heretiques as Catholiques,</hi> yet our Adversaries, by their clamorous accusations, seem as if they would force us to hold the contrary, whether we will or no.</p>
               <p>But before I prove that Faith hath been kept with Heretiques, even in those examples which the Bishop alledges, I observe that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self keeps not Faith with Catholiques, (at least in his Citations) otherwise he would not have miscited his Adversaries words: for thus he makes him speak. <hi>But</hi> A. C. <hi>goes on</hi> (saith he) and tells us, that <hi>after this Breach was made, yet the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was so kinde and carefull to seek Protestants, that she invited them publiquely with Safe Conduct to</hi> Rome, <hi>to a General Council, freely to speak what they could for themselves.</hi> Whereas the words of <hi>A. C.</hi> speaking of the Church of <hi>Rome's</hi> proceeding with Protestants in this case, are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly these; <hi>Which did AT FIRST seek to recall them from their novel Opinions, and AFTER THEIR BREACH did permit, yea invited them publiquely to</hi> Rome, <hi>to a General Council,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>A. C's.</hi> words rightly cited the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is onely said <hi>to seek to recall</hi> Protestants <hi>from their novel opinions,</hi> or errours; a thing no way liable to cavil: whereas in the Bishops allegation of the words they are so plac'd, and such words of his own added to them, as if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by her <hi>seeking</hi> had aim'd at nothing else, but how to <hi>entrap</hi> Protestants: when <hi>A. C.</hi> not onely meant, but said as plainly as he could, that the Church <hi>of Rome</hi> did <hi>first seek,</hi> that is, labour by all the fair means she could, <hi>to recall</hi> Protestants from their errours, even before there was any <hi>publique,</hi> or <hi>notorious</hi> breach made: and then afterwards onely (that is, when she saw <hi>private</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57798:83"/>
would take no effect, but that a publique and formal Schism was made by Protestants) <hi>invited them to a General Council.</hi> 'Tis true, the Churches inviting of Protestants to a Free and Publique Disputation in a General Council, was (in the nature of the thing) a justifiable and lawful <hi>seeking</hi> of them; but we say it was not <hi>the seeking</hi> of them, which <hi>A. C.</hi> both meant and exprest in this place; and the Bishop did not well to pervert and misreport his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries words, onely to finde himself matter for an injurious quibble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But to the end the true Doctrine may be fully understood in this point, viz. of <hi>Keeping faith with Heretiques,</hi> and of punishing after <hi>Safe-Conduct</hi> given, 'tis necessary to know, that a <hi>Safe Conduct</hi> may be granted two wayes. First <hi>jure communi,</hi> when 'tis given one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against <hi>unjust</hi> violence, <hi>falvâ semper justitiâ,</hi> provided alwayes that <note place="margin">Becanus ubi suprà q. <hi>6. §. 2.</hi>
                  </note> Justice be not impeached. Secondly, <hi>jure speciali,</hi> when it secures a man against all violence whatsoever, whether just or unjust, and chiefly in that cause for which it is given. In the former manner a <hi>Safe-Conduct</hi> was granted by <hi>

                  </hi> the Emperour to <hi>John Huss,</hi> and by the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> to <hi>Hierome of Prague.</hi> In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> offered <hi>Safe-Conduct</hi> to the Protestants in <hi>Germany:</hi> and <hi>A. C.</hi> tells us, the like was offered by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to all Heretiques. No Faith therefore was broken with <hi>John Huss;</hi> for a <hi>Safe-Conduct</hi> was onely given him <hi>jure communi,</hi> by which Justice was to remain unimpeachable; since he was onely promis'd to be defended against <hi>unjust</hi> violence: which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. Nay he was <hi>justly</hi> burnt for two reasons. The first is, for being obstinate in his Heresie. The second, for having fled; which the Emperour had prohibited in his <hi>Safe Conduct</hi> under pain of death. Wherefore the Emperour, if we rightly consider the matter, did not <hi>break faith</hi> with <hi>John Huss,</hi> but <hi>John Huss</hi> broke faith with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, by flying against his engagement: and seeing by his <hi>Safe-Conduct</hi> he could expect no more then to be secur'd against <hi>unjust</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that so he might be brought to a legal Trial, this being made good to him, and he legally convicted of Heresie, he might (que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless) be punish'd according to Law, without any breach of faith given by his <hi>Safe-Conduct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hierome of Prague</hi> indeed at first abjur'd his Heresie, but falling afterwards into a Relapse, and flying (as <hi>John Huss</hi> had done) was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and burnt: by which it appears, that faith was also kept with him. For the <hi>Safe Conduct</hi> granted him by the Council had this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Clause in it, <hi>Salvâ semper justitiâ,</hi> which sufficiently intimated, that the course of Justice was to proceed against him, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Safe-Conduct.</hi> But had the Protestants gone to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> upon the <hi>Safe-Conduct</hi> granted them by that Council <hi>jure speciali,</hi> in the second manner, they could not at all have been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd under any pretence of Heresie, without manifest breach of Faith; which all Catholiques hold to be unlawful. The like may be said of the <hi>Safe-Conduct</hi> offered them for going to <hi>Rome.</hi> So that his Lordships party may well be esteem'd <hi>Crasty Foxes</hi> (to use his own <hi>Simile</hi>) but never <hi>Wise men,</hi> to refuse so fair an offer: which (I repeat it again, and for proof referre my Reader to the

               </p>
               <p>By this Decree indeed the Council declares, that no Secular Power (how Sovereign soever) can hinder the Proceedings of the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Tribunal in causes of Heresie; for which there is great reason: and consequently, if the Emperour, or any other Secular Prince, grants a <hi>Safe-Conduct,</hi> or makes promise of any thing to the prejudice of that Jurisdiction, it shall not hold. The reason is, because 'tis a promise made of a thing not pertaining to the Jurisdiction of that Prince, nor wholly in his power to see perform'd. But the Council no where teaches, that Faith, or <hi>Safe-Conduct</hi> given in Temporal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses properly pertaining to the Princes Jurisdiction, is not to be kept by all, and to all persons of what condition soever, so farre as 'tis possible: but rather most clearly insinuates the contrary, in the last
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57798:84"/>
clause of this Decree; where 'tis said, <hi>That he who so promiseth, shall not remain obliged in any thing, having done what lieth in him.</hi> What, I pray, doth this signifie? Nothing else, but that even in the sense and intention of the Council it self, the person that <hi>promises</hi> or grants <hi>Safe-Conduct</hi> in cases not proper for him, is yet in conscience bound to do <hi>what lieth in him,</hi> that his said promise, or <hi>Safe-Conduct,</hi> may take effect, and that otherwise <hi>manet in aliquo obligatus,</hi> he is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether free of the Breach of Faith.</p>
               <p>Had the Relatour therefore not mangled the words of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, (to deceive the Reader) but set down the Decree fairly and fully as it is, the business had been so clear, that it would scarce have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any dispute. Neither could <hi>John Huss,</hi> being a learned man, a Doctour of Divinity, and writer of some Volumes, be ignorant what the force of a <hi>Safe Conduct</hi> was, granted by a Secular Prince in a matter so clearly appertaining to Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction; or not know the difference between a <hi>Safe Conduct</hi> given <hi>jure communi</hi> onely, with the clause <hi>salvâ justitiâ,</hi> and one granted <hi>jure speciali.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bishop hath little ground to averre, that he was deceiv'd by the Emperour in this. But put case <hi>John Huss</hi> were ignorant both of the one and the other, it was his own fault, and could be no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the proceedings of Ecclesiastical Discipline and Justice against him.</p>
               <p>His Lordship has no better success in the allegation of <hi>Simancha,</hi> whom he wrongfully cites, as holding absolutely and universally, that <hi>Faith is not to be kept with Heretiques;</hi> whereas he teaches it onely in cases, wherein <hi>that which is promis'd cannot be lawfully perform'd:</hi> And this were as well true, if the promise were made to Catholiques. For as it was unlawful first so to promise, so it is more unlawful to perform such a promise. Hence it is that <hi>Simancha</hi> hath these words, <hi>Veruntamen (ut Marius Solomonius ait) promissa contra Christum fides,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De poenis Art. <hi>46. § 52.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>si praestetur, utique perfidia est.</hi> If faith be given <hi>against Christ,</hi> that is, to the dishonour of God, or contrary to the precepts of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it were perfidiousness to observe it. Wherefore <hi>Simancha's</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is clearly this, that no private man can be obliged, by vertue of any promise, more to countenance and protect <hi>an Heretique,</hi> contrary to the law, then he can be oblig'd to do the same to <hi>High-way men,</hi> or <hi>Pyrats;</hi> because such a promise being against the publique good, and forbidden by the law, (as 'tis in <hi>Spain,</hi> where <hi>Simancha</hi> wrote, and where the Law strictly obliges all persons to detect Heretiques, as much as it doth <hi>Felons</hi> and <hi>Murtherers</hi>) cannot be observed without sin. Which meaning of his is also further confirm'd, by what he writes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <hi>Si tamen fides Haereticis data est à Principe, vel publicâ Potestate,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. §. 54.</note> 
                  <hi>exactè servanda est,</hi> &amp;c. <q>But (saith he) if Faith be given to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques by the Prince, or by those that have Publique Authority, it must be exactly observed, <hi>save onely, when the thing promised is against the Law of God or of Nature.</hi>
                  </q> By which it appears, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincere, or unadvised, the Bishop was in quoting this Author. Nor deals he any better with the Jesuits; they are likewise accus'd (in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral) to teach, <hi>that Faith given is not to be kept with Heretiques,</hi> whereas neither himself, nor all his gang, are able to name one of them for that opinion.</p>

                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:57798:85"/>
4. But (if you please) let us take yet a Turn or two with his Lordship in this part of his Labyrinth. First, <hi>John Huss</hi> (sayes he) <hi>and Hierome of Prague were burnt for all their Safe-Conduct;</hi> by which manner of speaking he seems to insinuate, that both their <hi>Safe-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts</hi> were granted <hi>jure speciali, viz.</hi> to preserve them not onely from <hi>unjust violence,</hi> but even from process and execution of Justice: which, in that of <hi>Hierome of Prague</hi> is apparently false; for the clause <hi>Salvâ tamen justitiâ</hi> is expresly inserted in it: and till our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries have prov'd the contrary, we must suppose that the like, and no other, was granted to <hi>Huss.</hi> Secondly, he takes for granted that <hi>publique Faith was violated</hi> in the persons of those two Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents; which, in relation to <hi>Hierome of Prague</hi> is notoriously false; the Council observing most punctually towards him whatever it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised: and for <hi>Huss,</hi> it promised him no security at all. If what the Emperour promis'd him, were <hi>jure speciali,</hi> (which our Adversaries cannot prove) yet being granted by a Secular Prince in a cause so clearly Ecclesiastical and Spiritual, we have said above, it could not impede the proceeding of that Supreme Ecclesiastical Tribunal: If it were <hi>jure communi</hi> onely; to an obstinate Heretique (as he was) it signified nothing.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>all men know</hi> (sayes he) <hi>that the Emperour was us'd by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Council to bring</hi> Huss <hi>thither:</hi> which he pretends to prove by a Latin Authority of I know not whom; for he cites onely <hi>Edit. in</hi> 16<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. and afterwards, <hi>ibid.</hi> leaving us to guess who his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour should be: But we will shew his Lordship all the respect we can, and suppose he meant to cite some Authour of Credit. What doth he say? onely this. <hi>Sigismundus Hussum Constantiam vocat, &amp; missis literis, publicâ side cavet.</hi> Which no way intimates whether it were done by the Councils instigation, or meerly of his own motion. How then can his Lordship hence prove, any secret Compact between the Emperour and the Council, or any underhand dealing of the Council, by the Emperours means, to bring <hi>Huss</hi> within their power, by his relying upon an unsufficient caution? The Bishops <hi>Dilemma</hi> therefore is easily solv'd, who argues thus. <hi>If the Fathers did it in cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the Emperour should give Safe Conduct, which themselves meant not to keep, then they broke Faith. If the Emperour knew they would not keep it, then he himself broke Faith, in giving a Safe Conduct, which he knew to be invalid.</hi> This is his Argument. But I answer. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Council use any such deceitful practice with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: nor did the Emperour give <hi>Huss</hi> any Security, but what he thought might be good and effectual; yea, he did make the Security good, at least to the utmost of his power, that is, so farre as in such a case it either beseem'd or concern'd him to do.</p>
               <p>We have already told his Lordship, that the Council onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that when promise is made by Secular Power to the prejudice of Ecclesiastical Proceedings in causes of Heresie, it is not of force. This is the whole intent of the Council; and the Relatour is much to blame, for imperfectly citing the Decree, with so many &amp;c's. to dazzle the eyes of his Reader, and make him believe what he pleases. Whereas that which the Council ordains, is not onely of most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57798:85"/>
right in regard of the Church, but also of evident neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. For if Temporal Princes may claim a Power, by their <hi>Safe-Conducts,</hi> or other promises made to Heretiques, to impede and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the Churches lawful and Canonical proceedings in such cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, what will become of Ecclesiastical <hi>Authority, Immunity, Liberty,</hi> &amp;c. Every Heretique or Sectary, how turbulent and seditious so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if he can but procure a <hi>Safe Conduct,</hi> or the word of some Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince for his Security, shall be exempt from Censure, may preach, write, spread Heresie without check, or controul. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council sayes no more in effect, then is in it self evident, <hi>viz.</hi> that an inseriour Tribunal cannot hinder the proceedings of a superiour. But enough of this matter.</p>
               <p>To his Lordships Question, <hi>why they should go to Rome to a General Council, and have their freedom of speech, since the Church of Rome is resolved to alter nothing,</hi> I answer, Protestants were never invited to a General Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> to reform the Church, (that's a work, to which they can pretend no competent Authoriy) but they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited thither to be better instructed, and reclaimed from their errours. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church is sufficiently authoriz'd by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> viz. that <note place="margin">Galat. 1.</note> though an Angel from heaven should teach otherwayes then shee had taught, he ought not to be believ'd. In like manner the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> might with good reason be resolv'd firmly to stick to the Doctrine, they had formerly been taught by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, notwithstanding any pretended difficulties, or obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, brought against it, either by Bishops or any other person.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His Lordship goes on, and blames both <hi>A. C.</hi> and <hi>F. Campi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 9.</note> too, for their boldness, in saying, that <hi>no good answer can be given</hi> by English Protestants, <hi>why they refuse to grant a publique Disputation to Catholicks.</hi> The Bishop thinks it a very good Answer, to say, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath no reason to admit of a publique Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with us, till we be able to <hi>shew it under the Seal, and Powers of Rome,</hi> that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>will submit to a Third, who may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Judge</hi> between Catholicks and Protestants, or <hi>to such a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council, as is after mentioned.</hi> But I would fain know, who this <hi>Third, indifferent Judge,</hi> should be. If he prove an <hi>Heretique,</hi> or <hi>Schismatique,</hi> he will hardly be found <hi>indifferent:</hi> 'tis to be fear'd, he will be <hi>partial</hi> in the cause. Perchance, he shall be some <hi>Atheist, Turk,</hi> or <hi>Jew: Judges</hi> fitly chosen, (indeed) to sit upon the Church of God. But would his Lordship (think you) have taken it for a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Answer, if some Brownist, or other Sectary in his time (upon his Lordships vouchsafing to dispute with them, in hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to union and obedience) should have answered, <hi>we will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Dispute, provided your Lordship, and the rest of your Prelatical Church of</hi> England, <hi>will accept of a Third, to be Judge between you and us?</hi> might not the Arrians, (or any other Ancient Heretiques) have as well required a <hi>Third,</hi> to judge between them and Catholiques in Controversies, wherein they differed? Yea, may not every known Rebel, upon the like pretense, demand a <hi>Third,</hi> to be Judge between him and the King his Sovereign, and in case of refusal, remain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate in his rebellion, even as well as the Protestants do persist in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57798:86"/>
their spiritual Disloyalty to the Vicar of Christ, because <hi>a Third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> is not accepted to be Judge between him and them? To what he intimates of a General Council, we say, if it be a lawful one, <hi>viz.</hi> call'd and approv'd, by the Pope as Head of the Church (as all lawful General Councils hitherto have been) we shall never refuse to submit to it, but heartily wish, that all the Relatours party would do the same.</p>

It was, because by their Heretical doctrine and Schismatical proceedings they had first separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves from the Church, and became both unworthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable (any longer) of her Communion. They had raised a new, Separate, and mutinous Faction of pretended Christians, distinct from the one, Catholique, or general, Body of the Church; They had chosen to themselves new Pastors, independent of any ordinary and lawful Pastours of Christs Church, that were before them. They had instituted new Rites and Ceremonies of religion, fram'd new Liturgies, or Forms of Divine Service; They had schismatically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd in several Synods, or Conventicles, and there broacht new He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Confessions of Faith, contrary, not only to the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Faith, but to the Faith of all particular Churches what ever, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent in the world immediately before they began. Thus, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of themselves first departed from the Churches Doctrine and Communion; and persisting obstinate in their evil opinions and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, the Church was forc'd to proceed against them according to the Canons, and by <hi>just censure</hi> cast them out of her bosom; lest otherwise by their scandalons division, high disobedience, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent

doctrine they might further infect the Flock of Christ, which was committed to her charge.</p>
               <p>The Bishop denies he ever granted, <hi>that Protestants did first depart, otherwise than he had before expressed,</hi> §. 21. num. 6. But that is enough: he there acknowledges that an <hi>actual separation</hi> (at least) was made by Protestants: and <hi>A. C.</hi> here asserts no more. Whether this <hi>actual separation</hi> were <hi>upon a just cause preceding</hi> (as the Relatour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends) is a thing to be disputed between <hi>A. C.</hi> and him: although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it be of it self clear enough to any who duly considers it, that Protestants neither had, nor could have, any <hi>just cause</hi> for such a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, as <hi>A. C. pag.</hi> 55, 56. and all Catholiques do charge them with. For it was a Separation not onely from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but (as <hi>Calvin</hi> himself, <hi>Epist.</hi> 14. confesses) <hi>à toto mundo,</hi> from the whole <hi>Christian</hi> world: and such a Separation necessarily involves separation from the <hi>True Catholique</hi> Church; from which, as it hath been often urg'd already, even by the confession of Protestants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, 'tis impossible there should ever be <hi>just cause</hi> to separate.</p>
               <p>The Bishop grants, that <hi>Corruption in manners onely is no just cause to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>make a separation from the Church of God,</hi> yet cannot forbear to have a fling at the corrupt manners of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> quoting for that purpose Dr. <hi>Stapleton.</hi> But I wonder our Adversaries take notice of such things. Are they themselves without blame? Is there no <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of manners</hi> amongst them? Surely yes; but passion blindes them, and they are like those who being brought into a most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant garden, richly beautified with variety of usefull herbs and odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous flowers, should pass over all this, and onely entertain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with looking upon some few weeds, which their curious or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther malicious eyes had there spy'd. For they take no notice of the Sanctity and Good life, perspicuous in very many both of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Laiety, in the Roman Church. They will not see the great variety of <hi>Religious Orders,</hi> wherewith the garment of the Church is, as it were, embroidered, (<hi>Astitit Regina à dextris tuis in vestitu deau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato, circumdata varietate, Psal.</hi> 44. <hi>ver.</hi> 10.) in which so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of both Sexes tye themselves to the Service of God by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Vowes, never to be dissolv'd by their own seeking; praying, and singing divine Hymnes day and night; which is a strange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of thing amongst Protestants. They tell us of many Popes that have been wicked; but they never mention, how many of them have been (undeniably) men of most holy life and Saint-like conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; I mean, not onely those of the Primitive and golden ages, (wherein no less then thirty (or more) successively one after another, for three hundred years together and upwards, were either Martyrs, or glorious Confessors, for the Christian Faith) but even of late, and in this our Iron Age.</p>
               <p>The discovery of some few motes darkens not the brightness of the Sun-shine. What if some few Catholique Authors are of opinion, that some of the Popes, as private Doctours, have fallen into Heresie; though <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and others deny it, and rather shew the contrary? What if some others have fallen into other foul Crimes? was there not, even in the Colledge of the Apostles, one that deny'd, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57798:87"/>
that betray'd his Master? Besides, it may be worth the noting, that amongst Catholiques, though Sins be committed, yet they are seldome maintained; they are not defended, nor justified as <hi>Good Works:</hi> whereas among Protestants <hi>Darkness</hi> it self is called <hi>Light,</hi> and the greatest of all Sins, <hi>viz.</hi> Heresie, Scisme, Sacriledge, Rebellion, &amp;c. together with all the bad spawn they leave behinde them, are cry'd up for perfect vertue, zeal, godly Reformation, and what not? Let our Adversaries therefore still bark, they shall never hinder <hi>Sanctity of life</hi> from being a mark of the <hi>True,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: though our chief quarrel with them for the present, be for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to brand her with <hi>Doctrinal errours;</hi> upon which account they <note place="margin">Ibid. §. 23.</note> both separate from her Communion, and attempt that horrid work of their deformed Reformation. But in vain do they attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Church, of what she can never be guilty. They ought rather to reform themselves, and disclaim those errours, which with Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Schismatical obstinacy they have so long maintain'd against her.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But I return to his Lordship, who grounding himself upon the Separation of the ten Tribes, averres, that <hi>a particular Church may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it self.</hi> But whether or no, or how this may be done, I referre my Reader to what shall be said hereafter. For the present I onely note, that his Lordship goes upon false grounds. Thus he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. <hi>Was it not lawful</hi> (sayes he) <hi>for</hi> Juda <hi>to reform her self, when</hi> Israel <note place="margin">§ 24. num. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>would not joyn? Sure it was.</hi> First, by this Rhetorical Interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and answer he supposes that <hi>Juda</hi> reform'd her self; which is false. For <hi>Juda</hi> being the Orthodox Church, united with her Head, the High Priest, and not tainted with any Doctrinal errours, what need, I pray, was there of her reformation? His Text out of <hi>Osee</hi>

                  </note>, <hi>Though Israel transgress, yet let not Juda sin,</hi> by which he endeavours to prove that <hi>Juda</hi> reform'd her self, is rather against, then for him; because in any indifferent mans judgement these words, <hi>Though Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael trangress, yet at least let not Juda sin,</hi> have rather this sense, <hi>Let not Juda at least fall into Schisme, though Israel does,</hi> then the sense following, <hi>Let Juda reform her self.</hi> Secondly, he supposes that <hi>Juda</hi> is the <hi>Protestant party;</hi> which is also false. For if you be <hi>Juda,</hi> who, I pray, are the revolted <hi>Ten Tribes?</hi> who are of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal? But let us see what a pretty Parallel there is between <hi>Juda</hi> and you. <hi>Juda</hi> remain'd in <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> you left the Catholique <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> that is <hi>Rome, the City of peace,</hi> in whose bosom you were brought up. <hi>Juda</hi> never went to <hi>Dan</hi> nor <hi>Bethel,</hi> never made Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> never adored <hi>golden Calves.</hi> You made new Synagogues, to which you resorted; new and unheard of <note n="b" place="margin">Sacerdotes de extremis populi, qui non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Is not his Lordships Parallel then between <hi>Juda</hi> and the Protestant party very pat, and much to the purpose?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:57798:87"/>
He would have had far better success, had he compar'd his Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical party with the ten revolted Tribes of <hi>Israel:</hi> for this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel comes very home, not only in respect of the people misled, but also in regard of the misleaders, even in <hi>England. Jeroboam</hi> had no title at all to the Crown of <hi>Israel.</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was declar'd <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lègitimate</hi> and <hi>uncapable to inherit</hi> her Fathers Crown by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. <note place="margin">28. Hen. 8. cap. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Jeroboam</hi> out of ungodly Policy, the better to secure his usurp'd Crown, caused the ten Tribes to desert the old and true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Juda,</hi> which they had ever since their being <hi>Gods people,</hi> most constantly and universally professed. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> more out of <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Reason of State,</hi> then of <hi>Conscience,</hi> to fasten the Crown of <hi>England</hi> upon her head, made a Schisme from the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, abolished the Catholique and True Religion (which had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in <hi>England</hi> for so many hundred years before) purposely to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate her self with the common people, which easily inclines to all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness, and utterly disable that party from ever prevailing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in Parliament, which formerly had voted against her. <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> to the end his rebellious party might never return to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and be united with the High-Priest in the true religion, set up a new Synagogue, new Priests, new Sacrifices and new Ceremonies. Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to the end her Schismatical party might never piece again with their <hi>Spirituall</hi> Head, the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> set on foot a new Church, new Bishops, new Pastours, new Liturgies, and new Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. In fine, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> stretcht forth his hand against the true <note place="margin">3. Reg. 13. 1.</note> Prophet of <hi>Juda,</hi> and commanded him to be apprehended. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> stretcht forth her hand not against one onely, but all Priests and all Catholiques; witness the bloody persecution rais'd against them in her dayes; when it was made Treason for Priests to come into <hi>England,</hi> to exercise any Priestly Function, to have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with <hi>Rome;</hi> and a capital crime even to hear Mass, or but har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a Priest. And what I pray, is true piety in Gods sight, if all these be capital offences? But enough of this Parallel.</p>
               <p>His Lordship, even during the Schisme of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> will yet needs have <hi>Israel a True Church.</hi> But I answer, They were no <hi>true Church,</hi> because they rejected the Authority of the High Priest, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to communicate in the Sacrifices and Worship of God at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and adored the <hi>golden Calves</hi> of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> 'Tis true, there were many holy persons, inhabitants of the same Countrey with the rest, who kept themselves undefiled from those Idolatries and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; who though they were not (perhaps) suffered to go up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> to worship, yet never consented to go to <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Bethel.</hi> These we acknowledge, remained parts of the True Church, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Schisme; as many Catholiques do now continue true members of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, though living dispersedly in Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Countreys. And the Prophets who were amongst them, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a part of the True Church at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> for which reason, for the most part the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> persecuted them, as Catholiques also now are commonly persecuted by <hi>Heathen, Mahumetan,</hi> and <hi>Heretical</hi> Princes. The <hi>having-Prophets</hi> therefore among them argues the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> no more to be parts of the true Church, then it would argue the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57798:88"/>
Protestants in <hi>Holland</hi> to be parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, if some <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique should be found among them having the spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.</p>
               <p>But his Lordship will prove by some Texts of Scripture, that the ten Tribes continued <hi>a Church,</hi> notwithstanding their <hi>Schisme</hi> and Idolatry. But to that of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> 9. 17. I answer first, this Prophet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied both against <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Israel;</hi> and the word <hi>Israel</hi> being an Appellative, common to all the seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> 'tis not certain, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes means by it the ten Schismatical Tribes onely, and not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Tribe of <hi>Juda</hi> also. Secondly I say, the Relatours Gloss addes to the Text. God doth not there threaten to cast <hi>Israel</hi> away <hi>in non Ecclesiam,</hi> as the Bishop speaks, that is, to un-church them, as if (forsooth) before that threatning they had been a <hi>true</hi> Church: this is the Relatours own voluntary addition, or fiction rather; but he threatens, simply to deprive them of his wonted protection, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them into their enemies hands, and (as the very next words shew) <hi>to make them wanderers among the Nations,</hi> that should take them captive.</p>
               <p>To that of 4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 9. 6. where they are called <hi>the people of the Lord,</hi> I answer, in a general sense all <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed <hi>according to the flesh</hi> are styled <hi>the people of God,</hi> by reason of that promise of God made to Abraham, Gen. 18. <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee;</hi> but <hi>Abraham's</hi> seed only <hi>according to the spirit,</hi> that is, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, make the True Church.</p>
               <p>To his last Argument, (which he advanceth as <hi>ad hominem</hi>) that <hi>Multitude is a note of the Church.</hi> I answer, we do not contend that of Christians the greater multitude is an infallible mark of the true Church. There was a time when the Arrians were reported to be more numerous then the Orthodox.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son as well as from the Father, was a Truth alwayes acknowledg'd in the Church of God, and receiv'd in General Councils, long before the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie touching that point arose between the Latins and the Greeks. Witness that Epistle of St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which he wrote (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us) from the Council of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>a Bellarm. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto, cap.</hi> 23. §. His ergo omissis.</note> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> wherein are these words, <hi>Spiritus appellatus est veritatis; &amp; veritas Christus est: unde &amp; ab isto similiter, sicut &amp; ex Patre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit.</hi> The Holy Ghost (saith he) is called <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> and Christ is <hi>the Truth;</hi> whence follows that he <hi>proceeds</hi> as well <hi>from him,</hi> as <hi>from the Father.</hi> Thus he. Now this Epistle of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> and the Council of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> likewise shews, was receiv'd not only by the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which was about the year of our Lord 434. but also by four other General Councils held in <hi>Greece</hi> it self: and consequently the Doctrine of the Holy Ghosts Procession, was a Truth so anciently known in the Church, that it could not well seem a novelty to any, when the express confession of it came to be more frequent and publick in the Latin Church. It matters not much, in what capacity it was <hi>promulgated by the Church of Rome,</hi> whether as a <hi>particular</hi> Church, as the Bishop contends, or as <hi>Head</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 2.</note> of the Church Universal, as we think. For either way, it could not but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57798:88"/>
be very lawful for that Church to do it: nor can it help his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships cause, which way foever it was done. For supppose a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church may (in some case) promulgate an Orthodox Truth, not as yet Catholiquely receiv'd or defined by the whole Church; doth it thence follow that a <hi>particular</hi> Church (or Churches) may <hi>repeal</hi> and <hi>reverse</hi> any thing that the whole Church hath already Catholick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Definitively received? Surely no. Yet this is his Lordships, and the Protestants case.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence the Relatours egregious Fallacy is manifest, while from the adding of a <hi>Word</hi> onely, by some particular Church for Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a known, ancient, and generally received <note n="b" place="margin">See Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin, <hi>ubi suprà.</hi>
                  </note> Truth, (such as was the Procession of the Holy Ghost both from the Father and Son) he pretends to inferre both these Propositions, <hi>viz.</hi> That a <hi>particular Church may publish any thing that is Catholick, where the whole Church is silent;</hi> and <hi>that a particular Church may reform any thing that is not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, where the whole Church is negligent, or will not.</hi> For though the former of these Propositions be not so enormious as the latter, because it supposes not any actual errour, contrary to Catholique Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to be maintained by the whole Church, but onely a <hi>Non decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> or, at most, some negligence to promulgate a Catholick Truth, whereas the other supposes errour, of something <hi>uncatholick,</hi> to be taught or admitted by the whole Church; yet are they both utterly Paradoxical and False, and no way to be inferr'd from the example, or practise of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in declaring the Holy Ghosts <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi> from the Son: for that was of a point anciently and generally received in the Church.

               <p>For about the year of our Lord 1517. when their pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations began, was not the Real Presence of our Saviours Body and Blood in the Eucharist, by a true substantial change of Bread and Wine, generally held by the whole Church? Was not the Real Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Mass then generally believ'd? Was not Veneration of Holy Images, Invocation of Saints, Purgatory, Praying for the Dead that they might be eased of their pains, and receive the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of their sins, generally used and practis'd by all Christians? Was not Freewill, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Yea even among those who in some few other points dissented from the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Latin</hi> Church? To what purpose then doth the Bishop urge, that a <hi>particular Church may publish any thing, that is Catholique?</hi> this doth not justifie at all his reformation: he should prove, that it may not onely <hi>adde,</hi> but <hi>take away</hi> something that is Catholique from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church: for this the pretended Reformers did, as well in <hi>England,</hi> as elsewhere.</p>

All that can be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Authours (so far as I can yet learn) concerning this point is, that in the Councils of <hi>Toledo</hi> and <hi>Luca</hi> assembled against the Hereticks call'd <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> the word is found inserted in the Creed; which is suppos'd to have been done upon the Authority of an Epistle they had receiv'd from Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the first, wherein he affirms the Processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghost to be both from the Father and Son.

But perhaps that may be more probable which <hi>Stanislaus So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colovius</hi> tells us, in his Latin Translation of the Answer of <hi>Hieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> pag. 8. <hi>viz.</hi> that the Fathers of the first Council at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> (which is the second General) sending the Confession of their Faith to Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> and his Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope and Council at <hi>Rome</hi> approv'd of their said Confession, but yet added, by way of explication, the word <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioque</hi> to the Article which concern'd the Holy Ghost; and this they did, to signifie that the Holy Ghost, as True God <hi>proceeded</hi> from the Son, and was not <hi>made</hi> or <hi>created</hi> by him, as some Heretiques in those times began to teach. Neither doth he affirm this without citation of some credible Authority: adding withall, that this Definition, or Declaration of the Pope, was for some hundreds of years general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted and embrac'd by the whole Church, neither Greeks nor Latins dissenting, or taking any exception at the word <hi>Filioque,</hi> till about the time of the Eighth Synod; where the <hi>Greeks</hi> first began publiquely to cavil against it, more out of pride and peevish emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the <hi>Latins,</hi> then for any urgent Reasons, they had to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test it more then their predecessours before them. But of this I need not contend further with his Lordship.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To return therefore to our business of Reformation, we grant in effect as great power, as the Bishop himself does, to particular Churches, to National and Provincial Councils, in reforming er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and abuses either of doctrine or practice onely we require, that they proceed with due respect to the chief Pastour of the Church, and have recourse to him in all matters and decrees of Faith, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they define, or declare, points not generally known and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to be Catholique Truths.

unhandsome from an inferiour) but rather the <hi>Physician</hi> of it, to whose Care and Government it was committed.</p>
               <p>Neither do I think it convenient, to stay for a General Council, when the errours and abuses to be redressed are such, as call for speedy remedy, and threaten greater mischief, if they be not timely prevented. When the <hi>Gangrene</hi> endangers life, we do well to betake our selves to the next Chyrurgeon, that is, a Provincial Council: This in such a case, with the Popes assistance, is acknowledg'd a Physician compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and able to apply all due remedy to the Churches infirmities: although I confess the most proper Expedient, specially for all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that concern the Church in general, is an Oecumenical Council. Such as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was; whatever the Bishop (without <note place="margin">Ibidem n. 4.</note> any reason given) sayes to the contrary: nor can any thing be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against it, which upon due examination will not be found as easily applyable to all other approved Councils, which the Church hath yet had: so that by disowning this, we should in effect disown all others. But suppose it had not been <hi>General;</hi> yet sure it was for Number, Learning, and Authority, far surpassing any National Council, or Synod, which the Protestants, either of <hi>England</hi> or any other Nation ever had. Wherefore, if their Assemblies, or Synods, so inconsiderable as they were, are yet esteem'd of sufficient Authority to make reformation in matters of Faith, and correct what doctrine they imagin'd erroneous in the Catholique Church, shall not the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> be as sufficient to assure us, that the said pretended errours are indeed no errours at all, but Divine Truths, and the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual universally receiv'd <hi>Traditions</hi> of Christs Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But it is yet more strange, that our Adversary should also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject want of <hi>Freedom</hi> to this Council; seeing that even by the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own partial and malevolent <note n="a" place="margin">Paulus Suavius <hi>(the Venetian Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) his history of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of</hi> Trent, <hi>twice printed here at</hi> London <hi>by publique Authority.</hi>
                  </note> Historian, it sufficiently appears, that neither the Prelates wanted full liberty of Suffrage, nor the Divines of Disputation, and maintaining their several asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the best manner they could. His Lordship had done well to have lookt nearer home, and consider'd how matters were carried in <hi>England,</hi> much about that time. If the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> were not <hi>a free</hi> Council, what was that Protestant Synod of <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1562. in which the thirty nine Articles, that is, the summe of the Protestant Faith and Religion in <hi>England,</hi> were fram'd? Was that a Free Synod? First, at <hi>Trent</hi> all the Prelates in Christendome, that could be invited and were concern'd in the Resolutions of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, being solemnly call'd, did come, and assist (either in their persons or proxies) both at the Deliberations, and Determinations of the Assembly. I adde, that the Protestants themselves were likewise invited, with <hi>full security</hi> to come and go, if they had pleas'd; but of this we have spoken already. Whereas at <hi>London,</hi> to that Synod of English Protestants, not one of the lawfull English Prelates were call'd, or permitted to come; who yet of all others were most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd and ought to have been there present, as well by reason of their Authority and Function, as of their just interest. What speak I of the Prelates? not so much as one of the English Catholiques (how numerous soever they were at that time) were call'd to that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57798:90"/>
Assembly, but all (both Pastours and people) were condemn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without being heard, or allow'd to speak one word for themselves.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Trent</hi> there were no Bishops illegally depriv'd of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks, purposely to cashier their Votes in Council, nor any others included into their places, contrary to the Canons of the Church, purposely to vote down the said Churches established Doctrine and Canons. In <hi>England</hi> it is notorious, that all the lawful Prelates of that Nation were most illegally and arbitrarily depriv'd of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks, for no other end, but to evacuate their Authority in the Nation; and Lay-Bishops thrust into their places, purposely to vote down and abolish Catholique Religion by some colour of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and seigned shew of a pretended Ecclesiastical Synod. At <hi>Trent</hi> nothing had been done, or was done, in matter of Religion, by the Pope or any other person, in way of Determination, or <hi>New Decree,</hi> but by and upon the most unanimous and general resolutions of that Council. In <hi>England</hi> ('tis too notorious to be deny'd) Religion was already chang'd by the Queen and a few meer-lay-persons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (scarce enough to make a legal vote, had the matter been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for them) and this Synod of <hi>London</hi> call'd apparently not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate matters of Religion, as they ought to be debated in a <hi>Free Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Synod,</hi> but to <hi>serve designs,</hi> and to boulster up by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, titular, and usurp'd Authority, what before-hand had most Uncanonically been resolv'd upon by the State. This his Lordship should have a little reflected on, when he objected want of <hi>Freedom</hi> to the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But it seems, he could more easily see a Mote in another man's eye, then a Beam in his own.</p>

Who knows not, that the Pope is so far from being a hinderance to such Assemblies, that it is no small part of his Apostolical vigilancy for the good of the Church, to encourage and stir up the Bishops of other Nations and Provinces to the frequent holding of them? But we affirm that in matters of greater moment, which concern the Faith and publique Doctrine of the Church, Sacraments, and whatever else is of Divine

Institution, or universal obligation, <hi>particular</hi> Councils (if they duly proceed) attempt nothing without recourse to the Sea Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and the Popes consent either expresly granted, or justly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd.</p>
               <p>The Bishop indeed all along pretends the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and Provincial Councils did reform in matters of Faith and Doctrine, both without and against the Popes consent: and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him so to do; for without this granted, his Lordship knew well enough, it would be impossible for him to justifie the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of his English Church.

Secondly, the Bishop cites <hi>Concilium Romanum sub Sylvestro;</hi> but here the very title confutes his pretence: for the Council was held <hi>sub Sylvestro,</hi> under the Pope; therefore not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or against him. And at the Council of <hi>Gangres, Osius</hi> was Popes <hi>Sylvesters</hi> Legate, and the Canons of this Council, as Pope <note place="margin">Baron. ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num <hi>319.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>His third proof is <hi>Concilium Carthiginense primum,</hi> which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed assembled by <hi>Gratus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but no new Article De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in it; onely the perpetual Tradition of the Church, touching <hi>Non-rebaptization,</hi> was confirm'd therein, having been defined long before by sundry Popes, and also by the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> For this Council therefore of <hi>Carthage</hi> no man can be so hardy as to deny, but that the Popes consent, if it were not expresly had, yet might be justly presum'd. In the Synod of <hi>Aquileia</hi> (which is his fourth proof) the Bishop himself findes nothing, but only that <hi>Palladius</hi> and <hi>Secundinus</hi> were therein condemn'd <hi>for embracing the Arian Heresie:</hi> which having been already condemn'd by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> with other Bishops of <hi>Italy</hi> being present at <hi>Aquileia,</hi> who can doubt, but every thing was there done by the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and consent? His fifth proof is the second, otherwise call'd the third, Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> which was so far from being held against the Popes consent, that in the forty eighth Canon 'tis expresly resolv'd by the Council, to consult Pope <hi>Syricius</hi> concerning the matter of that Decree. His sixth proof is the Council of <hi>Milevis</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> condemning the Heresie of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> But was not (I pray) the Sea Apostolique consulted in that grand affair? Sure it was. St. <hi>Austin</hi> above cited will avouch as much. His seventh proof, is the second Council of <hi>Aurange</hi> which was assembled by means of <hi>Felix</hi> Bishop <note place="margin">Geunad. de Scrip. Eccl. cap. <hi>86.</hi>
                  </note> of <hi>Rome:</hi> so far was it from being held without the Popes consent.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57798:91"/>
After this comes the third Council of <hi>Toledo;</hi> which was so devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Authority of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> that in Recognition thereof it decreed, that all Constitutions of Councils, and <hi>all the Synodical Epistles of the Roman Bishops should remain in their ancient force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what sayes his <hi>Reserve,</hi> his Master-Allegation, the Fourth Council of <hi>Toledo?</hi> just as much as the rest. <hi>It added</hi> (sayes the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop) <hi>some things to the Creed, which were not expresly deliver'd in former Creeds.</hi> So they might well do, for fuller explication of what was implicitely deliver'd before, and in opposition to Heresies already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the whole Church. Did it adde any thing <hi>contrary</hi> to to the common Faith of the Church, or of the Sea Apostolique? which is the question in hand, and which <hi>Protestants</hi> did in all their pretended National <hi>Pseudo-Synods?</hi> Neither needed the Prelates to <hi>ask</hi> express <hi>leave of the Sea of Rome</hi> to convene and determine matters concerning the whole Church, provided it were done with due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to the Sea Apostolique. For that thus a National Synod may proceed, the Council of <hi>Milevis</hi> a little above cited doth suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare; which with the Authority of the Sea Apostolique concurring, condemn'd the Heresie of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> By such examples as these does our Adversary labour to justifie his Reformed English Church: Thus does he prove, that Provincial and Particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils may sometimes make Reformation in matters of Faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, without, yea against the Authority of the Apostolique Sea. Hath he not worthily acquitted himself of his Province think you? when in all the instances he brings, there is not the least glance, or intimation of any thing done <hi>contrary</hi> to the Popes Authority, but express mention of it, and of due regard towards it. He urges again, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> added the word <hi>Filioque</hi> to the Creed: But can any man in his wits think it was done without and against the <hi>Popes</hi> consent? Surely the Relatour cannot be thought here to have well minded his matter, or peradventure he perswaded himself, the multitude of his Allegations would serve to hide the impertinency of them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Yet, after so many lost proofs, with a confidence as great, as if they had been all Demonstrations, he asks us the question, <hi>And if this</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>was practis'd so often, and in so many places, why may not a National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Church of England do the like?</hi> Truly I know no reason why it may not, provided it be a True National Council, and a True Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as those recited were true Churches and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils) and provided also that it do no more. But seeing (as his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words declare) by <hi>the Church of England,</hi> he menas the present Protestant Church there, and by <hi>National Council</hi> either that <hi>Pseudo-Synod</hi> above-mentioned in the year 1562. or some other like it, I must crave leave of his Lordship to deny his supposition, and tell him <hi>the Church of England</hi> in that sense, signifies <hi>no true Church,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is such a <hi>National Council</hi> to be accounted <hi>a lawful Synod,</hi> duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative of the true English Church. For is it not notorious, that the persons constituting that pretended Synod in the year 1562. were all manifest usurpers? Is it not manifest, that they all by force
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57798:91"/>
intruded themselves both into the Seas of other lawful Bishops, and into the <hi>Cures</hi> of other lawful Pastours, quietly and Canonically possessed of them before their said Intrusion? Can those be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a lawful National Council of <hi>England,</hi> or lawfully to represent the English Church, who never had any lawful, that is, Canonical and Just Vocation, Mission, or Jurisdiction given them to and over the English Nation?</p>
               <p>But suppose they had been True Bishops and Pastors of the English Church, and their Assembly a lawful National Council, yet were they so far from <hi>doing the like</hi> to what the forementioned particular Churches and Councils did, that they acted directly contrary to them. Not one of those Councils condemned any point of Faith, that had been generally believ'd and practis'd in the Church before them, as this Synod of <hi>London</hi> did: Not one of them contradicted the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as this did: None of them convened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the express will of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as this Conventicle did. None of them deny'd the Popes Authority, or attempted to deprive him of it, as these did, so far as 'twas in their power. What Parallel then is there between the proceedings of the abovesaid Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Synods, or Councils, of <hi>Rome, Gangres, Carthage, Aquileia,</hi> &amp;c. and the Bishops pretended Synod of Protestants at <hi>London</hi> in the year 1562.</p>
               <p>What the Bishops in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time did, is known <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> and confess'd, not only by Bishop <hi>Gardiner</hi> afterward in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> reign, (who was the learnedst Prelat then in <hi>England</hi>) but even by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Authors, to have been extorted from them rather by threats &amp; force, then otherwise, and consequently can be of no great advantage to the Bishop. And yet what they <hi>subscrib'd</hi> was far out-done by the Synod of 62. For though the <hi>Henry-Bishops</hi> (as we may call them for distinction) seemingly at least renounced the Popes <hi>Canonical</hi> and <hi>acquired</hi> Jurisdiction here in <hi>England,</hi> I mean, that Authority and Jurisdiction in Ecclesiastical matters, which the Pope exercis'd here by vertue of the Canons, Prescription, and other title of <hi>humane Right,</hi> and gave it to the King, yet they never renounc'd, or depriv'd him of that part of his Authority, which is far more intrinsecal to his office and absolutely of <hi>Divine Right;</hi> they never deny'd the Popes Sovereign Power <hi>to teach the universal Church,</hi> and determine all Controversies of Faith whatsoever with a General Council: nor did they dissent from him in any of those points of Faith, which that Synod of <hi>London</hi> condemned in the year 1562. That which the King aim'd at, was to get the Power into his hands, and to have those Authorities, Prerogatives, Immunities annexed to his Crown, which the Pope enjoyed, and had exercised <hi>here in England</hi> time out minde, in Ecclesiastical Causes, that is, in the Goverment and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the English Church; and to this the Bishops yielded: but what concern'd the Popes Authority in relation to the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, for ought appears clearly to the contrary, both the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and the King too, left the Pope in possession of all that he could rightly challenge.</p>

Was it for any thing else, that they sack't and demolisht so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Monasteries and Religious Houses, alienating their Lands and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, but because by the principles of Reformation they held it Superstition to be a Religious Person, or to live a Monastical life? Was it for any thing else, that they pluckt down Altars, burnt Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, defac'd the Monuments of the Dead, brake the Church-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, threw down Crosses, tore the Holy Vestments in pieces, &amp;c. but because they thought them all Instruments of Idolatry and false Worship, as they tearm it? was it for any thing else, that they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest themselves of Ecclesiastical Benefices, took upon them Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Jurisdictions and Pastoral Charges, by force of Secular Power and Authority, from those that were in lawful and quiet possession of them according to the Canons of the Church, but because according to the Maximes of their new Belief, they held the old Pastours of the Church to be <hi>False Teachers,</hi> and their Function neither lawful nor of use among Christians? 'Tis clear then, that the <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> works of the Reformers, and the wicked <hi>Tenets</hi> of the Reformation, differ onely as the Tree and its Fruit: they are not altogether the same, but yet the one springs connaturally from the other; the one begets and bears the other, as naturally, as a <hi>corrupt Tree bears bad fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can his Lordship so easily wash his hands of the guilt, as he seems willing to do, by saying, <hi>they are long since gone to God to answer it,</hi> as if none could be involv'd in this crime, but onely the first Actors.

               <p>MR. <hi>Fisher</hi> askt his Lordship, <hi>QUO JUDICE doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Church of Rome hath err'd in matters of Faith?</hi> as not thinking it equity, that Protestants in their own cause should be <hi>Accusers, Witnesses,</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. The Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <note place="margin">§. 25. num. 1.</note> in answer to this confesseth, that <hi>no man in common equity ought to be suffer'd to be Accuser, Witness, and Judge in his own cause.</hi> But yet addes, <hi>there is as little reason, or equity, that any man who is to be accused, should be the accused, and yet Witness and Judge in his own cause. If the first may hold,</hi> (saith he) <hi>no man shall be innocent: and if the last, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  will be nocent.</hi> To this I answer. We have already prov'd the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                  </hi> Church (in the sense we understand <hi>Roman</hi>) <hi>Infallible;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she ought not to be <hi>accus'd</hi> for teaching errours. Neither can she submit her self to any <hi>Third</hi> to be judg'd in this point, both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no such competent <hi>Third</hi> to be found, as also because it were in effect to give away her own right, yea indeed to destroy her self, by suffering her Authority to be question'd in that, whereon all Certainty of Faith depends: for such is the Catholique Churches <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Again, I make this demand. Suppose that <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Deacon, or some other Heretique of the Apostles times, separating themselves from the Apostles, and Christians that adhered to them, should have
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57798:93"/>
accus'd them of false doctrine; and being for such presumption ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by the Apostles, would it have been a just plea, think you, for the said condemned Heretiques, to have pretended, that the Apostles were <hi>the party accused,</hi> and that they could not be <hi>Witnesses</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> too in their own cause; but that the trial of their doctrine ought to be resert'd to a Third person? I suppose no man will be so absurd. I say then, Whatever shall be answer'd in defence of the Apostles proceeding, will be found both proper and sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Church against her Adversaries. For if the Apostles might judge those Heretiques in the Controversies abovesaid, then the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons accused</hi> may sometimes, and in some causes, be <hi>Judges</hi> of those that <hi>accuse</hi> them: and if <hi>the Infallibility</hi> of the Apostles judgement, together with the <hi>Fullness</hi> of their Authority, were a sufficient ground and reason for them to exercise the part and office of Judges in their own cause, seeing both these do still remain in the Church, (viz. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> of Judgement, and <hi>Fullness</hi> of Authority) doubtless the lawful Pastours thereof duly assembled and united with their Head, may lawfully, nay of duty ought to judge <hi>the Accusers</hi> of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whoever they be; according to that acknowledged Prophesie concerning Christs Church, (<hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 17.) after our Adversaries own Translation, <hi>Every tongue that ariseth against thee in judgement</hi> (or that accuses thee of errour) <hi>thou shalt condemn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Protestants indeed, having neither competent <hi>Authority,</hi> nor so much as pretending to <hi>Infallibility</hi> in their doctrine, cannot rationally be permitted to be <hi>Accusers</hi> and <hi>Witnesses</hi> against the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (much less <hi>Judges</hi>) in their own cause. Wherefore <hi>A.C.</hi> addes, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Principal and Mother-Church; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it be against common equity, that Subjects and Children should be Accusers, Witnesses, Judges, and Executioners against their Prince and Mother in any case, yet it is not absurd, that in some cases the Prince or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may accuse, witness, judge, and if need be, execute Justice against un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and rebellious Subjects, or evil Children.</hi> To this the Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that for the present he will suppose the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be both <hi>a Prince</hi> and <hi>a Mother,</hi> that he may not seem <hi>to avoid the shock of</hi> A. C.'s <hi>Argument:</hi> but addes withall, <hi>that no moderate Prince ever</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>thought it just, or took upon him, to be Accuser, Witness, and Judge, in any case of moment, against his Subjects.</hi> I answer, that a Prince, being liable many wayes to errours, and mistakes in judgement, ought in equity to submit to some indifferent Judge, in all matters of personal and private interest, between him and his Subjects; though in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of publick concern, as of Treason or the like, where the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is evident, and admits not the delayes of legal Formality, I think it would not be accounted unjust, for the Prince to be Accuser, Witness, and Judge too, againct a Traiterous Subject. However, the Church may lawfully judge her Accusers, because she is <hi>Infallible</hi> in her decisions of Faith, and hath <hi>full Authority</hi> finally and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to determine all controversies of that nature.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Parents</hi> the Bishop grants, that while Children are young, they may chastise them without other <hi>Accusers</hi> or <hi>Witnesses</hi> then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the Children are, not withstanding such correction, to give
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57798:93"/>
them reverence. But (saith he) <hi>when Childen are grown up, and come to some full use of reason,</hi> there ought to be remedy for them against their Mother, <hi>if she forget all good nature, and turn stepdame unto them:</hi> which I willingly grant, and leave such injur'd Children, for remedy, to the Magistrate and the Law; to both which the Children may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully appeal, and the Mother ought to submit, as to her Superiours. But the Catholique Church, duly and compleatly represented in a General Council, hath no superiour on earth; neither is it lawfull for any private Christian or Christians, upon any pretence, to appeal <hi>from</hi> her to any Third Person, in causes of Faith: the case therefore is not alike. Secondly, I deny the Bishops supposition, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (taken in the sense we take it) is or ever can be such <hi>a Stepdame to her Children,</hi> or so far <hi>forget</hi> her duty both to God and them, as justly to deserve <hi>the Accusations</hi> which Protestants (her undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and rebellious sons) bring against her: and therefore towards them (as well as towards the rest of her children) she still retains the rights of a Mother; and they must not take it ill, if (as occasion serves) she exercise towards them some part of her Motherly Authority; but rather bethink themselves of returning to their <hi>Due Obedience,</hi> and conforming themselves to that holy Exhortation of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 1, 2.</note> (for their better content) I shall give them out of their own Bible, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>laying aside all malice, and all guile and hypocrisies, and envies, and evil speakings, as New-born Babes they desire the sincere Milk of the Word,</hi> (that is, the pure uncorrupted Christian Catholique Doctrine) <hi>that they may grow thereby</hi> to salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But even abstracting from the Churches <hi>Infallibility</hi> in matters of Faith, her proceedings towards Protestants will be found, upon due examination, most just. For though a Prince, or Parents, may not <hi>in all cases</hi> be <hi>Accusers, witnesses</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> of their Subjects or Children, because it may possibly be evident, that they tyrannize over them, or treat them injuriously, yet when matter of fact is so evident, that it cannot be deny'd by their respective Children, or Subjects, when laws and custom of the whole Nation do also evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare the things criminal, for which they are punish'd, what need is there (absolutely speaking) of any further Witness, or Judge, to punish them? Now this is our case. The things, for which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church condemns and punishes Protestants, are clearly matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> preaching and teaching such Doctrine as the Church forbids to be taught, actual disobedience to her Canons, separating themselves from the communion of other Catholique Christians, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing and contradicting their lawful Pastours in matters concerning Religion, &amp;c. all which are criminal actions, and clearly punishable, not onely by the Canons of the Church, but by the Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of every Catholique Countrey. No need (surely) of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers and Witnesses, where the Offence is notorious: Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might the Pastours of the Church (who were their proper Judges) proceed to Canonical Sentence against them, seeing (as I said) it was notoriously evident, (and by themselves not deny'd) that they oppos'd and contradicted, not onely the publique doctrine and belief of all Christians generally throughout the world, but also
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57798:94"/>
the Laws, (both Ecclesiastical and Temporal) Statutes, Decrees, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, and Practises, universally in force in all Nations, where they began their pretended Reformations.</p>
               <p>When the Separatists of <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> or King <hi>James</hi> his time, pretended to reform the Protestant <hi>Church-Decrees and Customs</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and call'd for a <hi>Judge</hi> between the Prelates and them, did the then-Church-Governours scruple to condemn and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them, though they neither esteem'd themselves Infallible, nor to act by any Infallible Rule? for their Commission to do this was onely from the King and State; and their Rule, not the <hi>Scripture,</hi> (which the Separatists pretended to as much as themselves) but either the Book of Common Prayer, or the thirty nine Articles, or the Queens Injunctions, and Book of Canons. Do not their Canons excommunicate all that deliberately oppose any of their said thirty nine Articles? Did they not, for this reason, ordinarily summon Anabaptists, Brownists, Familists, and other Separatists, to appear at their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Courts, as they call them? did they not proceed to sentence of Excommunication, and other Censutes, as the case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit'd, and the Laws of their Church enabled them to do? Nay, did they not upon this ground oftentimes Excommunicate us <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> for refusing to frequent their Churches? did they not bring us into Sequestrations, Imprisonments, and a thousand other troubles? Would they hear us, when we appeal'd either to Scripture, Fathers, Church, Councils, or any other third person to be <hi>Judge</hi> between them and us? Behold a very just proceeding! When they fall foul either upon us, or their own Separatists, they are content to be Accusers, Witnesses and Judges; but when they are call'd to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie their actings against the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, then (forsooth) 'tis an <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> thing: then they call for a <hi>Third Person</hi> to judge; not because they are indeed willing to be <hi>judged,</hi> or regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by any authority under heaven, except themselves, but because they know, that a competent Judge between the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and them, distinct from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is impossible to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. C.</hi> therefore had reason to tell the Bishop, that <hi>never any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judge had so censured the Church, as he had done; and that indeed no power on Earth or in Hell it self, could so far prevail against the General Church, as to make it erre generally in any one point of Divine Truth; and much less to teach any thing by its full Authority to be mater of Faith,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. n. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>which is contrary to divine Truth, expressed or involved in Scriptures rightly understood. And that therefore no Reformation of Faith could be needful in the General Church, but onely in particular Churches;</hi> citing to this purpose <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. 32. <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. In answer to which the Bishop onely tells us, how <hi>unwilling</hi> he is, <hi>in this troublesome and quarrelling age,</hi> to meddle <hi>with the erring of the Church in geveral:</hi> he addes, though the Church of <hi>England</hi> professeth, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>hath err'd even in matters of Faith, yet of the erring of the Church in general she is modestly silent.</hi> It matters not what she sayes, or sayes not, in this; but our question is, <hi>what she must say,</hi> if she speak consequently either to her principles or practise. For this is certain, that many of those particular points of Faith, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57798:94"/>
as errours by the English Protestant Church, were held and taught for points of Faith by all the visible Churches in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when this pretended Reformation began. If therefore they be <hi>dangerous errours</hi> (as the Bishop with his English Church professes <note place="margin">Suprà num. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> they are) by good consequence it must follow, that the English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church holds, that the whole Catholique Church <hi>hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red dangerously.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how unwillingly soever his Lordship seems to <hi>meddle with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  of the Church in general,</hi> yet at last he meddles with it, and that very freely too: for in effect he professes she may erre in any point of Faith whatsoever, that is not simply necessary to all mens salvation. Hear his own words in answer to <hi>A. C.'s</hi> assertion that <hi>the General Church could not erre in point of Faith If</hi> (saith the Bishop) <hi>he means no more then this,</hi> viz. <hi>that the whole universal Church of Christ cannot universally erre in any point of Faith, simply necessary to all mens Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he fights against no Adversary, but his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  fiction.</hi> What is this but tacitely to grant, that the whole Church of Christ may universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erre in any point of Faith not simply necessary to all mens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Is not this great <hi>modesty</hi> towards the Church? Nay a great satisfaction to all Christians, who by this opinion must needs be left in a wood, touching the knowledge of Points absolutely necessary to their salvation?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the Bishop suspects <hi>a dangerous</hi> consequence would be grounded upon this, if it should be granted, that <hi>the Church could not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>erre in any point of Divine Truth in general, though by sundry consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deduced from principles of Faith; especially if she presume to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine without her proper Guide, the Scripture,</hi> as he affirms <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to say, <hi>she may.</hi> I answer, When God himself (whose <hi>Wisdom</hi> is such that he cannot be deceiv'd, and <hi>Verasity</hi> such that he cannot deceive) speaks by his <hi>Organ</hi> the Holy Church, that is, by a General Council united with its Head, the Vicar of Christ, what danger is there of Errour?</p>
               <p>As concerning <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who is falsly accus'd, I wonder the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour should not observe a main difference between defining matters, absolutely <hi>without Scripture,</hi> and defining <hi>without express Scripture;</hi> which is all that <note n="a" place="margin">Nostra sententia est Ecclesiam abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutè non posse errare, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms. For though the points defined be not <hi>expresly</hi> in Scriptures, yet they may be there <hi>implicitly,</hi> and rightly deduc'd from Scripture. As for example, no man reads the Doctrine of Christs Divinity (as 'tis declar'd by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and receiv'd for Catholique Faith even by Protestants themselves) <hi>expresly</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: it is not there said in express terms, that he is of <hi>the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with the Father,</hi> or that he is <hi>God of God, Light of Light, and True God of True God,</hi> &amp;c. and yet who doubts, but the sense of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is contain'd in Scripture? and consequently that the Defining of this, and other points of like nature, by the Church, was not done (absolutely speaking) <hi>without Scripture.</hi> Besides, who knows not that the Scriptures do expresly commend <hi>Traditions?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Doctrine defin'd for matter of Faith, be according to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57798:95"/>
                  <hi>Tradition,</hi> though it be not express'd in Scripture, yet the Church does not define it <hi>without</hi> Scripture, but <hi>according</hi> to Scripture, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing therein the Rule, which is given her in Scripture.</p>
               <p>But 'tis further urged by the Bishop that <hi>A. C.</hi> grants <hi>the Church</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>may be ignorant of some Divine Truths, which afterwards it may learn by study of Scripture, or otherwise: Therefore in that state of Ignorance she may both erre, and teach her errour; yea and teach that to be Divine Truth, which is not: nay, perhaps teach that as matter of Divine Truth, which is contrary to Divine Truth.</hi> He addes to this, that we have as <hi>large a promise</hi> for the Churches <hi>knowing all points of Divine Truth, as A. C.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joan. 16. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>or any Jesuit, can produce for her not erring in any.</hi> Thus the Bishop. To which I answer, The Argument, were there any force in it, would conclude as well against the Infallibility of the Apostles, as of the present Catholique Church. For doubtless the Apostles themselves were ignorant of many Divine Truths; though the promise intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Bishop of being <hi>taught all truth, John</hi> 16. 13. was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately directed to them: and yet 'tis granted by Protestants, that the Apostles could not <hi>teach that to be Divine Truth, which was not; much less could they teach that as matter of Divine Truth, which was contrary to it.</hi> Ignorance therefore of some Divine Truths, and for some time onely, when they are not necessary to be known, doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre errour, or possibility of erring in those Truths, when they are necessary to be known. The Apostles (<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 19.) were charged not to be <hi>Sollicitous</hi> beforehand, what they should answer to Kings and Presidents, being brought before them, because it <hi>should be given them in that hour what to speak.</hi> In like manner (with due proportion) is it now given to their Successours what to <hi>answer,</hi> that is, what to define in matters of Faith, when ever emergent occasions require it. Secondly, I say, that an ignorant man is of himself subject to errour; but <hi>taught</hi> and informed by a master that is infallible, he may become infallible. So that his Lordships Argument, from bare ignorance concluding errour, or an absolute possibility of erring, is it self as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, as this: A young Scholar, of himself alone is <hi>ignorant,</hi> and apt to mistake the signification of words; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he can do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then mistake, while his Master stands by him, and teaches him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the Bishop at last bethinks himself, and puts in a <hi>Proviso: Provided alwayes</hi> (saith he) that this erring of the Church <hi>be not in any</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>point simply Fundamentall:</hi> for of such points, even in his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>the whole Church cannot be ignorant, nor erre</hi> in them. To which proposition of his Lordship at present we shall return no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer but this; We desire to know, what those points are, which he calls <hi>simply fundamental,</hi> or simply necessary to all mens salvation. <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> from very good Authority, tells us, that <hi>some barbarous and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de Eccl. Milit. cap. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ignorant people have been saved without believing Scripture at all:</hi> and if trial were made, I believe it would be found the more common opinion even amongst Protestants themselves, that the Explicite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Trinity, or Incarnation it self, as the Catholique Faith, and Oecumenical Councils declare it, is not <hi>simply necessary</hi> to all mens salvation. So that if the Church be exempt from errour onely
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57798:95"/>
in such points, the promises of Christ will be brought to little more then nothing; and the Churches Infallible Authority be shrunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so narrow a compass, that most of the Hereticks she ever yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, will be found to have been out of her reach, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire her, if not to <hi>reverse,</hi> yet at least to <hi>review</hi> her sentence against them, (since his Lordship will have it <hi>Fallible</hi>) lest (perhaps) she might erre in pronouncing it.</p>
               <p>Neither indeed can any rational man be ever satisfied by hearing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in general, that the Church cannot erre in matters <hi>simply necessary</hi> to all mens Salvation, if he be not withall <hi>determinately</hi> inform'd which are those points. For so long as he knows not what is, or is not, so <hi>universally</hi> necessary, how can he be assur'd whether the Church may not erre, or hath not err'd in Defining such and such a particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Let it therefore be first established, either by a determinate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of such <hi>simply necessary and Fundamental</hi> points, or by some <hi>certain</hi> and determinate <hi>Rule,</hi> whereby we may undoubtedly know them; otherwise we speak at random.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The strength of the places, formerly alledg'd by <hi>A. C</hi> for the Churches Infallibility in all points of Faith whatever, his Lordship here again endeavours to enervate; telling us first, that <hi>they are known</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 25. n. 5.</note>

For if the Pope and a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil may erre, the whole Church might erre; as being oblig'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Doctrine, and Definitions of such a Council: and if the whole Church be fallible, what <hi>infallible certainty</hi> can we have of any Tradition? Wherefore seeing the Infallibility of the Church, Councils, and Tradition, depend so necessarily upon each other, whatever Authorities prove the Infallibility of any one, do in effect and by good consequence prove the same of all the rest.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. For the better understanding of which Texts 'tis necessary to know, that every errour contrary to Divine Faith is Heresie, as St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and all Divines, generally teach: Wherefore if the Church should teach any thing contrary to what God has reveal'd, she should teach Heresie; and contradict these Fathers, who all clear the Church from that aspersion, by vertue of this promise of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>The Gates of Hell shall not prevail against her,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, tacitly at least, acknowledge, that if she did teach Heresie at any time, the Gates of Hell, in that case, would be found to have <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd</hi> against her. Seeing therefore, every errour in Faith, or against Divine Revelation, is Heresie, and since the Church, in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these Fathers, grounded upon this promise, cannot teach Heresie, it follows evidently that in the judgement of the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, she cannot <hi>erre</hi> in any point of Faith whatever, by vertue of the same promise.</p>
               <p>How the Infallibility of the Church is gather'd out of the second place hath been shew'd already, and is here confirm'd even by his <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 20. Ibidem.</note> Lordships own discourse out of St. <hi>Leo epist.</hi> 91. which is, <hi>that Christ in that place, promis'd to be present with his Ministers in all those things, which he committed to their execution.</hi> But surely one, and a chief one of those <hi>ALL,</hi> was to teach <hi>Infallibly,</hi> the whole doctrine of Christs Gospel. Wherefore Christ is still present with his Ministers inabling them to perform this so important a work, when 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57798:96"/>
to be executed; that is, when the necessities of the Church require some point in controversie among Christians to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               <p>Nor will that conclusion hence follow, which his Lordship fears <hi>viz.</hi> that all <hi>the Sermons of every Pastour of the Church would be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> for 'tis no wayes necessary that every particular Pastour should be Infallible; but 'tis absolutely necessary, that the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or a General Council should be Infallible, because otherwise, there would no means be left in the Church, sufficient to determine Controversies of Faith, or prevent the spreading of Schismes and Heresies.</p>
               <p>To the end my Reader may the better conceive this, he is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand there are divers degrees of Christs <hi>presence</hi> and <hi>assistance</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Ministers of his Church. All of them cannot chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all priviledges, but must be content with those, that properly belong to their respective state and condition in the sacred Hierarchy. And yet, as all the said degrees are grounded upon this and the like <hi>promises</hi> of our Saviour; so 'tis necessary, they be all <hi>verify'd,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the respective necessities of the Church. The <hi>Supream</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree we affirm to be that of <hi>Infallible Assistance;</hi> and therefore assign it onely to those who have <hi>Supream</hi> Authority in the Church, and in cases onely of most urgent necessity, for preventing of Heresies and Schismes. In all other cases, and in reference to all other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Church, we profess that so long as the <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning</hi> part of them is continually so <hi>assisted</hi> by Christ, that it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally leads not his Flock into errour in Faith, nor neglects to teach them <hi>the observation of all things Christ commanded,</hi> the promise is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently perform'd on Christs part, and St. <hi>Leo's</hi> words, <hi>In omnibus</hi>

               <p>The third place urged by <hi>A. C.</hi> is out of St. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32. where Christs prayer for St. <hi>Peter</hi> is as efficacious as his promise; both of them implying an Infallibility in the Church, against all errours in Faith whatsoever. The words are these: <hi>Simon, Simon, Behold Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath required to have you, to sift as wheat. But I have prayed for Thee, that thy Faith fail not: and thou once converted, confirm thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> 'Tis clear, that Christ here prayed, that Faith in the Church might not fail; either by praying for St. <hi>Peter</hi> as he was a Figure of the whole Church, (which is the exposition of the <hi>Parisians</hi>) or by praying <hi>immediately</hi> for St. <hi>Peters</hi> person, and mediately for the whole Church, which he represented.

                  <hi>Catholique Church cannot erre, keeping her self to the Direction of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as Christ hath appointed her.</hi> But I ask what Priviledge then has the Catholique Church in these promises of Christ, more then every private Christian?

                  <hi>of Scripture,</hi> there is none of the faithful, but may pretend to be as Infallible as the Church. Fourthly, they must be limited (sayes he) to <hi>all</hi> such Truths, as our <hi>Saviour had told them.</hi> But the Apostles were taught divers things, of principal concernment in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Salvation, by the Holy Ghost, even after our Saviours Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: had they no promise of Divine Assistance, in the delivery of those Truths?</p>
               <p>Thus the promises of Christ come to nothing. But if one should ask some of this Bishops Disciples, how their Master proves, that the promises of Christ are to be limited to Truths <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> they must answer <gap reason="foreign">

For where (I pray) hath Christ so limited his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses? where do the Apostles teach us to understand them with such limitation? Neither do we extend them to Truths <hi>wholly unnecessary,</hi> or to <hi>curious Truths,</hi> as the Bishop seems willing to insinuate: No, We tell him, there is a <hi>medium,</hi> a middle sort of Truths between those which are <hi>absolutely necessary for all mens Salvation,</hi> and those which are simply <hi>unnecessary,</hi> or <hi>curious.</hi> We extend these promises to all Truths of this middle sort, that is, to all such Truths, as the Church findes consonant to Catholique Faith and Piety, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be <hi>defin'd</hi> for the preventing of Heresies, Schismes, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions among Christians. But I pray observe our Adversaries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Subtlety in the close of all. Christ (saith he) hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, that the Spirit should <hi>lead</hi> his Church <hi>into all Truth,</hi> but he hath no where promis'd, that the Church should <hi>follow her leader.</hi> What a rare <hi>Acumen</hi> is here! Then belike, to <hi>lead</hi> and to <hi>follow</hi> are not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives in Protestant Logick. But let them take heed; 'tis to be fear'd they will be found Relatives: and that if the Devil chance to <hi>lead</hi> any of them to Hell for their Heresie and other sins, nothing will help, but they must infallibly <hi>follow</hi> him.

               </argument>
               <p>BY the precedent Discourse it appears, that the Bishops main task, for a long time, hath been to prove, that the <hi>General Church</hi> may erre, and stand in need of Reformation <hi>in matters of Faith:</hi> this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">§ 25. n. 7.</note> the thing, which <hi>A. C.</hi> most constantly denyes. But his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship finding the proof of this not so easie, by little and little was fain to slide into another question, concernig the Power <hi>particular Churches</hi> have to reform themselves, thinking by this to Authorize the pretended Reformation of his <hi>particular</hi> English Church. To this purpose were his many Allegations of the Councils of <hi>Carthage, Rome, Gangres, Toledo,</hi> &amp;c. § 24. <hi>num.</hi> 5. which how they succeeded, the Reader may easily have perceiv'd by our Answers in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He goes on with his wonted Art: which is, to alledge his Adversary with not overmuch sincerity. <hi>A. C.</hi> treating the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said question touching the Power <hi>particular</hi> Churches have to reform themselves, and not denying, but in some cases <hi>particular</hi> Churches may reform what is amiss <hi>even in matter of Faith,</hi> for greater caution, addes these express words, (<hi>pag.</hi> 58.) <hi>WHEN THE NEED</hi> (of Reformation) <hi>IS ONELY QUESTIONABLE, particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours and Churches may not condemn others of Errour in Faith.</hi> But these words, <hi>when the need is onely questionable,</hi> the Bishop thinks fit to leave out: to what end, but to have some colour to contradict his Adversary, and abuse his Reader?</p>
               <p>Let us now see whether his Lordships party be far from judging and condemning other Churches, as he seems to make them by his <hi>simile. A man that lives religiously</hi> (sayes he) <hi>doth not by and by sit in judgement, and condemn with his mouth all prophane livers. But yet while he is silent, his very life condemns them.</hi> First of all, Who are these men that <hi>live so religiously? They,</hi> who to propagate the Gospel the better marry Wives, contrary to the Canons, and bring (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) Scripture for it <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Non est bonum esse hominem solum;</hi> and again, <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Numquid non habemus potestatem mulierem sororem circumducendi?</hi> Who are these men (I say) that <hi>live so religiously? They,</hi> who pull down Monasteries both of Religious men and women; <hi>They,</hi> who cast Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars to the ground; <hi>They,</hi> who partly banish Priests, partly put them to death; <hi>They,</hi> who deface the very Tombs of Saints, and will not permit them to rest even after they are dead. These are the <hi>men who live so religiously.</hi> But who are (according to his Lordship) <hi>prophane Livers? They,</hi> who stick close to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successors; <hi>They,</hi> who for the Catholique Faith endure most willingly Sequestrations,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57798:98"/>
Imprisonments, Banishments, Death it self; <hi>They,</hi> in a word, who <hi>suffer Persecution for Righteousness.</hi> These, in his Lordships opinion, are <hi>Prophane Livers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I return now to the Relatours men, <hi>that live so religiously.</hi> Do these men never condemn the Catholique Church, but by their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous lives, which you have seen? Surely they condemn her not onely by quite dissonant lives, but also by word of mouth, by their pens, nay by publick and solemn Censures. Witness (to go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church of <hi>England, Artic.</hi> 19. where she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns of errour not onely the Churches of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but even of <hi>Rome</hi> it self. Again <hi>Rogers</hi> in his allowed <hi>Analyse</hi> and <note place="margin">See <hi>Rogers</hi> on the thirty nine Articles.</note> Comment upon the said Article, pronounces that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not onely <hi>shamefully err'd in matters of Faith,</hi> but that <hi>the</hi> whole <hi>visible Church</hi> may <hi>likewise erre from time to time, and hath err'd in doctrine, as well as conversation.</hi> Do they not say, <hi>Artic.</hi> 21. that General Councils may erre, and have err'd, <hi>even in things pertaining to God?</hi> Do they not pronounce of <hi>Purgatory, Praying to Saints, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images and Reliques &amp;c. Artic.</hi> 22. of <hi>Transubstantiation, Artic.</hi> 28. and of <hi>the Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Mass, Artic.</hi> 31. respectively, that they are <hi>fond things, vainly invented by men, contrary to Gods Word, Blasphemous Fables,</hi> and <hi>dangerous Deceits?</hi> Though it be as clear as the sun at noon-day, that both these and many other points, deny'd and rejected by Protestants, were the doctrine and practise, not onely of the <hi>Roman,</hi> but of the whole Church near upon a thousand years together, even by the confession of Protestants. Is this onely to <hi>reform themselves,</hi> and not <hi>to condemn other Churches:</hi> otherwise then by <hi>silence</hi> and example?

                  <q>The Patriarch (say they) is in the same manner over all those, that are under his Authority, as He, who holds the Sea of <hi>Rome, is Head and Prince of all the Patriarchs.</hi> And in the same Canon the Pope is afterward stiled, <hi>Petro similis &amp; Autoritate par,</hi> (resembling Saint  <hi>Peter,</hi> and, <hi>his equal in Authority.</hi>)</q> This also the practise of the Church shews; which is alwayes the best Expositour and Assertour of the Canons.

answer to his objections more compendious and clear) it will not be amiss, in the first place, to state that business by way of <hi>Narrative,</hi> and matter of Fact onely; which I shall briefly do out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and <hi>Optatus Milevitanus.</hi> Thus then it was.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Donatists</hi> of <hi>Africk</hi> finding themselves sharply oppos'd by <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> and Primate of <hi>Africa,</hi> by way of revenge <note n="d" place="margin">D. Aug. epist. <hi>162.</hi>
                  </note> accuse him of having in time of Persecution deliver'd up the Holy Scriptures, with other Sacred <hi>Utensils</hi> of the Church, into the possession of the Heathens; which was accounted a most capital crime amongst Christians. They added to their accusation, that he was made Bishop by one guilty of the same crime, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Felix</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aptung;</hi> and they prosecuted the business so hotly, that by a Synod of seventy <hi>African</hi> Bishops <hi>Caecilian</hi> was condemn'd, and outed of his Bishoprick. But he, making no great reckoning of the sentence, as being condemn'd absent and unheard, and knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be in Communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the Donatists are forced to prosecute their charge against him in other Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea. But not daring to appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> or at least knowing it would be to little purpose, they address themselves to the Emperour <note n="e" place="margin">Optat. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lev. lib <hi>1.</hi> cont. Parmen.</note> 
                  <hi>Constantin,</hi> and desire him to command their cause to be heard by some Bishops of the <hi>Gaules</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where the Emperour then resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But the Emperour was so far from favouring them <note n="f" place="margin">D. Aug. cont. lit. Petil. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap <hi>92.</hi>
                  </note>, that he shew'd a great dislike of their proceedings, telling them <note n="g" place="margin">Aug. epist. <hi>166.</hi>
                  </note> exprefly, that it belong'd not to him, neither durst he act the part of a Judge in a cause of Bishops. Nevertheless knowing very well the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent disposition of Schismatiques, and perceiving they meant not to acquiesce in the sentence of any Ecclesiastical Tribunal, to which they were immediately subject, he thought good to take a middle way: which was to send them to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to be heard and judged by the Pope, to whom the cause did most properly belong; <note n="h" place="margin">Euseb. Hist. lib. <hi>10.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> but yet to comply a little with the Donatists, he sent along with them some Bishops of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> in whom they more confided, and whom they had already demanded to be their Judges; intending that these French Bishops should hear the Donatists cause together with the Pope, and determine therein what they should finde to be right. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Melchiades</hi> (the Pope) refuse them; but for the greater solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the judgement and satisfaction of the parties, adjoyned to them <note n="i" place="margin">D. Aug. epist. <hi>166.</hi> Optat. Milev. lib. <hi>1.</hi> contr. Parmen.</note> fifteen other Italian Bishops, and so proceeded to the hearing of the Cause. But behold the issue!

               <p>The Schismatiques being thus condemn'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> and even by those Bishops of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> whom they had chosen for Judges, by way of Appeal address themselves again to the Emperour; which the pious Prince took so hainously, that (as <hi>Optatus Milevitanus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) he cry'd out against them to this purpose, <note n="m" place="margin">Optat.

What should the Emperour do? He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready protested against this, as of it self unlawful, but there was no remedy; the Schismatiques will not let him rest until he hear them. Wherefore having first <note n="r" place="margin">D. Aug. epist. <hi>162.</hi>
                  </note> promised to ask the Bishops pardon, he consents to this also; hears them, and <note n="s" place="margin">D. Aug. in Brevic. Collat. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thag. parte <hi>3.</hi> col. <hi>589, 590, 591.</hi>
                  </note> condemns them with his own mouth.</p>
               <p>This is the true and real story of the Donatists proceedings; from whence his Lordship brings several objections against the Popes Supremacy, which we are now to examine. First he would have us observe, <hi>that the Roman Prelate came not in, till the Donatists had leave gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them by the African Prelates, to be heard by forreign Bishops.</hi> But this proves rather the justice and moderation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Prelate, that <hi>he came not in</hi> before it was due time, and the matter orderly brought before him. For though the cause did most properly belong to the <hi>Popes</hi> Cognizance, yet was it first to be heard and decided by the Bishops of the Province, where the cause first sprang up. The Pope was not to meddle with it, otherwise then by <hi>way</hi> of regular Appeal, unless (perchance) he had seen the Provincial Bishops to have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected it, or been unable effectually to determine it. Secondly, he abuses St. <hi>Austin</hi> in making him say, that <hi>the African Bishops gave the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 25. n. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Donatists leave to be heard by forreign Bishops.</hi> Whereas there is no such <hi>leave</hi> mention'd, or insinuated by St. <hi>Austin</hi> in all that Epistle. What he sayes is onely his own private advise, <hi>viz.</hi> that if any of them had convincing proofs of ought that was criminal in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Bishops of <hi>Africa,</hi> for which they fear'd to communicate with them, they should apply themselves to the Transmarine Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and especially to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and there make their complaints: which is not a dispensing with them to do something, which otherwise they might not do, (as the Bishop would have it thought) much less is it a license, or dispensation, given them by the <hi>African</hi> Bishops sitting in Council; but onely a private exhortation, and counsel of <note n="t" place="margin">Si aliqui in vobis sunt, qui certa ipsorum crimina ita noverint ut ea facile valeant convincere, &amp; talibus communicare formidant, PERGANT ad fratres nostros Transmarinarum Ecclesiarum Episcopos, &amp; ibi prius de ipsorum factis &amp; contumaciâ conquerantur, quod ad judicium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> St. <hi>Austin</hi> himself, requiring them to do what according to the Canons was to be done in such a case.</p>
               <p>His second objection is, that if the Pope had <hi>come in without this leave,</hi> to judge the Donatists cause, <hi>it had been an usurpation in him.</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:57798:100"/>
But this is grounded partly upon his own false supposition, that such <hi>leave</hi> was given, and partly upon an affected mistake, or mis-translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words <hi>usurpare</hi> and <hi>usurpavit.</hi> For 'tis evident, in the first part of the sentence St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks not in his own person, but in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Donatists, as making an objection to himself in their behalf. <note n="u" place="margin">An fortè non debuit Romanae Ecclesiae <hi>Melciades</hi> Episcopus cum Collegis Transmarinis il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud sibi <hi>usurpare</hi> judicium, quod ab Afris Scptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginta, ubi primas <hi>Tigisitanus</hi> praesedit, fuerit terminatum? <hi>Quid quod nec ipse usurpavit:</hi> ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatus quippe Imperator Judices misit Episcopos, quicum eo sederent, &amp; de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Whereas, the Bishop by his englishing the words makes St. <hi>Austin</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively say, <hi>peradventure Melchiades ought not</hi> (of right) <hi>to have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged</hi> (<hi>or usurp'd</hi>) <hi>to himself that judgement:</hi> which surely was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious winding in his Labyrinth. For it makes that to be a Negative in St. <hi>Austins</hi> sense, which doubtless in his true meaning was an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative; and by asking, <hi>will you Donatists say he ought not</hi> to do this, he by consequence and in effect said, that he ought <hi>to do it.</hi> For the second part of the Speech, where St. <hi>Austin</hi> answers the objection, 'tis no less clear, that he speaks <hi>per</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by way of condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to his Adversaries manner of speaking, the better to mollifie them, which is oftentimes practis'd in Rhetorick; and not as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, that it could be any real <hi>usurpation</hi> in the Pope, to take cognizance of such a cause without <hi>leave</hi> given. And if our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries think not this true, let them tell us, who, but our Saviour Christ and the Canons of the Universal Church, gave the Pope <hi>leave</hi> to hear and judge the causes of St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and those many other Patriarchs and Bishops of the Church, which most certainly he did both <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> effectually, no man (no not the persons themselves who were interessed and suffer'd by his judgement) complaining, or accusing him of <hi>usurpation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, he alledges, that <hi>other Bishops were made Judges with the Pope, and that by the Emperours power, which the Pope will now least of all endure.</hi> I answer first, the Bishops sent by the Emperour were onely three; an inconsiderable number to sway the sentence: and the Pope to shew his Authority, that he was not to be prescrib'd by any in this cause, added to these three, fifteen other Bishops of <hi>Italy,</hi> to be his Colleagues and Assistants in the business. Secondly I answer, the Emperour in sending those Bishops together with the <hi>Donatists</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> did nothing by way of <hi>Authority,</hi> or <hi>Command,</hi> but of <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as using his <hi>Interest</hi> with the Pope; which he might do without breach of the Canons. What he did afterward, he openly protested to be in it self unlawful, and not belonging to him; he did it therefore onely in condescendence to the <hi>Donatists</hi> importunity, and would have askt the Bishops pardon for it, as <note n="x" place="margin">V.

               <p n="4">4. His Deductions from the Civil Law are no better. For first, suppose that an inferiour Prelate could not appeal from the sentence of his Patriarch; yet when the Patriarchs themselves have differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces one with another, must there not according to the rules of good Government, be some higher ordinary Tribunal, where such causes may be heard and determined? I say <hi>Ordinary.</hi> For it would be a manifest defect, if that which is the extraordinary High Court of Ecclesiastical Justice, <hi>viz.</hi> a General Council, should be of necessity assembled for every particular difference between Patriarchs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what the Law sayes, is rightly understood, and must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated of Inferiour Clerks onely; who were not (of ordinary course) to appeal further then the Patriarch, or the Primate of their Province; for so the <note n="z" place="margin">Concil.

                  <hi>Gregory; Where there is neither Metropolitan nor Patriarch,</hi> even In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Clerks, when they appeal, <hi>must have their recourse to the Sea Apostolique.</hi> Then surely it follows, the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not onely over the <hi>Western</hi> or <hi>Southern</hi> Provinces, (as the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour limits it, <hi>pag.</hi> 168.) but over the whole Church, whither the Jurisdiction of Metropolitans and Patriarchs never extended. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could such Appeals be just, if the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> were not the <hi>Lawful</hi> Superiour and Judge of all the Bishops of Christendome; it being confest, that no Juridical Appeal can be made, but from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to a superiour Judge.</p>
               <p>To those words of St. <hi>Gregory, quae omnium Ecclesiarum Caput est,</hi> wherein he intimates the reason, why Appeals should be brought, from all parts of Christendome, to the Sea Apostolique, his Lordship thinks it best to use this evasion. <hi>I have said enough to that</hi> (saith he) <hi>in divers parts of this discourse.</hi> But <hi>in what parts</hi> hitherto I cannot finde, though I have us'd some diligence in the search. I could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wish he had spoken something to it here, where he had so fair an occasion. I onely say this. If the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea be the <hi>Head of all Churches,</hi> (as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> sayes it is) surely it hath Authority over all Churches.</p>
               <p>His Lordship, as long as he stands upon the <hi>Roman</hi> ground, stands upon thorns, and therefore makes a step, or rather a leap, from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> with whose <hi>Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums</hi> given heretofore by Antiquity, he is much pleas'd. But what those <hi>Antient times of Church Government</hi> were, wherein <hi>Brittain was</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:57798:101"/>
never subject to the Sea of Rome, <hi>we desire should be prov'd, and not meerly said.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I should not have envy'd his Lordships happiness (much less the honour of his Sea) had he and all his <hi>worthy Predecessours</hi> (as he calls them) since St. <hi>Austin,</hi> been enobled with the Eminence of Patriarks: yet I see no reason, why a <hi>velut Patriarcha,</hi> pronounc'd by the Pope by way of <hi>Encomium</hi> onely, upon a particular occasion, should be of force to make <hi>Canterbury</hi> a Patriarchal Sea. <hi>Similies</hi> fall alwayes short of the thing it self. Again it imports little, that there was a <hi>Primate</hi> in <hi>Brittain;</hi> for that onely proves, that inferiour Clerks might not ordinarily appeal from him to <hi>Rome:</hi> but that <hi>Brittain</hi> was not subject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea, or that the Brittish Bishops did not (as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion requir'd) freely and continually <hi>appeal</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> it doth not prove; yea the contrary is manifest by all the monuments of the Brittish Church. What ever is meant by the words <hi>in Barbarico,</hi> cited by his Lordship out of the <hi>Codex Canonum Ecclesiae Universae,</hi> certain it is, that whoever were under the government of the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> were not exempted from the Authority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought the Relatour to suppose it, unless he had first prov'd, that the said Patriarch had been himself legally exempt, or not subject to the Pope: which he neither offers to do, nor can it be done; nay the contrary is evident.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To me truly it seems very strange, his Lordship should be so little acquainted with the Ecclesiastical History of <hi>England,</hi> as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm so confidently, that <hi>in ancient times Brittain was never subject to Rome;</hi> meaning in Ecclesiastical matters.

                  <hi>Venerable Bede</hi> tell us, that in King <hi>Egfrids</hi> time (which was about the Year of our Lord 673.) St. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> being unjustly depriv'd of his Bishoprick, appeal'd to the Sea Apostolique, was heard by Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> in the presence of many other Bishops, and by their unanimous Sentence was pronounced innocent? Was he not restor'd again to his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick by vertue of that sentence? Doth not the same Authour affirm, that being the second time expell'd his Sea, he did the second time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was likewise acquitted, upon a full hearing of his cause, in the presence of his adversaries? Was there not, upon his second return into <hi>England,</hi> a Synod of Bishops call'd in obedience to the Popes order; in which, by the general vote of all the good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop was again restor'd?

               <p n="6">6. In the following pages his Lordship spends not a few lines in <note place="margin">§. 25. n. 11.</note> vain, labouring to prove a <hi>Separation</hi> of the <hi>African</hi> Church from that of <hi>Rome;</hi> chiefly out of two Instruments, found in several Editions of the Councils, which seem to testifie as much. One is an Epistle, or <hi>Supplication</hi> rather, which <hi>Eulalius</hi> Bishop of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  is suppos'd to have written to Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the second, in the name of the <hi>African</hi> Church, desiring a Reconciliation with the <hi>Roman,</hi> and disclaiming the <hi>Separation</hi> made between them for many years before. The other is an Epistle of the same Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the second to <hi>Eulalius</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> wherein he imparts the good news of the <hi>African</hi> Churches Submission, and Reconciliation with the <hi>Roman,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces with him upon the occasion. But I answer, As the Bishop himself stands not to maintain the Credit of these Epistles (which he knows to be generally question'd by Catholiques) nor answer the exceptions, which <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> bring against them; so the <note place="margin">Baron. ad Ann. <hi>419.</hi> n. <hi>92, 93.</hi> Bellar. lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Rom. Pout. cap. <hi>25.</hi> in fin.</note> use he makes of them is to very little purpose.</p>
               <p>To the first part of his <hi>Dilemma,</hi> viz. <hi>If the said Instruments be false, then Pope</hi> Boniface <hi>the second, and his Accomplices at</hi> Rome, <hi>or some for them, are notorious forgers</hi> &amp;c. We deny the consequence; there is no necessity to affirm, that either <hi>Boniface the second, or his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices,</hi> were forgers of these pretended Instruments; but rather the contrary: In regard such a forgery would presently have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd and exclaim'd against; seeing in that Popes time no such man as <hi>Eulalius</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but one <hi>Timotheus,</hi> an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, <note place="margin">Baron. ubi suprà.</note> and great opposer of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Neither could the other <hi>Eulalius</hi> he speaks of, be then a Catholique Bishop of <hi>Carthage;</hi> it being a time when there was not one Catholique Bishop in all <hi>Africk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to his closing words <hi>or some for them,</hi> if he mean they did it by the Popes consent, 'tis answer'd under the word <hi>Accomplices:</hi> but if he intend no more, but that they were forged by some body, 'tis very true; but what will it concern the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea, if some other feign an
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57798:102"/>
Epistle in the Popes name? Were there not <hi>some</hi> that feign'd Epistles, and other writings in the Apostles names? was that the Apostles fault? or did it bring any just prejudice either to the Authority, or Integrity of their writings?</p>
               <p>To the second part, viz. <hi>If these Instruments be true, then the Church of Africk did separate from the Roman, and the Separation continued for above a hundred years.</hi> I answer, Till it be evinced, that these Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are <hi>true,</hi> we cannot suffer by them: but his Lordship is so far from offering at this, that he doth not so much as positively affirm it. He shews us indeed, several Editions of the Councils, wherein these Instruments are inserted. But it is well known, that the Editions of Councils cited by the Bishop, have many other Apocryphal and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authentique</hi> writings inserted in them besides these. The reason of this may be, because the Compilers of those times did not take upon them to be Censurers of what they found upon ancient Record, but onely to be faithful Publishers of the Records. Whence it is, that as they did not except against these Instruments, (no more then against others of like nature) so neither did they expresly approve them; but meerly publish'd what they found upon Record, leaving the further scrutiny to the learned. But as for the Schismatical Separation of the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Church from the <hi>Roman,</hi> argued out of the said Instruments, 'tis inconsistent with the truth of Story, and confuted by many pregnant and undeniable instances, which prove, that the <hi>Africans,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the contest in the sixth Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> touching matter of Appeals, were alwayes in true Catholique Communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, even during the term of this pretended Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Witness, in the first place, St. <hi>Austin</hi> himself, who though he were present, and subscrib'd (as 'tis most probable) to that Epistle of the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which gave all the offence, yet after his death Pope <hi>Celestin</hi> in his Epistle to the Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> using many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of high commendation, professeth <note n="a" place="margin">Celestin.

with him; yea particularly praises them for their respects to the Sea Apostolique; and asserts his own right of receiving Appeals from all parts of Christendom, as necessity requires.

               <p n="7">7. In the next Paragraph, the Bishop by a long discourse founded more upon his own conjectural presumptions, then any thing else, undertakes to shew, how the Popes rose by degrees to that height of Authority, <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 12.</note> which Protestants cannot endure to see; in which discourse having first asper'st St. <hi>Hierome</hi> as being <hi>no great friend to Bishops,</hi> (which is both false and injurious to the reputation of so holy a Doctour) at last he delivers his own assertion, which is, <hi>That the very Fountain of Papall Greatness was the Popes residence in the great Imperial City.</hi> But we have often shew'd a far different <hi>Fountain</hi> thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Christ, making St. <hi>Peter</hi> Head of his Universal Church, in that Text of the Gospel, <hi>Tu es Petrus, &amp; super hanc Petram,</hi> &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Exposition of Fathers; is it reason then, we should take the Relatours bare word for it without proof? Well, but <hi>Precedency</hi> (saith he) <hi>is one thing, and Authority another;</hi> thereby insinuating that under the reign of <hi>Constantin</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had onely <hi>Precedency,</hi> or Priority of place in publique Assemblies before other Prelats, by reason of his residence in the Imperial City, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proper Authority, or Jurisdiction over them. But we have often evidenc'd the contrary.</p>
               <p n="8">8. After a slight glance at the <hi>Levity</hi> of the <hi>Eastern,</hi> and <hi>Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy</hi> of the <hi>Western</hi> Bishops, (wherein the Pope is no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd then all other Prelats of the West) he tells us of the <hi>Obedience</hi> Popes did anciently shew towards the Emperours; <hi>enduring</hi> (saith he) <hi>their Censures and Judgements; and accepting the ratification of their Election</hi> to the Popedom, <hi>at the Emperours hands.</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess all this. They <hi>endured the Emperours Censures,</hi> just in the same manner, as all other oppressed persons are forc'd to <hi>endure</hi> the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their oppressors. But let all his Lordships party shew us one <hi>just judgement,</hi> that an Emperour ever pronounced against the Pope. <hi>They accepted the ratification of their Election at the Emperours hands:</hi> but surely that (except in some few cases; where wicked Emperors ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently tyranniz'd over them, and by force compell'd them to do what they pleas'd, contrary to Law and Custom) was no more then this. The Emperour being duly inform'd, that such or such a person was Canonically chosen Pope, there issued forth of course some <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi> or other <hi>Authentick Act</hi> from the Emperour, whereby he gave notice thereof to the principal Judicatures and Prefect ships of the Empire, requiring them, upon all occasions, to acknowledge the said Elected person for Pope. A thing very proper for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to do, as the state of the Empire then stood, as was also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57798:103"/>
in the Election of most of the chief Prelats and Officers of the Empire. But his Lordship was much mistaken, if under the notion of <hi>ratifying the Popes Election</hi> he thought the Emperours had ever any just power to make whom they pleased Pope: never any good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour pretended to more, then to see that the Election were Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical: which, in a matter so highly concerning the peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, could not with equity be deny'd them. But had any Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours refus'd to ratifie the Election of a Pope Canonically chosen, no man but a stranger in Ecclesiastical History, can doubt, but all good Christians would in such case, have adher'd to the said Pope, and not to him the Emperour should have obtruded upon them. We also grant, that so long as the Pope remain'd a Subject of the Empire, this custome continued: but being afterward declar'd free from that subjection, the reason ceased, and the custome with it. See <hi>Gratian. Decret. Can.</hi> Ego Ludovicus. <hi>Dist.</hi> 63. &amp; <hi>Can.</hi> Constitutio, <hi>Dist. eâdem</hi> where the Emperours themselves renounce it.</p>
               <p>After this, to prove that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> were grown so ambitious, that they could hardly contain themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ordinary bounds of their own Jurisdictions, the Relatour cites us three Greek words out of <hi>Socrates,</hi>

                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:57798:104"/>
This is evidenc'd out of the fourth and seventh Canons of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Sardica,</hi> accounted anciently an <hi>Appendix</hi> of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and often cited as the same with it. I deny not but some anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authors may speak against too frequent appealing to <hi>Rome,</hi> and declining ordinary Jurisdiction, especially where the crimes were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, and all just proceedings towards delinquent parties observ'd: as who doubts, but in Civil causes there may be just ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against the like appeals, especially, if the Courts, to which the Cause is remov'd by Appeal, be very remote? but withall, who sees not that such accidental complaints do rather confirm, then weaken, the confess'd Authority and Right of such Superiour Courts, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and determine Causes of Appeal?</p>
               <p>To prevent, as much as might be, all occasion of Complaints in this kinde, the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> provided this expedient, that no Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticks under the degree of Bishops should usually be allow'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to <hi>Rome:</hi> which may easily serve to reconcile all seeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in Authours touching this matter. And it must be observ'd, that though the Canons prohibit Priests, and inferiour Clergy-men to appeal out of their own Province, yet they forbid not the Pope to call what causes of theirs he sees necessary, before him: although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the business of <hi>Apiarius</hi> the Pope, properly speaking, did neither call him out of his own Province to be heard by himself, nor yet admitted his appeal, but remanded him back to his proper Judges, with command they should hear his cause once again, and do him right, in case it were found, that any injustice had been used towards him in the former Sentence. However Bishops were never prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the liberty of appealing to <hi>Rome,</hi> by any Ecclesiastical Canon whatever. 'Tis true indeed, the <hi>Africans,</hi> in their Epistle above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, thought good, by way of Argument and Deduction, to extend the Canon prohibiting Appeals, even unto Bishops causes: but the general custome of the Church was ever against them, as is manifest by what hath been said.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Fathers in the sixth Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> petition'd (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess) the Pope not easily to give ear to those, who appeal'd to <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Africk,</hi> especially where the crimes were manifest. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept also against <hi>the manner</hi> of proceeding in the case of <hi>Apiarius,</hi> and some others: in which the Popes Legats, sent into <hi>Africk,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not themselves as <hi>Judges,</hi> but rather as <hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Advocates</hi> of the appealers. Wherefore the Prelates at that Council request his Holiness, he would rather please to give power to some in <hi>Africk</hi> to end such causes, then send from <hi>Rome</hi> such as should give encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Delinquents, <hi>ne fumosum Typhum Saeculi in Ecclesiam Christi videretur inducere; Lest otherwise</hi> (say they) his Holiness <hi>should seem to introduce the swelling pride, or haughtiness, of the world into the Church of Christ,</hi> which ought to be the School and Mistress of Humility.</p>
               <p>We confess also, that in the times of Pope <hi>Zosimus, Boniface</hi> the first, and Pope <hi>Celestin,</hi> there was much searching into the Records of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council, to finde the matter of Appeals therein decided. The occasion was this, Pope <hi>Zosimus</hi> to shew his proceedings in that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to be not onely <hi>just,</hi> but <hi>Canonical,</hi> had, by a little mistake (the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57798:104"/>
errour, probably, being rather his <hi>Secretaries,</hi> then his own) cited the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> for his Right touching Appeals; whereas it should have been the Council of <hi>Sardica;</hi> in the Canons whereof that Power is clearly allow'd the Pope. Now this Council of <hi>Sardica,</hi> being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>Appendix</hi> of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> then otherwise, and called presently after it; consisting likewise for the most part of the same Prelates, and assembled for no other end, but to confirm the Faith of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council, and supply some Canons necessary for the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church, what matters it, that such a mis-citation, of one Council for another, happened? or how does it prejudice the <hi>Popes</hi> right? Did the <hi>African</hi> Fathers, or any other Catholique Authour of succeeding ages, ever charge the Pope with falsifying the Canons, upon this account, as Protestants now do? let them shew this, if they can.</p>

                  <hi>ancient custom</hi> to style the Bishop of <hi>Rome, Oecumenical,</hi> or <hi>Universal, POPE:</hi> nevertheless it cannot be shown they ever made use of this honourable Title; but rather contented themselves with that of <hi>Servus Servorum Dei,</hi> as relishing more of Humility and Apostolical meekness.

I adde, that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> himself, even whilst he inveigh'd most sharply against the title of <hi>Universal</hi> Bishop, expresly <note n="m" place="margin">D. Greg. lib. <hi>7.</hi> epist. <hi>63.</hi>
                  </note> avoucheth, that both the Emperour and Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> professed conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Constantinople <hi>was subject to the Sea Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi> And whereas some carp at this Epistle of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> because it names the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople Eusebius,</hi> there being (as they say) no Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> of that name in St. <hi>Gregories</hi> time; it is answer'd, that <note n="n" place="margin">Amular. de Divin.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Amularius Fortunatus,</hi> an approved Authour, that wrote but two hundred years after St. <hi>Gregories</hi> time, cites the whole Epistle as Authentique, without the name <hi>Eusebius:</hi> So that (the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Sea of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> being a thing so confessed in all antiquity) this will seem but a weak objection. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may be observ'd, that although the Patriarchs of <hi>Constantinople</hi> challeng'd the title of <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> or <hi>Universal,</hi> yet when either the Pope, or his Legats were with them, at <hi>Constantinople</hi> or any other City, they usually forebore it, and remitted it wholly to the Pope. This appears by the Subscriptions in the third General Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> under <hi>Constantinus Pogonatus,</hi> in the next age after St. <hi>Gregory:</hi> where Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> is styled <hi>Universal;</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> subscribes himself only, <hi>George, by the mercy of God Bishop of Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus we see in brief, how matters have passed <hi>de facto</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the title of <hi>Universal</hi> Bishop. Now to answer the Relatours Objection we are to take notice, that the term <hi>Universal Bishop</hi> is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of two senses; the one Grammatical, the other Metaphorical. In the Grammatical sense it signifies <hi>Bishop of the Universal Church, and of all Churches in particular,</hi> even to the exclusion of all others from being properly <hi>Bishops;</hi> and consequently displaceable at his pleasure, as being onely <hi>his,</hi> not <hi>Christs</hi> Officers, and receiving Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from <hi>him,</hi> and not from Christ. In the <hi>Metaphorical</hi> sense it signifies onely so high and eminent a Dignity above all other Bishops throughout the whole Church, that though he, who is stiled <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Bishop,</hi> hath a real and true Superintendency, Jurisdiction, and Authority over all other Bishops, yet that they be as truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Bishops in their respective Provinces and Diocesses, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. For who doubts, but a meer Diocesan Bishop is as truly a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and chief Officer of Christ in his Diocess, as an Archbishop, Metropolitan, Primate, or Patriarch, in their several Districts; though it cannot be deny'd, but every one of these have respectively true Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Authority over him? The like is visible in the Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of different Tribunals in the Commonwealth: where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Judge is as truly an Officer of the State, and a Magistrate, as the Superiour; and yet the Inferiour is subject to the Superiour, and must be content, in case of Appeals, to have both the <hi>Causes</hi> of his Court, and himself too, judged by the Superiour, when Justice shall require it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This being clear'd, 'tis evident, that St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs against the title of <hi>Universal Bishop,</hi> takes it in the Literal and Grammatical sense; in which we confess it contains a capital Errour and grand Heresie, destructive of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57798:106"/>
Christs Institution; and therefore not undeservedly censur'd by the Holy Zeal of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> as <hi>Monstrous, Blasphemous,</hi> and in some sort <hi>Antichristian.</hi> I say, 'tis evident out of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> himself, even in those Epistles cited by the Bishop, that he takes the word in the literal and worst sense, when he declaims so vehemently against it. For he sayes expresly, <hi>If there be one who is UNIVERSAL Bishop</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">D. Greg. lib <hi>4.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>all the rest are no more Bishops.</hi> So that in St. <hi>Gregories</hi> meaning, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever assumes to himself the title of <hi>Universal,</hi> doth not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as all the <hi>Stewards</hi> of Christs Family ought to do, <hi>viz. in being a Servant over his Fellow Servants,</hi> but pretends in effect to be himself their <hi>Master,</hi> and to make them all his own Servants, receiving and holding their respective Charges, not from their true Master, <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> but from him.</p>
               <p>But some perhaps will object. The Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> did not actually aspire to such a height of pride; nay 'tis scarce credible he either did, or could pretend to make himself the onely Bishop in Christendome, degrading as it were all others from the degree of Bishops. I answer, admit he did not pretend to this; yet seeing he did so unwarrantably usurp a Title, which in the best sense could not possibly belong to him, but being construed in the other, to which it is very liable, it must needs contain so poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and prodigious an Arrogance, that (what ever his actual preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions might be) St. <hi>Gregory</hi> had just reason both to suspect and smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuke him as aiming thereat. Just as if a Subject of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (for instance) should contrary to the Kings consent, take upon him the Title of Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> or <hi>Sicily,</hi> though perhaps he really intended no more, yet doubtlesse he would be soon suspected, nay charged with a trayterous designe of making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self absolute King. But as for the Metaphorical signification of the word, which allows all other inferious Bishops to be true Bishops, and to have true Episcopal Jurisdiction, as Officers ordained by Christ, though subordinate to the Popes Supream Authority, St. <hi>Gregory</hi> was so far from thinking it <hi>Blasphemous,</hi> or <hi>Antichristian pride,</hi> that though indeed he did not claim the <hi>Title</hi> even in <hi>this</hi> sense, yet was it the constant practise both of his Predecessors and himself to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the substance of it, that is, <hi>Universal Jurisdiction</hi> and Authority over all other Bishops and Patriarchs throughout the whole Church, when necessity required: and particularly over the Bishops of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> who were then risen to the Highest Patriarchall Dignity in the Church next the Pope. In those very Epistles, where Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> so much inveighs against the Title of <hi>Universal Bishop,</hi> and him that arrogantly assum'd it, 'tis manifest, that Pope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> , St. <hi>Gregories</hi> Predecessour, annull'd the Decree of the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> wherein this Title had been given to the Bishop of that City. And did not St <hi>Gregory</hi> himself repeal it again, and threaten to excommunicate <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in case he desisted not from the usurpation of it? <hi>Ecclesiam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

is, that even in the Epistle here cited by the Bishop, he teaches, that <hi>the Care and Principality over the whole Church was committed to St. Peter,</hi> (which is all that the Metaphoricall sense of <hi>Oecumenicus</hi> or <hi>Universal</hi> contains) and yet denies he was ever call'd <hi>Universal Apostle.</hi> He grants likewise, that the High Priest was supream Ecclesiasticall Governour of the whole Jewish Church, yet was not call'd <hi>Universal Priest:</hi> all which evidently shews, that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> quarrels not the word in that signification: Why? because he acknowledges the lawfulness of the thing signified by it.</p>
               <p>This premised, it will not be hard to answer all the Bishop objects against us in this particular. To his first objection we grant, that <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 12.</note> according to the <hi>Literal</hi> sense of the word, (in which St. <hi>Gregory</hi> took it) the assuming such a Title argued so great a pride in the Assumer, as might portend the nearness of <hi>Antichrists</hi> time. To his second, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the word <hi>Universal</hi> in the sense disclaimed by St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and the word <hi>Monarch</hi> in its rigorous propriety, whereby it answers to the <hi>literal</hi> sense of <hi>Oecumenicus,</hi> or <hi>universalis Episcopus,</hi> I deny that there was ever any <hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi> or <hi>Monarch,</hi> over the whole Militaut Church, either for the first 600. years before St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> or at any time since. For to be a <hi>Monarch</hi> over the Church in propriety of speech, or such an <hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi> is in effect to un-bishop all other Prelates of the Church, and make them onely Officers <hi>ad placitum,</hi> and Delegates of the said <hi>Vniversal</hi> Bishop, or <hi>Monarch,</hi> placeable and displaceable at his sole pleasure, like the Officers of Temporall Monarchs.</p>
               <p>To what he alledges out of <hi>Baronius,</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Title of <hi>Vniversal</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in a Councill about the year 1076. I answer, it signifies no more then this, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the said Title (still understood in the Metaphorical and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sense) was due to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to no other: which is undeniably true. Neither are we to think, that those seven and twenty <hi>Dictatus Papae,</hi> (as they are call'd) recounted by <hi>Baronius,</hi> and objected here by the Bishop, are all matters of Faith, but (as it were) a Catalogue, or Abridgement of such <hi>Priviledges,</hi> as partly by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution, partly by long Custom and Prescription, partly by Canon, and partly by probable consequences drawn from Principles of Faith, were found agreeable to the Supream Authority of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Bishop.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What he sayes of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour's <hi>conferring</hi> the Title of <hi>Universal</hi> Bishop upon <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third, thereby intimating, that it was never given to Popes before, is most false. For all that <hi>Phocas</hi> did was but to declare, that the Title in contest did of right belong to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> onely: which is a sufficient evidence, that before the said Declaration it had been given to the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Neither was there of this any question; all the Dispute was, whether it might not be also extended to the Bishop of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> and this indeed was declar'd in the Negative by <hi>Phocas.</hi> Now who seeth not, that 'tis a far different thing to <hi>declare</hi> a Title, or Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be of <hi>right</hi> due, and another to <hi>conferre</hi> it <hi>de Novo</hi> upon any one. If his late Majesty of glorious memory had been pleas'd
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57798:107"/>
(when time was) to have declar'd <hi>W. L. Patriarch of England,</hi> we may well suppose, his Lordship would not have granted the Title had been <hi>de Novo conferr'd</hi> on him; seeing he has already contended, that long before, <hi>viz</hi> in <hi>Vrban</hi> the second's time, it was given to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But put case <hi>Phocas</hi> had indeed conferr'd the Title of <hi>Vniversal</hi> Bishop upon Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> as a <hi>new Dignity,</hi> not formerly belonging to him, yet would it make but little to his Lordships purpose. For we say again, 'tis not all one to have a Title <hi>conferr'd</hi> by another, and to <hi>assume,</hi> or <hi>use</hi> it ones self. The Bishop should have prov'd, that Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> us'd the Title of <hi>Vniversal</hi> Bishop, in his ordinary style, as the Bishops of <hi>Constantinople</hi> are prov'd to have done of late times, and as anciently the said <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Cyriacus</hi> his Successour, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to do: which was the thing St. <hi>Gregory</hi> inveigh'd against. The Bishop therefore makes here a fallacious <hi>Turn,</hi> when he shifts the question from <hi>taking</hi> to <hi>giving,</hi> and passeth from <hi>ones self</hi> to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other person.</hi> Let it be shewen that <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third, or any other Popes his Successourss, assum'd this Title, as the Bishops of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> did: for till this be prov'd, it will not follow, that either <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> erred in reproving, and condemning the Bishop of <hi>Constantinoples</hi> undue assuming that Title to himself, or that Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> and his Successours did erre, by having it <hi>declar'd</hi> due to them by another. Why may not the same person be very unwilling to take an extravagant Title upon himself, and yet for good reasons be well content that another give it him? Who knows not, that anciently the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was styled <hi>Caput Ecclesiae, Custos Vineae,</hi> and <hi>Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Christi,</hi> they being Titles due to his place and Office; and though the Popes gainsay'd them not, yet Christian Humility ever taught them to forbear the use of such titles themselves.</p>
               <p>The Relatour here professes to give an Historical account, how the <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>Popes grew under the Emperours,</hi> and by degrees attained the heighth they are now at. To which I answer. We deny not, but that in <hi>Temporal</hi> Power and Authority the Popes <hi>grew great</hi> by the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of Christian Emperours. But what is this to the purpose? If he would have said any thing material, he should have prov'd that the Popes rose by the Emperours means to their <hi>Spiritual Authority and Jurisdiction</hi> over all other Bishops throughout the whole Catholique Church: which is the onely thing they claim <hi>jure divino;</hi> and which is so annexed to the Dignity of their Office by Christs Institution, without the least dependance of any Emperours or Secular Powers, that were the Pope depriv'd of all his <hi>Temporalties,</hi> (which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be done by any Secular Power, without committing a most enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Sacriledge) and reduc'd to the poverty of St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself, the first of them; yet could not his <hi>Spiritual Authority</hi> suffer the least Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution by it.

For otherwise it had been very absurd in St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to perswade Pope <hi>Victor</hi> not to cut off from the Church so many Christian Provinces, had he believ'd (as Protestants contend he did) that the Pope had no power at all to cut them off.

               <p>But admit St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had indeed <hi>reprov'd</hi> Pope <hi>Victor</hi> for what he did in the case of the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops, it being a matter of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Jurisdiction onely, in the exercise whereof 'tis not deny'd, but the Pope, through misinformation incident to humane frailty, may sometimes go too far, what does it prove more then that (possibly) the Pope proceeded a little too severely, or hastily with those Christians, whose fault did not, in the judgement of St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and some others, deserve so heavy a censure? But who sees not, that all this rather confirms the Popes power? Doth St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> or any other beside him, complain of the Popes <hi>usurpation</hi> in this case? Do they charge him with taking more upon him, then he had authority to do? Do they tell him, he had no authority to excommunicate those <hi>Asian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or use any Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over them, as Protestants tell him in reference to themselves? And yet who can doubt but this they would have told him, and with great bitterness too, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the provocation, had they had just ground to do so, or could have done it without proclaiming themselves <hi>ipso facto</hi> Schismatiques, and shaking the very Foundation of the Churches Discipline and Unity?</p>

               <p>This Argument did <hi>Irenaeas</hi> use in confutation of the Hevetiques he disputed against in <hi>France;</hi> which, taking his words in the True and Genuine sense, was a very pregnant one, and given as a Rule to teach, not onely Heretiques, but all Christians, that the Doctrine or Tradition, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was, as it were, the Touch-stone of all Apostolical Doctrine; If now we turn the Medal, and look upon this Holy Doctors argument in the sense the Bishop takes his words, we shall finde it speak little more then non-sense. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to avoid the Prerogative ascrib'd by St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, will needs, (as I have said) make <hi>undique</hi> to signifie no more then <hi>round about;</hi> thereby restraining that <hi>more powerful Principality</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaks of, to the Provinces of <hi>Italy</hi> and Islands about it, as the Patriarchate of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which the power of that Church extended not.

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> 
                  </hi> will be found to argue thus against the Heretiques of his time.</p>
               <p>'Tis necessary that all the Churches, or the Faithful round about <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> those onely of <hi>Italy</hi> and the Islands adjacent, which make up the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate, should have <hi>recourse</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome, propter potentiorem Principalitatem,</hi> that is, for its Bishops <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence of place,</hi> or in regard of his Patriarchal Power within the aforesaid Precincts.</p>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> and other Heretiques in <hi>France</hi> or any other part of the world, are convinced of Heresie for not having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Is not this fine <hi>Meandrick</hi> Logick, well beseeming so noble a Labyrinth?</p>
               <p>But let us observe, how the Relatour deals with the latter part of this Fathers Text, <hi>In quâ semper ab his qui sunt undique, conservata est ea, quae est ab Apostolis Traditio;</hi> which he thus translates: <hi>In which</hi> (Church) <hi>is conserved that Tradition, which was deliver'd by the Apostles;</hi> and not according to his Authour, who sayes <hi>alwayes conserved.</hi> The word <hi>alwayes</hi> was not to appear in English, for fear it might induce some impartial Readers to entertain too worthy an opinion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Neither did he think it fit to give his Reader the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish of these words, <hi>ab his qui sunt undique,</hi> though inserted among
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57798:108"/>
the former, which would too much have opened the Fathers mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> that not onely the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as 'tis a particular Church) kept intirely the Apostolical Tradition, but that <hi>in it</hi> all the Faithful <hi>every where</hi> did keep the same Apostolical Tradition, by being in unity and Communion with her. Thus you may see to what shifts, and upon what shelves even learned men are often driven by maintaining errour.</p>
               <p>From the Premises I argue thus.</p>
               <p>All the Faithful every where must of necessity have recourse to the Church of <hi>Rome propter potentiorem Principalitatem,</hi> by reason of her more powerful Principality. This is St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Proposition.</p>
               <p>But there could be no necessity they <hi>all</hi> should have recourse to that Church by reason of her more powerful Principality, if her said power exended not to them all. This is evident to reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> this more powerful Principality of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, must needs extend to all the Faithful <hi>every where,</hi> and not onely to those of the <hi>Suburbicary</hi> Churches, or Patriarchal Diocess of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Bishop pleads.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Little therefore is it to his advantage, what he pretends to shew out of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> viz that the extent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate was contain'd within the Islands and Precincts of <hi>Italy:</hi> since it is inconsistent with the Vote of all Antiquity, and gives St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> the lye. Nay it makes her Jurisdiction incomparably less, then any of the other Patriarchal Churches; yea, of much less extent, then many Metropolitan Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. To which I add, 'tis contrary even to the common compute of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants themselves, who often grant the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to have been Patriarch of the West; which undeniably contains many vaste Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and Nations, beside <hi>Italy</hi> and the Islands about it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Bishop could not altogether deny, but the word <hi>Suburbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary</hi> was unduly added by <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in the Translation of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon, so I say 'tis necessary to understand it (unless we will contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict all the world) not in the Bishops sense, as signifying onely the Churches of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Islands thereto belonging, but as general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifying all Churches and Cities, any way suburdinate to the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> which was at that time known, (as also to this day) by the name of <hi>Urbs,</hi> or <hi>City,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by way of excellency; not as it related to the Prefect, or Governour of <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard of whose ordinary Jurisdiction, we confess, it commanded onely those few places about it in <hi>Italy;</hi> but as it related to the Emperour himself: in which sense the word <hi>Suburbicary</hi> rightly signifies all Cities, or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches whatsoever within the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; as the word <hi>Romania</hi> also anciently signified the whole Imperial Territory, as Card. <hi>Perron</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>This exposition of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his term <hi>Suburbicary</hi> wants not ground even in his own Text, who makes, as it were, a contradistinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the <hi>Suburbicary Churches.</hi> Now under <hi>Egypt</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends <hi>Lybia, Pentapolis</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> which being without the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of the Empire, were committed to the power and care of the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> but all <hi>Suburbicary</hi> Cities, that is, such as were under the City of <hi>Rome</hi> as it was Imperial, were left under the

Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he (by reason of his Seat at <hi>Rome</hi>) was still to be their chief Prelat, and to have a more immediate and ordinary care over them, then he had over those other Cities, which were out of the Empire: though as St. <hi>Peters Successour</hi> he had the universal care of the whole Church, and that full <hi>Potentiorem Principalitatem,</hi> which St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ascribes unto him.</p>

Nevertheless we deny that he hath any ground to limit to St. <hi>Peter</hi> onely those <hi>Elogiums</hi> given him by St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and not allow them extendible to his Successours, so far as they are necessary for their upholding the Church also in the profession of true Faith. Wherefore as St. <hi>Peters Authority is</hi> (by the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57798:109"/>
Bishops own confession) <hi>rightly urg'd</hi> by <hi>Epiphanius to prove the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Holy Ghost</hi> against the Hereticks that deny'd it, so doubtless by vertue of the same promise and institution of Christ, may and ought the Authority of his Successors be urg'd in time to come, in proof of any other contested Article, or point of Faith. Though therefore we affirm not (as the Relatour is frequently imposing upon us) that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successours are (by vertue of this Text) <hi>to governe the Church as Princes and Monarchs,</hi> yet we say, that by vertue thereof they so govern the Church, as we may securely <hi>relie on them in matters of Faith,</hi> at least in such as they <hi>definitively</hi> teach and promulgate to the whole Church.</p>
               <p>But in the close the Bishop undertakes a strange task. He will prove that <hi>Epiphanius, in most express terms, and that twice repeated,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> makes not St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but St. <hi>James Successour to our Lord in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of his Church.</hi> But he every way mistakes. For first in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he alledges, there's not a word of <hi>the Churches Principality.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he meerly equivocates in the words <hi>ante caeteros omnes,</hi> which signifie onely <hi>priority of time,</hi> because St. <hi>James</hi> was the first of the Apostles, that was ordain'd Bishop of any particular place; <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> (as both <note n="b" place="margin">Euseb.

               <p n="10">10. However the Relatour is so kinde to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as to allow him a <hi>Primacy of Order:</hi> but that is not so much as the Fathers allow him.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> alwayes signifies Preheminence in Authority? and <hi>Primatus</hi> more especially Preheminence, or Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in Ecclesiastical Government? Is the <hi>Primate</hi> of any Christian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more then one that hath Precedence in place? Doth that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle signifie no more in <hi>England,</hi> then that the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> ought to have the chief place in the Convocation-House? Have not all Catholique Authours (yea and many Protestants too) ever thought they signified the Supreme Authority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> both sufficiently and properly by the word <hi>Primatus?</hi> Are there not many Volumes extant on both sides <hi>De Primatu Romani Pontificis?</hi> Were their Authors ever tax'd for speaking ambiguously in using that terme? wherefore if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had <hi>Primacy,</hi> he had also <hi>Supremacy;</hi> and if his <hi>Primacy</hi> were <hi>Universal</hi> over all, his <hi>Supremacy</hi> was so too: Since they both signifie the same thing; <hi>viz.</hi> an eminency of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power in <hi>one</hi> above the rest.</p>
               <p>Again, St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> speaking of this very subject, saith <note n="a" place="margin">D. Hieron. lib. <hi>10.</hi> cont. Jovinian.</note> 
                  <hi>Primatus Petro datur, ut Capite constituto' Schismatis tollatur occasio.</hi> Can any man in his wits think, that by <hi>Primatus</hi> he mean't onely <hi>Precedency</hi> of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? was that sufficient to prevent Schisme? If therefore a True and Proper <hi>Primacy</hi> be granted by <hi>Protestants</hi> to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successour also, before and above all other Bishops and Patriarchs of the whole Church, (as divers of them grant the Fathers did) it must be also gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>Supremacy of Power</hi> over all Bishops and Patriarchs of the Church is due unto him. Now that <hi>Primacy,</hi> or <hi>Supremacy,</hi> of right belongs to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successour, no less then to himself, I evince by this following Argument.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> was necessary in the Apostles time, for the due Government of the Church in order to prevention of Schismes and procurement of Unity, must <hi>à fortiori</hi> be necessary in all succeeding ages.</p>
               <p>But the Power and Jurisdiction of <hi>One</hi> (viz. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour) over all Christians whatsoever (not excepting even the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves) was necessary in the Apostles time for the due Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, in order to prevention of Schisms and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of Unity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the Power and Jurisdiction of <hi>One</hi> (viz. St. <hi>Peter</hi> or his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour)
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57798:110"/>
is <hi>à fortiori</hi> necessary in all succeeding Ages.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major,</hi> viz. that whatsoever Power and Jurisdiction was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in the Apostles time for the due Government of the Church, &amp;c. must needs be necessary in all succeeding Ages, is clear from meer Inspection into those succeeding Ages to this present: where it is visible, by what degrees the great zeal of the Primitive Christians has decay'd and cooled even to this day, to the production of infinite Schismes and Heresies: which must needs, ere this, have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd and utterly confounded the Church, had not our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (that Divine Law-giver) laid that original Platform of Church-Government, which was to serve us as a pattern to the end of the world: our Saviour Christ not so much regarding the need of it during the Apostles lives, as the necessity his all-seeing wisdom fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw would be of it in all future Ages.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is prov'd effectively by the precedent Discourse, where St. <hi>Peters Primacy</hi> (that is, as we there shew, his <hi>Supremacy</hi> over all) is confest by his Lordship and other Protestants.</p>
               <p>The Conclusion therefore is undenyable; <hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis necessary for the Due Government of the Church, that <hi>one</hi> should be endow'd with Power and Jurisdiction over all Christians in all succeeding ages.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto, that so long as the <hi>End</hi> is but in <hi>Acquisition,</hi> and not compleatly gained, the <hi>Necessary Means</hi> to obtain it is alwayes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. But the <hi>End,</hi> in our present case, <hi>viz.</hi> the Due Government of the Church, the preserving it in the Unity of True Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith and Christian Charity, is, and ever hath been since the Apostles time, but in <hi>Acquisition,</hi> and shall not be compleatly gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the end of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Necessary Means,</hi> viz. the Supreme Authority of <hi>One</hi> over <hi>All</hi> in the Government of the Church, is, hath been, and ever will be necessary to the Worlds End.</p>

                  </note> Card. <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of seven Popes, (most of them very Ancient) proves, that our Saviour by that Prayer obtain'd, both for St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, this priviledge, namely, that they should never teach the Church any thing contrary to True Faith. What sayes the Bishop to this? As for St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself he tells us, <hi>it will be easily granted,</hi> that such a priviledge was obtain'd for him: but that it should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, or intended for his Successours also, that never came within the compass of <hi>ROGAVI PROTE, Petre.</hi> Yea, <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> proof (according to the Relatour) <hi>is its own Confutation.</hi> And why? because (forsooth) all his proofs are <hi>from witnesses in their own Cause,</hi> and <hi>from Interessed persons.</hi> I answer first, that <hi>all</hi> his proofs are not from Popes; fot he gives several pregnant reasons for his Assertion, drawn from the Text it self, had the Bishop been pleas'd to answer them. Secondly I ask, <hi>How interressed?</hi> so far as to assert a manifest untruth, in a matter of so great importance, to the whole Church? Surely no. Can our Adversaries have the Confidence (Temerity rather) to affirm, that <hi>Felix</hi> the first (a most Holy Martyr, about the year 273.) that <hi>Lucius</hi> the first (another most Holy Martyr, as some think, or as others say, a Confessour, about the year 337.) and <hi>Leo</hi> the first, (a most Holy Pope, as all Antiquity acknowledg'd, about the year 440.) would dare pervert and mis-alledge Scripture, onely <hi>for Interest,</hi> and to advance their own Authority, had they not known it to be the <hi>just Authority</hi> of their Sea, and rightly grounded on this Text?</p>
               <p>Truly I could never yet understand this proceeding of Protestants, who make so many publick professions to stand to the Fathers Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, of the first Five or Six hundred years; yet when such Fathers are alledged, fly presently back, and reject their Authority upon such weak pretenses as these. And though Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> were something after those ages, <hi>viz.</hi> about the year 678. yet I see not how they can refuse his Testimony in this matter, unless they be resolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn not onely him, but all the Fathers in the sixth General Council, (where the Epistle of this Pope was read and approv'd) who could much better judge, whether his words were written out of <hi>proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> then the Relatour, or any of his party. The other Three, 'tis confest, are of somewhat a later standing; yet the latest of them flourisht above four hundred years since: and we desire to know, what Authour of good repute ever taxed any of them as by assed with <hi>proper interest,</hi> when they publish't, that St <hi>Peter</hi> does in his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours still <hi>teach</hi> the Church, and <hi>confirm his Brethren</hi> in the True Faith, by vertue of this prayer of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>His assertion, that <hi>Bellarmin upon the matter confesses, there is not one</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:57798:111"/>
                  <hi>Father in the Church,</hi> before <hi>Theophylacts</hi> time, that <hi>understands this Text as</hi> Bellarmin <hi>doth,</hi> is wholly groundless. Must he needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, there are no more Authours citable in any subject, but what he cites himself? Certainly though <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Learning was great, and his Reading much, yet was he known to be a person of too great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and humility to pretend to this. But suppose he had confest as much, as the Bishop desir'd, what follows? onely this, that till <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylacts</hi> time, none had given so full an Exposition of those words, <hi>Ego rogavi pro Te, &amp;c.</hi> as those seven Popes: which is no wonder at all, considering how few of the Fathers have purposely comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the place, and how many of them do in effect deliver the same Doctrine, drawn from other Texts of Scripture, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so shews in other Chapters.</p>
               <p>The force therefore of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> proof out of <hi>Theophylact</hi> is this: If our Saviours prayer was to have a <hi>special</hi> effect in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> because he was to be the <hi>Churches Foundation</hi> under Christ, it must also have the like effect in those who were to be <hi>such Foundations</hi> in succeeding ages, that is, in all his lawful Successours. Neither doth this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Indeficiency of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, belong to him precisely as an Apostle (which the Relatour insinuates) but rather as he was Prince of the Apostles, and appointed to be Christs <hi>Vicar</hi> on earth after him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To what he addes touching the <hi>two Effects,</hi> or <hi>Priviledges,</hi> our Saviours prayer obtain'd for St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and their <hi>descending</hi> to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, I answer, Whatever our Saviour intended should <hi>descend</hi> by vertue of that prayer of his, did effectively so descend. But I confess 'tis a disputable question, whether every thing, which Christ by this prayer intended and obtain'd for St. <hi>Peter,</hi> was likewise intended by him to descend to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successours. That some <hi>special</hi> privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (both intended and obtain'd (by this prayer) was to <hi>descend</hi> to them is manifest, both by the <hi>Authorities</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> brought <note n="a" place="margin">Bellarm. lib. <hi>4.</hi> de Rom. Pout. cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in proof thereof; and this Priviledge was, that none of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successours should ever so far <hi>fall from the Faith,</hi> as to teach Heresie, or any thing contrary to Faith <hi>tanquam Pontifex</hi> (as the Cardinals words are) that is, in vertue of that Authority which they were to have in the Church <hi>as his Successors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordship quarrels this Priviledge, and sayes, <hi>'tis not out of all doubt,</hi> though <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms it is. And why so? <hi>Because</hi> many <hi>learned men</hi> have affirm'd the contrary, and <hi>challeng'd many Popes for teaching Heresie.</hi> I ask, what <hi>learned</hi> men does he mean? his own, or ours? If his own, 'tis no marvel they challenge those of teaching Heresie, from whose subjection they have revolted, and whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (to justifie their unjust revolt) they daily load with bitter inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives and opprobrious appellations. If ours, What <hi>Teaching</hi> do's he mean? Is it teaching onely in quality of a <hi>private Doctour?</hi> This is not the question here; this belongs to the first Priviledge <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> sayes, our Saviour obtain'd for St. <hi>Peter</hi> by his prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> of not personally erring against Faith. If he mean <hi>Publique Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as Doctour and Pastour of the whole Church, what Catholique Divines ever taught, that the Pope can in this quality teach Heresie?

Some haply will reply, Many Catholique Divines hold, that the Pope without a <hi>General</hi> Council may erre, though he teach <hi>ex Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drâ,</hi> or as Doctour of the Universal Church. Let them name those Authors, and let their words be exactly cited; which will soon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive them: seeing they that hold the Pope may erre, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines without a <hi>General</hi> Conncil, do consequently to their principles deny, <hi>that without a General Council</hi> he either doth, or can define any matter <hi>as Doctour of the whole Church;</hi> constantly averring, that he never acts in that quality, but when he presides in a <hi>General</hi> Council. If our Adversaries please to yield so farre to the Popes Infallibility, as to grant him exempt from erring in matters of Faith, when ever he defines with a <hi>General</hi> Council, I shall not desire to have further Controversie with them touching that point.</p>
               <p>But by the <hi>By,</hi> I cannot dissemble a slye Turn the Relatour here makes to disguise <hi>Bellarmins</hi> words. <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> speaking of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <note place="margin">

               <p>Neither is it any absurdity, much less a contradiction, in <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> to affirm in one place, that <hi>the Gift</hi> (not <hi>the whole Gift,</hi> that's an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bishops pure liberality) <hi>obtain'd by this prayer for St. Peter,</hi> did belong <hi>to his Successours,</hi> and afterwards say, <hi>perhaps</hi> some part of it did <hi>not belong to them.</hi> For what do's this signifie more, then that the one was not so absolutely certain as the other; though he really believ'd that both parts of the Gift did belong to them, and strongly disputes for that his opinion. May not a learned Authour positively affirm a thing to be true, though it be not infallibly certain?

3. The Text <hi>Pasce Oves &amp; Agnos,</hi> John 21. 15, 16, 17. comes <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 17.</note> next to be examin'd: wherein our <hi>Daedalus</hi> windes to and fro to finde a plausible evasion: but all will not do. <hi>Feed my Sheep—and my Lambs,</hi> that is, sayes <hi>A. C. Christs whole Flock.</hi> But at this the Bishop bids <hi>soft and fair. It is onely his Sheep and his Lambs.</hi> As if <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Lambs</hi> were not Christs <hi>whole Fock.</hi> What means this nice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Lambs,</hi> and <hi>the whole Flock?</hi> the Bishop tells us, because (forsooth) <hi>every Apostle, and every Apostles Successor hath charge to feed both Sheep and Lambs, no less then St.</hi> Peter. I ask where? The Bishop replies, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 29. (he would say haply 19. for there is no 29<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> verse in all this Chapter) and <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 17. Nay <hi>soft</hi> there, say I. I finde no mention, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. or <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. either of <hi>Sheep</hi> or <hi>Lambs.</hi> Those mention'd <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. (<hi>Euntes ergo docete omnes gentes, baptizantes eos in nomine Patris, &amp; Filii, &amp; Spiritus sancti</hi>) were not yet brought to Christs fold, they were as yet unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and uninstructed in the Faith: and therefore not pertaining to this Text of St. <hi>John,</hi> nor to the present question. For as the Text speaks onely of such as were actually Christs <hi>Sheep</hi> or <hi>Lambs,</hi> that is, actually his <hi>Flock,</hi> so the question is onely, whether <hi>all such</hi> were nor by our Saviour in this Text committed to St. <hi>Peters</hi> charge and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and collectively speaking, to him onely. We say, the words themselves being so absolutely and indefinitely pronounced, without restriction or limitation to any part of Christs Sheep, must according to the rules of right Interpretation, be understood general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indefinitely of <hi>all</hi> that were <hi>Christs Sheep</hi> and <hi>Lambs,</hi> that is, of all Christians whatsoever. Till therefore it be evidenc'd from some other place of Scripture, as clear as this of St. <hi>John,</hi> that the other Apostles had the feeding of <hi>all Christs Sheep</hi> as universally and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitedly committed to them, as here they were to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or that they themselves (who are as properly comprehended under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs sheep as any others) were excepted out of St. <hi>Peters</hi> charge, it must of necessity be granted, both that all <hi>Christs Sheep,</hi> even the Apostles themselves were in some sort, to be <hi>fed,</hi> that is, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd as Christs Sheep ought to be, by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and also that <hi>A. C's</hi> Gloss, expounding <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Lambs</hi> to be <hi>Christs whole Flock,</hi> stands unshaken by any thing the Bishop replies.</p>
               <p>Nay he replies nothing at all, by way of Argument to disprove it; but knowing it to be the sense of all Antiquity, windes about, and falls upon that odious question of <hi>Killing</hi> and <hi>deposing Kings;</hi> wherein, he presum'd, it would be more easie for him to choak his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary. But it shall not serve his turn. For we say first, he commits a gross fallacy, arguing <hi>à negatione speciei ad negationem generis;</hi> which is a new kinde of Logick. For what is it else to inferre the Pope has no Universal Power, or Supremacy at all, over the whole Church, because he hath not <hi>such or such a particular</hi> power over Christian Kings and Princes? His Lordship should have remembred, that we were yet upon the question <hi>An sit,</hi> whether or no the Pope hath an universal Power and Authority over the whole Church; which till it be fairly determin'd, 'tis but to make too much haste, and pervert due order, to fall upon the Question <hi>Quid sit,</hi> and dispute wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57798:113"/>
and how far it extends? Secondly we answer, the point of <hi>kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Kings</hi> is a most false and scandalous Imputation. For what Pope ever kill'd, or gave Command, Warrant, or Authority for the killing of any King? or what Catholique Author ever taught, that he had power from Christ so to do? And as for <hi>deposing</hi> them, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 'tis no point of our Faith, that the Pope hath power to do it: and therefore it is no part of my task to dispute it. But what Protestants have both done and justifi'd in the worst of these kindes, is but too fresh in memory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A. C.</hi> does not beg the question, when he sayes, <hi>The Bishop of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 18.</note> Rome <hi>shall never refuse to feed and govern the whole Flock of Christ, in such sort, as no particular man, or Church, shall have just cause to make a separation from it;</hi> seeing it is the clear inference of his precedent discourse: it is rather a begging the question in his Lordship to tell us onely, while he ought to prove it, that Protestants have made no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration <hi>from the General Church,</hi> but onely from <hi>the Church of Rome,</hi> and <hi>such other Churches, as by adhering to her have hazarded themselves, and do now mis-call themselves THE WHOLE CATHOLIQUE CHURCH.</hi> It is also in this case a begging the question, to affirm <hi>the Roman-Catholique Church to be in errour:</hi> since no man did ever grant his Lordship that she was so? or hath he any where convinc'd her of errour? He hath often said it and suppos'd it, I know; but where he hath prov'd it I know not. 'Tis therefore yet to be prov'd that the Roman-Catholique Church hath err'd in any Doctrine, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely defined by her. Again we deny, there is any <hi>hazard</hi> in <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, she being the unshaken Rock of Truth, and solely able to shew a <hi>continual Succession</hi> of lawfully-Sent Pastors and Teachers, from <hi>Christ</hi> to our present times, who have hitherto taught the same <hi>unchanged</hi> Doctrine, and shall <hi>infallibly,</hi> according to <hi>Christs</hi> promise, continue so teaching it unto the worlds end.</p>
               <p>From this onely Catholique Church Protestants have unhappily sever'd themselves, as I have already prov'd, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 13, 14.</note> and are through their own fault so absolutely depriv'd of all Communion with her, that they can no more be esteem'd members of this Church, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they now stand, then a wither'd branch can be accounted a part of the Tree from which it was broken. In vain therefore doth the Relatour pretend, that Protestants have not left the Church in her <hi>Essence,</hi> but in her <hi>Errours.</hi> The <hi>Essence</hi> of the Church consists in her Faith, Sacraments, Discipline: In all these ('tis too manifest to be deny'd) Protestants have forsaken the Church, yea and perpetually fight against her; wherefore they have left her in things <hi>essential,</hi> or pertaining to the life and <hi>being</hi> of the Church. And yet they have the confidence to call these <hi>Essentials, Errours;</hi> which is a bold and erroneous presumption: wherein they imitate no less the old Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques in the Primitive times of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Novatians, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Nestorians,</hi> &amp;c. then the Swarms of new Sectaries among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For which of all these did not, or would not, upon occasion plead, they forsook not the <hi>Essence</hi> of the Church, but her <hi>Errours;</hi> they separated not from her <hi>Communion,</hi> but <hi>Corruption?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Well. But after all disputes a man would imagine, that our
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57798:113"/>
learned Antagonist would at length submit to a General Council. For first he thus professes, speaking to <hi>A. C. What greater, or surer</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 26. num. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>judgement you can have, where sense of Scripture is doubted, then a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, I do not see.</hi> And immediately after he cites a long Text of <hi>A. C's.</hi> which speaks to this purpose; <q>That if all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours of the Church be gather'd together in the Name of Christ, and pray unanimously for the promis'd Assistance of the Holy Ghost, making great and diligent search and examination of the Scriptures and other grounds of Faith, and hearing each Pastour declare what hath been <hi>the Ancient Tradition</hi> of this Church, shall thereupon Decree some particular point, or matter, to be held for Divine Truth, if the Pastours of the Church (or General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil) may erre in such a Decree, what can be firm or certain upon Earth?</q> In answer to this he both professes, <hi>that it seems fair,</hi> and also <hi>freely grants, that a General Council is the best Judge on Earth for Controversies of Faith, where the sense of Scripture is doubted.</hi> This would make a man think the Bishop intended to conform himself to such a Decree. But to the end all the world may see how unwillingly he yields to reason, especially when it comes from an Adversary, he presently again begins to quarrel with <hi>A. C.</hi> telling us, there was never any such <hi>General Council</hi> call'd, nor indeed possible to be call'd, as <hi>A. C.</hi> speaks of, <hi>viz. in which all Pastours were gather'd together.</hi> As if <hi>A. C.</hi> were so simple, as by <hi>all Pastours</hi> to understand <hi>Numerically and Individually ALL,</hi> that is, every one of them, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that a Council could not be thought sufficiently <hi>General,</hi> nor an Obligatory Decree of Faith be made by it, unless <hi>all the Pastours</hi> of the Church in this sense were gather'd together: especially he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so clearly declar'd his meaning to the contrary, in defending the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to have been a true <hi>General</hi> Council: where 'tis manifest all Pastours whatsoever did not convene; though there were as many, as had met in some other General Councils, esteem'd even by Protestants for such. And strange it is to see, how long the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour skirmishes with meer shadows, and what inferences he makes meerly upon this most salsly-suppos'd, and wholly-improbable sense of <hi>A. C's.</hi> words. <hi>All Pastours</hi> then, in that Text of <hi>A. C.</hi> signifie no more, then <hi>all that are requisite,</hi> or so <hi>many of all</hi> as are, in the judgement of Reason and Christian Prudence, duly sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a True and Lawful General Council. If so many, lawfully call'd, be gather'd together, 'tis the <hi>ALL</hi> that <hi>A. C.</hi> intends: and if these lawfully assembled, pray for the promis'd Assistance of the Holy Ghost, they questionless shall obtain it, seeing our Saviour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of his word.</p>
               <p>Another Exception against that cited passage of <hi>A. C.</hi> is, that he speaking of Points decreed by a General Council, makes <hi>Firm, and Infallible</hi> to be Synonyma's: But here again the Bishop fails in his observation. <hi>A. C.</hi> onely tells us, that the Decree of such a General Council was <hi>Firm, and Infallible,</hi> that is, not onely <hi>Firm,</hi> but also <hi>Infallible.</hi> Is this to make them signifie the same thing? Neither doth he speak so much of what is Infallible <hi>in it self,</hi> as what is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible <hi>in order to us.</hi> So that, this and the Premises considered, there
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57798:114"/>
must needs be some other visible and Infallible Judge, (<hi>viz.</hi> a General Council) beside Scripture, for setling Controversies in the Church, and making all points of Faith not onely <hi>Firm,</hi> but <hi>Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. What the Relatour brings in his swelling Margent, out of <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus</hi> and St. <hi>Austin,</hi> serves onely to amuse his Reader. We grant that Christ did not dye <hi>Intestate,</hi> but left behinde him a Will; which was afterwards <hi>written.</hi> So that in rigour of speech he left onely a <hi>Nuncupative Will,</hi> which was after deliver'd to the Church, partly by <hi>Writing,</hi> partly by <hi>Tradition.</hi> However, we stand not upon the <hi>terms,</hi> but the <hi>thing</hi> it self; and have recourse with St. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi> to the <hi>Written Word</hi> (or <hi>Will</hi>) in matters of Faith. We urge and plead it in almost all matters controverted in Religion between us and them. But we demand, what was to be done by those first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who liv'd before this <hi>Will</hi> was written, or at least before it was generally receiv'd or known for such? Again, what are we now to doe, when either this <hi>written Word</hi> is call'd in question, or the matter in Controversie not so clearly set down therein, as to put a period to contention? Do the forecited Authours deny, that in such case we must have recourse to Tradition? Nothing less.</p>
               <p>Certainly St. <hi>Austin</hi> believ'd the necessity of Infant-Baptism, the unlawfulness of rebaptizing the duly-Baptiz'd by Heretiques, with many other points, which no man can evidently prove out of the <hi>written Word</hi> alone: nay the Scripture it self he believ'd for no other reason, then the Authority of the Church and Tradition. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot sufficiently wonder at those words of his Lordship to <hi>A. C.</hi> in the Margent, where by way of defiance he tells him, <hi>he could shew no Father of the Church, who taught, that Christ ever lest behinde him a NUNCUPATIVE OBLIGATORY WILL.</hi> First, what means he by that restrictive expression, <hi>a Nuncupative Obligatory Will?</hi> Could any <hi>Will,</hi> left by our Saviour, whether <hi>Nuncupative,</hi> or by <hi>Writing</hi> not be <hi>Obligatory?</hi> Secondly, how was it possible, the Bishop should challenge us to prove <hi>by the Fathers,</hi> that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our left behinde him a <hi>Nuncupative Will,</hi> since 'tis in it self most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and undeniable? Did he leave (I pray) any other then a <hi>Nuncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pative Will?</hi> Was any part of the Gospel written either by himself, or by any other at his command in his life time? Did he not make his <hi>whole Will</hi> by word of mouth to his Disciples?</p>
               <p>But we shall not insist wholly upon the self-evidence of the thing. Is it not to be shewn out of the Fathers, that Christ left a <hi>Nuncupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Obligatory Will?</hi> First, touching the word (<hi>Nuncupative Will</hi>) we hope it will be held sufficient, if we prove the thing, (<hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written,</hi> yet <hi>Obligatory, Declaration of Christs Doctrine</hi>) which is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to a <hi>Nuncupative Will.</hi> And as to this we say that <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and all Catholique Divines, who write of the word of God <hi>written and unwritten,</hi> do effectually prove it, not onely by the Authority of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and the unanimous consent of the Fathers, but even by the very Text of Scripture it self. Does not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> command us (2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 14.) <hi>TO HOLD FAST THE TRADITIONS we have been taught whether by Word, or Epistle?</hi> Doth not this in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect signifie a <hi>Nuncupative Will,</hi> and <hi>Obligatory?</hi> Does not Saint

But surely he is not a little mistaken. For in the first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  Councils, do we not finde the Confirmations of the several Popes, who then sate, clearly acknowledged? See the Acts and Synodical Epistles of the six first Councils, and <hi>Gelasius, epist.</hi> 13. <hi>ad Episcop. Dardan. Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Neither can it rationally be thought, that the Decrees of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil should be taken for the Decrees of the whole Church Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, if the consent of the acknowledged chief Pastour and Head of the Church were wanting. And whereas the Relatour brings St. <hi>Austin's</hi> Authority, to prove, that the Sentence of a General Council <hi>is confirm'd by the consent of the whole Church yielding to it,</hi> we answer, his Allegation might well have been spar'd; for we say so too. We acknowledge, the Acceptation of the Universal Church to be an <hi>Acoessory</hi> and <hi>Secondary</hi> Confirmation of the Decrees of a General Council; and as the whole Church <hi>Representative</hi> (or a General Council) cannot erre in <hi>defining,</hi> so neither can the whole Church <hi>Diffusive</hi> and <hi>Formal</hi> erre in <hi>accepting</hi> and believing whatever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. So that ordinarily speaking, we acknowledge a Double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Decrees made by a General Council; the one, of the Pope, as Head of the Church; the other, of the Church it self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended throughout the several Provinces of Christendom. But the Popes Confirmation is Primary, Essential, and absolutely necessary; because without it, what the Council declares neither is, nor can be esteem'd the Act, or Judgement of the whole Church Representative; the Pope being the chief Member both of Church and Council. The Churches Acceptation is, as I have said, a Confirmation also; but this is onely Accessory, for the further satisfaction of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that may haply doubt, either of the Authority, or Proceedings of this or that Council in particular. And there is no other ordinary means to assure private persons throughout the Church, that such or such a Council was lawfully assembled, proceeded duly, voted free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and was Authentically confirm'd by the chief Bishop, but this, <hi>viz.</hi>

that its Decrees are universally receiv'd <hi>as obligatory</hi> by all particular Churches, or the whole Church <hi>Diffusive.</hi> Neither is this Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so simply and absolutely necessary, but that the Decrees of a General Council, lawfully assembled and duly confirm'd by the Pope, are obligatory without it, and antecedently to it.</p>
               <p>But what if St. <hi>Austin</hi> say no such thing as the Bishop cites him for, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that 'tis <hi>the consent of the whole Church</hi> Diffusive, that confirms the Decrees of General Councils, and not the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

Surely no. To conclude therefore, we think, the Bishop could not well have more effectually justifi'd our assertion, concerning the Authority both of the Church, and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, then by citing this Text of St. <hi>Austin:</hi> Since it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifies, that the Church doth settle and determin matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie by the sentence of a General Council; in which <hi>the whole Churches</hi> consent is both virtually included, and effectually declared.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Bishop is not yet well pleased with <hi>A. C.</hi> but goes on in his <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 2.</note> angry exceptions against him, for interposing (as he tells us) <hi>new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, quite out of the Conference.</hi> But how can it be called <hi>new matter,</hi> as not pertinent to the question debated in the Conference, if <hi>A. C.</hi> urg'd and prov'd, by what reasons he could, the necessity of the Popes Authority for ending Controversies in Faith; that being the point his Adversary most especially deny'd? <hi>A. C.</hi> desires to know what's to be done for reuniting the Church in case of Heresies and Divisions, when a general Council cannot be held by reason of manifold impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments; or being call'd, will not be of one minde. <hi>Hath Christ our Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>in this case provided no Rule, no Judge Infallible to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Controversies, and procure unity and certainty of Belief?</hi> Yes, (sayes the Bishop) <hi>He hath, left an Infallible Rule, the Scripture.</hi> But this Answer <hi>A. C.</hi> foreseeing, prevented by his following words, <note n="a" place="margin">Indeed the Protestants admit no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Means, Rule, or Judge, but onely Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which every man may interpret, as he pleases, and so all shall be uncertain. <hi>A.

What sayes the Bishop to that? First, he cunningly dissembles the objection, takes no notice of <hi>A. C.s</hi> discourse to that purpose; and yet, finding it necessary to apply some salve to the sore, he addes in the second place, as it were by way of <hi>Tacit</hi> prevention, <hi>In necessaries to Salvation</hi> the Scripture <hi>by the manifest places</hi> of it, (which admit <hi>no dispute,</hi> nor need any <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judge</hi> to interpret them) <hi>is able to settle Unity and Certainty of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:57798:115"/>
But surely here the Bishop went too farre, and lost himself in his own Labyrinth. For if by matters <hi>necessary to Salvation</hi> he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands onely such as are of <hi>absolute necessity</hi> to be <hi>expresly</hi> known and believ'd by all Christians, (<hi>necessitate medii</hi> as Divines speak) though we should grant they were so clear in Scripture, as not to fall under dispute among Christians, yet to affirm (as he does) that there ought to be <hi>no contention to a separation</hi> about any other points, is to condemn the perpetual practice of the Catholique Church, which hath ever oblig'd her Children, under pain of <hi>Anathema,</hi> to separate themselves from thousands of Sectaries and Heretiques, (as namely from the <hi>Montanists,</hi> the <hi>Quarto-Decimani,</hi> the <hi>Rebaptizers, Monothelites, Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Semi-Pelagians, Vigilantians, Iconoclasts,</hi> and the like) who held all those foresaid <hi>necessary</hi> matters, and err'd onely in such, as were not absolutely and universally necessary to be expresly known, and believ'd by all Christians whatsoever.</p>
               <p>But if by <hi>necessaries to salvation,</hi> he mean any of those, which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines term necessary, <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> he should have assign'd them in particular: for till that be done, such General Answers as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop here gives, signifie nothing, either to the just satisfaction of us, or security of their own proceedings; since they cannot possibly know in what points they ought to hold <hi>contention to a separation,</hi> and in what not. Moreover we having already prov'd at large (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and in other places) that 'tis necessary to salvation to believe whatever is sufficiently propos'd to us by the Church, whether clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Scripture or not, it follows, there must be some other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule, beside Scripture, whereon to ground our Faith of such Things, as are not clearly deliver'd in Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Holy Scripture alone is not qualifi'd for such a Rule of Faith as the Bishop would make us believe it is. For though it may be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Ibidem. n. 4.</note> to be <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi> in it self, yet is it not so <hi>in order to us,</hi> nor so much as known to us for Gods Word, without the Authority of the Church, assuring us of that truth: and he is very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken when he supposes, <hi>the Ancient Church had no other</hi> Additional <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> (viz. Tradition) by which <hi>to direct their Councels.</hi> Nor is there any thing alledgeable out of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> contrary to this sense, if his words be candidly interpreted. <hi>Tertullian</hi> indeed calls Scripture <hi>the principal</hi> rule; and we, if we have not sufficiently acknowledg'd it already upon sundry occasions, will now say so too: it is the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,</hi> not the <hi>onely</hi> Rule. He <hi>adores the fulness of Scripture;</hi> so do we, as to that particular point, about which he then disputed. We confess, the Scriptures do most <hi>fully prove</hi> against <hi>Hermogenes</hi> the Heretique, that the <hi>world,</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> whereof this world consists, was not <hi>eternal,</hi> but <hi>created</hi> by God in time. Again 'tis no way probable that <hi>Tertullian</hi> here extends the <hi>Fulness of Seripture</hi> so far as to exclude all <hi>unwritten Tradition,</hi> which in other parts of his <note n="b" place="margin">Tertull. lib.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57798:116"/>
that it hath <hi>a woe</hi> annexed to it; but to superinduce what is no way dissonant, but rather consonant and agreeable to Scripture, hath no such <hi>curse</hi> laid upon it.

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore to take notice by the way of the Bishops conceit upon <note place="margin">Ibidem. n. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Gedeon's Fleece,</hi> we averre, that Scripture hath not onely <hi>Dew</hi> upon it, but <hi>water</hi> in it, and that enough, not onely for a <hi>Lamb to wade</hi> thorow, but for an <hi>Elephant</hi> to swim: but whosoever shall presume to <hi>wade,</hi> or <hi>swim</hi> there, without help of Apostolical and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tradition, will surely perish by his presumption. He asks, <hi>what warrant we have to seek another</hi> Rule, beside Scripture; but considers not how groundless his own assertion is, <hi>that God hath left us Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as the onely Infallible Rule:</hi> which is contrary to the common belief of all true Christians, contrary to express Scripture, and the constant judgement and practise of the Church in all ages; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of none but confess'd and condemn'd He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But the Bishop tells us, that though the Pope should be granted <note place="margin">Ibidem. n. 6.</note> a living Infallible Judge, yet would it not suffice, <hi>against the malice of the Devil and impious men, to keep the Church at all times from renting even in Doctrine of Faith, or to soder the rents which are made.</hi> His <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> reason is, because <hi>oportet Haereses esse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heresies there will be, and Heresies properly there cannot be, but in Doctrine of the Faith.</hi> I answer, the Church is at all times <hi>sufficiently</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> secur'd from such Rents by the Authority of its chief Pastour, where 'tis duly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd. <hi>The malice of the Devil and impious men,</hi> by inventing Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, hurt not the Church, but themselves and their Adherents, who by their Heresie and Schism make a divorce from the Church, that is, either sever themselves, or are justly cut off from her for their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; the Church (to speak properly) remaining still as pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt as she was before. Heresies are not <hi>within,</hi> but <hi>without</hi> the Church; and the <hi>Rents,</hi> (or Schismatical party) which stand in need of Sodering, are not found amongst the true Members of the Church, who continue still united in Faith, and due obedience with their Head, and in all necessary Communion with one another; but in those who have deserted the true Church, and either made, or adher'd to Schismatical and Heretical Congregations.</p>
               <p>And herein truly, if passion did not too much blinde us, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would tell us, that had not the Pope receiv'd from God the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he challenges, of Governing the Church as <hi>Supream Head</hi> thereof under <hi>Christ,</hi> he could never have been able to preserve that Peace and Unity in matters of Religion, that is found in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; (there being, upon other Accounts, so many Feuds and Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57798:116"/>
among the Professours of that Religion) or to have subsisted thus long, had his pretension to it been grounded on meer Policy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; as Protestant Ministers continually suggest to their Disciples: especially in these latter ages, wherein the wit and malice of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have been sharpened to the utmost; and every thing objected (even with notorious calumny) that might possibly serve to render his Authority suspected and contemptible, even with those who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd it. But leaving him to the execution of his Pastoral Charge, let us see, how matters go between the Bishop and his Adversary.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>A. C.</hi> tells us, <hi>there is no earthly Kingdom,</hi> that (when <hi>matters cannot</hi> opportunely <hi>be compos'd</hi> by Parliament, which upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and at all times cannot be summoned) hath not, <hi>beside the Law-Books, some living Magistrates and Judges, and above all one visible King</hi> (the Supream Magistrate and Judge) to determin emergent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, and preserve peace in Temporal affairs: and thence <hi>à pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate rationis,</hi> or rather <hi>à fortiori</hi> inferrs, that Christ, the wisest of Kings, hath in like manner provided in his Kingdom (the Church) beside <hi>the Law-Books of Holy Scripture,</hi> some <hi>visible Magistrates and Judges,</hi> and <hi>above all one chief Magistrate and Judge,</hi> sufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd and assisted by his Spirit, as to put an end to all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies concerning <hi>Ecclesiastical affairs,</hi> and preserve his Church <hi>in the Unity and Certainty</hi> of Faith. To which the Relatour thinks it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to say, all this is but <hi>a Simile:</hi> and <hi>if the Similitude hold not in the main, the Argument's nothing.</hi> The <hi>Similitude</hi> upon which <hi>A. C.</hi> grounds his discourse, is, <hi>that the whole Militant Church is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> which the Bishop denyes, telling us, <hi>they are no mean ones, who think our Saviour Christ left the Church Militant in the Hands of the Apostles and their Successours, in an Aristocratical, or mixt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But I answer, though <hi>A. C.</hi> urges the Argument in <hi>the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of a Kingdom</hi> onely, yet is it of force in any other kinde of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Government. In a Common-wealth, beside the Law-Books, 'tis requisite, there be a living Judge, or Judges, invested with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority to determin all matters in difference amongst the people.</p>
               <p>What the Relatour brings against <hi>the Monarchy</hi> of the <hi>Militant Church,</hi> shews onely, that it is not <hi>a pure,</hi> but a <hi>mixt</hi> Monarchy, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating somewhat both of <hi>Aristocracy</hi> and <hi>Democracy.</hi> I call that a <hi>Pure</hi> Monarchy, in which all the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> is so in <hi>one</hi> alone, as that no other person, or persons in the Kingdom, govern, but in vertue of the <hi>Monarchs</hi> Authority, and meerly as his <hi>Substitutes.</hi> A <hi>mixt</hi> Monarchy is that, in which one indeed is <hi>Supream,</hi> and in some cases commands all; yet so, as others within the Monarchy are Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and do govern both Towns and Provinces <hi>as their own,</hi> and with rights of Sovereignty, though not absolute, but holding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the Monarch in chief. Now the Supream Government of the Church is clearly Monarchical. Seeing the Pope, as Vicar of Christ, and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successour, hath a Supream Authority over the whole Church: yet is not his Monarchy <hi>pure,</hi> but <hi>mixt;</hi> because Bishops, within their respective Diocesses and Jurisdictions, are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Princes also, that is, Chief Pastours and Governours of such a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57798:117"/>
part of the Church, <hi>in their own right,</hi> and not meerly his <hi>Vicars</hi> and <hi>Substitutes,</hi> placeable and displaceable at his pleasure. In this respect therefore the Government of the Church hath something of the <hi>Aristocratical</hi> in it. And because any man, if sufficiently qualified for it, may be promoted to a Bishoprick, it hath something also of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. But since the Government of <hi>one</hi> in chief is by all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers acknowledged for the most <hi>perfect,</hi> what wonder is it, that Christ our Saviour thought it fitter to govern his Church by <hi>one Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> (as the Bishop is pleas'd to tearm him) then <hi>Aristocratically,</hi> or by <hi>many,</hi> as he would have it? And as for the <hi>Literae Communicatoriae,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 8.</note> (which himself alledges against this Monarchical Government) they rather prove our Assertion, being ordain'd by <hi>Sixtus</hi> the first, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of such Bishops, as were call'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> or otherwise forc'd to repair thither; to the end they might without scruple be receiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Diocess at their return: having also decreed, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such Letters <hi>Communicatory</hi> none, in such case, should be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now what can more clearly prove, that the Pope had power over all Bishops, and all Diocesses in the Church, then the making of such a Decree? We deny not; but the like <hi>Literae Communicatoriae</hi> were mutually sent from one Patriarch to another. But as for that <hi>even, equal,</hi> and <hi>Brotherly way,</hi> whereby the Bishop pretends, that these Letters were sent reciprocally from other Patriarchs and Bishops to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for admitting any into Episcopal, or Priestly Office, that went from them to him; as I finde nothing of it in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> (who yet handles the matter at large) so I doubt not, but it is a meer <hi>Chimaera.</hi> And had the Bishop pleas'd, with all his professed diligence in the search, to have afforded us any instance, in a business of such importance, there would doubtless have appear'd a manifest difference and <hi>inequality</hi> between them, <hi>viz.</hi> that those sent to the Pope from other Prelates, were meerly <hi>Testimonial,</hi> to assure him that the person bringing them, was capable of his Communion: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as those from the Pope to other Bishops were not onely <hi>Testimonial,</hi> but <hi>Mandatory,</hi> or such as <hi>enjoyn'd</hi> the reception, and restitution of the Bringer, to such place and office in the Church as he pretended to. Witness (beside many other examples in Ecclesiastical Story) the case of St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and those other Catholick Bishops, persecuted and expell'd their Seas by the Arrians, and restor'd by vertue of the Popes Letters Communicatory. But, should the Pope voluntarily submit to the Equity of his own Law, that is, not onely allow such Letters to be written from others to him, as he writes to them, but also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to be so far of force as equity requires, what would this prejudice his just Authority? It might argue indeed the Humility of his Spirit; but could surely be no Argument against his Right, and Power to do otherwise, if he saw cause.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Neither hath the Bishop much better success in his Allegation of St. <hi>Hierome:</hi> who, in his Epistle to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> enveighing (as his manner is) somewhat vehemently against one, that seem'd to preferre <hi>Deacons</hi> before <hi>Priests,</hi> proceeds so far in vindication of the dignity and honour of Priesthood, that he almost equalizes it with the office of Bishops; plainly asserting, that <hi>Diocesan</hi> Bishops have no more belonging to them <hi>jure Divino</hi> (or by the Institution of Christ) then Priests, save onely the Power of Ordination: that the riches, wealth, and amplitude of their respective Diocesses make not one Bishop greater then another; but that all Bishops, where ever they be plac'd, are of one and the same <hi>merit and degree</hi> in regard of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Priesthood: which (speaking precisely of the Office, and Power Episcopal in it self) is very true: for a larger or lesser Diocess makes not one man more or less a Bishop, then another; St. <hi>Austin</hi> was as much a Bishop at little <hi>Hippo,</hi> as <hi>Aurelius</hi> was at great <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage:</hi> But this is no impediment to the additional, or accessory col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (whether by divine or humane Institution) of some special and more eminent Power and Authority upon the Bishop of one Diocess, then of another: as we say there is conferr'd, <hi>jure Divino,</hi> upon the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as he is St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successour; and <hi>jure Ecclesiastico</hi> upon many other Bishops, <hi>viz.</hi> Archbishops, Metropolitans, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, &amp;c. who by the Canons of the Church exercise authority over many Bishops, who in regard of the power <hi>meerly Episcopal</hi> are equal to them. St. <hi>Hierome</hi> therefore, when he sayes <hi>ubicunque fuerit Episcopus, sive Romae, sive Eugubii, sive Constantinopoli, sive Rhegii,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hier. Epist. ad Evagrium.</note> 
                  <hi>sive Alexandriae, sive Tanis, ejusdem meriti, ejusdem est &amp; sacerdotii,</hi> speaks not of the Pope <hi>as he is Pope,</hi> or in respect of that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent Authority, which belongs to him as Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour, but onely compares him with another private Bishop in respect of meer Character, or power of a Bishop <hi>as Bishop</hi> onely. And as he doth not <hi>de facto</hi> speak of the Pope as Successour of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> so is it certain, that <hi>de jure</hi> he could not speak any thing to the prejudice of that part of the Bishop of <hi>Rome's</hi> Authority, without contradicting and condemning himself, not onely in his Epistle to Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> already cited, (where he professeth, that to be out of the Popes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is to be <hi>an Alien from the Church of Christ</hi>) but also in his Commentaries on the 13. <hi>Psalm,</hi> where he calls St. <hi>Peter, Head of the Church;</hi> and <hi>Epist. ad Demetriad. Virg.</hi> where he stiles the Pope <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour of the Apostolick Chair;</hi> and speaks to the same purpose in divers other places of his <note n="a" place="margin">D.

Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cif.</note> works.</p>
               <p>But now the Bishop, to give a home-blow, as he imagin'd, to the Popes Authority over the whole Church, pretends to bring <hi>a great and undoubted Rule, given by</hi> Optatus; who tells us, <hi>the Church is in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. n. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>the Commonwealth, not the Commonwealth in the Church:</hi> whence he
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57798:118"/>
positively concludes it impossible, that the Government of the Church should be <hi>Monarchical.</hi> For (saith he) <hi>no Emperour, or King, will endure another King within his Dominions to be greater then himself, since the very enduring it makes him that endures it, upon the matter, no Monarch.</hi> But the force of this Argument will presently vanish, if we but consider, that these two Kingdoms are of different natures; the one, Spiritual, the other Temporal; the one exercis'd onely in such things as concern the Worship of God, and the Eternal Salvation of Souls: the other, in affairs that concern this world alone; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently do not of their own nature hinder, but help one another, where they are rightly administred. Neither must it come under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, whether the administration of the spiritual Monarchy ought to be <hi>endur'd</hi> or not, seeing Christ hath so ordain'd it: nor would the Relatour (I suppose) have urg'd this argument, had he well reflected on the person of our Saviour; who (as the Bishop himself would not deny) was, whilst he lived on earth, most truly and properly the visible Monarch of the whole Church (his Kingdom) whether the Kings of the earth would <hi>endure</hi> it, or not.</p>
               <p>Again, is it not in a manner the same thing in regard of Temporal Kings, to have had the Apostles, <hi>Universal Governours</hi> over all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as if some one had been a Monarch, or chief amongst them? and yet the Bishop cannot in his own principles deny, but Temporal Kings were bound to <hi>endure</hi> this, and did actually <hi>endure</hi> it, without <hi>unkinging</hi> themselves thereby. Nay, is it not as prejudicial to their Temporal Crowns, Titles, and Prerogatives, to have all their people (together with themselves) subject to the decrees of a lawful General Council (which the Bishop denyes not) as to be subject to the Decrees of some one chief Bishop?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Lastly, who sees not, that the force of this Argument is utterly broken by the daily experience, we have of the contrary to what our Adversary pretends? For instance, do not the Two great Christian Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain endure</hi> it? Nay, do's not all the world see, that they do not onely endure it, but maintain the Authority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of such a <hi>Spiritual Monarch,</hi> as we speak of, in the very midst of their Dominions? and is it not evident, they prosper so well <hi>under</hi> it, that it would be no less then Dotage to contend, that the enduring it is a Diminution of their Majesty?</p>
               <p>Our Adversaries reflection upon this particular by way of Answer, is not onely <hi>injurious</hi> to those Two great Monarchs, but destructive of his own Argument. For he tells us, the Popes power is of little esteem in the Kingdoms of these Two Catholique Princes <hi>further</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>then to serve their own turns of him;</hi> which they do (saith he) <hi>to their great advantage</hi> Thus, what the two great Catholique Princes of <hi>Christendom</hi> profess to do upon the Account of Faith and Conscience, the Relatour hath the confidence to tell us, they do it meerly on the score of policy, and for temporal ends; though he plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himself in this assertion; since he told us but just now, the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during</hi> such a Monarchy made him that <hi>endur'd</hi> it, no Monarch. You see at once both his Civility towards Christian Princes, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy to himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:57798:119"/>
Moreover, I wonder the Relatour could not see, that this Argument, <hi>The Church is within the Commonwealth, ergo Subordinate unto it,</hi> (had it any force) would conclude as much against the <hi>Aristocratical</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, for which he so much pleads, as the <hi>Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> For how (I pray) could the Bishops of so many different King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and States, when the good of the Church did necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, Convene in a General Councel, or authoritatively Declare what ought to be believ'd, when matters of Faith were question'd? or how should they (otherwise then precariously) cause their Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be receiv'd through the whole Church, if either there were no Supream Spiritual Governour at all, or he bound, as it were, to ask Princes leave to do what belongs to his Office? Is not a General Council as much <hi>within the Commonwealth,</hi> as the Pope? If therefore the Pope, in the administration of his Office be any way subject <hi>de jure</hi> to the Authority of Temporal Princes, how can a General Council be absolute and independent of the same Authority, in the execution of theirs? Thus you see how by impugning the <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government of Christs Church, he, in effect, overthrows all Church-Government whatsoever, even that which himself would seem to approve.</p>
               <p>It remains therefore fully prov'd, that the external Government of the Church on earth is Monarchical, not <hi>purely</hi> and <hi>absolutely,</hi> but <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as hath been already declar'd. Neither do we stile the Pope <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the Church,</hi> but the Deputy, or Vicar General of Christ: that is, his Chief Bishop, by whom he governs his Church in chief. He is neither <hi>King,</hi> nor <hi>Lord</hi> of the Church, but the <hi>Chief-Servant</hi> of it, a <hi>Steward</hi> of Christs Family, yea a <hi>Fellow-Servant</hi> with other Bishops, to one and the same Master. Yet the Care of the whole Family is committed to him, and but part of it to other Bishops; who govern by Commission from Christ <hi>with</hi> him, but <hi>under</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This duly consider'd, what the Relatour objects out of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> for the power of Bishops, comes just to nothing. For we acknowledge Bishops to have a <hi>portion, jure Divino,</hi> in the Government of Christs Flock. They are no less Chief Officers of Christ, then the Pope, though not in all respects equal to him, or so absolute, as to govern with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dependance on him. And it seems strange, the Bishop should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to prove out of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> that the Government of the Church Militant is not Monarchical, in the sense often declar'd, because <note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. <hi>1.</hi> De Rom. Pont. cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> he teaches <hi>'tis to be govern'd by Bishops;</hi> since in the place alledg'd, he declares the Government of the Church onely as 'tis contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the government of Temporal Princes; not as inferiour Bishops are distinguisht from the Supream, or Chief Bishop: that's another question, and treated by him in another place: it being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to his purpose there to shew, that the Church was to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Ecclesiastical, not Temporal Princes; without disputing whether the said Ecclesiastical Governours were Subordinate, or not, one to another.</p>
               <p>But the Bishop proceeds in his objections, and tells us the Church
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57798:119"/>
Militant remaining <hi>spread in many earthly Kingdoms,</hi> cannot so well be order'd by one Monarch, as a particular Kingdom may by one King. <hi>For how</hi> (saith he) <hi>will this one Supream execute his Office, if the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Kings of those several Kingdoms will not give leave?</hi> I answer first, this Difficulty makes as much against the <hi>Aristocratical</hi> form of Church-Government as the <hi>Monarchical.</hi> For how will a General Council (to use his own term) <hi>enter to execute their Office,</hi> when the necessities of the Church require such a Convention, <hi>if the Kings of those several Kingdoms</hi> (from whence the Prelates are to come) <hi>will not give leave?</hi> Nay how can the Bishops of any one Christian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom meet in Synods, if their respective Sovereigns (to whom the Relatour will have them subject even in <hi>Spirituals</hi>) <hi>will not give leave?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. As to his Surmize, that we <hi>would have one Emperour over all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Kings, as well as one Pope over all Bishops,</hi> I answer, it was a Chimaera of his own Brain, and as impossible for him to know, as for any of his party to deny with Truth, that we pray for Peace and Unity amongst all Christian Princes, wishing nothing more, then that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them may enjoy, and rest satisfied with his own right.</p>
               <p>But here the Bishop takes occasion to fall foul upon <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, because (forsooth) comparing the Ecclesiastical and Civil Power to the Two great Lights, the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> he made the <hi>Sun</hi> a Symbole of the Ecclesiastical, and the <hi>Moon,</hi> of the Civil Power; which the Relatour interprets for us to signifie the Pope and the Emperour. I answer. First, did not men love contention; there would be no quarrelling about such Conceipts as these; which are never taken for <hi>Argumentative,</hi> but meerly <hi>Allusive</hi> Applications of the Sacred Text touching these Two Powers; which diversely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered give ground to different Allegories. In times of persecution both the Church, and Pope, may not unfitly be compar'd to the <hi>Moon,</hi> by reason of their declining condition: but in time of prosperity, if we consider the same Church in relation to <hi>the extent and greatness</hi> of her Power beyond the Imperial, (it reaching to all places and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the world, professing Christian Faith) as also in respect of the Dignity of its <hi>Object,</hi> viz. Things Caelestial; (whereas the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of the Imperial Power are onely the Things of this world) there's little question, but the Ecclesiastical Power excells the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, no less then the Soul does the Body, or Eternity the Things of this life. In this regard therefore it could be no just matter of offence, for the Pope to be understood by the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the Emperour by the <hi>Moon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Pope (forsooth) makes too much odds between his own power and the Emperours, abasing that of the Emperour so far as to make it <hi>forty seaven times less</hi> then that of the Pope; which the Bishop proves from the Gloss upon this Decretal. We answer, the Allegory led the Glosser to it; and that being rather a flourish of wit and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceipt, then matter of solid Argument, it was but lost time for our Adversary to make inferences from it, and would be the like in us to answer them. The matter we stand upon is, that the Pope is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Pastour of the whole Church. Let our Adversaries disprove
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57798:120"/>
this, and not trifle about Allegories. We confess also, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour is Supream over his Subjects in all Civil affairs: in fuch sort, as neither of these Powers can of right hinder the other, in the due execution of their charge. They are both of them absolute and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Powers; though each in their proper orbe; the one in Spirituals, the other in Temporals. By which it appears, we are far from depressing the Imperial power <hi>lower then God hath made it,</hi> as the Relatour most injuriously chargeth us. No, we honour, and very willingly acknowledge the Emperour, in <hi>Tertullians</hi> style, <hi>Hominem</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>à Deo secundum, &amp; solo Deo minorem,</hi> viz. in the administration of all Civil affairs; in which doubtless all persons within his Dominion, ought to be subject to him. Yet does it not belong to the Emperour to order the affairs of the Church, resolve Controversies of Faith, or interpret Scripture in any sense contrary to the judgement and doctrine of the lawful Pastours of the Church: he hath no power to do any thing of this nature: neither shall we ever read, that any of them took upon them to be Supream Governours of the Church, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Religion on their own account, without or contrary to the said Pastours.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Book of the Law ('tis true) was anciently by Gods special command to be given to the King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18. But to what intent was it given? To govern the Church, by reading it, or expound the sense of the Law, when it happen'd to come in Controversie? Surely no: It was given him to govern himself and Kingdom by it; that by reading it he might <hi>learn to fear God, and keep his words and statutes,</hi> commanded in it, as the Text it self declares.</p>
               <p>Neither is it to be doubted, but in case of Notorious and Gross Abuses, manifestly contrary to Religion, and connived at by the Pastours of the Church, Christian Princes may both lawfully and piously use their Authority in procuring the said abuses to be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally redressed by the said Pastours; as the examples of <hi>Ezekias</hi> and <hi>Josias</hi> prove, alledged by the Bishop. But they prove not, that Princes may themselves take upon them the Priests Office, either in whole, or part; they prove not, that they may reform Religion, in the Substance of it, or enact any thing pertaining thereto by their own Authority, without, or contrary to the Priests consent; They prove not, that Princes may determine the Controversies of the Law, God having expresly reserv'd them to the Priests judgement, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all to submit to it under pain of death. Nay, point blank to the contrary we read (2. <hi>Paralip.</hi> 26. 20.) that <hi>Osias,</hi> though a King, was stricken by God with a sudden Leprosie, for but attempting to usurp the Priests Office: which if it were so unlawful then, must needs now be yet more, by how much the Functions of the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Priesthood are more <hi>Sacred, Spiritual,</hi> and participatively <hi>Divine,</hi> then those of the Mosaical Law.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Nor did the Popes ever attempt, or so much as pretend to bring the Emperours under them in Civil affairs, which is another aspersion the Bishop layes upon them. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> the Third were indeed very prudent men, and worthy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of the Church, to assert her just liberties; but they never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57798:120"/>
to subject the Emperour to themselves in Temporal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and it had been more for our Adversaries credit, instead of falsly pretending it to be <hi>plain in History</hi> that they did so, to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us at least some one good proof of it. Can any such thing be solidly concluded from the Allegory of the Sun and Moon? upon which the Relatour so long insists, and makes so many unsignificant reflections, that they would better become a person the Moon had particularly wrought upon, then a Primate of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The Relatour could not leave his digressive Discourse, without giving a lash to the Jesuites, by willing them to leave <hi>their practising</hi> to advance the greatness of the Pope and Emperour. But I wonder he could so easily believe, that men of understanding (as he sticks not to acknowledge Jesuites to be) should by Vow deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the riches and pleasures of this world, with design to make the Pope and Emperour great: especially seeing, that without breach of an Oath peculiar to their Order, they can neither seek, nor so much as accept of any Ecclesiastical preferment, (as other Church-men and Religious may) unless by way of <hi>Obedience,</hi> when expresly thereto commanded by the Pope, under pain of Sin.</p>
               <p>He skips from the Jesuites to the Friers. A certain Frier at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 12.</note> (<hi>John De Puente</hi> by name) in the Year 1612. printed a Book; in the <hi>Frontispiece</hi> whereof he painted <hi>the Sun and the Moon,</hi> so as they clearly signified the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> (Here the Scene changes; 'twas just now the Pope and the Emperour.) There were also divers other Emblematical Phansies added; by which was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated; that his Catholique Majesty should be content to be under the Pope, so he might rule all the world beside. Lastly, for fear the <hi>Scutcheons</hi> and <hi>Devises</hi> should not sufficiently discover the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi> the Title of the Book layes all open. 'Tis called <hi>LA CONVENIENTIA DE LAS DOS MONAR QUIAS CATOLICAS;</hi> in English, <hi>The Agreement of the Two Catholique Monarchies,</hi> viz. of the Pope and of <hi>Spain.</hi> To all which the Bishop addes his own particular reflection, that <hi>the Book had all manner of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, that a Book could have,</hi> For answer to it, we deny not but such a Book was both licensed and printed: but doubtless, who ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uses the contents of it impartially, will judge it was both licensed and printed rather for its witty conceit, and divertisement for the King and his Courtiers, then for a solid Foundation, whereon to build any serious and Dogmatical Assertion.</p>
               <p>And as this Spanish Frier stood for his own King, so <hi>Campanella</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Frier) is objected to have stood as much for the late <hi>Dolphin,</hi> now King of <hi>France,</hi> publishing, about the time of his Birth, a certain <hi>Eclogue</hi> concerning him; wherein the said <hi>Dolphin</hi> was promis'd <hi>the Universal Monarchy</hi> of the world, and all other Princes represented as now more afraid of <hi>France</hi> then ever before. What such men speak, partly out of Flattery to Princes, (an Epidemical infirmity, incident to men of all conditions) and partly as delighted with their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, makes nothing at all, to the cause of Religion; nor can we be thought responsible for any such personal Actions, or Assertions, of private men. 'Tis sufficient for us to have prov'd, that the Pope is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57798:121"/>
Universal Pastour of the Church: what the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France</hi> are, or would be, in reference to other Christian Kings and Princes, concerns not us either to know, or examine.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But leaving these Digressions, the Relatour does here acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it high time, <hi>to return</hi> to his Adversary, and think of Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>A. C.s</hi> Argument; which proves, that in the Church, beside the <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Law Book</hi> of the Bible, there must be a <hi>living Magistrate and Judge, so assisted by the Holy Ghost, as he may be able rightly to determine all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies of Religion, and preserve Unity and Certainty of Faith in the Church.</hi> To this he answers in brief, that for determining Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in Religion, and preserving Unity and Certainty of Faith, <hi>it is not necessary to have</hi> one Bishop over the whole Christian Church, more then 'tis necessary for determining Civil Differences, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Civil peace and unity among Christians, to have one Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour over the whole world. To confirm this, the Authority of <hi>Occham</hi> is cited, saying, that it is not <hi>necessary</hi> there should be <hi>one Governour</hi> of the whole Church under Christ; but 'tis <hi>sufficient,</hi> there be <hi>many</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, <hi>governing divers Provinces,</hi> as there are <hi>many</hi> Kings governing divers Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>I answer first, that besides that these <hi>Dialogues</hi> (which the Bishop here alledges) are in the <hi>Index</hi> of <hi>forbidden Books, Occham</hi> himself is no such unquestionable Authour among Catholiques, that we should think our selves oblig'd to defend what ever he sayes, especially in a question that concerns the Popes Authority; it being too well known how factiously he sided with an Enemy of the Church. Secondly, had Christ instituted such a Government of his Church, as <hi>Occham</hi> fancies, <hi>viz. a Government consisting of many,</hi> not Subordinate to any One, as Head and Supream over them, it would have been requisite, that all those <hi>Independent</hi> and <hi>Coordinate Governours</hi> in the Church should have been Infallible: otherwise the Government of the Church would have been little less then a meer Anarchy, without <hi>Unity,</hi> or <hi>Certainty</hi> in any thing: which must have destroy'd the very end of Government, and expos'd the whole Body of the Catholique Church (which yet is and must be <hi>One</hi> by the Institution of Christ) to as many Schisms, and varieties of Faith, as there are several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

The words of the Council are these. <hi>Definimus Sanctam Apostolicam Sedem, &amp; Romanum Pontificem in Universum orbem tenere Primatum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We define</hi> (saith the Council) <hi>that the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique Sea, and Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>have Primacy over the whole world; and</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe Bishop, pleading so much the necessity of <hi>General</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, <note place="margin">§. 27. n. 1.</note> as if he meant to submit to their Determinations, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd <hi>A. C.</hi> to tell him, <hi>that a General Council</hi> (viz. that of <hi>Trent</hi>) <hi>had already judged the Protestants, to hold errours.</hi> This was indeed to lay the Axe to the root, and bring the cause to a speedy issue: but the Relatour will not be taken unprovided. He answers therefore, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was neither a <hi>Legal,</hi> nor a <hi>General</hi> Council. Why not <hi>Legal?</hi> It had all the Conditions ever yet required by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, to the Legality of a General Council: and why not <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral?</hi> seeing all Bishops were invited to come, and that a greater number actually came, and assisted at the end of the Assembly, then were present at some other Councils, confessedly General. But let us hear the Bishops exceptions against this Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:57798:122"/>
His first exception is, that <hi>the Abettours</hi> of this Council <hi>maintain publickly, that 'tis lawful for them to conclude any Controversie, and make it DE FIDE, and so in our judgement FUNDAMENTAL,</hi> though it be not contain'd in Scripture, nor so much as <hi>probably</hi> dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thence; and for this opinion Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi> is cited in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. I answer, No Catholique Authour ever taught, that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Council to make what ever they please <hi>Matter of Faith,</hi> as the Bishop would seem to insinuate; but onely that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest or involved in the word of God, <hi>written,</hi> or <hi>unwritten,</hi> that is Tradition: And this indeed is defin'd by the very Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in these terms, <hi>that in matters of Faith we are to rely not onely upon Scripture, but also on Tradition.</hi> Now that this doctrine is true, hath been already <note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 6, 7, 14.</note> prov'd; and that it cannot make the Council <hi>illegal</hi> is manifest, even from the Bishops own Principles. For he confesseth, that <note n="b" place="margin">Relat. §. 16 n. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> (when it can be certainly known for such) is as truly the word of God, as <hi>Scripture</hi> it self: and 'tis <note n="c" place="margin">Ch. 6. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>certainly</hi> known to be <hi>such</hi> by the Tradition, or Definition of the Church, as hath been likewise heretofore prov'd, and by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop himself granted, in the question touching Scriptures-being the Word of God. Nor did the Council herein proceed in a different manner from other lawful and Oecumenical Councils, whiles she grounded her Definitions, partly on <hi>Scripture,</hi> partly on <hi>Tradition,</hi> even in matters not deducible by any particular, or Logical, inference from Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A second exception is, that the Pope (the person chiefly to be reform'd) <hi>Presided</hi> in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and was <hi>chief Judge in his own cause, against all Law, Divine, Natural, and Humane.</hi> But the Pope by his Legates <hi>presided</hi> also in the fourth General Council at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as the Bishop himself acknowledges: and yet 'tis esteem'd by all parties a Lawful and Authentical Council. Nor can it be prov'd, that the Pope was more <hi>the person to be reform'd</hi> at <hi>Trent,</hi> then at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> 'Tis true, the persons condemn'd by both these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils pretended, that (excepting onely themselves) the whole Church, and chiefly the Pope err'd, and by consequence were to be reform'd: but as the former complain'd without ground, in the opinion of all but themselves, so did the latter, and so do all their Adherents. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was esteem'd a great <hi>Party,</hi> and <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi> by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> for having acted so zealously in defence of the Catholique Faith against their Master, <hi>Arius:</hi> Yet he sate a chief Judge with the other Bishops, and had both a Prime place, and Vote in the first Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> where their Heresie was condemn'd. Saint <hi>Cyril presided</hi> in the Third General Council, though by the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian</hi> Heretiques there condemn'd, he were counted a <hi>Party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Adde to this, that in the abovemention'd Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> the cause was very particular between Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Dioscorus;</hi> and yet not onely the Legats of the said Pope presided in the Council, during the whole agitation of the business, but the condemnation of <hi>Dioscorus</hi> was even fram'd by Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and approv'd by the whole Council: So far was it from being thought a solid objection against him, that he was a party in the cause, or the person to be reform'd. We deny not but
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57798:122"/>
the other Bishops (being also Judges in the Council) may proceed even against the Pope himself, if the case do necessarily require it; as should he, for example, manifestly appear to be an Heretique. Protestants therefore have no just cause to quarrel the Popes <hi>presiding</hi> in Councils, especially so long as he is not justly accusable of any crime, but such, as must involve not onely the Council, but the whole Church, as much as himself; as 'tis evident he was not, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> 'Tis not therefore <hi>contrary,</hi> but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable</hi> to all <hi>Law, Divine, Natural, and Humane,</hi> that the Head should <hi>preside</hi> over the Members; and to give <hi>Novellists</hi> liberty to Decline the Popes judgement, or the judgement of any other their lawful Superiours, upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>  of their being <hi>parties,</hi> or by them accus'd of errour, who sees not, that it is, in effect, absolutely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt such people from all legal censure; nay, even to grant, there is no sufficient means left effectually to govern the Church, or condemn Heresie, Schisme, and other offences against Religion?</p>
               <p>But the Bishop, in his large Margent, denyes as well matter of <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>Fact,</hi> as matter of <hi>Right,</hi> in this question of the Popes <hi>presiding</hi> in General Councils: telling us, that in the First Council of <hi>Nice, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> was President, and not the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> either by himself or his Legates. I grant, <hi>Hosius</hi> did preside in that Council; and so did likewise <hi>Vitus,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius</hi> Priests of <hi>Rome,</hi> but I say they all presided <hi>as the Popes Legates,</hi> and not otherwise. This appears, by their subscribing the Conciliary Decrees in the first place. For, I pray, upon what other title would they have been allow'd to do it? There were Patriarchs, and many other Bishops of far greater Dignity then <hi>Hosius, Vitus,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius,</hi> to whom Precedency in that point must have been given, had not these represented the person of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop. Hence it is, that both <note n="a" place="margin">Cedren. in Compend. Hist.</note>

                  <hi>Photius</hi> confess, that the Pope <hi>gave Authority</hi> to the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council by his Legats: which is somewhat more, then barely to <hi>Preside</hi> in the Protestants sense; and by what <hi>Legats,</hi> if not by those abovementioned? I adde, that in the old Preface to the Council of <hi>Sardica,</hi> extant in the First Tome of the Councils, it is expresly said, that <hi>Hosius</hi> was the Popes Legat, and in right of that Legatship presided in the Council. <note n="c" place="margin">Hincmar. in opusc. <hi>55.</hi> cap. <hi>20.</hi>

In the second General Council 'tis true, <hi>Nectarius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> was President, and not the Pope, or his Legats. But the reason was, because Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> having first summon'd that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to be held at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the Bishops of the Oriental Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces being accordingly there met, the Pope for some reasons altered his minde, and would have had them come to <hi>Rome,</hi> to joyn with the Bishops he had there assembled: which the Prelates at <hi>Constantinople</hi> refusing in a submissive manner, alledged such arguments and just im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments for their excuse, as the Pope remained satisfied with them. So the Council was, upon the matter, held in two places, at <hi>Rome</hi> by the Pope and Bishops of the West, and at <hi>Constantinople</hi> by <hi>Nectari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and those of the East, as appears in <note n="f" place="margin">Theod. lib. <hi>5.</hi> Hist. cap. <hi>9. 10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Theodoret:</hi> who also men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Epistles both of the Pope to the Oriental Bishops, and of those again to him, full of mutual respect and amity: So that while he presided in the Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> and gave Allowance to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and considering the frequent intercourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, they were to be lookt on as but one Council in effect, and the Pope to have presibed therein.</p>
               <p>In the third General Council St. <hi>Cyril</hi> presided for Pope <hi>Celestin,</hi> as appears by the Letter the Pope writ to him long before he sent any other Legats to that Council: in which Letter he gives St. <hi>Cyril</hi> charge to <hi>supply his place;</hi> as is testified by <note n="a" place="margin">Evagr. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>4.</hi>

                  </note> Epistles both of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> to the Council, and of the Council to him again. In the fifth <hi>Eutychius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> sat (we confess) as Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; yet so as he acknowledg'd this priviledge due to Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and that, in effect, and by Authority, though not in person, he presided there, as those words of <hi>Eutychius</hi> his Epistle to the Pope declare, (<hi>Petimus, Praesidente nobis vestra Beatitudine,</hi> &amp;c.) which are extant at the end of the Fifth Council. In the sixth and seventh the Bishop grants, the Popes Legats presided; but addes, that the office of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratour</hi> in the Assembly was chiefly executed by <hi>Tharasius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> which, as to matter of Disputation and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Debates of the Synod, we do not deny, (it being a Greek Council, and <hi>Tharasius</hi> an eminent Greek Bishop;) but as to matter of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Command,</hi> all things were <hi>order'd</hi> by those who were really Presidents of the Assembly, that is, by the Popes Legats. I conclude therefore, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> had just ground to say, <hi>The Pope</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Concil. cap. <hi>21.</hi> §. Tertia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio.</note> 
                  <hi>hath been possest, full fifteen hundred years, of the right of Presiding in General Councils;</hi> and the Bishop was grosly mistasten in saying the <hi>Cardinal gives no proof of it, but onely his bare word;</hi> since in the very place the Bishop cites, he mentions it as prov'd elsewhere (<hi>viz. Ibid. cap</hi> 19.) where the Relatour might have found it, had he pleas'd to have turn'd to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third exception is, that the place was not <hi>Free,</hi> but either in, or too near the Popes Dominions. But certainly <hi>Trent</hi> is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Popes Dominion: and if the <hi>Lutherans</hi> had reason to require, that the Council should not be held in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Pope was
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57798:123"/>
thought too prevalent, surely the Pope, and all Catholiques with him might justly demand it should not be held in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ubi suprà.</note> were so potent. Hereupon <hi>Bellarmin</hi> well observes, that no fitter place, or more void of exceptions could have been found, then <hi>Trent,</hi> in the Confines of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> had it been left to the arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even of an infidell. As to what he sayes, that all were not call'd, who had <hi>Deliberative or Consultative Voices</hi> in the Council, he should have told us who they were, that were not call'd, in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as was necessary. Must all Bishops and Pastours have been call'd by name? It appears by the Popes Bull of <hi>Summons,</hi> that the the Invitation was as general as could be; nor can it be deny'd, but its publication in all Provinces of <hi>Christendome</hi> was as general also, as the distractions and troubles of the times would permit. How then can it be said, <hi>all were not call'd who had voice in Council?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He goes on to a fourth exception. <hi>None had Suffrage in Council, but such as were sworn to the Pope, and Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and professed enemies to all, that call'd for Reformation, and a Free Council.</hi> I answer, it is no new thing for Bishops to take an Oath of <hi>Canonical Obedience</hi> to the Pope. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> mentions it as an Ancient Custome in his <note place="margin">D. Greg. lib. <hi>10.</hi> epist. <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note> time: the objection therefore makes as much against the Ancient Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, which Protestants themselves acknowledge, as against this of <hi>Trent.</hi> However, certain it is, that the Bishops of those Primitive General Councils, were so far <hi>ty'd to Rome and the Pope</hi> by Faith and Christian Communion, that they were <hi>sworn Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> of all such Heretiques, as then respectively call'd either for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> or such a <hi>Free Council,</hi> as Protestants now do, <hi>viz.</hi> that should include all Schismatiques and Heretiques whatsoever, profef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the name of Christ. Again, the Oath which the Bishops usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take, does not at all deprive them of the liberty of their Suffrage: nay it doth not so much as oblige them not to <hi>proceed,</hi> and <hi>vote</hi> even against the Pope himself, if they see just cause; but onely <hi>that they will be obedient to him, so long as he commands things suitable to the will of God, and the Sacred Canons of the Church.</hi> Neither were the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants otherwise <hi>pronounced Heretiques</hi> by the Pope, then in pursuance of the Canons of the Church, which required him so to do; and of the Decrees of General Councils, which had already condemnd their opinions for Heresie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His last exception is against the small number of Bishops, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Council: and in the first place he mentions the Greeks; whom he takes to have been unjustly excluded. But I answer first, the Pope by his Bull call'd all that had <hi>right</hi> to come, <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 2.</note> making no exclusive mention of any. Secondly, the Greeks by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their notorious Schisme, had excluded themselves, and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) durst not venture to come, as knowing, that the Orthodox Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops at <hi>Trent</hi> would have withstood their admission: it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd, that no known Heretique or Schismatique, hath right, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then by special leave, or permission, to sit in Council. Those <hi>Greeks,</hi> whose names are found among the Subscribers of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, were Orthodox Bishops of the Greek Church, not purposely made and sent thither by the Pope, (as the Relatour surmizes) but expell'd,

and by force kept out of their Seas by those who had wrongfully usurp'd them; and these assisted at the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in their <hi>own right,</hi> viz. as Catholique Bishops of the Greek Church. Neither needed they any particular <hi>sending</hi> from the Greeks, as the case then stood, and still continues; 'tis sufficient they were call'd by the Pope, and had <hi>right</hi> of assisting in the Council, as true Bishops of the Greek Church.</p>
               <p>We are told again, that in many Sessions of this Council <hi>there were scarceten Archbishops present,</hi> and not above <hi>forty or fifty Bishops;</hi> and for <hi>the west nearer home, it reckon'd</hi> no more then <hi>one English, viz.</hi> the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph.</hi> I answer, many more were both call'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; who likewise came long before the end of the Council, and confirm'd by their Suffrage what had passed before their coming: which was sufficient. Concerning those of our Countrey, the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour seems not to have been so well vers'd in the Acts of the Council, as he might have been; otherwise he would have found, beside the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph, Richard Pate Bishop of Worcester</hi> present, in the sixth Session of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> He is also said to have been there at the very first opening of the Council; and is mention'd both in the thirteenth Session, and divers others.</p>
               <p>As for his Authority, or Right, to sit there, being not sent, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, by the English Church, we answer, such Mission, or Deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not of <hi>absolute necessity,</hi> but onely of <hi>Canonical Provision,</hi> when time, and state of the Countries, whence Bishops are sent, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: in other cases it sufficeth, they be called by the Pope. Now 'tis undeniable, that for some years before the Council ended, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Bishops that should have sent their Deputies to accompany these forementioned Bishops to the Council, were restrain'd in prison by Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The Bishop therefore being so apt to mistake in the Affairs of his own countrey, we cannot give much credit to him, in what he affirms either of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi> It sufficeth, that in diverse Sessions of this Council, many Bishops of both these Nations were present; and might have been in all the rest, had the particular affairs of their own Countries permitted them. The impediment was not on the Councils part; and consequently their absence could be no just prejudice to the Authority, Legality, or Liberty of it: and in the latter Sessions (wherein all that had been formerly Defin'd by the Council, was <hi>de novo</hi> confirm'd and ratify'd by the unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all the Prelats) 'tis manifest the Council was so <hi>full,</hi> that in number of Bishops it clearly exceeded some of the first four Councils, which even our Adversaries themselves account General.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The whole matter therefore duly consider'd, <hi>A. C.</hi> wanted not <note place="margin">§. 28. n. 1.</note> reason to tell the Bishop, that nothing could be pretended by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which might not in effect have been as justly objected by the <hi>Arians</hi> against the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> But to this the Bishop will by no means yield; telling us, <hi>the case is not alike</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the said Councils, and endeavouring to shew the Disparity in diverse respects. First, saith he, the Bishops of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council <hi>professed, not to depart from Scripture,</hi> but engaged to prove what they defin'd, <hi>by many testimonies</hi> thereof; whereas the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> (as
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57798:124"/>
the Relatour affirms) <hi>concluded many things simply EXTRA, out of all bound of Scripture,</hi> leaving <hi>both its Letter and sense.</hi> I answer, the Arians objected the same to the <hi>Nicen</hi> Fathers, namely that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded things both <hi>beside</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> to Scripture; they alledged Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for their Heresie, they said in effect to the Father's then, what the Bishop and his party say to us now, <hi>we are sure, and we are able to prove, that the Council of (Nice) had not Scripture for them.</hi> There is therefore no such <hi>disparity</hi> between them, as the Bishop pretends. The truth is, both these Councils had <hi>the Scripture</hi> for their <hi>rule,</hi> and proved by it the Doctrine they Defined; but neither of them hold it for their <hi>onely rule,</hi> or so made use of it, as to reject Tradition; for which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it self is admitted. In confirmation of which <hi>Theodoret</hi> expresly <note place="margin">Theod. Hist. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> sayes, that in condemning the Arian Heresie <hi>the Council of Nice groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it self upon Tradition:</hi> not but that many Testimonies of Scripture were rightly urg'd by the Bishops of that Council against <hi>Arius,</hi> but because Tradition was the principal thing, that was clear and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable on the Councils side; the Arians, partly by their <hi>private</hi> and <hi>subtle</hi> Interpretations eluding the force of many Texts, which Catholiques brought against them, and partly alledging not a few Texts for their own opinion, against the Catholique Doctrine.</p>
               <p>As to what he addes in the Margent, that the whole Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that <hi>Scripture was against the Arians, and agreeing with the Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> but that the like consent is not, that Scripture is <hi>for the Council of Trent,</hi> and <hi>against Protestants;</hi> We answer, the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the whole Church, both is, and was, when Protestants first began, that either Scripture or Apostolical Tradition (which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to it) was for the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and against Protestants. Is it not evident (to go no further back then the Year 1500.) that all the visible Hierarchical Congregations of Christians in the World had Mass, used Prayer for the Dead, invoked the Saints, reverenced Holy Images and Reliques, believed Purgatory, the Real Presence of Christs Body in the Holy Eucharist, and generally acknowledg'd all other Sacraments, declar'd for such by the said Council? As yet therefore there appears no Disparity between the Councils of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Nice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he tells us, the consent of the whole Church was, that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture stood for the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> against the <hi>Arians,</hi> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it to have done for the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> To omit, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop proves not his Assertion (which therefore may as easily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd as he affirms it, if we extend nor the Church beyond its due li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits) can it be said, the consent of the whole Church was, that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture stood for the same Council in all that they defin'd to be Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal? Had they Scripture for the condemnation of the <hi>Quarto-decimani</hi> and Rebaptizers; both which the said Council condemn'd together with the Arians? If our Adversaries cannot shew us the particular Texts of Scripture, by which the Council confuted these Heresies, will it not be manifest, they did it by sole Tradition.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Relatour having insinuated, that <hi>the Pope made Bishops pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely for his side,</hi> does here disclaim it upon this account, <hi>that none can</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 29. num. 1</note> 
                  <hi>know the Popes intention but God, who is the Surveyour of the heart.</hi> Is
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57798:125"/>
not this to be religiously impertinent; first to possess his Reader with a strong presumption of the Popes corrupt Designe, and then to come no better off, then by saying, he could not see the secrets of his heart? But he will have it, that there were valuable Presumptions of making Bishops purposely to maintain his party: I answer, the Bishop should not have put us off with <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands,</hi> in that whereon he grounds an Accusation of so great importance, but have sufficiently prov'd, that there was <hi>de facto</hi> an extraordinary creation of Supernumerary and meerly <hi>Titular</hi> Bishops, made about that time, and sent to the Council to serve the Popes designs; which we deny to have been done.</p>
               <p>Secondly his pretence, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> could be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge in matters of Religion, because <hi>the Pope had made himself a strong party in it,</hi> is disprov'd by the very Argument he brings to assert it, <hi>viz.</hi> the multitude of <hi>Italian</hi> Prelats. For who knows not, that the <hi>Italians</hi> are more divided in point of Interest and Dependence, then any other Nation in Christendome, by reason of the many So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Principalities and States, into which <hi>Italy</hi> is divided? Though therefore we should surmize, that the <hi>Italian</hi> Prelats in this Council were not guided by true principles of piety, yet surely there is little reason to think, they should combine with the Pope to serve his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; which in all probability would not suit so well with their own, or Princes Interest, on whom themselves, and hope of advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depended. This Argument therefore hath so much in it of the <hi>Chimaera,</hi> that certainly no solid judgement will esteeme it consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>To what the Relatour sayes touching the number of Bishops in the <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 2.</note> said Council, that there were in it <hi>a hundred and four Italian Bishops, more then of all the rest of Christendome.</hi> I answer first, that having viewed the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> with some diligence, I cannot reconcile the numbers there set down, with what is here avouched to be taken thence. Secondly supposing his computation true, what do's it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice our cause? 'Tis manifest, the farre greater number of <hi>Italian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were of the Domions of other Princes, and had not the least shadow of any Temporal Dependance on the Pope; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no <hi>stricter tye</hi> upon them, to serve his Interests, then all the rest of the Bishops in that Council. The reason, why there might be more Bishops of <hi>Italy,</hi> then other places, is evident, in regard that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was in a far more <hi>quiet</hi> condition, then either <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> which at that time, were both infected with Heresie, and imbroiled in Civil Wars; so that the chief Pastours of those Provinces, could not so well be spared from their Charge, as these of <hi>Italy:</hi> and for other Countries, no wonder if they were thinner, as being more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. To which I might adde, that there are more Bishopricks in <hi>Italy,</hi> then in any Nation of <hi>Christendome,</hi> of no greater extent. Now these concurring reasons might well increase the number of <hi>Italian</hi> Bishops, without any such Design, as Protestants, and the Relatour here rashly surmizes.</p>
               <p>Again, what private <hi>Interest had the Pope to look to</hi> at the Council of <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Trent,</hi> which was not common to him, with all the Bishops in that Council; nay indeed, with all the Catholique Bishops of <hi>Christendom?</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:57798:125"/>
Was it not the Interest of all the Bishops in Christendome (except those of the new stamp) to keep Heresie out of their respective Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses and Provinces? Was it not their Interest to preserve the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Canons, and the <hi>free Exercise</hi> of Ecclesiastical Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction? What other Interest, but this and the like, had the Pope to prosecute in the Council?</p>
               <p>But the Relatour urges this Disparity between the Councils of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Nice,</hi> viz. that at <hi>the same time</hi> the Council sate at <hi>Nice,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Pope <hi>Sylvester</hi> held a Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> in which he, with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred seventy five Bishops of the West, <hi>confirm'd the Nicen Creed,</hi> and Anathematiz'd all those, <hi>who should dare to dissolve the Definition of that Holy and Great Council:</hi> whereas no such thing was done by the Greek Church, to confirm the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> This, we confess, is some <hi>Disparity,</hi> but very little to the purpose: for though it happen'd, that this was done <hi>de facto</hi> in confirmation of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Definitions, yet had they not been of less Authority without such an Accessory As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, provided the Pope had ratify'd them in such manner, as he did the Decisions of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Did ever any of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> attribute the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, to the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given it by these <hi>Western</hi> Bishops? surely no.</p>
               <p>Neither was this <hi>Roman</hi> Synod held <hi>at the same time</hi> with the Concil of <hi>Nice,</hi> (as the Relatour, to amuze his Reader, pretends) but after it, as the Acts themselves testifie. Nor was the like done in other General Councils, admitted by Protestants; who cannot therefore in reason make this objection against the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Lastly, the Doctrine of Faith declared by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally receiv'd by the whole Catholique Church; which was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation incomparably greater then that of two hundred seventy five Bishops: and the same Faith hath been far more constantly held ever since; none of the Catholique Provinces of <hi>Christendom,</hi> represented in that Council, ever deserting the Faith there declar'd: whereas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Provinces either in whole or part, deserted the Faith defin'd at <hi>Nice,</hi> and embraced the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Here, for want of solid reasons, the Bishop falls again to his sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes; <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 4.</note> by which he would fain insinuate to his credulous Reader, that the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> were so aw'd by the Popes Authority, or sway'd by his Interest, that either they durst not, or would not open themselves so farre as to speak freely what they thought. What is this but an empty and injurious suspicion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an unworthy accusation of so many grave Prelats assembled in Council? A little more of Christian charity might have taught his Lordship to frame a far different judgement, and believe, that so many worthy Prelats would not be neglectful of their charge, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of their conscience: especially seeing the Pope had fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his desire, that the matters in Controversie might receive a free and fair Dispute in the Council, in order to a Settlement of the Truth.</p>
               <p>To put a period therefore to this long and groundless Dream of the Popes <hi>strong party,</hi> and <hi>the Bishops-being over-aw'd</hi> in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> I conclude, that seeing none of the Fathers there assembled, no
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57798:126"/>
not any of those who liv'd either under the wing of Protestant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or where <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> was allowed, ever sided with Protestants, but constantly and zealously persever'd, even till death, in the Faith and Doctrine they had subscribed in that Council, and shew'd themselves solicitous, that all its Definitions should be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally held by their people, no Evidence can possibly be given of any <hi>Free Consent,</hi> or <hi>Vote</hi> in Council, if this may be call'd in question.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Touching <hi>HIEREMIAS,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> you must know, that some Eminent Protestants of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Party, about the end of the last Century, endeavour'd to feel the Pulse of the Greek Church, to see if they could there finde any <hi>Symptoms</hi> of their own Disease. The design was to close with the Greeks, for the better making out of the pretended perpetual Succession of their Church: which Project they so hotly pursu'd, (though formerly in vain attempted) that they would not desist, till (the Patriarch being settled in his Throne) they had sent to him the summe of their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Belief; drawn up according to the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confession, which had been compos'd by <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and approv'd by their Patriarch, <hi>Luther.</hi> After a long intercourse of Letters, Answers, and Replyes, mutually continued for some years, and all arguments us'd, that might induce the Patriarch to receive them into his Communion, he could not be courted to so much as the least shew of approving their doctrine; but did in all his Answers clearly confirm the Tenets of the <hi>Roman-Catholique</hi> Church, which those <hi>Lutherans</hi> endeavour'd to overthrow. Insomuch that at last the Patriarch tyred with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, gave them a rebuke for their <hi>departure from the Doctrine of the Catholique Church,</hi> and desir'd them not to trouble him any more with their writings. All this is more largely related by <note n="a" place="margin">Spondan. Continuat. Baron. ad Ann. <hi>1574.</hi> num. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Spondanus,</hi> out of the writings of those very <hi>Protestants,</hi> that treated with the Patriarch in the business.</p>
               <p>Neither can the Censure passed by this Patriarch upon the <hi>Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> errours be accounted rash or precipitate; seeing they had a <hi>full Hearing</hi> by him they had made their address to: who was not onely the chief Patriarch of the Greeks, but a person of that eminent Esteem among them, that his Censure must in reason be taken to declare the sense of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. Nor matters it that Catholiques account him a <hi>Shismatique:</hi> this cannot prejudice his Censure in reference to Protestants. He was such a <hi>Schismatique,</hi> as they would gladly have made Patron of their Religion.</p>
               <p>The Bishop therefore, by giving no other Answer to this Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs-proceeding against <hi>Protestants,</hi> but that <hi>he findes not this Censure of Hieremias warranted by any Authority of the Greek Church,</hi> shews he had very little to say in opposition to it. Was not this <hi>Hieremias</hi> chief Patriarch of the Greek Church? Doth not he write in a style <hi>Definitive</hi> and peremptory, touching the matters debated between him and Protestants? Does he not upon all occasions testifie the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he declares, to be the Doctrine of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> of the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> and of the <hi>Sacred Councils?</hi> Did any of the Greek Bishops ever disclaim the said Doctrine, either in whole or part; as
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57798:126"/>
they disclaim'd the Doctrine of one of his successours, whom they depos'd and ejected as an Heretique, because his Tenets savour'd of the Protestant Leaven? who then can doubt, but what he delivers is the common Belief of the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Church? as is likewise in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect acknowledg'd by the Interessed <hi>Lutherans</hi> themselves, in their <hi>Acta Theologorum Wittenbergensium,</hi> &amp;c. publisht after the Treaty end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more expresly by some <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Sir</hi> Edwin Sands <hi>his</hi> Europae Speculum.</note> English Writers.</p>
               <p>Well therefore might <hi>A. C.</hi> affirm, <hi>without making himself a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> that if ever such <hi>a Free Council,</hi> as the Relatour seem'd to wish, were gather'd out of the East and West Provinces of Christendom, <note place="margin">Ross <hi>his</hi> Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebia.

                  <hi>Protestants would doubtless be condemn'd for Heretiques.</hi> For this is not to <hi>Prophesie,</hi> but to discourse, and draw a <hi>Certain</hi> Conclusion out of Principles morally Evident; that is to say, if the <hi>French, Spanish, and Schismatical Greeks also,</hi> in their respective Churches, do teach and profess, as matter of Catholique Faith, Doctrine Diametrally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to that of <hi>Protestants,</hi> no man can doubt but, (had, or were, they met in a General Council, to declare their said Belief) they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly condemn <hi>Protestantisme,</hi> no less then did this Patriarch <hi>Hieremias.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. THe Bishop having cast as much dirt as he was able, upon the <note place="margin">§. 30.</note> Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> wishes in <hi>fine,</hi> that a lawful General Council were called, to end Controversies. A pure one, you may
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57798:127"/>
be sure, if according to his wish: who, bearing himself very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon the impossibility of assembling such a Council as he would call <hi>General,</hi> sayes (as it were to insinuate an unwillingness on our part to have Controversies ended in so fair a way, as by a General Council) <hi>If you have a most gracious King inclined unto it, how can you acquit your selves, if you do not consent?</hi> As though, forsooth, there were no more requir'd to the assembling of a General Council, then the Kings inclination, and the English Catholiques consent. Is not this a gross delusion?</p>
               <p>He tells us for a wonder, <hi>That A. C. marvels, what kinde of General Council he would have, and what Rules observed in it, that were Morally like to make an End of Controversies, better then our Catholique General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</hi> Was this to express any backwardness to a lawfull General Council? or could any thing be more reasonably demanded of him? Could the Relatour expect an End of Contention between us by means of a General Council, unless the <hi>Conditions</hi> and <hi>Rules,</hi> by which the said Council should proceed, were first known, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to by both parties? Are not <hi>Protestants</hi> themselves a sufficient proof of the Negative, in their Cavillings against the Authority and Proceedings in the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> But what <hi>particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> or <hi>Rules,</hi> for the legitimating of a future General Council, could he assign, which had not been competently observ'd in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer General Councils; nay even in that of <hi>Trent?</hi> whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Decrees nevertheless the Bishop, with the whole party, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rejects.</p>
               <p>As to his profession, <hi>that any General Council shall satisfie him, that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>is called, continued; and ended according to the same course, and under the same conditions, which General Councils observ'd in the Primitive Church,</hi> it is too general to be ingenuous, or give real satisfaction to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; signifying nothing at all in relation to a finall End of our Controversies: seeing Catholiques hold those general conditions, as much as the Bishop, or any of their opposers; and yet our Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are still the same, as to particulars. To as little purpose (save onely to deceive the Reader) cites he <note n="a" place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Concil. cap. <hi>17. §. 2.</hi>
                  </note> the Latin Text of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his Margent, as though he concurr'd with him in the requisite conditions of a General Council: whereas by those conditions are clearly excluded all Excommunicated Bishops, Heretiques and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques, from being any necessary part of a General Council.</p>
               <p>But to come yet closer to the point; who should call this his <hi>wished</hi> General Council? If we follow the example of those most Ancient Councils, which himself acknowledges for General and lawfully called, then the Pope must be the Summoner of it, or at least the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with the Popes consent: in both which cases we are not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, with what contempt the Protestant party would look upon such a Council; especially if it insisted in the steps of those Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Councils, in which the Pope (as we have <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 19.</note> shewn) presided. To call therefore for a General Council, in the Protestants sense, is a meer nothing, an empty name to amuse silly people with: since, morally speaking, 'tis impossible there should ever be such a General Council, as they fancy to themselves, <hi>viz.</hi> an Oecumenical Council, that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57798:127"/>
should consist as well of Schismatiques, Heretiques, and Desertors of the Catholique Church, as of true Catholique Bishops. But if it were never thought reasonable in a Civil Commonwealth (which yet the Bishop makes the pattern of his Spiritual one in point of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) that Out-Laws and condemned persons should be admitted to sit with their Lawful Judges, to determine whether they were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents or not, how instantly soever they might demand it, how can it be thought to stand with any colour of Reason, that Spiritual Out-Laws and Desertors of the Catholique Church, that maintain many anciently condemned Heresies, should be admitted to Sit and Vote in Council among their Lawful Judges, whether they were guilty or not? What Rebel would ever be found. Criminial, if he might be allow'd to be his own Judge?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> to shew the Bishop, to how little purpose he called for a General Council, asked him, <hi>Whether he thought a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Council might erre,</hi> viz. in its Decisions and Determinations of Faith. To which the Relatour having answer'd in the Affirmative, that <hi>it might erre,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> thus further Queried. <hi>If a General Council may erre, what nearer are we to Unity, after a General Council hath determined.</hi> What the Bishop reply'd to this, I shall not deliver out of the mouth of either Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> or <hi>A. C.</hi> because he quarrels with them, though to little purpose, touching the precise words he used in the Conference; wherein his memory might as well fail him as the other: You shall have them from his own pen, upon more mature deliberation. But first hear how he disputes <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> touching Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> first Querie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether</hi> (sayes he) <hi>a General Council may erre or not is a question of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 32. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>great consequence in the Church of Christ.</hi> To say it cannot erre, <hi>leaves the Church without remedy against an errour once determined.</hi> To say it can erre, <hi>seems to expose the members of the Church to an uncertainty and wavering in Faith, to make unquiet Spirits not onely disrespect former Councils of the Church, but to slight and contemn whatsoever it may now determine.</hi> To each member of this discourse I answer thus in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. To <hi>say,</hi> and but meerly to <hi>say</hi> it without good proof, <hi>that a General Council cannot erre,</hi> may leave the Church indeed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against an errour: But to <hi>say</hi> it cannot erre, and <hi>prove</hi> it too, both from Reason, Authority, and Gods Word, as Catholiques do, is so far from leaving the Church without remedy against an errour; that it secures all the adhering members thereof from erring in any matter of Faith. Now for the latter branch, or member, <hi>To say it can erre</hi> does not onely <hi>seem to expose</hi> (as the Bishop hath it) but does actually expose and abandon all the Adherents of that opinion, to an inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table wavering and uncertainty in Faith, and makes them utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn all former and future Councils, when ever they determine any thing contrary to these mens fancies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now to Mr.</hi> Fishers <hi>second Querie,</hi> wherein are we nearer to Unity, if a <note place="margin">Ibid. num. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> .</note> General Council may erre, <hi>the Bishop thus positively answers,</hi> The Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a General Council erring is to stand in force, and to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal obedience at least yielded to it, till evidence of Scripture, or a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration to the contrary, make the errour appear, and until thereupon another
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57798:128"/>
                  <hi>Council of equal Authority do reverse it.</hi> Is not this a strange (not to say an impious) doctrine, to be advanc'd without Authority either of Gods Word, or of Antiquity, nay contrary to all solid Reason; that men should be tyed up by an Erring Conciliary Decision in points of Divine Truth, against Evidence of Scripture, or a Demonstration of the Errour? For till thereupon another Council of Equal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity reverse it, the errour is still to be submitted to by all men, <hi>even when they know it.</hi> This indeed is a rare effect of a General Council, to oblige all the members of the Church <hi>to Unity in Errour,</hi> against Scripture and Demonstration, during their whole lives, or rather to the worlds end; since such an <hi>Utopian</hi> rectifying Council as the Bishop here fancies, is morally impossible ever to be had, as I have already shewn.</p>
               <p>And to mend the matter, that is, to make us still at a greater loss, this pretended reforming Council must be one of <hi>Equal Authority</hi> with the supposed Erring Council that preceded: this being a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition expresly requir'd by the Bishop. Now since Protestants do not hold all General Councils to be of <hi>Equal Authority,</hi> who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, or how shall men satisfie themselves, whether the Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Imaginary General Council be of <hi>Equal Authority</hi> with the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? The Bishop gives us no light in this particular, but leaves us to grope in the dark.</p>
               <p>But let us indulge so much to our Adversary, as to suppose such a Council met as the Bishop would have, General and of Equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; yet <hi>Maldonats</hi> Argument, (which the Relatour allowes for <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 2.</note> a <hi>shrewd</hi> one) evinces clearly, that by this way we should never have a certain end of Controversies: since to try whether any point of Faith were decreed according to Gods word, there would need an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Council, and then another to try that, and so in <hi>infinitum.</hi> The result of which would be, that our Faith should never have whereon to settle or rest it self. To this the Bishop answers, that <hi>no General Council, lawfully called and so proceeding, can be questioned in another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Evident Scripture or a Demonstration appear against it;</hi> and therefore we need not <hi>fear proceeding IN INFINITUM:</hi> which is either as ambiguous as the rest, or inconsonant to his own Doctrine touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a General Council; which he sayes cannot <hi>easily erre</hi> in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Verity. But this is neither to exclude <hi>possibility,</hi> nor <hi>fear</hi> of erring, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi> possibly it may erre <hi>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> .</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Bishop sayes, <hi>I might have returned upon you again, If a General Council, not confirmed by the Pope, may erre (which you affirm)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>to what end, then a General Council?</hi> He tells us, we may say <hi>yes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Pope, as Head of the Church, cannot erre. Thus the Relatour makes a simple answer for us, and then Triumphs in the Confutation of his own Answer. But let this piece of Disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity pass: and let us examine, how uncandidly he imposes both on us and his Reader, while he insinuates to him, that we hold for a point of Catholique Faith, that the Pope alone, as Head of the Church, is unerrable in his Doctrinal Decisions: which is but an opinion of particular Doctours, and no man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to believe it as a point of Faith. We need not therefore make
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57798:128"/>
such a ridiculous answer, as the Bishop does for us, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council is necessary, because the Pope, as Head of the Church, cannot erre: but rather the contrary, That a General Council is needfull, because it is not <hi>De fide,</hi> or receiv'd for a point of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Faith, that the Pope can decide inerrably without a General Council; as all Catholiques unanimously believe, he <hi>ever</hi> does, when he defines with it. What's now become of his Lordships brag of retorting upon us?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the Bishop, foreseeing as it were a Volley of Arguments probably to be discharg'd against him upon account of this his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour-retaining Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Determinations of a General Council erring is to stand in force against Evidence of Scripture or Demonstration to the contrary, till thereupon another Council of Equal Authority reverse it, seeks his defence at last under the Covert of these restrictive expressions, <hi>If the Errour be not manifestly against</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Fundamental Verity,</hi> and, unless it (the Council) erre <hi>manifestly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably.</hi> In which cases you may see, the Relatour holds it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to oppose the determination of a General Council. Now what is this but by seeking to solve one absurdity, to fall into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as great? <hi>viz.</hi> to leave not onely his Friends still more in the dark, (while he neither determines what points of Faith are <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi> nor what Errours in particular are manifestly against <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Verity,</hi> nor what <hi>manifestly intolerable</hi>) but opens a wide gate to all Phanatique and unquiet Spirits (who never want Evident Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for what they fancy) to exclaim (as warranted by the Bishop) against the Church and her Councils for teaching errours manifestly against Fundamental Verity, or manifestly intolerable: in both which cases they may, with the Relatours license, spurn against all Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Authority.</p>
               <p>By this you may easily discern upon how Sandy a Foundation the Bishop has built up his ruinous Doctrine touching the Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of General Councils; whose Authority he endeavours to Square by the Rule of Civil Courts, never reflecting on the vast Disparity there is between the Government of the Church in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Administration of the Civil Affairs of a Kingdom, or Commonwealth. The former is principally exercis'd in Teaching, Declaring, and Authoritatively Attesting Christian Faith, which must of necessity be alwayes <hi>one and the same:</hi> whereas the chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Civil Government are matters in their own nature variable, and changing according to Circumstances of Time, Person, Place, &amp;c. So that what is prudently resolved and Decreed by a Parliament now, may in a short revolution of time be found inexpedient in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the publick good, and necessary to be repealed: which can never happen in Decisions of Faith.</p>
               <p>The truth of this is evident, even from the Penalties imposed by these different Courts; the Civil one never inflicting on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringers any more then a Temporary External punishment, Corporal, or Pecuniary: whereas the Spiritual, <hi>viz.</hi> a General Council, layes an Eternal Curse on the Dis-believers of their Decisions. Witness the first Four General, acknowledg'd for such by Protestants: which,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57798:129"/>
were they fallible, as the Bishop contends they are, would be the greatest tyranny (not to say <hi>Impiety</hi>) imaginable. Most imprudently therefore did the Bishop, in labouring to Square a General Council by the Rule of Civil Courts, against Catholique Doctrine. 'Tis true, some particular <hi>Simile</hi> may be drawn from Parliaments against him: not, for him.</p>
               <p>But the Bishop has another help at a dead lift, wherein all pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reformers and their Adherents are very deeply concern'd: which is, that <hi>National, or Provincial Councils may reform for themselves</hi> in case of <hi>manifest and intolerable errour, if the whole Church (upon peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>and just complaint</hi> of this errour) <hi>neglect, or refuse to call a Council and examine it.</hi> Sure the Bishop had very ill luck, or a bad cause to maintain, otherwise he could never have spoken so many inter-clash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ambiguities, in so little a Compass as he does. For first, he leaves us to divine what those Errours are, which we must esteem <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.</hi> Secondly, he forgets to tell us, whither we should repair to be ascertain'd of the <hi>Intolerableness</hi> of the Errour; unless he would have have every man follow herein the Dictate of his own private judgement. Thirdly he dismisseth us uninstructed, how to make a <hi>just and peaceable complaint</hi> to the whole Church: whither are we to repair to finde the whole Church, or its Representative; while, as is supposed, there's no General Council yet in being. Fourthly he leaves us wholly to guess how long we are to expect the whole Churches pleasure in point of calling a Council, till her forbearance therein may be interpreted a <hi>Neglect,</hi> or <hi>Refusal</hi> to do it. Fifthly he scores us out no way, how we should go to work to obtain the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Concurrence of all Christian Princes, to the actual Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of this new model'd Council. It would be too long to point out all the inextricable Difficulties, that attend this uncanonical way of proceeding in Religion, recommended by the Bishop. A Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, so far from being a <hi>Remedy</hi> against the pretended <hi>intolerable</hi> failings of a former General Council (upon supposition of the whole Churches <hi>neglect or refusal</hi> to <hi>call a Council</hi> and <hi>examin them</hi>) that it is highly instrumental to Division both in Church and State; giving as good title, if not better, to any new Body of Sectaries to reform Protestantism, when they get power into their hands, as it did to <hi>Protestants</hi> to <hi>reform for themselves,</hi> against the whole Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. However the Bishop still goes on, harping upon the same string; and in lieu of giving us solid Arguments to evince the Truth of what he would perswade, <hi>viz.</hi> that his opinion touching a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils possibility of erring in points of Faith, is most <hi>preservative of peace established, or ablest to reduce perfect Unity into the Church.,</hi> he falls <note place="margin">§. 33.</note> into a tedious discourse, which he sayes he will <hi>adventure into the world but onely in the nature of a Consideration,</hi> which yet he divides into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; entring upon the First with Two very erroneous Suppositions; which he layes for the foundation of a tottering Superstructure. The one, that the Government of the Church is no further Monarchical, then <hi>as Christ is the Head.</hi> The other, that <hi>all the Power an Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Consid. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Council hath to determine, and all the Assistance</hi> it <hi>hath not to erre in its Determination, it hath it all from the Universal Body of the Church;</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:57798:129"/>
because the Representative of a Commonwealth hath no more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then what it receives from the Body it represents.</p>
               <p>The first of these, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Church is not governed by one in chief, under Christ, is a supposition <note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 17, 18.</note> more then once confuted. To the second, (which we have already impugned above) we further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that the Power and Assistance, which General Councils have <hi>to determine</hi> Controversies of Faith, so as <hi>not to erre in the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> cannot possibly be communicated to them by the Church, but must chiefly proceed from the same Fountain now, it did in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Direction of the Holy Ghost: This Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual power for the government of the Church, being not of <hi>Humane,</hi> but <hi>Divine</hi> Institution: nor proceeding so much from the Natural Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Knowledge, Vertue, and Abilities of the Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours assembled in Council, as from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation <note n="*" place="margin">Note, that we assert not any <hi>New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> since the Apostles times; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Assistance of the Holy Spirit, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the further Explanation and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these already deliver'd.</note> of the Holy Spirit with them. Whereas in a Civil Commonwealth (which is of <hi>Humane</hi> Institution) its representative cannot pretend to any other Power, then what is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the said Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Bishop considers, <hi>that though the Act, that is ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Consid. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>out by many together, must needs be perfecter, then that which is but the childe of one mans sufficiency, yet this cannot be Infallible, unless it be from some special Assistance of the Holy Ghost.</hi> This we no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict: but adde, that this <hi>special Assistance</hi> of the holy Ghost is so far ever afforded to a Lawful General Council, as to render all its compleated Definitions of Faith, Infallible.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thirdly, he considers, that <hi>the Assistance of the Holy Ghost is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Consid. 3. Num. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>without errour: that</hi> (sayes he) <hi>is no question; and as little, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil hath it. But the doubt that troubles, is, whether all Assistance of the Holy Ghost be afforded in such an high manner, as to cause all the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of a Council, in <hi>matters Fundamental in the Faith and in remote De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions from it, to be alike Infallible.</hi> By this expression <hi>alike Infallible,</hi> the Bishop seems to grant, that all the Definitions of a General Council, even in <hi>Deductions</hi> as well as <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> are Infallible, and onely to doubt whether they be <hi>alike</hi> Infallible. I see no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of graduating Infallibility in the present question; since any real Infallibility is as much as Catholique Authors assert in all Decisions of Faith, be they Fundamental, or <hi>remote Deductions</hi> in the Bishops sense: seeing, that as to our obligation of believing them, they are alike Fundamental, as we have prov'd in the second Chapter.</p>
               <p>Here the Bishop intends to examine the Texts, which he sayes <hi>Stapleton rests upon</hi> for proof of <hi>Infallible Assistance</hi> afforded to General <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Councils, <hi>viz.</hi> John 16. 13. <hi>I will send you the Spirit of Truth, which will lead you into all Truth.</hi> And John 14. 16. <hi>This Spirit shall abide with you for ever.</hi> And Matth. 28. 20. <hi>Behold I am with you to the end of the world.</hi> Likewise these, which he sayes are <hi>added by others,</hi> viz. <hi>The Founding the Church upon the Rock, against which the Gates of Hell shall not prevail,</hi> Matth. 16. 18. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32. Christs Prayer for St. <hi>Peter, that his Faith fail not;</hi> and Christs promise, Mat. 18 20. <hi>That where two or three are gathered together in his Name, he will be in</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:57798:130"/>
                  <hi>the midst of them.</hi> And that in the Acts, (chap. 15. 28.) <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us.</hi> A man would imagine these Texts sufficiently clear in themselves, to evince the Truth of the Catholick Assertion touching General Councils; but the Bishop is partly of another minde, affirming, that <hi>no one of them does infer, much less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Infallibility.</hi> He was loath to say <hi>all of them together</hi> did not. But let us hear how he quarrels them in particular.</p>
               <p>To the first, which speaks of <hi>leading into all Truth,</hi> and <hi>that for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>ever,</hi> he answers <hi>ALL is not alwayes universally taken in Scripture; nor is it here simply for All Truth; but for ALL TRUTH absolutely necessary to Salvation.</hi> I reply, neither do we averre, that it is here <hi>universally</hi> taken, or doth signifie <hi>simply all Truth,</hi> (for then it would comprehend all natural Truth, and matter of Fact, which we deny no less then the Bishop) but that it signifies <hi>all Truth</hi> necessary for the Apostles and their Successors to know, for the Instruction and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, whether expressed, or but infolded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or Tradition.</p>
               <p>As to his limiting the words to Truths <hi>absolutely necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we say, this is but <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and a meer groundless restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, depending wholly on the Bishops voluntary assertion, as we have already <note n="a" place="margin">Ch. 14.</note> shewn. It is also clearly refuted by the Context, (<hi>vers.</hi> 12.) where our Saviour having told his Disciples, he had <hi>many things to say to them,</hi> which <hi>they could not then bear,</hi> addes immediately, as it were, by way of Supplement to their present weakness, the forecited words, that <hi>when the Spirit of Truth should come, he would guide them into all Truth;</hi> that is, into all those Truths, which Christ had to <hi>say</hi> to them, and which they were not as yet in a capacity to <hi>bear.</hi> But can any man imagine, Christ had not already instructed his Apostles touching all points <hi>absolutely necessary to Salvation;</hi> especially, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what himself professeth in his Prayer for them to the Father, John 17. 8, 14. <hi>I have given unto them the words, which thou gavest me, and they have received them, &amp;c,</hi> Can <hi>those words,</hi> in any Protestants opinion, signifie less then all points <hi>absolutely necessary to Salvation?</hi> His Lordship here stumbles in the plain way, endeavouring to impose this absurd Disjunctive upon his Reader, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>all Truth</hi> must either signifie <hi>simply All whatsoever,</hi> (matter of Fact, as well as Faith) or be restrained to <hi>Truths absolutely necessary to Salvation,</hi> that is, without which no man can in any circumstance be saved: the apparent falsity whereof a man half blinde may perceive; it being in effect to say, that either <hi>All men</hi> are wise and learned, or none but <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To as little purpose is his other limitation, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Councill is then onely Infallible, <hi>when it suffers it self to be led by the Blessed Spirit, by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>the word of God.</hi> By this again it seems that in things absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation a General Council is not <hi>absolutely</hi> Infallible, but may possibly refuse to be led by the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of God, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fall into Fundamental Errour: in which the Bishop is not constant to himself, professing the contrary, when it makes for his turn: But if it may so erre, what a sad condition might the whole Church be in; since what a General Council teaches is as obligatory
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57798:130"/>
to the whole Church, as what the Parliament enacts is obligatory to the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>His last shift, to evade the force of those words <hi>leading into All Truth,</hi> is, that the promise of <hi>Assistance</hi> was neither so <hi>absolute, nor</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>in such manner to the whole Church, as it was to the Apostles,</hi> nor <hi>directly</hi> to <hi>a Council</hi> at all. Who contends it was? who makes it a question, whether the promised <hi>Assistance</hi> of the Holy Ghost, were not more <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> intended to the Apostles then to the Church; or not more <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> to the Chureh, then to General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils? It sufficeth us, if it were in any sort <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really</hi> intended to them all: and that so it was, the very nature of the promise evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth: since otherwise, neither the said succeeding Pastours, northe Church of their times, could infallibly decide any arising Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, touching the sense of Scriptural Texts, which are not onely ambiguous, but lyable to damnable Interpretations, as the Scripture it self averrs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. much less determine any point of Faith not expresly deliver'd in Scripture, as many are not.</p>
               <p>But note, that to the closing words of this first Text <hi>and that for ever,</hi> the Bishop sayes not any thing. The truth is, their clearness is not easily eluded.</p>

                     </gap> , unto the end of the world,</hi> the Bishop answers, <hi>the Fathers are various</hi> in their Exposition and Application of this Text. We grant, they are <hi>various</hi> in words, but <hi>agreeing</hi> in sense, and that the <hi>same</hi> in effect we here plead for. The Fathers, by the Bishops own Confession, understood a <hi>presence of Aid and Assistance,</hi> to <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the weakness</hi> of the Apostles and their Successours, <hi>against the Difficulties they should finde</hi> for <hi>preaching Christ.</hi> But are Heresies and the perverse maintainers of them, no part <hi>of the Difficulties,</hi> Christs Ministers meet with in preaching his Gospel? Sure they are. And if this be the <hi>Native sense</hi> of the words, as 'tis in the Relatours opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; it follows necessarily, that the said Ministers, or Preachers of the Gospel have such a <hi>presence</hi> of Christ promis'd them in this place, as effectually inables them to withstand and overcome those Difficulties; which, in reason cannot be more conveniently effected, then by a General Council <hi>so assisted, Declaring against them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, sayes our Adversary, <hi>few of the Fathers mention Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>in Teaching by the Holy Ghost.</hi> What matters that? The reason is, because this is but one <hi>Special</hi> kinde of presence: and the Fathers usually in their expositions of Scripture (unless some particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion carries them to the contrary) content themselves to express the general importance of the Sacred Text, without descending to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. And yet some of them (as even the Bishop himself observes) do expresly interpret this place of Christs presence <hi>in teaching by the Holy Ghost.</hi> But <hi>they do not extend it</hi> (saith he) to <hi>Infallible Assistance, further then the Succeeding Church keeps to the word of the Apostles,</hi> as <hi>the Apostles kept to the guidance of the Spirit.</hi> No more do we. We confess, the Succeeding Church could not be Infallible, should it depart from, or teach contrary to <hi>the word of the Apostles,</hi> no more then the Apostles themselves could have been Infallible, had they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57798:131"/>
from the guidance of the Spirit. But as the Infallibility of the Apostles consisted in their constant adhering to and following the guidance of that Holy Spirit, in all matters concerning Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, so is there, and the Fathers teach, such a <hi>presence</hi> of Christ with the <hi>Succeeding</hi> Church, as causeth her in all Definitions of Faith, constantly to adhere <hi>to the word of the</hi> Apostles, and as need requires, <hi>infallibly</hi> to expound it: all which we have sufficiently <note n="b" place="margin">Chap. 8. 10. 14.</note> prov'd: and could it otherwise happen, Christ would not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes found so present with his Church, as to keep her from incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ruine by erroneous Doctrines; which this his promise must at least imply.</p>
               <p>Lastly, whereas <hi>Maldonat</hi> proves, that this kinde of <hi>presence,</hi> by <hi>Infallible Teaching,</hi> is rightly <hi>gathered</hi> from this Text; though not expresly signified by it, the Bishop by his mis-translation makes him <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> deny it to be <hi>the intention of Christ:</hi> which learned Authour does not onely assert the Truth of this Exposition, <note n="c" place="margin">Maldonat. in cap. <hi>28.</hi> Matth.</note> but brings in proof of it the testimonies of St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> St. <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Salvianus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Third, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. touching <hi>the Rock,</hi> on which <hi>the Church is founded,</hi> the Bishop sayes first, <hi>he dares not lay any other</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Foundation, then Christ.</hi> We answer, all the Apostles are styl'd <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of the Church; witness St. <hi>Paul</hi> (who was one of them) <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. Christ indeed was, and is, the <hi>Principal</hi> Foundation (<hi>the Chief corner stone</hi> in the Churches building, as the Apostle there speaks) yet <hi>Ministerially,</hi> and by Authority Derived from Christ, not onely the Apostles, but the Successours of the chief of them, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> may be, and are, in a true sense, <hi>Foundations</hi> of the Church. Secondly, the Bishop sayes, (and he does but say it) that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> was onely <hi>the first in order:</hi> whereas the Fathers teach, and we have sufficiently <note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 16. 17.</note> prov'd, that he was not onely the <hi>first</hi> in <hi>order,</hi> but <hi>in Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly he tells us, that by the <hi>Rock</hi> is not meant St. <hi>Peters person</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>onely,</hi> but <hi>the Faith which he professed:</hi> and for this (saith he) <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers come in with a very full consent.</hi> I answer, we pretend not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by <hi>the Rock, St.</hi> Peters <hi>person onely,</hi> but his <hi>Faith</hi> conjoyned with his person, or his person, confessing and asserting the Faith: and that the Fathers speak in this sense, (and no other) when they say the Church is built upon St. <hi>Peters Faith,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Bellarm. lib. <hi>1.</hi> De Rom. Pont. cap. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> proves by a whole Jury of the most Ancient among them, and most of them the same, the Bishop here pretends to bring for himself; beside the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> consisting of above six hundred <note place="margin">Concil. cbal. Act. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> Catholique Bishops.</p>
               <p>As to what he asserts, that by <hi>Hell-gates-prevailing against the Church is not understood principally the Churches not Erring, but her not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>falling away from the Foundation,</hi> we have already <note n="d" place="margin">Chap. 14.</note> fully prov'd the Contrary, both by the Testimony of the Fathers, and Solid Reason; shewing, that if any Errour in Faith could be admitted by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, <hi>the Gates of Hell</hi> might in such case be absolutely said <hi>to have prevaild</hi> against her, contrary to this promise of Christ. And how <hi>Bellarmin</hi> here cited by the Bishop, is to be understood, when he sayes, <hi>there are many things DE FIDE, which are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:57798:131"/>
                  <hi>to salvation,</hi> is already <note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 2.</note> shewn: where we also prov'd, that every errour in Faith contrary to what is propounded by the Church, is Fundamentall. But the Relatour, (as if his own word were a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof) tells us finally, that <hi>the promise of this stable Edification</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>is made to the whole Church, not to a Council.</hi> Why not to both I pray; to a General Council as well as to the Church? The truth is, it was made neither to Church nor Council <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>immediately,</hi> but to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successours, as the Fathers above mentioned shew; though for the good of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> her preservation from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in Faith: which morally could not be effected, if a General Council, lawfully called and confirm'd by St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successour, be not Infallible, or exempt from errour in its decisions of Faith.</p>
               <p>To what the Bishop concludes with upon this Text, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil hath no interest in this promised <hi>Edification further then it builds upon Christ,</hi> that is, upon the <hi>Doctrine Christ</hi> deliver'd, the <hi>Rules</hi> he gave, and the <hi>Promises</hi> he made to his Apostles and their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, we agree with him; but that a General Council confirmed by the Pope, does ever reject, or go contrary to these, we absolutely deny.</p>
               <p>To the fourth place, <hi>viz.</hi> of Christs prayer for St. <hi>Peter, that his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>faith should not fail,</hi> Luke 22. 32. the Relatour will have the <hi>native sense</hi> of it to be, <hi>that Christ prayed and obtained for St.</hi> Peter <hi>perseverance in the grace of God, against the strong Temptation, which was to winnow him above the rest.</hi> And you must take it, if you please, upon his bare word; that by <hi>Faith</hi> is here meant Grace. Had the Bishop weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pregnancy of <note n="b" place="margin">Bellarm. lib. <hi>4.</hi> De Rom. Pont. cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Reasons in confutation of this Exposition, he could not, surely, have been so positive in it. It should be an unnecessary prolixity to insert them here; where 'tis sufficient to observe the contradiction involv'd in this pretended <hi>Native sense</hi> of Christs prayer. Christ, according to the Bishop, <hi>obtain'd</hi> for St. <hi>Peter</hi> that he should persevere in Grace: But St. <hi>Peter</hi> did not still persevere in Grace, (for he lost it, when he committed that enormous sin of Denying his Master.) Therefore Christ <hi>obtain'd</hi> and did <hi>not obtain</hi> one and the same thing of his Eternal Father: which is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal contradiction. Our Saviour therefore prayed, according to his own expression in Scripture, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> might not lose Faith by an Internal act of Disbelief, though the Devil should so far prevail by his Temptations, as to make him say, contrary to his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>I know not the man you have taken prisoner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Bishop objects thus against this Text, <hi>to conclude an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>

without the least proof) <hi>Lucius, Felix,</hi> St. <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Petrus Chrysologus,</hi> (the last of which lived above twelve hundred years ago:) these, I say, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms <hi>to have adventur'd</hi> to prove from this Text what the Bishop denies. And though the three first of these were Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet such was their Sanctity and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as might well vindicate them from the least jealousie of challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, either through ignorance or ambition, more then of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to their office.

               <p>And as for <hi>Chrysologus,</hi> his Contemporary, and no Pope, he <hi>adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd,</hi> as it were, to ground the Infallibility we plead for, upon this Text, <note n="b" place="margin">Epist. ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Had <hi>Chrysologus</hi> written, or addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his words to the Pope, there might have been some colour for the Evasion; but speaking them to an Heretique, whom he sought to reduce into the bosome of the Catholique Church, who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he intended to complement the Pope?

               <p>So the Testimonies of <hi>Theophylact</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard</hi> are slighted by <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> him as men of <hi>yesterday,</hi> though they lived, the one above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, the other near six hundred years ago. But whoever charges St. <hi>Bernard</hi> with <hi>corrupt</hi> Doctrine, either in point of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Manners,</hi> might as justly charge St. <hi>Austin</hi> and the Fathers of his time: in which time, even by the acknowledgement of <note n="c" place="margin">Calvin lib. <hi>4.</hi> Insist. cap. <hi>2. §. 3.</hi>

                  <hi>Theophylact,</hi> he being a Greek Bishop, and of the forwardest in siding against the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, and in taxing her of Errour touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Procession of the Holy Ghost, it cannot be rationally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, but what he speaks in favour of the Roman Church, is extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him by the evidence of Truth, and the known consent of all Catholique Christians in that particular. As to <hi>the Gloss upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law,</hi> I answer it speaks onely of the Pope in his personal capacity, as a private Doctour; in which quality it is not deny'd, but he may possibly erre, even in Faith.</p>
               <p>Hence may easily be perceiv'd, how unsatisfactorily the Bishop en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to elude the force of this Text concerning Christs prayer for St. <hi>Peter:</hi> which I have <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 17.</note> already prov'd to be extended to his Successours: and that General Councils are at least collaterally and by way of consequence comprehended in it, is evident to reason.

                  </note> of the Infallibility of General Councils; the Argument proceeding <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> thus. <hi>If two or three gathered together in my name do alwayes obtain that which they ask at Gods hands, to wit, Wisdome, and Knowledge of those things which are necessary for them, how much more shall all Bishops gathered together</hi> (in a Council) <hi>alwayes obtain Wisdome and Knowledge, to judge those things which belong to the direction of the whole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed is the summe of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> discourse upon this Text: and I conceive the inference for the Infallibility of General Councils to be so clear, that every intelligent and unbyassed Reader will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it at first sight: seeing it can neither be deny'd, that the Pastours of the Church, assembled in a General Council to determine Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Christian Faith, are <hi>gathered together in the name of Christ;</hi> nor that they do <hi>in all due manner</hi> beg of God <hi>Wisdome, Understanding,</hi> and all <hi>necessary Assistance,</hi> to determine the Controversies aright.</p>
               <p>However the Bishop makes several exceptions against this Text. His first is, that <hi>most of the Fathers understand this place of consent in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>Prayer.</hi> So do we too. Is it not the very ground of our Argument? Do we pretend, that General Councils are prov'd Infallible from this Text, for any other reason, then because the Prelats in Council assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled do <hi>unanimously</hi> and <hi>duly</hi> pray, that God will preserve them from Errour, and because he hath promised to hear their prayers?</p>
               <p>His second exception is, that <hi>he doubts, the Argument A MINORI AD MAIUS holds onely in Natural and Necessary things, not in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>things Voluntary, and depending upon promise.</hi> I answer without any <hi>doubt,</hi> that the Argument <hi>à minori ad majus</hi> holds as well in things <hi>promised</hi> as <hi>natural,</hi> where the motive is increased, and neither <hi>Power</hi> nor <hi>Goodness</hi> wanting in the Promiser. If therefore God have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to grant the just and necessary Petitions of <hi>two or three</hi> assembled in his Name, he does therein impliedly promise <hi>à fortiori</hi> to grant the Petition of a General Council, when being assembled, they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously beg, that they may by the Divine Assistance be preserv'd from Errour in their Dicisions of Faith. Here the motive is greater then in the former case; the necessities of the whole Church do more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly ingage the Power, Love, and Honour of God, then the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of a few. By this it appears, that what he averres, that <hi>the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the less to the greater, can never follow, but where and so far, as the thing, upon which it is founded, agrees to the less;</hi> makes not any thing against us, since we deny not, but God is ready to grant the <hi>just and necessary</hi> Petitions in both cases.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I answer, there's no <hi>Essentiall</hi> difference between the <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the things determined by the Apostles, and those decided by a Generall Councill, confirm'd by the Roman Bishop.

                  <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Argument deduc'd from this Apostolicall Council, <hi>as 'twas a President to all future Councils oecumenicall,</hi> holds good for their Jnfallibility: since otherwise they must haue been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall as to the principall purpose of calling them, Viz. so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin Controuersies of fayth, as to put an end to all debates <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> of that nature in the Church: which can never bee effectually done, where Infallibility is not acknowledg'd, as hath been <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 7. 8. 14.</note> proued.</p>
               <p>To what hee obiects, that <hi>there is not THE LIKE Jnfallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in other Councils, where no man Sate, that was inspired, as was</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:57798:134"/>
                  <hi>in this</hi> (of the Apostles) <hi>where all that sate as iudges were inspired,</hi> I answer, 'tis sufficient that the whole Body of the Prelats concurring with their Head, in any other lawfull Generall Council, were <hi>ioyntly</hi> infallible in any kinde of <hi>reall</hi> infallibility, whether <hi>like</hi> to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or not. So in the Bishops own principles, a Generall Council, or at least the Catholique Church, is infallible in <hi>fundamentalls,</hi> or <hi>Things absolutely necessary to saluation,</hi> though hee would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>any ONE</hi> in the Church to haue that prerogatiue of infallibility. As touching <hi>Ferus,</hi> hee avouches nothing contrary to our doctrine of infallibility; though his Authority would bee of no greater force, then if hee were <hi>none of ours:</hi> His Comment vpon the Acts (which the Bishop here cites) beeing listed, with most of his other works in <note n="a" place="margin">Ioannis Feri fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciscani opera omnia in Romano Indice prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita sunt, exceptis Annotationibus et Commentarijs in Matth. et Ioann.

               <p>Thus haue I gone thorough all the forecited pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of scripture, and in euery one of them solv'd the Bishops obiections for rendring them incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent proofs of the Infallibility of Generall Councils: which yet I needed not haue done, since what is cleerly prou'd by any one Text of scripture is as vndoubtedly true, as what is prou'd by more. But the Bishop tells us, <hi>hee easily grants a Generall Council cannot erre in Things necessary to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <note place="margin">Ibidem num. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>it selfe to bee led by the spirit of Truth in scripture:</hi> wherein hee seems but to trifle, saying no more in effect, then that a Generall Council cannot erre, so long as it doth not erre. This is a very small Prerogatiue, and might bee affirm'd of any kinde of Council, nay of any particular person of how meane capacity soever. The question is, whether a lawfull Generall Council can ever bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumable to fall into the Bishops hinted disorder of <hi>leauing scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or defining any thing contrary to its true sense. But to speake truth, there can bee no question of it, as beeing inconsistent with the veracity of Diuine Promises, to permitt the whole Church to erre in any Doctrinall point she finds necessary to define by a Generall Council, for preuenting of schisms, and settling of mens minds in the Truth.</p>
               <p>To what hee adds, as the Result of his discourse vpon these several Texts. that <hi>supposing they promisd Assistance even to Infallibility, yet they are to bee understood of the whole Church principally, and of its Representatiue but by consequent, nor any further then the sayd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatiue consents and eleaues to that vpon which it is consequent, viz. the Catholique Body of the Church.</hi> This, I say, is but a weake cuasion. For seeing the <hi>Catholique,</hi> or Diffusiue, <hi>Body of the Church</hi> is bound to beleeue and profess the Doctrine taught by her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatiue, if the Church Diffusiue haue an Infallible Assistance for her Beleeving, the Council, or Church Representatiue, must also necessarily haue Infallible Assistance in Teaching. To which of these this Assistance is promised <hi>principally,</hi> is but a vayne spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, since they both haue it, as beeing absolutely necessary for them both.</p>
               <p>Here the Bishop falls againe to his <hi>Considerations,</hi> and wil haue <note place="margin">Consid. 4. num. 1.</note> vs to obserue, <hi>fourthly, that there is not the like consent, that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi>

J answer, <hi>all</hi> that haue not deserted, nor adher'd to the Desertors of the Catholique Church, doe vna nimously agree, that a lawfully-call'd and confirm'd Generall Council can no more erre in point of fayth, then the Church in general: and his Lp. was much out in quoting <hi>Waldensis</hi> for the contrary: hee beeing so great a Champion of the Bishop of <hi>Rome's</hi> Authority, as to assert his Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in defining <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi>

Austin</hi> speaks of, to <hi>Rules of Maners and discipline.</hi> I answer, the Cardinal is in no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, though elsewhere hee averrs, <note n="a" place="margin">Bellarm lib. 2. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. cap. 2.</note> that Generall Councils cannot erre in <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>Manners.</hi> for this is no good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and discipline, ergo they may <hi>erre</hi> in such matters. The reason is, because Precepts of Manners and Discipline depend much vpon Circumstances of <hi>Time, place, person,</hi> &amp;c. which varying, it often so falls out that what at first was prudently iudg'd <hi>fit to bee done,</hi> becomes afterward <hi>vnfitting:</hi> and when this happens, tis out of question one Generall Council may bee <hi>amended</hi> by another, yet neither of them bee iustly tax'd with Errour, they both commanding <hi>aright</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem</note> according to different Circumstances.</p>

                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:57798:135"/>
To what hee obiects against this exposition, that St. <hi>Austins</hi> whole dispute, in this place, is <hi>against the errour of St. Cyprian followed by the Donatists; which was</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>an Errour in fayth, namely, that true Baptisme could not bee giuen by Heretiques, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>such as were out of the Church,</hi> I answer, this euinces nothing against vs. For though this father takes the occasion of his speech from that errour of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and makes a Gradation in the writings of Bishops Prouinciall, Nationall, and Generall Councils, yet tis manifest hee speaks in a different stile in the last place, where hee touches on Plenary Councils: cleerly pronuncing, that the writings or private Bishops may bee <hi>reprehended, si quid in eis fortè a veritate deuiatum est:</hi> so hee affirms, that Prouinciall and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Councils must <hi>yeeld</hi> to Generall ones: but of these hee only sayes they may bee <hi>mended</hi> by others, <hi>when by some experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things, that is opened which was shut vp, and that know'n, which lay hid:</hi> which <hi>experiment,</hi> as wee haue sayd, is only found in matters of <hi>fact,</hi> precepts of <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>discipline,</hi> which depend on Circumstances, and are therfore in their own nature changeable; or lastly, when <hi>experience</hi> shews, that some new arising errours call for a further explanation of some Doctrinall point already defin'd.</p>
               <p>Nor matters it, that there was no <hi>experiment of fact</hi> in St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> case; seeing St. <hi>Austin</hi> does not consine his discourse to St <hi>Cyprians</hi> case only, but by occasion of his, and his Councils errour, lays down generall Doctrine touching the different <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the writings of particular Bishops, prouinciall, Nationall, and Generall Councils. And as for Doctor <hi>Stapletons</hi> reading <hi>Conclusum</hi> for <hi>Clausum,</hi> it imports little to the present purpose; hee <note n="b" place="margin">Prine. Doctrin. lib. 11. Controv. 6. pag. 381.</note> else where reading it <hi>Clausum est.</hi> The Bishops exposition therfore of St. <hi>Austins</hi> word, <hi>experiment,</hi> to bee a <hi>further proofe of the question,</hi> is groundleess, and contrary to the know'n notion of the word. Nor does it help him that St. <hi>Austin</hi> in the following chapter (where hee speaks of <hi>Rebaptization</hi>) sayes it was a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <hi>tenebris inuoluta:</hi> since hee speaks of it as it stood in St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, vndefin'd by a Generall Councill. Adde hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> expressly teacheth in the same chapter, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> would <hi>certainly</hi> haue corrected his opinion, had the point, in his time, been defin'd by a Generall Council: which is another manifest proofe, that neither St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> nor St <hi>Austin</hi> were of the Bishops minde in this particular, touching Generall Councils.</p>
               <p>Hence also is iustified what <hi>Stapleton</hi> averrs as the Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports him, viz. That <hi>if St. Austin speakes of a Cause of fayth, his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>meaning is, that latter Generall Councills doe mend the former, when they explicate more perfectly that fayth, which lay hid in the Seed of Ancient Doctrine:</hi> as for example, when the Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> explicated that of <hi>Nice,</hi> concerning the Diuinity of Christ, the Councill of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> that of Ephesus, and the Counil of <hi>Cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> all the Three. This <hi>Stapleton</hi> speakes by way of <hi>Solution</hi> to the Argument brought by Protestants from this Text of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> against the infallibility of Generall Councills: and the Relatour
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57798:136"/>
disingenuous, as to make his Reader beleeue, that the sayd <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> brings it for a proofe; while hee ridiculously asks, whether it bee <hi>not an excellent Conclusion, These Councils taught no Errour, and were only explained; Therfore no Council can erre in matter of fayth.</hi> 'Tis I confess, <hi>no Excellent conclusion,</hi> nor ever intended for such by <hi>Stapleton.</hi> But 'tis so excellent a <hi>solution</hi> to the Bishops Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it made him giue an Additionall Turn to the rest of his Labyrinth.</p>
               <p>That St. <hi>Austin</hi> meant plainly, <hi>that euen Plenary Councils might erre in matter of fayth, and ought to bee amended in a latter Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jbidem. num. 4.</note> the Bishop does well to say, <hi>I thinke will thus appeare.</hi> For in truth hee does but <hi>thinke</hi> it, as will soone bee manifest.</p>
               <p>His maine reason why hee <hi>thinks</hi> so, is taken from <hi>St. Austins</hi> word <hi>emendari,</hi> which the Relatour tells us <hi>properly supposes for errour and faultiness.</hi> J answer, the word <hi>emendari</hi> is very properly applyable to the taking away of any defect, it beeing deriued from <hi>Menda,</hi> which as <hi>Scaliger</hi> himselfe, in his Notes vpon <hi>Varro,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues, comes from the latin Adverb <hi>Minus,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">See Marinij Lexicon, in verbo <hi>Menda.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>properly signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies any defect whatsoeuer;</hi> and therfore not solely applyable to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in fayth, but to such defects as I haue mentioned aboue. <hi>Stapleton</hi> therfore giues not a <hi>forced,</hi> but the true and proper sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of St. <hi>Austins</hi> word <hi>emendari.</hi> And this may serue for a sufficient solution to the rest of his discourse: the word <hi>emendari</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 5.</note> bearing our sense as properly <hi>as reprehendi,</hi> and <hi>ce dere</hi> insisted on by the Bishop.</p>
               <p>To what hee adds, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> must bee vnderstood to speake of <hi>Amendment of errour,</hi> because hee teaches it must bee done <hi>without Sacrilegious pride, without swelling Arrogancie,</hi> and <hi>without Contention of Envy, in holy Humility, in Catholique peace, in Christian Charity;</hi> which Cautions the Bishop supposes, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily import some <hi>Errour,</hi> or <hi>fault</hi> committed by the former Council; in <hi>mending</hi> whereof the following Council might, without such <hi>Caueats</hi> bee apt to insult over the former; and the former, or their Adherents, to <hi>envy,</hi> and <hi>contest</hi> the Proceedings of the latter. I answer, St. <hi>Austins</hi> admonitions in this kinde relate not in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to Generall Councils, but to the other seuerall subiects of his whole discourse, viz. Priuate Bishops, Prouinciall and Nationall Councils; by whome as errour may bee committed, so 'tis evident, <hi>Pride, Arrogancy, Contention</hi> may happen in its emendation, if not religiously avoyded by the am enders.</p>
               <p>The Bishop proceeds against <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> telling vs <hi>this shift of his is the poorest of all,</hi> viz. That St. <hi>Austin speaks of vnlawfull Councils.</hi> But surely 'tis no <hi>shift</hi> at all in the Cardinal, seeing hee gives that Exposition only <hi>ex superabundanti</hi> and with a <hi>peradventure,</hi> as the Relatour himselfe obserues. To what hee brings at last, that <hi>it is a meere tricke, which the Ancient Church knew not, and</hi> (as hee thinks) <hi>not beleeu'd at this day by the wise and learned of our own side, to require the Popes Instruction, Approbation,</hi> and <hi>Confirmation,</hi> etc. J answer, <hi>wise and learned men</hi> will rather thinke, 'tis a meere <hi>Resuerie</hi> in the Relatour thus to contradict the perpetuall know'n

               <p n="1">1. THe Bishop labours in his fifth <hi>Consideration</hi> to avoyd Two <hi>Jnconueniences,</hi> which must needs follow by supposing errour to bee incident to a Generall Council. The first is, that this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition <hi>layes all open to vncertainties.</hi> The second, <hi>that it maks way</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 33. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sid. 5. num. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>for a whirle winde of the Priuate spirit to come in, and ruffle the Church.</hi> Hee thinks hee hath found out a Remedy for this twisted Disease. To the first <hi>Inconuenience</hi> hee sayes, that <hi>Generall Councills as lawfully called and ordered, and lawfully proceeding, are a great and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  Representation, and cannot erre in matters of fayth, keeping themselues to Gods Rule, and not attempting to make a New of their own: and that they are with all submission to bee obserued by euery Christian, where scripture or euident demonstration comes not against them.</hi> But whoe sees not, that this Remedy is as bad as the Disease? A Generall Council is an <hi>awfull Representation,</hi> if it bee <hi>lawfully called, and ordered, and proceeds lawfully:</hi> but hee set's not down the <hi>Marks,</hi> wherby wee may know, whether it bee lawfuIly called, ordered, and proceeds lawfully, or not. Neither does hee tell us whoe shall bee Iudge of those <hi>Marks.</hi> A Generall Council, says hee, cannot erre in matters of fayth, <hi>keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to Gods Rule.</hi> But this is both ambig uous, and vnsatisfactory. For if hee meane, that a Councill cannot erre so long as it teaches
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57798:137"/>
nothing contrary to the word of God, what greater Prerogatlue does hee giue to the Representatiue of Gods Church then belongs to any priuate Doctour, who cannot erre so long as hee follows, and cleaues to this vnerrable <hi>Rule?</hi> If his meaning bee, that a Generall Council cannot erre, if it considers the testimonies of holy writt, and define any thing according to the sense in which they vnderstand those testimonies, how can they bee tax't of errour, seeing it cannot bee deny'd, but Generall Councils, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining many points contrary to Protestant Doctrine, did conforme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their definitions to the sense in which (vpon serious examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) they vnderstood the most pertinent places of holyscripture. But Councils must not <hi>attempt to make a New Rule</hi> of their own. True But what the Bishop thinks <hi>New,</hi> is in the iudgement of those graue Prelats as <hi>Ancient,</hi> as the word of God. To whom then ought wee to submit? To him that is a priu ate Doctor, and averrs it to bee <hi>New:</hi> or to that <hi>lawfull</hi> Assemblie, which asserts it to bee <hi>Ancient?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee tells us next, that Generall Councils are to bee <hi>obserued by cuery Christian with all submission, where scripture, and euident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration come not against them.</hi> But who shall iudge, I pray, whether scripture or Demonstration make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  against them, or not? Does not every Heretique, that spurns against the Church; pretend that the scripture hee vrges, is <hi>euident,</hi> and his Reason a <hi>demonstration?</hi> you will reply, that the Bishop does not meane by a demonstratiue argument, such an one, as appeares so, only to a private spirit, but <hi>such as beeing proposed to any man, and vnderstood, the minde cannot choose but inwardly assent vnto it.</hi> If this bee so how can Protestants bee excused, who deny many points defined by Generall Councils? Many learned and vnderstanding men of our religion haue read the places of Scripture alledg'd by Protestants against vs, and haue diligently ponder'd all the Reasons and pretended euidences their aduersaries bring; and yet they are so farre from beeing convinc'd in iudgement, that they evidently oppose the beleefe of those points Defined, that they are persuaded of the contrary wherfore their arguments are not, euident in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but only seeme so to their private Spirits: and therfore all Christians, according to the Bishops rule, ought to submit to those Councils in the beleefe of the sayd points. Nor wil it serue the turn to say, that there was neverany Generall Council, besides the foure first, wherein nothing was defined contrary to Truth. For hence will follow, that a Council cannot bee know'n to bee Generall, but by the Truth of their Doctrine; nor their doctrine to bee true, but by the testimony of scripture: whence will bee deduc'd that wee ought to beleeue nothing for the Authority of a Council, but that wee our selues are the sole Iudges, whether the Definitions of Councils bee agreable to Gods word, or not. If you allow other Councils to haue been also Generall, and yet to haue falsely taught any of those points, which Catholiques now hold contrary to Protestants, you must eyther grant that scripture, or demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes not evidently against them, or auerre, that all learned
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57798:137"/>
and vnderstanding Catholiques, that haue perus'd their obiections, are conuine'd in judgement, that what themselues hold, is eyther quite opposite to the word of God, or contrary to common sense and the light of reason: both which are manifestly absurd.</p>
               <p>As for the Remedy hee applies to the second <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ,</hi> it is as ineffectuall as the first. The reason hee brings, why the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position <note place="margin">Jbidem.</note> of fallibility in Generall Councils does not <hi>make way for the whirlewinde of the Priuate spirit, is, because Priuate spirits are too giddy, to rest vpon scripture, and too heady and shallow to bee acquainted with Demonstratiue Arguments.</hi> But this is contrary to experience. For which of all those, that are taxt to giue way to the <hi>private spirit,</hi> refuse to <hi>rest</hi> vpon the word of God? Doe the Presbyterians in <hi>England</hi> decline Testimonies of scripture, when they Dispute with the Prelatists, against Episcopacy, and other points? Doe the Caluinists flie from scripture, when they contend with the Lutherans in Germany against Consubstantiation and vbiquity? or with the Arminians in Holland aboute Predestination, vniversall Grace, free will, perseuerance &amp;c? would the Bishop make us beleeue, that all maintainers of the Priuate spirit are so voyd of vnderstanding, as not to bee capable of a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Argument? must they needs bee depriu'd of the light of reason, because they thinke fit to follow the <hi>Dictamen</hi> of their owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in what they beleeue? or that they cannot comprehend any demonstration in Euclide because they giue way to their private spirit in the vnderstanding of scripture? The Bishop esteemes them <hi>giddy, Shallow,</hi> insufficient, and vncapable of a demonstratiue Argument, or of a right vnderstanding of the word of God: yet they, and their followers are of a different persuasion. They take them selues to bee, and are reputed by many others, to bee persons of strong reason, sharp iudgement, deep insight in what belongs to scripture: and vpon this presumption they will take vpon them to call in question whateuer suites not with their priuate fancie. Now to thinke that their priuate spirit is sufficiently oppos'd, by saying, they are all fooles, and vncapable of reason, is in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to bee voyd of iudgement, and to deserue the like Censure. <note place="margin">Ibidem num. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But what shall wee say to the Authority of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> who would haue true demonstrations every where to take place; and professes, that a Truth so cleerly demonstrated, that it cannot bee questioned, is to bee preferr'd before all those motiues, by which <note place="margin">D. Aug. cont. Ep. fund. c. 5.</note> a man is held in the Catholique Church? I answer, his words are only conditionall, and signifie, that in case any true and cuident demonstrations could bee brought against the motiues, that kept him in the Church, they must take place in our vnderstanding, in regard the assent, which ariseth from those motiues, is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and free; where as, that which would arise from such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue Arguments, would bee so cleere and necessary, that wee could no more preuent it, then our assent to this Principle, <hi>The whole is greater then the part.</hi> But hence it followes no more, that the Church can define what is cuidently contradicted, cyther by scripture, or demonstration, then that an Angel may feele, tast,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57798:138"/>
heare, because this Proposition is true, An Angel would seele, tast, or heare, if hee had a body, a tongue, or corporall eares.</p>
               <p>But to what purpose, does the Bishop goe about, to shew, that Councils are not to bee our Iudges in points that are cleerly taught by reason or scripture? wee shall neuer haue recourse to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, to know, whether the whole bee greater then the part; nor whether <hi>Jsaac</hi> had two sons, <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau.</hi> Neither ever will there arise any case, in which all wise persons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church will outwardly profess the Doctrine defined by Councils, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly aslent, that it is contrary to the word of God, and to eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstration. The Controuersie which the Bishop should haue resolu'd is this, whether in case one partie pretend, and verily beleeue, they haue cleere scripture, and demonstration for what they say; and the other, consisting of men at least equall, if not superiour, to them, in point of learning, vnderstanding, Morall Honestie, Prudence, and all other helps conducing to right iudgement, shall affirme the contrary, whether in this case there bee not an absolute necessity of a liuing, and infallible iudge, to end the Controuersie; and whether all Christians ought not to submitt to that iudge, notwithstanding any reasons, or seeming euidences to the contrary?</p>
               <p>Tis strange the Bishop should thinke <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to grant, that a priuate man may lawfully dissent from a Generall Council, by <note place="margin">Ibidem num. 3.</note> reason of some <hi>manifest</hi> and <hi>intolerable</hi> errour. The Cardinall asserts indeed, that inferiours may not iudge superiours, whether they proceed lawfully, or not, <hi>vnless it manifestly appeare, that an</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bellarm. de Conc. lib. 2. cap. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>intolerable errour is committed by them.</hi> But there hee speaks of the Council of the Iews, which condemned our sauiour, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him, committed an intolerable errour. And in that very place hee teaches, that the Council of the Jewes, wherein the High Preist presided, could not erre in matters of fayth, before the coming of the Messias? but that after his birth they might, according to diverse Prophesyes hee there alledges; adding, that at the very time when the Council was lyable to errour, subiects were to submitt to their superiours, viz. the people to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, vnless it manifestly appear'd, that an intolerable errour had been committed by them. But how can the Relatour inferre from thence, that such an errour may bee committed by our Generall Councils, since the Cardinal expressly teaches in that very booke, that our Generall Councils cannot possibly erre in their definitions of fayth?</p>
               <p>The Bishops next quarrel is with Doctor <hi>Stapleton,</hi> for teaching, <note place="margin">Ibidem num. 4.</note> that <hi>the voyce of the Church,</hi> in determining Controuersies of fayth in Generall Councils, <hi>is Diuine?</hi> telling vs, that <hi>the Proposition stick's in his throate,</hi> as if the Doctor had felt some checke in the vttering of it. Why? because (forsooth) by way of explicating himselfe, <hi>Stapleton</hi> adds, that it is not <hi>simply,</hi> but in a <hi>manner,</hi> diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. Is this to retract, in any sort, what hee had sayd? who sees not rather, that 'tis only to speake with that necessary caution which the cause requires, and which the cauilling disposition of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57798:138"/>
doth particularly oblige vs to? This Proposition, <hi>The voyce of the Church, determining in Generall Councils, is in a manner diuine,</hi> is doubtless not only most true in it self, but also most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to Catholicke grounds; to witt, as expressing, that it is not Gods <hi>immediate reuelation</hi> but only an infallible meanes of applying <hi>immediate reuelation</hi> to us.</p>
               <p>His next obiection against the sayd Doctor is <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> viz. for aucrring that <hi>the Church is the foundation of fayth in a higher kinde, then scripture.</hi> I answer, that I haue diligently sought for the words alledged, in <hi>Stapletons</hi> works, and cannot finde them. The Bishop quotes <hi>Relect. Contr.</hi> 4. <hi>quest.</hi> 4. <hi>art.</hi> 3. but that <hi>question</hi> hath no <hi>article</hi> at all in it. 'Tis true, in the fifth <hi>question</hi> hee teaches, that the Church is <hi>more know'n</hi> to us, then scripture; and that it is <hi>the meanes of applying to us both scripture, and all things else that wee beleeue.</hi> But this is neither <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> nor <hi>Contradiction</hi> to his own grounds. However, should any such proposition bee found in <hi>Stapleton,</hi> J am not bound to maintaine it, seeing J haue only engag'd to defend the receiu'd Doctrine of the Catholique Church; which no ways depends vpon any such assertion, as is here layd to <hi>Stapletons</hi> charge.</p>

In the sixth Consideration the Relatour argues to this purpose: if a Generall Council bee infallible, the infallibility of it is eyther in the <hi>Conclusion</hi> alone, or in <hi>the Meanes</hi> that proue it alone <note place="margin">Consid. 6. num. 1.</note> (that is to say in the <hi>Premisses</hi>) or <hi>in both together.</hi> But the Council (sayth hee) is neither infallible in the <hi>Conclusion</hi> alone, nor in the <hi>Meanes</hi> (or premisses) alone, nor yet <hi>in both together:</hi> ergo, 'tis, not infallible at all. Wee desire to bee breife; and therfore, not standing to consider the reasons, why hee thinks 'tis not infallible in <hi>the Meanes,</hi> wee answer 'tis infallible in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> that is, in the Doctrine defined, though it bee not infallible in the <hi>meanes,</hi> or arguments vpon which it proceeded to the definition. The reason is, because the one, viz. that the Conclusion, or defined Doctrine of a Generall Council, should bee infallibly true is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the due gouernment of the Church; But the other, viz. that there should bee infallibility also in the <hi>Meanes,</hi> or in the disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aboute the matter, before it comes to bee defined, is not necessary: and it is a know'n maxime <hi>Deus non deficit in necessarijs, nec abundat in superfluis;</hi> which holds good in Theologie, as well, as in Nature. God is not wanting in the supply of necessaries, noris hee profuse in affording things superfluous.</p>
               <p>To this our Aduersarie replies, that <hi>'tis a thing altogether vnknow'n in nature, and art too, that fallible Principles can, eyther as father, or mother, beget, or bring forth an infallible Conclusion.</hi> But this is a false <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 2.</note> supposition of the Bishop, for the Conclusion is not so much the childe of those principles, as the fruite of the Holy Ghost, directing and guiding the Council to produce an infallible Conclusion, what ever the premisses may bee. This is necessary for the peace, and vnity of the Church, and therfore not to bee deny'd, vnless an impossibility can bee shew'd therein. But I hope no man will <hi>attacque</hi> Gods Omnipotency, and depriue him of the power of doing this. Hence
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57798:139"/>
it appeares how vainly the Relatour fancies to himselfe, that <hi>Stapleton</hi> and all Catholiques are <hi>miserably hamper'd</hi> in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, whereas they all easily answer it, as wee haue done.</p>
               <p>What hee sayes next is a meere peruersion of <hi>Stapletons</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 3.</note> whoe neuer teaches that the Church is <hi>Simply Propheticall</hi> eyther in the <hi>Premisses</hi> or <hi>Conclusion,</hi> but rather the quite contrary, as the Relator might haue seen, (if hee had pleas'd) in the place hee cites. Tis true, hee vses the word <hi>Propheticall</hi> sometimes, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Stapleton. Relect. Contr 4. q. 2.</note> of the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> or Definition of a General Council: but 'tis apparent, hee does it only in a lesse proper, or Analogicall sense, to signifie, that, by vertue of diuine Assistance and direction, such a Conclusion, or Definition, in regard of precise verity, is as <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly</hi> true and certaine, as if it were a <hi>Prophecy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is there any Contrariety in this, betweeen <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin:</hi> for both agree, that neither Church nor Council doe publish <hi>Jmmediate Reuelations;</hi> nor create any <hi>New Articles</hi> of Fayth, but only <hi>declare</hi> and vnfold, by their definitions, that doctrine, which Christ and his Apostles <hi>in some manner</hi> first deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Both of them likewise confesse, that whether the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, from which the Church, or General Councils, deduce their definition, haue <hi>intrinsecall</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> connexion with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, defined or noe, yet the Conclusion or definition it selfe, is of <hi>infallible</hi> verity: the holy Ghost so directing the Council, that it neuer defines any conclusion to bee of fayth, but what is <hi>de facto</hi> matter <hi>reueasd</hi> by God, eyther in those Principles from which the Council deduces it, or at least in some other.</p>
               <p>The Relatours whole Discourse therefore, vpon this subiect of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> falls of it selfe to the ground, as beeing built vpon a pure (I had almost sayd a willfull) mistake, viz, that <hi>Stapleton</hi> maintaines the Decrees of a Generall Councill to bee <hi>Propheticall</hi> in a proper sense, which hee does not: and consequently, that it was wholly needless for our aduersary to talke so much of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasms</hi> and tell vs so punctually what <hi>Prophecy</hi> is, what <hi>vision:</hi> and that neither of both are to <hi>bee gotten with study and Industry.</hi> For wee know all this; and therfore wee doe not style the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of Councils <hi>Reuelations,</hi> or <hi>Prophesies,</hi> or <hi>visions,</hi> or the like; but willingly acknowledge they are the results of much study, and industrie: only wee aerre the study and industrie, which the Prelats in Generall Councils doe vse for the finding out of Truth, is always crowned by God with such success, as <hi>infallibly</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues them from errour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stapleton</hi> goes on, and giues vs the reason, why a Generall <note place="margin">Ibidem num. 3.</note> Councill must necessarily bee infallible in the <hi>Conclusion, because that which is determined by the Church, is matter of Fayth, not of Knowledge; and that therfore the Church proposing it to bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> , though it vse Meanes, yet it stands not vpon Art, Meanes, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, but the Assistance of the Holy Ghost: else when wee embrace the Conclusion proposed, it would not bee an Assent of Fayth, but an Habit of Knowledge.</hi> To this the Bishop replying, seemes to broach a New Doctrine; namely, <hi>that the Assent of Fayth may bee an Habit</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:57798:139"/>
                  <hi>of Knowledge.</hi> To this the replying Bishop seemes to broach a new doctrine namely, <hi>that the Assent of Fayth may bee an habit of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</hi> But surely Diuine Fayth is, according to the Apostle, Hebr. 11. <hi>an Argument of things which doe not appeare,</hi> to wit, by the same meanes, by which wee giue this assent of Fayth: otherwise our Faith would not bee free, and meritorious. Tis true, the same conclusion may bee <hi>Fayth</hi> to one, and <hi>Knowledge</hi> to another, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> cited by the Bishop) but this must bee vpon different motiues: and therfore Fayth, as <hi>Fayth,</hi> can neuer bee knowledge; which is all that <hi>Stapleton</hi> vrges. The motiues of Credibility then, which wee haue for our Fayth, doe not by euident demonstration shew the truth thereof, though they make it euidently credible: in so much as hee would bee <hi>imprudent,</hi> who should refuse to giue his assent. So though the Bishop doe truly assert, <hi>that the Church in all ages hath been able</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>to stop the mouthes of philosophers, and other great men of reason, when it is at the highest;</hi> yet this is also true, that our sauiour did neuer intend to sett vp a schoole of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> but of <hi>Fayth:</hi> and that Councils, in their definitions, relie not, on any demonstratiue reasons, but on the infallible Assistance of the holy Ghost, promised to them. In like manner, the Faythfull ground not themselues on any demonstration proposed to them by the Church, but on <hi>Gods Reuelation,</hi> obscurely, but certainly, and <hi>infallibly</hi> applyed to them, by the Church. <note place="margin">Consid. 7 num. 1. 2</note>

               <p>In the seauenth Consideration, the Relatour takes notice againe of a Querie, that A. C. made to him: viz. <hi>if a Generall Council may erre, wherein are wee neerer to vnity by such a Council.</hi> But in stead of giuing a punctuall, and direct answer, as hee should haue done, hee falls a fresh vpon certaine <hi>new considerations,</hi> which hee aduances vpon this subiect; whether the <hi>Protestant opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> that Generall Councils may erre in defining matters of Fayth, or the <hi>Catholique opinion,</hi> that they cannot, <hi>bee more agreeable to the Church, and more able to preserue and reduce Christian peace:</hi> which in effect is little else, but to answer one Querie, by many; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought his reader almost to the port of his <hi>Labyrinth;</hi> by a gentle turn, to lead him back againe through all the <hi>Meanders</hi> thereof: howeuer wee must obserue his Motions.</p>

But the principall thing the Bishop would haue vs consider here, is, that <hi>Jnfallibility resides, according to power and Right of Authority, in the whole Church, and in a Generall Council only by power deputed.</hi> To which purpose hec cites St. <hi>Austin,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">D. Aug. lib. de Agon. Christian. cap. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Petrus personam Ecclesiae Sustinet; et huic datae sunt claues, quum Petro datae. Peter</hi> (sayes hee) <hi>beares the person of the Catholique Church; and to her were the Keyes giuen; when they were giuen to Peter.</hi> I answer, there is a twofold representing, or <hi>bearning the person</hi> of an other, to bee obseru'd. The one <hi>Parabolicall,</hi> or by way of <hi>meere Figure,</hi> and <hi>supposition</hi> only. Thus <hi>Agar</hi> (<hi>Abrahams</hi> bondwoman) <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 25. 26. repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the nation, or people of the Iewes, yet liuing vnder the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Mosaicall law: and Mount-Sion, or <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> the Churh of God. The other, <hi>Historicall,</hi> and <hi>Reall,</hi> viz. when the person representing has <hi>right,</hi> or <hi>relation aparterei,</hi> in, and towards the thing represented; by vertue whereof it doth, in the rust, and and necessary interpretation of Reason, <hi>beare the person,</hi> or stand for the thing represented. Now St. <hi>Peter</hi> Sustained the person of the Church in this latter sense; I meane <hi>Historicè, non Parabolicè,</hi> really, and in verity of <hi>fact,</hi> not in Figure, or Parabolicall supposition only: hee beeing such a principall, and cheife member of the Church, as did <hi>ratione officij</hi> virtually, and truly containe in himselfe the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Ecclesiasticall Power: in the same manner, as a King receiues, the keyes of a town, whereof hee takes possession <hi>for himselfe,</hi> though he representeth the whole kingdome, and receiues the keyes for the good thereof. Thus, Isay St. <hi>Peter</hi> receiu'd the keyes for himselfe; as hee was Head of the Church, though that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception were indeed ordain'd for the good of the whole Church.</p>
               <p>To receiue a thing in this manner, is not to receiue it in <hi>the</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:57798:140"/>
                  <hi>others right,</hi> but in <hi>his own,</hi> not withstanding it bee finally meant for the good of the other. This is so cleere, euen to common sense, that wee haue no need of turning ouer many <hi>Classique Authours</hi> to proue it. wherfore the example of an Attorney tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing possession of land for a Purchaser, and of one, who hauing a Proxy, receiues a woman with the Ceremonies of Marriage in the name of an other, are not to the purpose; because in such cases the person of an other is Sustain'd only <hi>Parabolicè,</hi> or by way of voluntary supposition <hi>pro tempore;</hi> as when a Legate receiues the keyes of a town, meerly as substitute, for, and in the name of his King. But in our case the keyes were receiued <hi>Historicè,</hi> and in way of reall propriety, as by the King himselfe, Head of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, so by St. <hi>Peter</hi> Head of the Church.</p>
               <p>This Answer is grounded in St. <hi>Austin</hi> himselfe, who teaches <hi>St. Peters</hi> receiuing the souereign Authority of the gouerning the whole Church (signified hero, by the keyes) as hee was <hi>a Figure</hi> of the Church, and represented <hi>the person</hi> of the Church, to haue been <note n="b" place="margin">D.

                  <hi>propter Primatum</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by reason of the PRIMACY</hi> which hee had amongst the Apostles. The like hee hath in <note n="c" place="margin">D. Aug. Quaest. ex Nou. Testam. quaest. 75. D. Aug. de verb. dom. serm. 13.</note> other places. So cleerly does hee explicate his own meaning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the answer wee haue giuen to the text the Bishop brings. Why therfore doth the Relatour labour in vayne to wrest the Keyes out of St. <hi>Peters</hi> hands, and to bestow them hee knows not where? They must remaine where Christ has left them. St <hi>Peter,</hi> and his successours know best how to vse them, and <hi>how to turn them in their proper wards,</hi> as the Bishop speaks.</p>
               <p>In his Third <hi>Consideration</hi> hee supposes, that though a Generall Council bee granted lyable to errour, yet <hi>so long as the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Church</hi> (Diffusiue) <hi>bee exempt from it in the Prime Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Fayth, absolutely necessary to saluation,</hi> there is still a <hi>sufficient Meanes to preserue, and reduce vnity, and to preuent all inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> that vsually trouble the Church. One of the greatest <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences</hi> that can possibly fall vpon the Church, is errour in fayth; which vpon supposition that a Generall Council may erre in such matters, does vnauoydably befall the whole Church <note n="*" place="margin">chap. 8. 2.</note> as wee haue already shew'n; and that without any hopes of euer beeing certainly cleer'd of it. For as one Generall Council fell into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour so may an other, and a third, and a fourth, etc. Vnless therfore Generall Councils bee granted infallible in matters of Fayth, where is the Bishops remedy against <hi>Jnconueniences?</hi> How shall the Church bee freed from <hi>Perplexity?</hi> How shall <hi>vnity</hi> bee <hi>preseru'd,</hi> or <hi>reducd?</hi> Hee tells vs, the Church, vpon discouery of the errour of a former Council, <hi>may represent herselfe in an other body,</hi> or <hi>Council, and take order for what was concluded amiss.</hi> But who shall warrant, that the remedy shall not proue as bad as the disease, or perhaps worse? who shall secure vs, that the second Council shall <hi>rightly</hi> condemne the supposed errour of the first? or (if it happen so) shall not broach two other for that one, and thereby bee an occasion of fresh <hi>Jnconueniences, Perplexities, Contentions,</hi> in, and to the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:57798:141"/>
Againe, how shall the whole Church, vpon euidence found, of the miscarriage of a Generall Council, <hi>represent her selfe in an other body?</hi> must euery particular member of the Church first except against the sayd errours, and concurre to the election, and holding of an other Council? That will neuer happen. For in such a multitude, very many will bee of the same minde with the precedent representatiue of the Church. If not all, but some part only of the Churches members, bee conuinced of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended errour, and, would call an other Council to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>  it, then not <hi>the whole</hi> Church in Generall, but only a part of it, should take vpon them to remedy the abuses of a Generall Council: which is absurd. Moreouer, if the power of calling Generall Councils reside only in the whole Church Diffusiuely taken, as the Bishop here supposeth, what likelyhood is there, that there should euer bee such a Council called; it beeing not to bee done, but by the generall consent of all Christians; whose interests are so diuided, and for the most part so repugnant to each other, that it cannot bee doubted, but when one Nation, or Countrie, is willing to haue a Generall Council called, some other will bee found as vnwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When will all Christians (thinke you) agree, that both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, Catholiques, Grecians, Lutherans, and all other Sectaries should meete in Councill, and haue equall power, and libertie to vote there? which if they haue not; who can expect, that the excluded party will hold it a Generall Council, and thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues bound to submitt to it?</p>
               <p>The Bishop tells vs, that the Church <hi>heeretofore</hi> vsed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> the errours of former Councils by <hi>calling, and representing her selfe in a new Councill, and that this is euident in the case at Ariminum, and the second of Ephesus, and in other Councils named by Bellarmin.</hi> But, I answer: our dispute is about lawfull Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councils, confirm'd by the Pope; such as neither of these were; nor any of those other, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> mentions in the place <note n="e" place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 2. de Conc cap. 16.</note> quoted by the Bishop: neither can it bee sayd, that those subsequent Councils, which reformed the errours concluded at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and <hi>Ephesus,</hi> were called by the Authority of the <hi>whole</hi> Church in generall, but by the Pope, in the same manner, as that of <hi>Trent</hi> and others were.</p>
               <p>Hee grants that the Church, though it may erre, hath not <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> only a <hi>Pastorall power to teach, and direct, but a Pretorian also, to controule, and censure too, where errours, or crimes, are against points Fundamentall, or of great consequence.</hi> Are not the Reall Presence, Purgatory, praying to Saynts, the fiue Sacraments of seauen which Protestants denie, and diuerse other points, wherein they differ from us, and the Church, things <hi>of great consequence?</hi> And did not the whole christian Church generally teach, and profess these points, both long before, and at the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> departure from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? why was it not then in the power of the Church to <hi>controule,</hi> and <hi>censure</hi> him, with all his followers, for opposing her Doctrine in the sayd points? Againe, if wee ought to obey the Church in <hi>points Fundamentall,</hi> and <hi>of great consequence,</hi> as
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57798:141"/>
the Bishops doctrine here cleerly implies, why must wee not obey her likewise in taking those points to bee <hi>Fundamentall, and of great consequence,</hi> which shee holds to bee such, and by her definition declares to bee such? Certainly Heretiques will neuer want reason to iustifie their disobedience to the Church, if allowing her authority to <hi>controule,</hi> and <hi>censure</hi> only in points Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and of great consequence, wee allow them the liberty to iudge, and determin what points are such, what not. <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>

               <p>His instance of a mothers authority, viz. <hi>that Obedience due to her, is not to bee refused vpon her falling into errour,</hi> holds not in the Church, because the authority of a naturall mother is not in order to <hi>Beleefe,</hi> but to <hi>Action:</hi> and it does not follow, that because shee hath commanded amiss in one thing, that her child is not to obey her in an other, which it shall not know to bee vnlawfull.

LICET CHRISTVS &amp;c. <hi>Though Christ instituted this Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Sacrament, and gaue it to his Disciples after supper, vnder both kindes of bread, and wine, yet NON OBSTANTE, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this, it ought not to bee consecrated after supper; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but fasting. And likewise, that though in the Primitiue Church this Sacrament was receiued by the faythfull, vnder both kindes, yet this custome, that it should bee receiu'd by Laymen, only vnder the kinde of bread, is to bee held for a law, which may not bee refused. And to say this is an vnlawfull custome of receiuing vnder one kinde, is erronious, and they which persist in saying so, are to bee punished, and driuen out, as Heretiques.</hi> The force of the obiection depends wholy on the words NON OBSTANTE, which the Bishop conceiues to import, that the Council defin'd <hi>receiuing vnder both kindes not to bee necessary, NOTWITHSTANDING that our Sauiour so instituted it,</hi> viz. in both kindes. I answer, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> rightly obserues, that the words <hi>non obstante</hi> haue no reference to receiuing vnder both kindes, but to the time of receiuing it after supper: which though the Bishop bee not satisfy'd with, but obiects, <hi>that</hi> the <hi>NON OBSTANTE must necessarily</hi> (<hi>for ought hee can see</hi>) <hi>bee referred to both clauses, in the words following, because both clauses went before it; and, hath as much force against receiuing vnder both kindes, as against receiuing after supper;</hi> yet, I see no reason, but hee might haue taken it for a full satisfaction. For to mee it seemes cleere (let the Bishop fancy what hee pleases) that the <hi>non obstante</hi> can haue no reference, but to the time of receiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after supper. For the words that follow a <hi>non obstante</hi> in any sentence, haue neuer reference to any thing, but what hath some
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57798:142"/>
opposition with it. Now to consecrate, and receiue fasting, (which the Council opposeth to what was done by Christ) hath no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position at all with the Apostles receiuing vnder two kindes. For it were an absur'd, and senseless proposition to say: though Christ instituted this Venerable Sacrament, and gaue it to his Disciples <hi>vnder both kindes,</hi> yet it ought not to bee consecrated <hi>after supper,</hi> nor receiued but <hi>fasting:</hi> wherfore the Consecrating, and receiuing <hi>fasting</hi> (which is only opposed by the <hi>Non obstante</hi> to what was done by Christ) hath not reference to the receiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder both kindes, but only to the receiuing after supper.</p>
               <p>But the Relatour adds, that the after-words <hi>Et similiter</hi> (<hi>and likewise</hi>) couple both together in this reference; as if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil by saying AND LIKEWISE <hi>though in the Primitiue Church this Sacrament was receiued vnder both kindes, yet this custome, that it should bee receiued by Laymen, only vnder the kinde of Bread, is to bee held for a law, which may not bee refused,</hi> should signifie, that Laymen ought to receiue the Sacrament vnder one kinde, not only though it bee contrary to Christs institution, but also to the practise of the Primitiue Church. But how will he proue, that this is the signification of the words <hi>And likewise?</hi> may not a man say properly, though the Iewes might haue plurality of wiues, yet the Christians may not? <hi>and likewise;</hi> though the Iewes were allowed to desire <hi>eye for eye, tooth for tooth,</hi> &amp;c. yet <hi>notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> the Christians are not? Here, the words <hi>And likewise</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both sentences together, and yet the <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> of the latter sentence hath no reference to the words of the first part, since it were ridiculous to fay: Though the Iewes might haue plurality of wiues, yet Christians are not allowed to require eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.</p>
               <p>As the Decrees of the aforesayd Council are not contrary to the institution, and ordination of Christ, so neither is the practise of the Church in receiuing <hi>vnder one kinde</hi> contrary thereto. To shew that the practise of the Church were contrary to Christs institution, the Bishop should haue made it appeare, that Christ did so institute this Sacrament of his last supper, that hee would not haue one part to bee Sacrament without the other; or that hee would not haue one part bee taken without the other. Now neither of these two can bee proued. Not that one kinde alone is not sufficient to the Sacrament: for if nothing bee requisite to the essence of a Sacrament, but <hi>Matter, forme,</hi> and a <hi>diuine promise</hi> of Grace to those that shall receiue it: the words of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration <hi>Hoc est corpus meum</hi> is a true forme; the element of bread alone, is a true matter, vsed by our Sauiour. Hee hath also promised Grace to those, that shall receiue his Body vnder the forme of bread, as appeares by these words, Joan. 6. <hi>Qui mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat hunc panem, viuet in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> .</hi> with what reason therefore can any one deny, that the Body of Christ vnder the forme of bread is a true Sacrament? Neither can it bee prou'd that Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Laymen to receiue <hi>vnder both kindes.</hi> Not by these words, <hi>Drinke yee all of this.</hi> For if this were a command, and not a
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57798:143"/>
Counsell, (as when hee sayd, <hi>if J, your Lord haue washed your feete, you also ought to wash one an others feete,</hi>) it was giuen to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, who <hi>all</hi> drunke of the Chalice. Now as it doth not follow, that Laymen are bound to baptize, and preach to all nations, because the Apostles were commanded to doe so; so neither doth it follow, that Laymen are bound to <hi>drinke</hi> of the Chalice, because the Apostles were.</p>
               <p>Nor can this obligation, viz. that Laimen should receiue <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kindes,</hi> bee inferred out of those other words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour; <hi>except you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If Protestants themselus therfore doe not extend this command to persons of all ages, notwithstanding that the words haue no restriction more to one age, then to an other, how will they proue from thence, that all Laymen are bound to receiue vnder both kindes? Beside, wee will shew hereafter, that euen in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, when the custome was to receiue <hi>vnder both kindes,</hi> the Sacrament was many times administred vnder <hi>one kinde</hi> only.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the Relatour pretends wee are <hi>vnreasonable,</hi> in holding <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 6.</note> Generall Councils infallible, because (sayth hee) <hi>no Body col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiue, whensoeuer it assembled it selfe, did euer giue more power to the representing Body of it, then a binding power vpon all particulars, and it selfe; nor euer did it giue this power otherwise, then with this reseruation in nature, that it would call againe, and reforme, yea, and if need were, abrogate any law, or ordinance vpon iust cause made euident, that the Representing Body had failed in trust, or truth.</hi> But this is only to suppose, and take for granted, what hee neuer yet proued, viz. that a Generall Council hath no authority, but what is <hi>meerly delegate</hi> from the Church vniuersall, which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents: whereas wee maintaine its authority to bee of <hi>diuine institution,</hi> and, when lawfully assembled, to act by <hi>diuine right,</hi> and not meerly by <hi>deputation,</hi> and consent of the Church, as wee haue also prou'd in the precedent chapter. True it is, the calling of such assemblies was taken vp, and hath for its pattern the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apostles, Acts. 15. yet surely there's as little doubt to bee made, but the Apostles had both <hi>direction,</hi> and <hi>precept</hi> too, for doing it so often as iust occasion requr'd, from Christ himselfe. Though therfore a Generall Council bee the Church represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue, and doe not meete, or assemble together <hi>hic, et nunc,</hi> but by order, and deputation from <hi>Man,</hi> yet it followes no, but the power, and authority by which they act, when they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  bee from God; as doubtless it is. Jn the first Council of the Apostles the <hi>Body Collectiue,</hi> as the Bishop calls it, that is, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that beleeu'd, did neither send, nor chuse the persons to sit
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57798:143"/>
in it; neither was their consent asked, whether a Council should bee conuened, or not; but the Apostles concluded this amongst themselues, as beeing a particular, and speciall branch of that <hi>Power</hi> they had receiued from Christ, for the Gouernment of the Church. Neither at this day, is their consent, or concurrence any more required <hi>de iure</hi> to the conuening of such assemblies, then it was in the Apostles time; but the Pastours of the Church doe act, and determin all things pertaining to this affayre, solely amongst themselues, without requiring the Peoples consent.</p>
               <p>Generall Councils then are a principall, and necessary part of that Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy, which Christ instituted for the Gouernment of his Church, and not an <hi>humaine Expedient</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, brought in, or taken up by the Church her selfe meerly upon prudentiall considerations, as the Bishop will needs conceiue: and their Power beeing wholy <hi>from aboue,</hi> as the Church Diffusiue properly speaking, giues it not; so neither can shee take it away, or annull any thing in point of doctrine, which the Pastours in such Councils assembled, shall by full authority decree. I sayd, <hi>in point of doctrine;</hi> because that is <hi>ex natura rei</hi> unchangeable. The Gospell of Christ and true Christian Fayth (which Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are by Christs Institution appointed to teach) admitts not of <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> now the Affirmatiue, then the Negatiue, (as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <note place="margin">Hebr. 13. 8.</note> by his <hi>correcting,</hi> and <hi>abrogating</hi> Power, left to After-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils would haue vs belccue) but only <hi>yea.</hi> It is alwayes <hi>the same,</hi> if once <hi>declared,</hi> and <hi>settled</hi> by those, who haue the authority, and assistance from God, that is requisite thereto, (as Councils haue, euen by the Relatours own confession here.) It must stand, and bee professed without alteration, or abrogation, for euer. His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense therfore of the Churches <hi>representing her selfe againe, and by a new Council taking order for what was decreed amiss,</hi> signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this case, saue only, that our aduersarie holds still to his first, and false supposition, that Generall Councils may erre; which was neuer yet granted him, nor can wee grant it, without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence to the nature, and propertie of true Christian Fayth, which is to bee <hi>invariable,</hi> and to admitt no change, not without derogating both from the institution, and honour of Christ.

If it hath not, the Church her selfe committs sinne, in the Bishops owne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by imputing errour to the precedent Councill; whose definitions according to him, must stand in force, and bee obeyed by <hi>all particulars,</hi> and consequently by the whole Church, till euident scripture, or demonstration bee brought against them. If it hath, then <hi>the whole</hi> Church cannot but cleerly perceiue the sayd errours of the former Council, and know them to bee such: and then, what need of an After-Council? what good can it doe? shall it bee called to declare that, which euery man sees already? or to define that, about which there is no controuersie, nor can bee any, so long as men continue in their right mindes, and doe but consider what they say or thinke?</p>
               <p>You will say, a Council ought to bee called in this case, to abrogate the law, or definition, of the precedent Council which erred. I answer, that supposes the definition of the sayd precedent Councill to bee still in force, which is false: first, because it is vnreasonable wee should bee <hi>bound</hi> to beleeue anything as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fayth, solely upon the authority of a Council that is lyable to errour, both against scripture, and demonstration. Secondly, because 'tis more vnreasonable wee should <hi>bee bound</hi> to beleeue what wee cleerly see to bee errour, and contrary both to scripture, and demonstration: and yet in no other case, but this, euen by the Bishops leaue, can the whole Church call an other Council to reuerse the decrees of the former. Thirdly, because, as it did not binde <hi>the whole</hi> Church from prosessing her dislike of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours defin'd, and calling an other to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>  so did it not oblige <hi>the particulars</hi> not to prosess outwardly a disbeleefe, or doubt thereof. Wherfore it is euident that his Lordship vpon this subiect says, and vnsays the same; and what hee seemes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to Generall Councils in one proposition, hee takes away in an other.</p>
               <p>The Bishop pretends the Catholique opinion touching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 7.</note> to bee <hi>yet more vnreasonable;</hi> because wee make not only the definitions of a Generall Council, but the sentence of the Pope also, <hi>infallible. For a Generall Councill,</hi> sayth he, <hi>may erre</hi> with vs, <hi>if the Pope confirm it not.</hi> So vpon the matter, the infallibility wee contend for, <hi>rests not in the representatiue Body the Council, nor in the whole Body the Church, but in the Head thereof the Pope of Rome:</hi> and if this bee so, <hi>to what end (sayth he) so</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:57798:145"/>
                  <hi>much trouble for a Generall Council? and wherein are wee neerer to vnity, if the Pope confirm it not?</hi> wee answer first, the Bishop stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at the thresholde: a Generall Council is not held by vs, to bee infallible at all, vnless it inuolue the Pope, or his confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and by consequence here are not <hi>two</hi> distinct infallibilityes for our aduersary to compare together, viz. of the Council, and the Pope, but <hi>One</hi> infallibility only, to witt of the Pope presiding in, and confirming the votes of a Generall Council, or (if you will) a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Council confirm'd by the Pope. Secondly, wee confess there are two opinions taught in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  schcoles concerning the Popes infallibility. The first, and the more con men is, that the Pope, euen without a Generall Council, is infallible in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of Fayth, when he teaches the whole Church. The second is, that he is not infallible in his definitions, faue only when he defines in, and with a Generall Council. Now had the Bishop (as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  to haue done) taken due notice of this second opinion, and proceeded in the point accordingly, these Doctours would quickly haue satissy'd his obiection, and told him. that as the Ccuncil is not infallible without the Pope, so neither is the Pope infallible without the Ccuncil; and that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility proceeds <hi>ioyntly</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But the Bishop sound it more for his turn to pass by this opinion in deep silence, framing his argument wholy against the other, as if it were the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Catholique Doctours. But of this wee haue sayd enough, hauing prosesled at the begining, that wee intended not to meddle much with any matters of priuate dispute, or opinion.

Secondly I answer more directly; this followes not with any the least shadow of consequence, in their opinion, who hold the Pope to bee fallible out of a Generall Council, as is manifest: and in the other opinion 'tis easily answer'd. For seeing the Pope, when euer he defines matters of Fayth ought to proceed maturely, and vse all meanes morally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  to find out the truth, and seeing that the deliberations, and notes of a Generall Council are the most proper, and efficacious in that kinde, it followes euidently enough, to all vnpreiudic'd, and impartiall iudgements, that the Council is called really to help, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  the Pope in that most important affaire, and which equally concerns the whole Church: also, that the aduice of the Councill in such cases is, not only a profitable, and fitt, but (speaking in a morall sense) a
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57798:145"/>
                  <hi>Necessary medium</hi> to this Holyness, wherby to make a full inspection into the matters he is to define.</p>
               <p>Nor doth this any way infringe what Doctor <hi>Stapleton,</hi> here alledged by the Bishop, affirms according to his own principles: viz. that <hi>the Pope acquires no new power, or authority, or certainty of iudgement by beeing ioyned to the Council.</hi> For though he acquires no new power, authority, or certainty of iudgement (which in this Doctours opinion he hath, whether he be <hi>with,</hi> or <hi>without</hi> a Councill) yet he may acquire some thing, which doth conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally worke, and conduce to the <hi>due exercise</hi> of that power, authority, and certainty of iudgement; to witt counsell, aduice, and conuenient information touching the matters in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie. The like is to be sayd to that of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> when he asserts, that the <hi>firmeness of a Council</hi> (to which the Relatour adds of his own, <hi>Infallibity</hi>) comes <hi>from the Pope only.</hi> For he intends to shew how the matter passes in regard of vs, who are assured no other way, of <hi>the firmeness</hi> of the Councils definition, then by the Popes confirmation alone.</p>
               <p>You will obiect, that if the Pope be infallible without the Council, and the Council, subiect to errour without the Pope, it must needs follow, that all the infallibility of Generall Councils proceeds from the Pope only; not partly from the Pope, and partly from the Council. I answer, the Assertours of that opinion may say, that Christ hath made two promises to his Church; the one, to assist her souereign Head, and Pastour, so as that, he shall neuer define any thing to be beleeu'd by all the Faythfull, but what is diuine truth. The other, so to assist Generall Councils, or the Representatiues of the Church, that they shall neuer erre in the doctrine they determin. Now those that affirme the Pope alone, or without a Generall Council, to be infallible, as well as Generall Councils, hold these two promises to haue been made by our sauiour: and that when the Pope defines in Generall Councils, his infallibility proceeds from the latter promise, by vertue of which, the definitions of Councils confirm'd by the Pope, would be infallible, although the other promise had not been made: as the Council at <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> would haue been infallible, by vertue of the infallible As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, which was promised to euery Representatiue of Christs Church, though each Apostle had not been endowed with that prerogatiue.</p>
               <p>The Bishop wonders, that <hi>they which affirme the Pope cannot erre, doe not affirm likewise that he cannot sinne.</hi> But why does he not wonder too, that Christ should giue infallibility in teaching to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> (as the Relatour cannot denie but he did) and yet not preserue him from those <hi>defects,</hi> for which St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  was truly reprebensible?</hi> Could not his Lordship obserue, that infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the Head of the Church, would be an effectuall meanes to settle Religion, confirme the Faythfull, suppress Heresies, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent differences in matter of Fayth &amp;c. seeing none would oppose the doctrine of the Pope, if they held him infallible? whereas no
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57798:146"/>
such good would accrue to the Church, in point of sanctity, though the Pope were impeccable, and held so to be by all Christians. For seeing that Prerogatiue in Christ, whome they hold to be their iudge, and to haue power to condemne them to euerlasting flames, cannot keep them in their duty, much less would the Popes impeccability doe it, though they did all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beleeue it. Lastly; as the infallibility of the Pope is in so many respects profitable for the Church, more then his immunity from sin would be: so the Assertours of it doe alledge many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and pregnant arguments from scripture, and Ecclesiasticall Writers, to proue it: but for his impeccability none can be alledged.</p>
               <p n="8">8. What can be inferred from Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> his demanding the iudgement of St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> I cannot see; vnless the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour had first shew'n, that the Pope did this, after he had pass'd a definition <hi>ex <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> in the matter. But in his allegation of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> he mistaks worst of all.

That such Astronomicall (not Thcologicall) <hi>Definitions</hi> were published an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, is manifest from <hi>Baronius:</hi> and the reason was; for that, though by the decree of the Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> all Christian Churches of Catholique Communion did celebrate Easter, not vpon the <hi>Decima quarta mensis primi,</hi> or day of the Iewish <hi>Pasche,</hi> but vpon the day following: yet by reason of the different accompts, or computation of time, through the various ending, and begining of Monthes, it fell out, that all did not celebrate it vpon the same sunday. Wherfore, to remedy this inconuenience, and reduce the obseruation of Easter, as much as might be, to a generall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, it was order'd by the Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> that by reason the Egyptians were held to be the most exact, and experienced of all other nations in the calculation of time, the Bishop of <hi>

               <p>The Bishop proceeds, asking vs in the next paragraph to this effect; that since the doctrine of the Popes infallibility, had been so easie a way, eyther to preuent all diuisions about the Fayth, or to end all controuersies of that nature, whensoeuer they should arise, <hi>why this briefe, but most necessary, Proposition THE BISHOP OF ROME CANNOT ERRE IN HIS JUDICJALL DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERMINATIONS CONCERNING THE FAYTH is not to be found in letter, or sense, in any stripture, Council, or Father of the Church?</hi> I answer first, that in the sense, wherein Catholiques maintaine the Popes infallibility to be matter of necessary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leese to all Christians, it is found (for <hi>sense</hi>) both in scripture.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe Bishop here, and in the Following paragraphs, brings in a fresh <hi>charge of errours</hi> in matter of Fayth, committed by such Generall Councils, as the Pope confirmed. The first in the endictement, is that of the <hi>Priests Jntention,</hi> which the Councils of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> (both of them confirm'd <note place="margin">§. 33. Consi'd 7. num. 11.</note> by the Pope) defin'd to be <hi>essentially necessary</hi> to the validity of a Sacrament: which the Bishop thinks is an errour. But before he goes about to proue it to be such, he forgets not to tell vs, that the Popes infallibility (of which wee talke so much) <hi>is a vayne, and vseless thing.</hi> Why I pray? His reason is, for that before
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57798:148"/>
the Church, or any particular man, can <hi>make vse of it,</hi> (that is, be settled, and confirm'd in the truth by meanes thereof) he must <hi>eyther know,</hi> or vpon <hi>sure</hi> ground, <hi>beleeue,</hi> that he is infallible. But (sayes the Bishop) this can only be <hi>beleeu'd</hi> of him, <hi>as he is St. Peter's Successour, and Bishop of Rome:</hi> of which it is impossible, in the Relatours opinion, for the Church, or any particular man, to haue such <hi>certaintie,</hi> as is sufficient to ground an infallible beleefe. Why? because the <hi>knowledge, and beleefe</hi> of this, depends vpon his beeing truly in <hi>Orders,</hi> truly a Bishop, truly a Priest, truly baptised: none of all which, according to our principles, can be <hi>certainly</hi> know'n, or beleeued; because (forsooth) <hi>the intention</hi> of him that administred these Sacraments to the Pope, or made him Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, Priest etc. can neuer be certainly know'n: and yet by the doctrine of the Councils of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> it is of absolute necessity to <hi>the validity</hi> of euery one of those Sacraments; so as without it, the Pope were neither Bishop nor Priest. This is the summe of a much longer discourse, which the Relatour makes to this purpose.</p>
               <p>In answer to which in the first place I obserue, though the Bishop leuels his argument only against the Popes infallibility, yet it hath the same force against the infallibility of the whole Church in points fundamentall. For seeing <hi>the whole</hi> Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not consist of other persons then such as are truly baptised, and that no infallible assurance can be had, that eyther all, or any one in particular is baptised, how is it possible wee should be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly</hi> sure, that there is such an assembly in the world, as the Bishop calls <hi>the Church,</hi> that is, a company of true Christians, beleeuing all points fundamentall, or absolutely necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, since wee cannot be <hi>infallibly</hi> sure, that any of them are baptised? Secondly I answer, that both a Generall Council, and the Pope, when they define any matter of Faith, doe also <hi>implicitely</hi> define that themselues are infallible, and by consequence, that both the Pope in such case, and also the Bishops that sit in Council, are persons baptised, in holy Orders, and haue all things <hi>Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> necessary for that function, which they then execute. Neither is there any more difficultie in the case of the Pope <hi>now,</hi> then there was in the time of the Prophets, and Apostles of old: whome all must grant, that with the same breath they defin'd or <hi>infallibly declar'd</hi> the seuerall articles, and points of doctrine propos'd by them to the faythfull, and their own infallibility in proposing them.</p>
               <p>Here therefore the Bishops argument hath equall force against all parties, (his own, as well as ours) and all must answer as wee doe; narnely, that it is not necessary <hi>first,</hi> to beleeue the infallibility of the proposer, to wit, <hi>prioritate temporis,</hi> or in respect of time; and <hi>afterwards</hi> the infallibility of the doctrine he proposeth: but it sufficeth to beleeue it <hi>first, prioritate naturae,</hi> so as the infallibility of the teacher be presuppos'd to the infallibility of his doctrine, as without which, this latter could not subsist, or be beleeu'd by vs. Thus, wee conceiue, the Relatours <hi>Achilles</hi> is fall'n; and truly it may seem much, that in all his discourse he should take no notice of this
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57798:148"/>
answer to this obiection, which is commonly giuen by diuines. Was it because he knew it not, or wanted a sufficient replie?</p>
               <p>But this is but, as it were, the Prologue to the Play: the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours maine business is about the <hi>Priests intention;</hi> concerning which he first of all positiuely layes down, that <hi>it is not of absolute necessitie to the essence of a Sacrament, so as to make it voyd, though the Priests thoughts should wander from his worke, at the instant of vsing the essentialls of a Sacrament; yea, or haue in him an actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to scorn the Church.</hi> After which he tells vs a story, how <hi>learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Bishop in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> disputed against the common opinion, viz. which holds <hi>the Priests intention</hi> to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: himselfe pressing the grand <hi>inconuenience,</hi> which he thinks would follow, if any such intention were held to be <hi>essentially</hi> necessary, in these words; namely that <hi>then no man should be able to secure himselfe, upon any doubt, or trouble in his conscience that he hath truly, and really been made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  of any Sacrament whatsoeuer; no, not of Baptisme: and so by consequence be left in doubt, whether he be a Christian, or no.</hi> I shall speake first to his principall assertion, which is, that <hi>the Priests intention is not absolutely necessary to the essence, or validity of the Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be not; I desire a reason of our aduersaries, why wee should not thinke a Priest consecrates the Body of Christ as much at a table, where there is wheaten bread before him, and that eyther by way of disputation, or reading the 26. Chapter of St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tthew,</hi> he pronounces the words <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> as he doth at the Altar? what is here wanting to the essence of a Sacrament, according to the Relatours principles? Here is the true forme, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum.</hi> Here is the true matter, <hi>wheaten bread.</hi> He that pronounces the Forme, is a true Priest: and yet in all mens iudgement Here's no true Sacrament made. Some thing else ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is necessary to the essence of a Sacrament beside what is here found: and what can that possibly be, if it be not the intention, which the Church requires? you will say (perhaps) that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumstances at least must shew to the standers by, that the Priest really intends to make a Sacrament. I answer first, if it be not absolutely necessary that such an intention should be had, why is it absolutely necessary, it should be signified? Secondly J deny that any such externall signification by circumstances, is <hi>essentially</hi> necessary to a Sacrament. Might not a Catholique Priest, to saue the soule of some dying infant, baptise it (if he could) without making any such signification by circumstances? Might he not vpon pretense that he had skill in Physick, and that it were good for the child to haue it's face often sprinckled with cold water, take occasion himselfe euer and anon, to be sprinkling the childs face, and at one time amongst the rest, to pronounce eyther softly, or by way of discourse, the words <hi>Ego te <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                  </hi> &amp;c. with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to conferre the Sacrament? and will any man doubt, but that the Priest doing this, out of a reall intention to baptise, the child is really baptis'd, though none of the standers by take notice, by any circumstances, of what that Priest does?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:57798:149"/>
I aske therfore, if in this case a true Sacrament be made, though no circumstances doe outwardly signify, that the Priest intends to make it, why is it not likewise so in the other case, viz. where a Priest hauing due matter (wheaten bread) before him, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> , or words of Consecration, meerly by way of discourse, or reading? Can any reason hereof be so much as imagin'd, saue only this, that in the former case the Priest hath a reall intention to make a Sacrament, or <hi>to doe</hi> what <hi>the Church</hi> doth, or what Christ did institute to be done, but in the other he hath no such intention?</p>
               <p>As for the inconuenience, which the Bishop pretends would follow out of this doctrine, viz. that <hi>no man can rest secure, that he hath been really made partaker of any Sacrament, no not of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme it selfe.</hi> I answer first, that as to the farre greater part of Christians, the inconuenience follows as much, out of the Bishops principles, as ours; they cannot be absolutely certaine that they are Baptis'd. For the Bishop himselfe holds, that both <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                  </hi> are <hi>essentially necessary,</hi> and that without them the Sacrament were voyd. But who sees not, how easie it is for the Priest, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Country-Churches, and villages amongst poore ignorant people, and in priuate howses too, when he is call'd to Christen children ready to dye, Jsay, how easie it is for the Priest, if he will be so wicked, to vitiate something pertaining to the <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls</hi> of Baptisme, without beeing perceiu'd: which if he does, the Baptisme is voyd. Secondly, as to his pretended inconuenience, that then people should not be <hi>absolutely, and infallibly</hi> certaine, that they are truly Baptis'd, is not <hi>Morall</hi> assurance, or such, as is lyable to no iust cause of doubting, and suspecting the contrary, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent? or can any man in his witts pretend to more assurance then this, touching his Baptisme? Such Metaphysicall, and rare cases therfore, as the Relatour seems to put, ought not to trouble sober men, much less to fright them, out of the true beleese of the Church: they only prouing, that wee cannot by ordinary course, without speciall reuelation, haue <hi>absolute,</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> certainty of our <hi>Justification,</hi> and <hi>Saluation;</hi> which is no way contrary to Catholique Fayth, but most consonant to it.</p>
               <p>As for those <hi>wandring Thoughts</hi> the Bishop speaks of, wee easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, they doe not nullyfy the Sacrament, because they well stand with a <hi>virtuall intention,</hi> which in the generall doctrine of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines is sufficient to the essence of the Sacrament. <hi>Virtuall intention</hi> is, when the Priest really does operate, or celebrate the Sacrament in vertue of an <hi>express</hi> intention which he had to doe it, but <hi>now,</hi> at this, or that instant, hath not, by reason of some distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of minde, or that his <hi>thoughts</hi> are vpon some other thing: which wee may illustrate by an example, or two. A Seruant vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on command of his Master vndertakes a iourney. When he first receiues the command, and is bidden to prepare himselfe, no doubt but in obedience to his Master, he hath an <hi>express intention</hi> to doe what he is commanded; which probably continues till his first setting out, and some time after. But vpon the roade he meets with

frends, lights vpon company, falls into discourse, &amp;c. so that he hath no longer that <hi>express intention,</hi> vpon the business he goes about, which at first he had; but yet he still goes on his way, by vertue of his intention to obey his master. A labouring man, that is hir'd to a dayes-worke, whilest he sings, or talks to his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourers, hath not any <hi>express intention</hi> of getting money: yet certaine it is, he labours all day in vertue of an <hi>intention</hi> to get money, though grown so flacke, that he cannot perceiue it. So is it in the administration of Sacraments, and in all other actions of like nature: wee doe not alwayes <hi>expresly</hi> intend the worke wee doe, (for that's <hi>morally</hi> impossible) but wee doe alwayes <hi>virtually</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, if euer wee went seriously, and deliberately about it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til wee doe <hi>expresly,</hi> and <hi>actually</hi> cease, or intend the contrary. For seeing the hand moues not without some impulse of the will, nor the will act at any time without some motiue represented by the vnderstanding, 'tis cleere in all these cases, that the motiue, which was first represented to the will, and by which the wil was first of all moued, doth stil remaine, and operate vpon the will, though so obscurely, and vnperceiuedly, by reason of other obiects interuening, that it can hardly be discerned to moue vs.</p>
               <p>Let the Priest therefore be neuer so much distracted in his thoughts, and <hi>wander,</hi> at the instant of applying the matter, and forme of the Sacrament; if he begun the action, not with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to deride the Church, but to doe what is vsuall for Christs Ministers to doe in the like occasions, he makes a true Sacrament by virtue of that first intention, though he does not cleerly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it. Now as for the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Bishop wee answer, that the most Eminent <hi>Sforza Palauicino,</hi> late of the Societie of <hi>IESVS,</hi> and <note place="margin">Parte 1. lib. 9. cap. 6.</note> now Cardinal, in his elaborate and learned tomes of the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> obserues, that the Council, in their definition touching the <hi>Priests intention</hi> in the Sacrament, aym'd only at the condemning of that errour of <hi>Luther,</hi> which denyes all vertue to the Sacrament, and auerrs it to haue its full effect from the Receiuers Fayth alone; so farre, as though the whole action were done in mockage, and derision of the Church, yet it should be to him that receiues it, a true Sacrament. This doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine the Council expresly condemn'd, as indeed it deseru'd, beeing so apparently vnsuitable both to the wisdome of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and the <hi>Decorum</hi> of his Church, contrary to the vniuersall apprehension of the Faythfull, and repugnant to the nature of all other humane actions.</p>
               <p>But as for <hi>Catharinus</hi> (who is the person the Relatour meanes by the <hi>Neapolitan Bishop,</hi> who as his Lordship sayes, <hi>disputed so learnedly</hi> against the common opinion, in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>) the Cardinal aboue mention'd, is cleere of opinion, that the Council decreed nothing against him; because he deny'd not an intention to be necessary in the Sacrament, but only explicated the thing differently from the common way of schole-men: into which dispute neither the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> nor <hi>Trent</hi> thought it necessary to engage; but defin'd in generall terms, that in the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57798:150"/>
Minister of the Sacrament, an <hi>intention</hi> was requir'd <hi>faciendi quod facit Ecclesia</hi> (of <hi>doing</hi> what <hi>the Church</hi> doth) which <hi>Catharinus</hi> did not deny.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus haue wee (<hi>I</hi> hope) sufficiently answer'd the Bishops first <hi>Charge of Errour,</hi> against Generall Councils confirm'd by the Pope. Before he brings in the second, he presents the Reader with such a quaint subtletie against the Popes <hi>Right</hi> to confirme them, and the necessity wee maintaine of their beeing so <hi>confirm'd</hi> by him, that wee cannot well auoid taking notice of it. Thus then he argues. <hi>Noe Councill is confirm'd till it be finished: and when 'tis</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. num 13.</note> 
                  <hi>finished, euen before the Popes confirmation be putt to it, eyther it hath erred, or it hath not erred. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>  it hath erred, the Pope ought not to confirme it; and if he doe, 'tis a voyd Acte: for no power can make Falsehood Truth. If it hath not erred, then it was true before the Pope confirm'd it: so his Confirmation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  nothing but his own assent.</hi> Thus the Relatour. But I answer, wee must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish in the business. A Generall Council makes a definition in matter, of Fayth, eyther, with <hi>the ioynt consent</hi> of the Pope, or without it. By defining <hi>with</hi> the Popes ioynt consent I vnderstand, that eyther the Pope be personally present in the Council, and concurre with it, (which happens but seldome) or that his Legats doe it, following the Popes instruction: in eyther of these cases the definition, of a Generall Council is vnquestionably infallible. By defining <hi>without</hi> the Popes consent, I meane, when neither the Pope is present, in the Council, nor haue the Legats that are present any instruction from the Sea Apostolique touching the matter; and by consequence doe not, in this case, so fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the chiefe Pastour of the Church, but that this further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation is necessary. Jn this therfore, and in all other like cases, 'tis necessary, that the Pope doe actually confirme the Decrees of Generall Councils, to make them <hi>infallible;</hi> or that it may be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly certaine</hi> to vs, that such, or such a Generall Council err'd not in any of its definitions concerning matter of Fayth.</p>
               <p>So that Exclusiuely to the Popes consent or confirmation wee can neuer be <hi>infallibly</hi> certain which hath happened, till the Pope ioynes, and adds his confirmation to the Decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Wee may express the matter in some sort by the kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to Acts of Parlament. <hi>Le Roy veut,</hi> added to a Bill presented from both Howses, makes it a binding Law to the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; which before it, was not. Soe the Popes consent, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation added to the definitions of Generall Councils, makes them articles of Christian Beleefe no longer now to be questioned, much less contradicted by any, but absolutely to be beleeu'd with infallible Fayth. Now this presupposed, wee answer the Relatours argument directly, thus.</p>
               <p>To the first part of it, <hi>if the Councill erred</hi> &amp;c. wee agree with him; the Pope ought not to confirme the Decree: adding more ouer, that it is impossible he should confirme it. And to the second viz. that <hi>if it erred not,</hi> then the definition <hi>was true, before the Pope confirm'd it,</hi> wee confess this also, for the Popes confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57798:150"/>
makes not the definition to be <hi>true</hi> in it selfe, but it makes vs <hi>infallibly certaine,</hi> that it is true. Gods Reuelation it selfe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witt of the things deliuer'd in scripture, makes them not to be true <hi>in themselues;</hi> for so they are, and were, whether he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed them, or no; but it makes them infallible truths <hi>to vs,</hi> or such truths, as both may, and must be infallibly beleeu'd by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. So wee say, the doctrine of Generall Councils was true in it selfe before the Popes confirmation, but it was not so sufficiently, and infallibly declar'd, that it could be beleeu'd with an act of true Christian Fayth: that Prerogatiue belonging to Decrees of Generall Councils, only as they include the Head of the Church, and not otherwise. But whereas then the Bishop inferrs, that <hi>the Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation adds nothing, but only his own consent</hi> to the Councils decree: wee vtterly deny the consequence; especially vnderstanding it in the Relatours sense, viz. for no more then the <hi>Assent</hi> of some other single Bishop or Patriarch. For wee auerre that it is the assent of the Chiefe Pastour of the Church, absolutely necessary to the compleating, and giuing full force to the acts of such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; and also that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  
                  <hi>infallibility,</hi> or absolute <hi>Certaintie</hi> of truth, to all their decrees in matter of Fayth: which surely is more then <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Well. But now the Relatour aduances againe with his instances; to witt, of pretended errours in the doctrine of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councils confirm'd by the Pope: thence concluding against vs, that euen the Popes confirmation doth not make the doctrine of such Councils, infallible. The errour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>  obiects, is against the <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> confirm'd by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third; where it teacheth <hi>that Christ is present by way of Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;</hi> which, as the Bishop affirms, <hi>was neuer heard of, in the Church before this Council; nor can it,</hi> (Sayth he) <hi>be prou'd by Scripture, and taken properly, is inconsistent with the grounds of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> But first, what a strange manner of proceeding is this, to assert a point of so great importance without soluing, or so much as taking notice of the pregnant proofs our Authours bring, both out of scripture, and Fathers, to the contrary of what he so mainly affirmes? The Relatour should not haue <hi>sayd,</hi> but <hi>prou'd,</hi> that Transubstantiation is an <hi>errour contrary to scripture,</hi> and not consistent with the <hi>grounds of Christian Religion:</hi> at least he should haue cleer'd his own Assertion, and in some manner, or other haue explain'd, how Transubstantiation may be <hi>taken impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,</hi> as his words insinuate. But surely this was a conception of the Bishops, so <hi>new</hi> and <hi>singular,</hi> that 'twill hardly finde any defendants.

Wee grant, that in ancient times, when the number of Christians was but small, it was the ordinary custome for all that would, (the Laity, as well as others) to receiue the Eucharist <hi>in both kindes:</hi> but wee auerre, this custome proceeded meerly out of <hi>free denotion,</hi> and not out of any beleefe, that it was <hi>absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> so to doe, by vertue of <hi>Christs precept:</hi> or that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the substance of Christs institution to doe otherwise. This therfore euinces not that, which the Bishop was obliged to proue; namely, that receiuing <hi>vnder one kinde only,</hi> is an errour contrary to the institution and intention of Christ; but rather the contrary to that is manifest from the practice of the Church, which always, euen in the first fiue, or six hundred years, allowed it publiquely to be taken vnder the forme of bread only, and that, as well in the Church, as out of it: as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> likewise more largely shews, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Eucharist. cap.</hi> 24. Whose authorities the Bishop shoul haue taken notice of, and not thought it sufficient only to say; <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> is an <hi>errour,</hi> and <hi>contrary to Christs institution,</hi> without shew of proofe. For wee tell him, the vniuersall practice of the Church is a better interpreter of Christs institution, then the Bishop, or any priuate person whatsoeuer: and so wee doubt not, but all sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Christians (not too much peruerted with Hereticall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice) will in time acknowledge. Howeuer, the Relatour, by his silence as to this particular, giues vs leaue to goe on, and consider his fourth obiected errour, viz. <hi>Inuocation of Saynts;</hi> to which he adds a fift also, <hi>Adoration,</hi> or worship <hi>of Images:</hi> both of them (wee confess) beeing points admitted, and defin'd by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which the Pope confirm'd.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="6">6. But it is further vrged, that wee pray to God, and desire him <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> to heare our prayers <hi>for the merits of Saynts:</hi> which the Bishop thinks doth not only make the Saynts <hi>Mediatours of Intercession,</hi> but euen <hi>sharers in the Mediation of Redemption.</hi> He tells vs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that such <hi>Prayers as these stand</hi> (<hi>not without great scandall to Christ, and Christianity</hi>) <hi>vsed, and authorised to be vsed in the Missal.</hi> I answer first; our aduersarie might as well haue taken offence at some prayers vsed in scripture; where, though the word <hi>Merits</hi> be not expresly mention'd, yet the full sense, and meaning thereof is necessarily implyed and vnderstood, as much, as in those prayers of the Church, which he will seeme so much to stumble at. For example: doth not <hi>Salomon, Psalm.</hi> 132. pray to God to heare him in effect <hi>for the Merits</hi> of his Father <hi>Dauid</hi> deceased, when he sayth <hi>Memento, Domine, Dauid et omnis Mansuetudinis eius?</hi> (<hi>Lord, remember DAVID, and all his MEEKENESS, etc.</hi> what, J pray you, is this but to desire, that God would remember to <hi>Salomons</hi> benefitt, and good, not only his own <hi>Couenant,</hi> and <hi>Promise</hi> made to <hi>Dauid</hi> (as Protestants vainly pretend, without <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 13, Baruch. 3: 4. Isa. 38: 3. † 63: 17. † 65. 8.</note> any the least ground from the Text) but <hi>Dauids Pietie and vertue,</hi> by which he was acceptable to God? For which reason also, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some particular instances thereof giuen, he adds againe in his prayer, <hi>Propter Dauid seruum tuum, etc. For thy Seruant DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDS sake</hi> (as euen the english Protestant Translation reads it) <hi>turn not away the face of thine Anointed.</hi> The like was done by <hi>Daniel</hi> (Dan. 13. by <hi>Moyses</hi> also, <hi>Hieremias,</hi> and other Prophets, praying vnto God, and desiring their petitions might be heard, for <hi>Abraham,</hi> for <hi>Isaack,</hi> and for <hi>Jsraels</hi> sake, and for the sakes of other holy men, who had liu'd before, and been in their times persons acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>Yea to doe this, was the generall custome of the Primitiue Church, witnessed by St. <hi>Austin,</hi> in his <note n="*" place="margin">Quaest. 149.</note> Questions vpon Exodus; where speaking of <hi>Moyses</hi> his praying, and obtaining pardon of God, for that great sinne of the Israelites in making the <hi>golden Calfe,</hi> he tells vs, that by such an example wee are put in minde, <hi>that when our own Merits depress vs with feare that God doth not loue vs, wee may be encouraged, and holpen BY THE MERITS of those whome he doth loue.</hi>

And if it be no iniury to the force, and vertue of Christs Intercession, that the Saynts doe pray and interceede for vs, through Christs merits, why should it be accounted an iniury to his Passion, that the Saynts merits, (or Good works) be held to haue force, to procure good things from God, both for themselues, and vs, yet not otherwise, then through the merits of Christ, and for his sake?</p>
               <p>Jn vaine therfore doth the Relatour goe about to peruert the sense of the prayers of the Church in the Missal; which, with all the Sophistrie he can vse, he shall neuer be able to shew, but <note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 1. de Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. cap. 4. §. 3.</note> to be most consonant to Christian doctrine, and pietie. And where as, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is tax'd for calling the Saynts <hi>our Redeemers,</hi> it is no fault in the Cardinal, but a rashness in the Bishop. For both <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himselfe professeth, they can only be so called in a <hi>large sense, and improper manner of speaking,</hi> and confirms his assertion by a like passage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who sayes of himselfe (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9, 23.) that to <hi>all men</hi> he became <hi>all things, that he might SAVE</hi>

               </p>
               <p>He taxes the Cardinall likewise for styling the Saynts <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina:</hi> which word he will haue always to signifie, eyther <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> or at least <hi>the Power of God, or an Oracle of God.</hi> Be it so.

                  <hi>the Power of God?</hi> and can it be thought so impious, and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to style the Saynts <hi>Powers of God,</hi> seeing it is vndenyable, that God vseth them as the instruments of his <hi>Power,</hi> and by them worketh many powerfull, and strange effects? Are not the Angels for this very reason called <hi>Powers of God,</hi> and the Gospell it selfe, <hi>the Power of God to Saluation?</hi> But this is the Bishops custome, now, and then to haue a fling at <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> whether he hit, or miss.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Against <hi>the Adoration of Images</hi> the Bishop is very bitter; so as to tell vs, <hi>the Modern Church of Rome is too like Paganisme in the practice of it, and driuen to scarce intellible subtleties in her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>writings, that defend it.</hi> The <hi>Modern</hi> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is thus, and thus to blame, sayth the Bishop. But J pray tell vs, wherein doe the <hi>Modern,</hi> and <hi>Ancient</hi> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> differ touching this point? What does the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> teach concerning the worship of Jmages, more then the second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did; which was celebrated little less then nine hundred yeares agoe, and therfore (surely) not to be accounted Modern? The Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> though it decreed that the Jmages of Christ, and his Saynts should be had in <hi>veneration, and due reuerence</hi> outwardly giuen to them, yet it expresly forbad they should be worshiped with <hi>Diuine</hi> worship, or such as was proper, and due to God alone. Doth the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Church now, teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? heare, if you please, the Prelats themselues speake in that Council.</p>
               <p>The Holy Council <hi>(say they)</hi> commands all Bishops, and all others <note place="margin">Conc. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Sess. 25.</note> who haue the office, and care of teaching, that they diligently instruct faythfull people, teaching them that the Images of Christ, of the Virgin Mother of God, and of other Saynts, are to be bad and retained, especially in Churches; and that due honour, and veneration is to be giuen to them: not that one should beleeue any Diuinity to be in them, or Power, for which they are to be worshiped; or that one should aske any thing of them, or put confidence in them, as anciently the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did, who placed their hope in Idolls: but because the honour that is done to them, redounds to those, whome they represent. So that by the Images wee kiss, and before which wee vncouer our heads, and prostrate our selues, wee worship Christ, and his Saynts, whose simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes they are: which doctrine <hi>(say the Fathers abouesayd)</hi> is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the Decrees of Councils, especially of the second of Nice. <hi>And a little after they adde.</hi> If it happen at any time that the histories, or passages, of holy Scripture be express'd, or figur'd out in pictures, whensoeuer it may be thought expedient for the vnlearned, lett them be taught, that the Diuinity (or God himselfe) is not painted therby, nor can be seen with bodily eyes, nor represented by any colours, or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
               <p>J thought it not amiss to sett down the words of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at large; as beeing sufficient, if duly considered, to stop our aduersaries mouthes, and silence their calumnies against vs for euer, in this particular, without any recourse to <hi>subtleties,</hi> and nice distinctions, as the Relatour pretends wee are forc'd to doe. For what is here but plaine, and easie? Behold in the first place,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57798:154"/>
express caution and prohibition, that wee attribute noe kinde of Diuinity to Images, but only worship them <hi>with such honour, and veneration, as is due to them.</hi> Behold in the second place; all Bishops, with others that haue the cure of soules vnder them, strictly requir'd to teach the faythfull no more, then this plaine, and secure doctrine: and that they take care to preuent, as much as in them lyeth, what euer danger, or inconuenience may possibly happen to their people, eyther by scandalous practises, or (perhaps) curious, and misinterpretable assertions of priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in the matter of Images. And Protestants (if they had cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) would iudge the best, namely, that the Ordinary Pastours of the Church doe themselues, effectually obey the Council herein, and the people, them: and not condemne the whole Church (Pastours, and people together) of Paganish Idolatrie, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, vpon meere surmises, as the Relatour more then seems to doe in this place: especially considering, that if <hi>neglect,</hi> or <hi>Disobedience</hi> be eyther in Pastours, or people, it is not the Churches, but their own personall fault who are guilty of it; the Church hauing taken the best, and most sufficient order that shee can, for the right instruction of those that belong to her.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Wee acknowledge no less then the Bishop, the Church hath always had great care to avoyd the least resemblance with Paganisme in any thing: and that therfore his Lordship might <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> well note (as he doth in the Margent) <hi>that the Christians in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus his time, were MVCH TROVBLED vpon a false report that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Optat. lib 3. cont. Parmen.</note> 
                  <hi>some were coming to sett an Jmage vpon their Altar,</hi> viz. immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the Oblation of the B. Eucharist was to be celebrated thereon. But what kinde of <hi>Jmage</hi> this was, appears not in any sort by <hi>Optatus</hi> his text.

               <p>Adde hereunto the <hi>Prouiso,</hi> which this Author giues in the <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> same chapter; which is, that wee ought to aske nothing of the Saynts, no not of our B.

Thus therfore, wee hope, this Author (<hi>Lla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>) his intention, and true meaning is cleer'd of what the Bishop imputes to him: but it will not be amiss to take notice also, how weakely the Bishops illation is made out of the sayd Authors words. Because <hi>Llamas</hi> writes <hi>that the Images of Christ are not to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  as if there were Diuinity in them, as they are materiall things made by art, but only as they represent Christ, and the Saynts,</hi> the Relatour inferrs thus: <hi>So then belike, according to the Diuinity of this Casuist, a man may worship Images, AND ASKE OF THEM, AND PVT TRVST IN THEM, as they represent Christ, and his Saynts.</hi> But what consequence is this? How does it follow, that wee may <hi>aske of Images,</hi> and <hi>put our trust in them,</hi> as they represent Christ, and his Saynts, because wee may worship them, as they represent Christ, and his Saynts? wee many times loue, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence a picture for the person it represents; and yet noe body is so foolish, as to <hi>aske</hi> any thing of it, as it represents that person. Wee shew a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57798:156"/>
ciuill inuocation, nor place confidence in them, as they relate to the king. Why therfore must it follow, that wee may call vpon pictures, or Jmages, as they represent our Sauiour, or the Saints, because they may be honour'd, or worshiped, as they doe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them?</p>
               <p>Nor is it less ridiculous, what the Bishop adds in pursuance of his discourse; namely, his resoluing this proposition of <hi>Llamas. The Images of Christ, and the Saynts are to be worshiped, not as if there were any Diuinity, in them, as they are materiall things made by arte, but as they represent Christ and his Saynts,</hi> into this other: <hi>The Images, of Christ, and his Saynts, as they represent their Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars, haue Deity, or Diuinity in them;</hi> making them both to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie the same thing. For why might he not as well haue resolu'd this proposition? <hi>The kings picture is to be honour'd, not as if there were Souereign Authority in it, as it is a materiall thing made by arte, but as it represents the king,</hi> into this other. <hi>The kings picture, as it represents its Exemplar, hath Souereign Authority in it.</hi> The Bishop here, surely, giues the Reader more cause to suspect his iudgement touching the interpretation of <hi>Llamas,</hi> then vpon his interpretation of him to taxe our Church of Idolatric.</p>
               <p>I conclude it therfore most certain, and indubitable, that <hi>Llamas,</hi> in the wordes cited by the Relatour, intended noe more, then to signifie, that all worship done to Jmages, was <hi>Relatiue,</hi> and not <hi>Absolute;</hi> which is to say, that it was exhibited to them, not for their own, but for their <hi>exemplars</hi> sake, which they represent: and that wee could be heard in our prayers, and expect releefe, not from the Jmages, but from the Prototypes: which, as it is the plaine doctrine of the Church, declar'd by the Councils of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> so 'tis all, that in this question I haue vndertaken to defend.</p>

                  <hi>wittingly, and willingly to the gross superstitions of the Romish Church.</hi> Js not this plainly to confess, that euen those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who doe willingly, and knowingly <hi>associate</hi> themselues to the <hi>gross superstitions</hi> of that Church, may <hi>possibly</hi> be saued, though not indeed as they doe this, but as they are Christians, and beleeue in the Foundation, Christ? Lastly, when he asks, as it were in anger, <hi>would you haue vs as malicious, or at least as rash, as your selues are to vs, and deny you so much as possibility of Saluation? Euen Mistaken Charity</hi> (<hi>if such it were</hi>) <hi>is farre better then none at all. And if the MISTAKEN be ours, the NONE is yours etc.</hi> Doth he not cleerly pretend by this to be more <hi>Charitable,</hi> that is, to grant more to vs Catholiques in this particular of beeing sau'd, then wee doe to them? Seeing then, that euen wee Catholiques grant possibility of Saluation to those, who ioyne with the Protestant Church, if theyr ignorance be <hi>inuincible;</hi> wee cannot but suppose, his pretended charity grants more to vs; namely, that there is possibility of beeing sau'd to those that ioyne with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, though their ignorance be not inuincible and though all, or the chiefe motiues, which Protestants bring; against vs, be neuer so sufficiently propos'd to them.</p>
               <p>Now if, on the one side, both Catholiques and Protestants, agree in this, that such as hold all the opinions of our Church, and continue in them till death, notwithstanding their beeing thoroughly acquainted with all the contrary reasons and doctrine of Protestants, may attayne Saluation; and if, on the other side, all Catholiques, as well those that now are, as the infinite multitude which hath been since a thousand yeares last past, according to Protestants own account and confession, doe deny possibility of beeing sau'd to such as liue, and dye in the Protestant Church, except in case of inuincible ignorance, who can doubt, but that our Church is cleerly <hi>the safer</hi> way of the two to Saluation? and therfore in prudence to be embraced, rather then that of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But what shall wee say to those Protestants, who grant no more to vs, then wee doe to them in order to Saluation? How shall those among our Aduersaries be conuinc'd, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and Religion is the <hi>safer</hi> way to Heauen, who will allow none of our Religion to be in a capacity to Saluation, but such, as are in no capacity of knowing, and vnderstanding their errours? J might bring many arguments to conuince them in this point; but for breuity sake J shall confine my selfe to these only, which follow.</p>
               <p>That Church and Religion is the <hi>more safe</hi> way to Saluation, in which many are saued according to the principles which are granted on both sides, then an other, in which many are sau'd only according to the principles, or doctrine, of one party; but very few, or none according to the doctrine of the other.</p>
               <p>But in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and Religion many are sau'd according to the principles which are granted on both sides, viz.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57798:158"/>
both by Catholiques, and Protestants: and in the Protestant Church many are saued only according to the principles, and doctrine of Protestants, but very few, or none according to the doctrine of Catholiques.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and Religion is a <hi>safer</hi> way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, then the Church, and religion of Protestants.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> I'conceiue none will deny. The <hi>Minor</hi> I proue thus. In the Catholique Church 'tis euident that many, beeing to depart out of this life, doe receiue the Sacrament of Pennance. These, according to the doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, are saued, because by vertue of this Sacrament they receiue the grace of Iustification, wherby of sinners, they are made the sons of God. and Heires of Eternall life: nor can they be deny'd to be sau'd, according to the doctrine of Protestants, seeing they beleeue in Christ their Redeemer, they confide in Gods Goodness and mercy for the pardon of their sins, they truly repent of them, and truly purpose for the future to amend their liues: which is all, that Protestant doctrine requires to make men partakers of Christs sanctifying Grace; and is also necessarily requir'd by Catholiques, to make them free subiects for the Sacrament of pennance. Who can therfore doubt but that all such persons are saued, both according to the doctrine of Catholiques, and Protestants too? J say, who can rationally, and with charity doubt, but that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, generally speaking, beeing taught, that Fayth, Hope, true repentance for sins past, and a purpose of amendment, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the due receiuing of the Sacrament of pennance, doe not omitt to exercise those acts with all necessary diligence, and sincerity, especially when they are to prepare themselues against that dreadfull passage to Eternity.</p>
               <p>That they may exercise such acts, if they will, by the help of Gods ordinary Grace, and by exercising them, be effectually sau'd the Bishop himselfe cannot deny, seeing he grants so much to the Donatists themselues, whom he confesses at least to haue been Schismatiques, iustly condemn'd by the Orthodox Church, and in some respects <note n="*" place="margin">§. 35. punct. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>in greater danger of damnation, then</hi> wee <hi>Romanists.</hi> His words are these. <note n="a" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>A plaine bonest Donatist, hauing, as is confessed, true Baptisme, and holding the Foundation, as for ought I know, the Donatists did, and repenting of what euer was sinne in him, and would haue repented of the Schisme, had it been know'n to him, might be saued.</hi> Neither will (J suppose) any other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant deny vs the possibility of exercising such acts; seeing they all grant, that with <hi>involuntary</hi> errours, true Fayth and repentanoe may stand; and haue no sufficient reason to thinke, that our errours at death, are voluntary and willfull; or that wee doe willfully omitt any thing, that wee beleeue to be necessary for the attaining of Saluation.</p>
               <p>But now, according to the doctrine of Catholiques, there are very few, or none, among Protestants, that escape damnation, or that are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> , if they liue, and dye out of the Communion of our Church. Not that it is a point of our beleese, that many
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57798:158"/>
Protestants shall be damn'd precisely vpon the account of beeing Heretiques, (because heresie is an obstinate, and <hi>willfull</hi> errour against Fayth; and wee cannot easily, much less infallibly determin, whose errours are <hi>willfull</hi>) but because there are none, or surely but very few amongst them, but are guilty of mortall sinne against Gods Commandements; and because the ordinary meanes they vse, and prescribe, is not according to our principles, sufficient to expiate, and blott out such sinne. 'Tis well know'n, that though Protestants, to obtaine Saluation, beleeue in Christ, trust in his merits, and repent of their sins, yet they doe it not purely out of a perfect loue of God, so as to hate sin aboue all euills, meerly as it is an offence against the Diuine Maiestie, and to preferre God, and his holy Commandements before our selues, and all other creatures, (for this is a very hard, and rare act euen amongst the best of Christians) but at best, vpon inferiour, and lower motiues (as the manner of most men is to doe) viz. in consideration of the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Heauen, as it is their own particular good, or for the auoyding of the paines of Hell, as it is their particular, and chiefest harme.</p>
               <p>Now, according to our doctrine, such kinde of repentance as this, is no sufficient remedy to blott out sinne, vnless it be ioyn'd wich the Sacrament of pennance, viz. Confession and Priestly Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, &amp;c. which Protestants reiect. J say, without the Sacrament of pennance actually, and duly recoin'd, all Catholiques hold, that neither Fayth, nor Hope, nor any repentance, or sorrow for sinne, can saue vs, but that only which is ioyned with a perfect loue of God, wherby wee are dispos'd to loose all, and suffer all that can be imagin'd, rather then to offend God; yea though there were indeed neither Heauen to reward vs, nor Hell to punish vs: which beeing a thing so hard to be found, especially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  such, as beleeue a man is iustifyed by Fayth only, it followes euidently, that in our doctrine, very few, or no Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants are saued. The Conclusion therfore is vndenyable, that our Church is a <hi>safer</hi> way to Salua ion, then that of Protestants,</p>
               <p>My second Argument is this. That Church, and Religion which affords all necessary meanes of Saluation, is a <hi>safer</hi> way to Saluation, then an other which does not.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and Religion affords all necessary meanes of Saluation; and the Protestant doth not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and Religion is a <hi>safer</hi> way to Saluation, then the Church and Religion. of Protestants.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident. The <hi>Minor</hi> consists of two parts; which I shall proue in order.</p>
               <p>The First, which is, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and Religion affords all necessary meanes of Saluation, appeares partly by the confession of Protestants themselues, who acknowledge generally, that in our Church, and Religion are contained all Foundamentall points; that is, all things absolutely necessary to Saluation: and partly, because it cannot be proued, that any thing is of absolute
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57798:159"/>
necessity, in order to Saluation, which is not found in our Churches Communion. The second, that Protestants standing to their owne principles, neither haue, nor can haue things necessary for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, J proue by this one Argument.</p>
               <p>Jt is certaine that diuine Fayth necessary to Saluation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these places of Holy Writt, <hi>sine fide impossibile est placere Deo, Hebr.</hi> 11. <hi>(without Fayth it is impossible to please God) Qui non crediderit, condemnabitur. Marc.</hi> 16. <hi>(He that beleeueth not, shall be damned.)</hi> 'Tis likewise certaine, that this diuine Fayth must be <hi>firme, sure,</hi> and without <hi>doubt,</hi> or <hi>hesitation:</hi> in so much that if an Angel from Heauen should preach the contrary to what wee beleeue, it ought not to be altered, according to that of the Apostle. <hi>Galat.</hi> 1. 8. Now how is it possible, that Protestants stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their principles, should haue this <hi>firme, Sure,</hi> and <hi>vndoubting</hi> Fayth, concerning any mysterie of Religion? They will say vpon the Authority of Gods Reuelation, or the <hi>written word.</hi> But Jaske, how is it possible for them to beleeue any diuine truth <hi>firmly, certainly,</hi> and <hi>infallibly</hi> for the Authority of scripture or the <hi>written word,</hi> vnless they doe first <hi>firmly, certainly,</hi> and <hi>infallibly</hi> beleeue, that scripture is the true word of God, and that the sense of the words is such as they vnderstand? and how can they beleeue this most firmly, and certainly, if they neither are, nor can be <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly</hi> sure, according to their own principles, that the Church erreth not in deliuering such, and such bookes for Canonicall scripture? or that those passages, vpon which they ground their beleefe, are the very same with the Originall Text; or in case they vnderstand not the Originalls, that there hath been no errour committed in the Translation of them? yea doe they not hold principles absolutely inconsistent with <hi>this certainty,</hi> when they teach, that not only priuate men, but Generall Councils, and euen the whole Church may erre in matters of great consequence? How can they then be sure, that the words of scripture, for which they beleeue the Diuinity of Christ (for example) are to be vnderstood in that sense, in which themselues vnderstand them, and not in the sense, which the <hi>Arians</hi> put vpon them? If Generall Councils, and the whole Church, may erre in expounding scripture, what certainty of beleefe can wee haue in this, and in diuerse other like points?</p>
               <p>Jf it be answered, that Christs Diuinity is a <hi>Fundamentall</hi> point, and that in <hi>Fundamentall</hi> points wee must beleeue the Church; J reply, this answer satisfies not the difficulty. For J aske, vpon what ground doe wee beleeue it to be a Fundamentall point? if because the whole Church teaches it to be so, and the whole Church cannot erre in points Fundamentall, I answer, it must first be proued, that the <hi>Arians</hi> are no part of the whole Church; for if they be a part of it, the whole Church doth not teach it. To say the <hi>Arians</hi> are noe part of the whole Church, because they erre in Christs Diuinity, which is a point Fundamentall, is to suppose that for certaine, which is principally in question. That Christs Diuinity therfore is a point Fundamentall, must be prou'd some other way, then by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57798:159"/>
of the whole Church. If that way be scripture, the former difficultie returns, viz. how a man shall be sure, according to Protestant principles, that scripture is to be vnderstood in the Catholique sense, and not in the sense of <hi>Arians.</hi> And if it be any other way beside scripture, according to Protestant principles, it will not be infallible, but subiect to errour, and consequently will not be sufficient to ground infallible certainty. 'Tis euident therfore, that Protestants, standing to their grounds, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue eyther the Trinity, or Christs Diuinity, and Incarnation, or the Redemption of mankinde by his death, or any other mysterie and point of Fayth with that firmeness and certaintie, which is requisite to an Acte of Fayth: nay it followes, that they cannot be altogether sure of these mysteries of Christian Religion, as they are, or may be of things related euen by heathen Historians; seeing more agree, that those things are true, then that the sense of scripture, in those controuerted points, is such as Protestants vnderstand.</p>
               <p>These Arguments wee conceiue sufficient to conuince any rationall vnderstanding, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and Religion is a <hi>safer</hi> way to saluation, then that of Protestants. Lett vs now take notice of the Bishops answers, and assertions touching this question.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas therfore Protestants doe commonly taxe vs for want of Charity, because wee generally deny Saluation to those that are out of our Church, A. C. proued that this denyall, (besides the threatnings of Christ, and the Holy Fathers denounced against all such, as are not within the Communion of the true Church) is grounded euen vpon Charity; it beeing farre more charitable to forewarn a man plainly of a danger, then to let him run into it, through a false security. <hi>There is but one true Fayth</hi> (Sayth he) <note place="margin">A.C. pag. 650</note> 
                  <hi>and one true Church, out of which is no Saluation; and he that will not heare this Church, lett him be vnto the</hi> (Sayth Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) Matth. 18. 17. <hi>as an Heathen and Publican.</hi> If Saluation then may be had in our Church, as the Bishop with other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants consessed; and there be noe <hi>true</hi> Church, nor <hi>true</hi> Fayth, but <hi>one,</hi> in, and by which Saluation may be had, (as is likewise confessed) it followes, that out of our Church there is noe Saluation to be hoped for, and consequently, that it is no want of Charity in vs to, tell Protestants of this, but rather want of light, and good vnderstanding in them, to thinke our admonition to be vncharitable. The Bishop himselfe confesses, <hi>that he, who will not</hi>

Now that by the ioynt principles, or doctrine both of Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques and Protestants, our Religion, or Fayth, is <hi>the safer</hi> way, wee haue already prou'd in our first Argument: and that Protestants may haue sufficient motiues to alter, and depose their present iudgement touching our pretended errours, whensoeuer they will attend to them, is sufficiently euidenced from hence; seeing, an infinite multitude of persons, who haue as good naturall witts as themselues, as tender consciences as themselues, haue read, and ponder'd the controuerted passages of scripture as much as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, vnderstand all contrary reasons, and obiections, as well as themselues, yet belecue with absolute certainty, as <hi>diuine Truths,</hi> those very points, which Protestants conceiue to be errours.</p>

If this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be good, then euen for this consent, it is safer Communicating with the Church of England, then with the Roman, and Lutheran: because all agree in this truth, not in any other opinion.</hi> Here are many words spent to small purpose. For first, can a man be sayd, in any true sense, to communicate <hi>rather</hi> with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then with the <hi>Roman,</hi> or <hi>Lutheran,</hi> only by beleeuing that, where in they all agree? and yet the Bishops Argument supposes this.

               <p>That which the Relatour adds to this, is no less absurd. He cites <hi>

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57798:161"/>
to admire the force of truth, which was able to draw this confession from an aduersarie. But J answer, what matter is it, though <hi>Suarez</hi> had really taught it not to be <hi>simply necessary</hi> to Saluation to beleeue Transubstantiation? were that sufficient ground to say, that he agreed with Protestants against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? must he needs thinke that Transubstantiation is an errour, or noc point of Catholique Fayth, because he held it not <hi>Simply necessary</hi> to Saluation? very true it is, all Catholiques teach that whatsoeuer is defin'd by the Church, is an article of Fayth, which may neither be doubted of, nor disputed: yet no man thinks 'tis <hi>simply necessary</hi> to Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to beleeue euery point so defined, by an express act.</p>
               <p>A Protestant, versed in scripture, would thinke it a sinne, if he should deny that Moyses his rod was turned into a Serpent: yet, J conceiue, he will hardly say, that it <hi>is Simply necessary</hi> to Saluation; or that he is bound, absolutely Speaking, to beleeue it with an express act of Fayth vnder paine of damnation. But the truth is, <hi>Suarez,</hi> speaks to no such purpose, as the Bishop alledges him. He confesses indeed, that the manner of explicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the change, or conuersion, that is made in the B. Sacrament, which Schoole-men vse, is no necessary part of the doctrine of Fayth in that particular, because it depends vpon Physicall and Metaphylicall principles; but as for the conuersion it selfe (or Transubstantiation) it is most euident, that he holds it for a point of Fayth, which to deny were Heresie. His words are these, in the section immediately precedent to that which the Bishop quotes. <note n="a" place="margin">Secundò infero, si quis confiteatur praesentiam corporis Xti, et absentiam panis, neget tamen veram conuersione vnius in ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud, in Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim labi: quia Ecclesia.

               <p>His quarrel with <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is no less impertinent; whome he censures (forsooth) of <hi>tediousness,</hi> and <hi>for making</hi> (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues) <hi>an intricate, and almost inexplicable discourse aboute an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductiue conuersion; a thing, which</hi> in the Relatours opinion, <hi>neither Diuinity, nor Philosophy euer heard of till then.</hi> But let the <note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 3. de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist. cap. 18. §. <hi>Ex his colligimus:</hi> et in recgonit. huius loci.</note> indifferent reader be Judge. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> explicates his <hi>Adductiue</hi> Conuersion thus. As meate is changed into the substance of mans body by meanes of nutrition, and becomes a liuing and animate part of man, not because the soule, which informs it, is <hi>de nouo</hi> produced in the matter duly prepar'd, but because the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57798:162"/>
same soule, which was in the body before, begins now to be in the new matter; so by vertue of this <hi>Adductiue</hi> Conuersion, the bread is turned into the Body of Christ, not as if Christs Body were (properly speaking) <hi>produced</hi> vnder the elements (for it was preexistent before; and nothing that is preexistent can in proper sense, be sayd to be produced) but because it was not <hi>there</hi> before, and begins now to be vnder the elementary forms, by vertue of Consecration. Lett any man iudge, whether this explication be not farre more intelligible, then what the Bishop himselfe sayes touching the point of <hi>reall presence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First of all, he affirms (with Bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi> and other Protestants, <note n="g" place="margin">§. 35. num. 3.</note> cited by him,) that <hi>the true, reall, naturall, and Substantiall Body of Christ, that very Body, which was born of the Virgin, which ascended into Heauen which sitteth on the right hand of God the Father, which shall come from thence to iudge the quick and dead, is truly, really, and Substantially in the B. Sacrament;</hi> and yet for all this, denyes both Transubstantiation and Consubstantiation; that is, in effect, he will haue Christs Body to be <hi>really</hi> and <hi>Substantially</hi> in the Sacrament, yet neither <hi>with</hi> the Substance of bread, nor <hi>without</hi> it. He will haue Christs Body to be <hi>really</hi> in Heauen, and <hi>really</hi> also <hi>in very Substance</hi> on earth at the same time, and yet stiffly denies, with all <hi>Caluinists,</hi> that the same Body can by any power be really present in seuerall places at once. Is not this to say in effect, that Christs Body <hi>really</hi> is only in Heauen, and <hi>no where else,</hi> and yet to acknowledge, that at the same time it is <hi>really</hi> in the Sacrament on earth? But who is able to vnderstand, and reconcile these speeches? His saying, that Christs Body is receiu'd <hi>spiritually by Fayth, by Grace,</hi> and the like, is a plaine contradiction to what he had taught before; seeing by these words are only signified a metaphoricall presence, which in no true sense can be called reall. In my opinion <hi>Zuinglius, Peter Martyr,</hi> and those of the Sacramentary party, deale faric more candidly in this point, (who flatly deny and reiect all <hi>reall presence,</hi> both name and thing) then the Bishop, and some other Protestants alledged by him, who confess the <hi>name,</hi> but deny the <hi>thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Catholique Authors, which the Relatour hath the confidence to bring, in fauour of his Protestant beleefe touching this matter, are grossly eyther misunderstood, or misexpounded <note place="margin">Ibidem. num 3.</note> by him. For 'tis euident, when they speake of <hi>spirituall Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> they meane, for the most part, that which is by <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>deuotion</hi> only, when for want of opportunity, or some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  reason, wee doe not actually receiue the B. Sacrament, but yet doe vse most of those affections, and deuoute aspirations of heart towards God, and our B. Sauiour, which wee are wont to practise, when wee doe really communicate. Sometimes indeed they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Christs miraculous and ineffable beeing in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where he is present not like a bodily substance, but rather like a spirit, that is, <hi>whole, in the whole consecrated host, and whole, in euery part of it.</hi> But sure J am, they neuer say, or thinke, he is there by such a <hi>spirituall</hi> presence, as Protestants meane;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57798:162"/>
that is, exclusiue of his <hi>truly-reall</hi> presence, and <hi>by Fayth only;</hi> or that he is not there as <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really,</hi> as he is in heauen, whether wee exercise an act of Fayth, or no.</p>
               <p>Now when the Bishop insists so much vpon a <hi>spirituall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the true and reall Body and Bloud of Christ, truly and really by Fayth;</hi> eyther he meanes such a <hi>participation</hi> as is proper to this Sacrament, and cannot be had saue only in the orall and actuall receiuing of the Sacramentall elements; or he meanes such a participation of Christs Body and Bloud, as deuoute persons may haue in their soules, whether they receiue those elements corporally, or no. If he meanes this second only, then both parties cannot be sayd to agree in the proper point of Sacrament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all participation; seeing it is now suppos'd to be such, but only a spirituall kinde of receiuing Christ, common to other devoute offices of Christian pietie, as well as to the Sacrament. If he meanes the first, viz. such a participation of Christs Body as is <hi>proper</hi> only to the Sacrament, and cannot be had, but when the Sacrament is <hi>orally</hi> and <hi>actually</hi> receiu'd, to make it appeare that wee agree with Protestants in it, they must first shew what it is, and particularly, that it is something really different and distinct from a deuoute <hi>eleuation of heart, remembrance of Christs Passion, trust,</hi> and <hi>application of his merits,</hi> etc. otherwise they relapse into the former difficulty, viz of putting such a <hi>participation</hi> of Christ, as is not <hi>proper</hi> to the Sacrament: for certainly none of all those <hi>participations</hi> of Christ last mentioned, are <hi>proper</hi> to the Sacrament, but may be exercised at other times, and by other meanes; as namely, when one eates his common food at the table, when he drinks wine or beere, when he looks vpon a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> when he prayes, meditates, or the like.</p>
               <p>But this, neither the Bishop, not any of his partie can shew, standing to <hi>Caluin</hi> and their own principles; that is, they cannot shew, what their <hi>spirituall participation,</hi> or receiuing of Christ, signifies in effect more, then a deuoute eleuation of heart, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christs Passion, trust, and application of his merits, or something of like nature, done and performed oftentimes, as really <hi>without</hi> the Sacrament, as <hi>with</hi> it: and consequently it can neuer be sayd, that <hi>both parties</hi> (viz. Roman-Catholiques, and Protestants) are of the same sentiment, or <hi>doe agree</hi> in any reall reception, or participation of Christ, <hi>proper</hi> to the Sacrament.

But in what respect is the Church of <hi>Rome worse</hi> then that of <hi>Israel</hi> in the time of <hi>Iezabel? because</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the Church of Rome hath solemnly decreed her errours,</hi> and <hi>impos'd them vpon</hi> men vnder <hi>the greatest penalties,</hi> viz. of Excommuncation etc. whereas the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> did neyther solemnly teach, that men ought to Sacrifice in the high places, nor punish men for going to Sacrifice at the one Altar in <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> Admitt this were true; though it be more then the Bishop can proue, seeing <hi>Elias</hi> complaind in those times, that Gods Altars were throw'n down, and the Prophets persecuted and slaine with the sword, which argues there was no such liberty as the Bishop pretends: admitt, I say, it were true, yet if there be any force in this argument, it concludes more against himselfe, then against the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. The Bishop grants, that a Generall Council, lawfully called and orderly proceeding, may define errours contrary to scripture, and that in matters euen Fundamentall, and of maine importance to Saluation; yet he <note place="margin">§. 38. num. 15.</note> teaches withall, that the decrees of such a Council must stand in force, and binde all particular men at least, to <hi>externall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> till the whole Church by an other Generall Council, reuerse the definitions of the former. Is not this likewise to be worse then the Church of Jsrael? Is not this to oblige people to make profession of false doctrine contrary to scripture and euident reason, or demonstration? yea, is it not to be, in this respect, farre worse then the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> which requires indeed, that all persons doe submitt to the decrees of Generall Councils, but doth not require this as granting Councils to be

fallible or subiect to define errour in stead of truth in matters of Fayth; but as assuredly perswading her selfe that they are, by the speciall assistance of the Holy Ghost, infallible, and cannot define any thing in such cases, but what is truth.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if inference be to be made from the practice of the Jewish Church it will serue rather to iustisie, then to condemne the proceedings of the <hi>Roman.</hi> When power resided in the true Prophets of God, and in his true and lawfull Priests, Idolatrie and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the law of <hi>Moyses</hi> was seuerely punish'd; but in corrupted times euery one had libertie to doe what ill he listed.

                  </gap> , to witt, by exacting strict obedience to her doctrine lawfully declar'd and established by Generall Councils; which she also beleeues, and is as well assured, to be according to diuine reuelation, and not repugnant to Gods honour, as the Synagogue was of their doctrine: the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I say, is rather to be commended for this, euen from the example of the Iewish Church, then to be tax'd with cruelty, for not symbolizing with the corrupted and Apostatiz'd Synagogue, in giuing promiscuous liberty to all, to beleeue and practise what they list in point of Religion.</p>
               <p>As for what he auouches concerning <hi>Transubstantiation, Purgatorie, and Forbearance of the Cup,</hi> that they are <hi>improbable opinions,</hi> and <hi>contrary to Gods word,</hi> wee answer, 'tis according to his custome to speake without proose; and therfore wee are not troubled at it. 'Tis that, which euery Heretique may say, if he please, (an <hi>Arian,</hi> as well as an English Protestant) the doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is <hi>improbable, is contrary to Gods word,</hi> where it contradicts their particular Heresie. Nay, is it not a thing, they might as iustly say of the English Church, as of the <hi>Roman,</hi> viz. that she is in this regard <hi>worse and more cruell</hi> then the Church of <hi>Israel;</hi> that she hath Solemnly decreed <hi>improbable opinions,</hi> to witt the doctrine of the Trinity, and the Deity of Christ, and <hi>to keep of disobedience,</hi> how false soeuer her doctrine be, she <hi>binds</hi> it vp vnder paine of Excommunication; yea and <hi>kindles the fagot too</hi> sometimes, when nothing else will serue the turn?

               <p>What he adds after this of <hi>some amonge vs, who wish the superstitions abolished which they know, and pray to God to forgiue their errours in what they know not, and would haue all things amended that are amiss, were it in their power,</hi> if he meanes, that such persons should <hi>know</hi> any superstitions taught and allowed by the Church as duties of Religion, or that they would haue any thing <hi>amended</hi> in the Churches publique Authoriz'd doctrine, he mistakes very much in supposing such persons to belong to our Church and Communion; it beeing contrary to Catholique Fayth to beleeue, that any such errours, or uperstitions can be taught by the Church; and he might as well suppose (if he had pleas'd) that those are Protestants, who goe to Church, and ioyne with Protestants in exteriour seruice, only to saue their estates, or for some other temporall ends, though they hold the Protestant <hi>Tenets,</hi> contrary to the doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, for no better then Heresies, and would, <hi>if it were in their power,</hi> much more willingly heare <hi>Mass</hi> then <hi>common prayer,</hi> when they goe to Church. Neither can he be a Catholique, who <hi>prayes to God to forgiue his errours,</hi> in any matter or point defined by the Church: for that implies a beleefe, or doubt, that the Church may haue erred in defining some doctrine of Fayth; which, according to vs, is absolutely inconsistent whith true Fayth: no more then (wee presume) he could haue been thought a Christian, or Protestant in the Bishops opinion, who should aske God forgiueness for beleeuing some thing deliuered in Canonicall scripture.</p>
               <p>Jn answer to A. C<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. Assertion, wherby he preferrs, both for <hi>number and worth,</hi> those who deny there is any <hi>perill of damnation</hi> by liuing and dying in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, before those who affirm there is, the Bishop, that he might more easily confute the passage, first of all, cunningly diuides it, and endeauours to shew, that <hi>number alone, is no sufficient ground of truth.</hi> Who sayes it is? Not A. C. J am sure; who as cleerly as he could, ioyn'd both together, <hi>worth</hi> to <hi>number,</hi> as a necessary supplement, and concluds what he intends, ioyntly from them both. Now this term (<hi>worth</hi>) comprehending, not only eminency of power and authority, but also of vertue, learning, zeale, prudence, sanctity, etc. can any man doubt, but those, who haue the greater <hi>number and worth</hi> on their side, are in all prudence to be thought rather in the truth, then those who haue incomparably less, or indeed nothing at all in comparison of them? His long marginall alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations therfore (which mention <hi>number</hi> only) serue to no purpose, but to amuse. And yet neither doth A. C. nor any of vs say, that <hi>our Fayth rests vpon the number or worth of men</hi> (as the Bishop will needs insinuate) but vpon Gods infallible veracity and authority: <hi>number</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> of men beeing only motiues of credibility, to induce, and direct vs prudently to determin, to which of the two parties wee are to giue credit, when they teach vs contrary doctrines.</p>

                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:57798:165"/>
A. C. thought it so euident a thing, that those of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> beleefe, in the points controuerted betwixt vs and Protestants, doe incomparably exceed those of the contrary partie, as the Bishop would neuer haue call'd for a proofe of it; as indeed it needs none. For if wee compare those spread ouer the whole face of Christendome for the last thousand yeares (a space of time common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted vs by our aduersaries) who beleeu'd, as wee beleeue, and neuer dream't of any <hi>perill,</hi> eyther of schisme, Heresie, or sinne, by liuing and dying in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, with those few, that since yesterday as it were, began to dissent from vs, and pretend there was <hi>perill of schisme</hi> &amp;c. by liuing and dying in the sayd Church, wee shall finde these, in <hi>worth and number</hi> iust nothing in regard of the other. So that in truth, the Relatour <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> himselfe (had he well consider'd it) should haue blusht at his own extrauagant obiection (<hi>you haue not yet prou'd your partie more worthy for life or learning, then the Protestants</hi>) and not bid his aduersary <hi>blush</hi> for speaking the truth. For in this case who sees not, that all true Christians, who for a thousand yeares together liu'd in the world, were, and are of our party?</p>
               <p n="2">II. But let vs consider what other instances the Bishop brings to impugn A.

                  <hi>into hell. The Church of Rome</hi> (sayth he) <hi>and the Church of England</hi> (dissenting parties) doe agree, that our Sauiour <hi>descended into hell,</hi> and that <hi>hell is the place of the damned.</hi> Therfore, according to A. C<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. rule, it should be safest to beleeue that our Sauiour descended into the place of the damned. <hi>But this</hi> (say's the Bishop) <hi>the Romanists will not endure;</hi> because <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> and <hi>the schoole generally agree in it, that he went really no further then LIMBVS PATRVM.</hi> I answer by denying his proposition. There is no such agreement of parties, as the Bishop pretends; though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> doe (both) agree, that our Sauiour descended into hell, yet they doe not (both) agree that by <hi>hell,</hi> eyther in the Creed, or in all places of Scripture where <hi>hell</hi> is mentioned, is vnderstood the place of the damned. Here therfore our aduersarie cleerly disputes <hi>ex falso supposito;</hi> and the argument, in truth, may be much better retorted vpon himselfe, thus. Both parties agree, that Christ descended into hell: but both parties doe not agree, that by <hi>hell</hi> is vnderstood here the place of the damned (for the greater and better part of Diuines hold the contrary) ergo, 'tis safer not to beleeue that he descended into the place of the damned, then positiuely to assert it, as some English Protestants doe.</p>
               <p>His next instance is about the Sacraments beeing receiu'd in both kindes; and as little to the purpose as the former. For though wee agree that our Sauiour <hi>instituted</hi> the Sacrament <note place="margin">Ibidem. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>To what he obiects against the doctrine of <hi>concomitancy,</hi> inuented (as he sayes) by <hi>St. Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin,</hi> and <hi>contrary to truth;</hi> for that <hi>the Eucharist is a Saerament of Bloud, shed and powred forth, and not of Bloud contained in the Body;</hi> I answer, that howeuer the term it selfe might (perhaps) be first vsed by the Angelicall Doctour; yet the thing thereby signify'd was always the constant doctrine of the Catholique Church; which euer taught, that by Consecration, vnder each <hi>species</hi> the entire Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or whole Christ, was putt; and therfore vnder each of them, as well the Body as the Bloud, and as well the Bloud as the Body was contain'd: notwithstanding it be certaine, that the precise words, in the Consecration of bread express noe more, then Christs Body; nor those vsed in the Consecration of the chalice, any more, then Christs Bloud. Wherfore to shew what is in the Sacrament by force of the precise words of Consecration, and what by vertue of naturall connexion, or vnion, Diuines commonly make vse of this distinction, <hi>ex vi verborum,</hi> and <hi>per Concomitantiam. Ex vi verborum,</hi> or by vertue of the precise words of Consecration, Christs Body only is vnder the forme of bread, and his Bloud only vnder the forme of wine: but <hi>per Concomitantiam,</hi> by reason of naturall connexion, or vnion, (wherby the parts of Christs Humanity are neuer to be diuided one from an other) the Bloud is vnder the forme of bread also, and his Body vnder the forme of wine, and his foule, and diuinity or Godhead, vnder both. And this the Bishop must grant, if he hold the <hi>reall presence;</hi> except he would haue vs thinke, that Christ is dead in the Sacrament, contrary to St. Paul, who plainly tolls vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>He dyes no more.</hi> As for the Priest that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, there is a double necessity for him to receiue vnder both kindes. The first is gathered from Christs words spoken to his Apostles at the institution of this Sacrament, and interpreted to vs by the vniuersall doctrine and practice of the Church. The
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57798:166"/>
second, grounded vpon the nature of the thing; which is not only a Sacrament, to be distributed amonge the Faythfull, but a true, proper, and perfect Sacrifice, representing that vpon the Cross; where not only Christs Body was Crucifyed, but also his Bloud was shed for vs. And therfore the Priest, who offers this Sacrifice of the Altar, must not only <hi>consecrate</hi> in both kindes, but <hi>receiue</hi> in both kindes, to compleate the sacrifice.</p>
               <p>His third instance is about the <hi>Commemoratiue</hi> Sacrifice in <note place="margin">Ibidem. punct. 3.</note> the Eucharist, wherein he pretends that they and wee agree. But this is false, speaking in the Protestants sense, or of such a <hi>Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moratiue</hi> Sacrifice, as excludes that, which is <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>proper.</hi> Where did Catholiques euer agree with Protestants, that it was not <hi>

Lett one only Author of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be named, who teaches this; or that <hi>bread broken,</hi> and <hi>wine powred out</hi> (vnderstanding naturall and substantiall bread and wine, as the Bishop must doe, according to Protestant principles) were, in true and proper sense, a <hi>Commemoratiue</hi> Sacrifice amongst Christians. For this were to say in effect, that Christians vnder the Gospell, did <hi>really</hi> Sacrifice to God naturall bread and wine; and therby adde another Sacrifice to that of Christs Body: which were a very gross errour.</p>
               <p>In his fourth about the <hi>intention</hi> of the Priest in Baptisme, <note place="margin">Ibidem. punct. 4.</note> he lapses againe. For what wee agree with Protestants in, wee stand to, as most <hi>safe</hi> to be done in order to Saluation. Now this is only (in the present case) <hi>that due matter and forme</hi> must necessarily be vsed for the validity of Baptisme. Doe any of vs, or can any man deny, but it is <hi>safer</hi> in order to Saluation, to vse <hi>due matter and forme</hi> in the Sacrament of Baptisme, then not to vse them? The Bishop indeed would gather from hence, that wee must also account <hi>due matter and forme</hi> sufficient without intention. But this is more then the rule obliges vs to doe. The rule, <note place="margin">Ibidem. punct.</note> certainly, bindes A. C. to no more, then to acknowledge the thing, wherein differing parties agree, to be <hi>saser</hi> then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, or negatiue of it; which wee doe cleerly in this case.</p>
               <p>His fifth instance is, that Catholiques and Protestants agree, that in the English Lyturgie there is noe <hi>positiue errour:</hi> but both parties doe not agree, that there is no errour in the <hi>Roman</hi> Missal. Therfore, (says the Bishop) according to A. C<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. rule, it should be better and <hi>more safe</hi> to worship God by the English Lyturgie, then by the <hi>Roman</hi> Missal; which he is sure wee will not grant. I answer first, all Catholiques doe not agree, that there is <hi>no positiue errour</hi> in the English Lyturgie; neither dares the Relatour affirme they doe: but only that <hi>some Iesuits</hi> confess't so much in <hi>his hearing.</hi> Secondly, though they did; that is, though all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques did grant, there were no <hi>positiue errour</hi> in the English seruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booke, yet it followes not, that therfore the English Lyturgie is <hi>better,</hi> or <hi>more safe</hi> to be vsed in the seruice of God, then our
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57798:167"/>
Missal. Why? because Catholiques doe not agree, that it is so much as positiuely <hi>safe,</hi> or consistent with Saluation, to vse it as Protestants doe that is, out of Hereticall persuasion, and with Hereticall contempt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Missal. For though it containes no <hi>positiue errour,</hi> yet to vse it out of any such principles, is certainly damnable sin, and destructiue of Saluation. The <hi>Arian</hi> Creeds contain'd no <hi>positiue errour</hi> against Fayth; yet because they did not containe all that was necessarily to be beleeu'd and confessed by Christians, and were sett forth by such as were know'n enemyes of the Catholique Fayth, which was wanting in them, they were always anathematiz'd and condemn'd by the Church, as much as if they had contain'd <hi>positiue</hi> and express errour. Did Catholiques grant, that those, who both vse the English Lyturgie, and reiect the <hi>Roman</hi> Missal as Protestants doe, were for all that, in state of Saluation, though they neuer repented, and did sufficiently know the grounds and reasons, why the Church forbids the vse of it, the argument would haue force: but seeing 'tis otherwise, our maxime stands yet good, and 'tis <hi>safer</hi> in order to Saluation, to worship God according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Missal, rather then according to the English seruice-booke; notwithstanding it were granted (which wee doe not) that the English booke contain'd no <hi>positiue errour.</hi>

               <p>The like is to be sayd of his seauenth, grounded vpon the agreement of dissenting parties in the <hi>Metaphoricall Resurrection</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. punct. 2.</note> of the soule from sinne; whence the Bishop would gather, that by A.

But most vntruly. For did euer any good Christian allow <hi>possibility</hi> of Saluation to any that deny'd the Resurrection of the body? If not, how is this instance within the rule? which supposeth, that both parties must agree in granting Saluation to one, in his way, or contested opinion.</p>
               <p>The same Fallacy is apparent in his Eighth and Ninth. For <note place="margin">Ibidem. punct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But no maruaile. For 'tis too apparent, our aduersarie has quite forgotten the rule, and fram'd another thing of it. A. Cs. rule speakes precisely this,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57798:167"/>
andnomore; viz. that when two parties differ in point of Religion, 'tis in prudence <hi>safest</hi> to take that way, wherein both parties grant Saluation to be obtainable, or to containe nothing in it opposite, or inconsistent with Saluation: whereas the Relatour presents it in an other dress, and makes it speake thus; viz. that when parties disagree, as abouesayd, 'tis <hi>safest</hi> to resolue a mans Fayth into that, in which the dissenting parties agree, and to beleeue no more then they doe agree in: which is farre from truth, and a thing which neuer came into A. C.s thoughts: and yet vpon this mistake 'tis euident to any that will consider them, most of the Bishops instances runne.</p>
               <p>Tlius all the Relatours examples, duly weighed, are found too light, and discouer'd to be indeed rather <hi>amusements,</hi> then proofs: A. Cs proposition, <hi>that 'tis safest in Religion to goe that way, which is confessed by both parties to afford possibility of Saluation, or to containe no damnable sinne in it,</hi> remaining in the meane while, a firme and vnshaken truth, notwithstanding all our aduersaries endeauours to vndermine it. If any thing yet be wanting to the due iustifying of it, it shall be declar'd in the following chapter. At present, the Bishop hauing made soe many assaults in vaine, seems to retire, and put himselfe vpon the <hi>defensiue;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 9</note> pleading, he is not out of the Catholique Church (though out of the <hi>Roman</hi>) <hi>because the Roman is not the Catholique, but a member of it, as the Church of England</hi> (he sayes) <hi>is:</hi> and requiring vs to <note place="margin">Ibidem, in margin.</note> shew, <hi>how one and the same Church can be, in different respects and relations, both a particular, and also the Catholique Church.</hi> But I answer, how often hath this been <hi>shew'n</hi> already, by all Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que writers, (had his Lordship been more willing to vnderstand <note place="margin">See chap. 10.</note> the truth from them, then to cauill about words) and also by vs in this treatise? namely, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as it signifies the Christians of the Diocess, or Prouince of <hi>Rome</hi> only, is a <hi>particular</hi> Church; but as it signifies the Society of all such Christians, as professing the Catholique Fayth, doe acknowledge the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>St. Peters</hi> Successor and Head of the whole Church vnder Christ, so it is (<hi>formally</hi> and properly speaking) not a <hi>particular,</hi> but the very Catholique and vniuersall Church of Christ; they beeing all, eyther Hereticall, or Schismaticall Churches (or both) that doe not acnowledge this.</p>
               <p>Our aduersary therfore might flourish as much as he pleas'd, with his vain and feigned Allegorie of an <hi>elder</hi> and <hi>younger sister;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> but wee tell his followers, such Rhetorique may serue to palliate, but shall neuer iustifie, nor excuse Schisme.

               <p n="1">1. THe Controuersie goes on touching Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques Saluation. The Bishop hauing first yeelded <note place="margin">§ 36. num. 1.</note> absolutely, that the Lady might be saued in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Fayth, nettled a little (as it seems) by Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> bidding her <hi>marke that,</hi> returns smartly vpon him in these words, <hi>she may be better saued in it, then you,</hi> and bids him <hi>marke that too.</hi> Well. wee will not interpret this to be any restraining of his former grant, touching the Ladies Saluation, but only an <hi>item</hi> to his aduersarie to looke to himselfe; for that, in the Bishops opinion, his case was not so good as the Ladies in order to Saluation. But what is his reason? because (for sooth) <hi>any man, that know's so much of the truth, as Mr. Fisher and others of his calling, doe,</hi> and yet <hi>opposes it,</hi> must needs be in greater danger. So that it seems, learning and sufficiency, according to the Bishop, haue such a connexion with Protestant doctrine, that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  easie
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57798:168"/>
matter to haue the one, and not to see the truth of the other. But how false this surmize is, appeares by the experience of so many learned men in the Catholique Church, who are so farre from discouering errours in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and truth in the contrary doctrine of Protestants, that the more learned they are, and the better they vnderstand and weigh the grounds of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, betwixt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and her aduersaries, the more they are confirm'd in the Catholique doctrine.</p>
               <p>Againe, what likelyhood is there, that by pondering the pretended reasons of Protestants for their Religion, I should euer come to a right and full vnderstanding of Diuine truth's; seeing it is euident, that following their principles I can be <hi>certaine</hi> of nothing, that belongs to Diuine Fayth? For, teaching as they doe, that all particular men, all Generall Councils, and the whole Church of God <hi>may erre,</hi> what <hi>assurance</hi> can they giue me, that eyther their Canon of Scripture is true, or that the sense of the words of Scripture, by which they proue their doctrine, is such as they vnderstand; or that their Church (which they grant to be fallible) doth not erre in those points, wherein they disagree from vs. <note place="margin">Ibidem:</note>
               </p>
               <p>What he asserts afterward, by way of reason why he allowes <hi>possibility</hi> of Saluation to <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques, viz. because they are <hi>within the Church, and that no man can be sayd simply to be out of the Church, that is Baptized and holds the Foundation,</hi> is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, and may be prou'd to be false euen from his own grounds. For, seeing he hath often deliuer'd, that by <hi>Foundation</hi> he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands only such points, as are <hi>Prime, Radicall,</hi> and <hi>Fundamentall</hi> in the Fayth, <hi>necessary</hi> to be <hi>know'n</hi> and <hi>expressly beleeu'd</hi> by all Christians, in order to Saluation: and seeing that many Heretiques are Baptized, and <hi>hold the Foundation</hi> in this sense, what does he but bring into <hi>the Fold</hi> of the Church, and make <hi>Members</hi> of Christs Mysticall Body, most of the Heretiques that euer were, and that, euen while they remayne most notoriously and actually diuided from it?</p>
               <p>Nor is he content with one absurdity, vnless he adioyne a second. <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>There is no question</hi> (sayth he) <hi>but many</hi> (viz. ignorant Catholiques) <hi>were saued in the corrupted times of the Church, when their Leaders, vnless they repented before their death</hi> (as 'tis <hi>morally</hi> certain, none of them did) <hi>were lost.</hi> See here a heauy doome pronounced against all the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctours in generall. But what? were they all <hi>lost</hi> who <hi>repented</hi> not of those pretended errours, which, as Pastours of the Roman-Catholique Church they taught so many yeares together? How could that be? were they not all, euen by the Bishops own principles, members of the true visible Church of Christ, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding those errours) by reason of their beeing Baptized, and holding the Foundation? If they neither lost that Fayth, by which they were members of the true Church; nor can be prou'd to haue taught any false doctrine against their conscience (by meanes <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> whereof they might fall from Grace) with what truth, or Charity could the Bishop pronounce such a sentence against them?</p>
               <p>He adds, that erroneous <hi>Leaders</hi> doe then only perish, when
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57798:169"/>
                  <hi>they refuse to heare the Churches instruction, or to vse all the meanes they can, to come to the knowledge of truth.</hi> But J demand, if no <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders</hi> but such, doe perish, with what countenance (conscience J might say) could the Relatour pass his iudgement of ours, in the manner he doth, that <hi>they were lost?</hi> Can it with any colour of equity or truth, be charg'd vpon them, that they refus'd <hi>the Churches instruction?</hi> what visible Church was there in the whole world for so many hundred yeares together, by which, had they been neuer so willing, they could be <hi>instructed,</hi> to teach otherwise, then themselues taught in their respectiue ages? and what other <hi>meanes</hi> could they be bound to <hi>vse</hi> more then they did, to come to the knowledge of truth?</p>
               <p>Why should not our aduersarie, in reason, haue rather excus'd <note place="margin">

                     </gap> .</note> these <hi>Leaders</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fayth and Communion, from Heresie, and all other damnable errour, then he does euen <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> himselfe and his followers? seeing 'tis manifest, these last oppos'd, and contradicted the more generall practice of the whole visible Church; whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique Doctours had alwayes the vniuersall practice of the Church on their side, in the points now controuerted, and for which Protestants condemne them of errour. The truth is, the Bishop is a little intangled here. Something he must say by way of threatning against Catholiques, to keep his own people in awe, and to fright them from becoming Catholiques: but positiuely and determinately what to say, he is scarce prouided. He giues a hint at the difference between <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Heresie;</hi> but dares not so much as apply the distinction, for feare he should be forc'd eyther to acquit our <hi>Leaders</hi> too manifestly, or otherwise pass such a censure vpon them, as he should not be able to maintaine. But the wary Reader will easily discouer by his timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousness and hesitancy here, his vncharitable temerity, and forwardness in the precedent passage.</p>
               <p>He tells vs likewise, that a <hi>teaching Heretique, if he adde Schisme to his Heresie, is lost.</hi> Very good. Wee grant it no less willingly then himselfe; but wonder, his Lordship would not first make it cleere, that our <hi>teachers</hi> added <hi>Schisme</hi> and obstinacy to their errours, (as he is pleased to call them) before, he gaue sentence vpon their persons, by saying that <hi>they were lost.</hi> But that which he adds concerning St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his followers, giues a plaine aduantage against him, and his followers; namely to proue, that <hi>all Leaders</hi> of Protestant Religion are guilty both of Heresie and Schisme; and by consequence lyable to damnation, <hi>except they repent. St. Cyprian,</hi> he sayth, was a maine Leader in the errour of Rebaptization; yet that the whole Church grants him safe, and his followers only (that were after him) <hi>in danger of damnation.</hi> And why this? but only because <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> did not <hi>refuse the Churches instruction,</hi> did not <hi>obstinately</hi> and formally oppose the Churches authority; which had not as yet defined the contrary doctrine. But after the Churches determination, those that followed St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> errour, and misled the people, were iudged both Heretiques and—Schismatiques, and that <hi>iustly</hi> too, by the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57798:169"/>
Bishops own confession; and so, by consequence, were <hi>lost</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance.</p>
               <p>But is not this a conuincing instance against <hi>Luther, Caluin,</hi> and all other ringleaders of the Protestant profession? doth it not euidently proue them also to be both Heretiques and Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques? did not they refuse to heare <hi>the Churches instruction,</hi> as much as any of those <hi>post-nate</hi> followers of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did? was not the contrary doctrine, to what these Protestant <hi>Leaders</hi> taught, as much, and as solemnly defined by the Church, as that which was contrary to the errour of rebaptization? Tis euident ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> followers were <hi>iustly</hi> accounted <hi>Heretiques</hi> and in <hi>danger of damnation,</hi> for not hearing the Churches instruction, giuen them by the voyce of a Generall Council, and for teaching contrary to what the Church had solemnly defin'd and declar'd, as by the Bishops own discourse they were; neyther <hi>Luther,</hi> nor <hi>Caluin,</hi> nor any that succeed them in their doctrine and profession, can be iustly acquitted of the like crime.</p>
               <p>If you answer, the whole Church of Christ condemned the errour of rebaptization; but the doctrine of Protestants was condemn'd only by the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I aske what you meane by <hi>the whole Church?</hi> If all such people, and all such particular Churches, as beleeue in Christ, and hold all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points in Protestant sense; that will comprehend <hi>the rebaptisers</hi> themselues, or those followers of St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> errour; whome the Bishop here confesses to haue been Heretiques. For doubtless they beleeu'd in Christ, and held all points, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Relatours principles, can be accounted Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, or absolutely necessary to Saluation; otherwise St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himselfe had erred in a point Fundamentall. Therfore <hi>the whole</hi> Church, in that sense, did not condemne the doctrine of rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization. And to say it was <hi>the whole</hi> Church in any other limited sense, makes it in effect but a <hi>particular</hi> Church in regard of the Church Catholique; and also, according to the Bishops doctrine, no less fallible and subiect to errour, in defining <hi>vnfundamentall points,</hi> (as this of rebaptization was) then was the Church which condemned Protestant doctrine, whatsoeuer Church that was. Besides, how often shall wee be forc'd to reminde our aduersaries, that when <hi>Luther</hi> first began to oppose the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the Protestant doctrine concerning Reall Presence, Inuocation of Saynts, Prayer for the dead, two Sacraments only, etc. was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Generall beleefe of the whole Christian world; whereof the farre greater part also were such, as professed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi>

Beside, the very acception wherein A. C. in that place, takes the word <hi>Roman Church,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witt, for the whole visible Catholique Church, euinces, that he could not meane any Church different from it <hi>in place,</hi> seeing the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in that sense comprehends <hi>all places</hi> in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, and all particular <hi>true</hi> Churches throughout the Christian world.</p>
               <p>Nor can it with truth be auouched, that the Greeke Church hath euer held and taught <hi>the Foundation</hi> in all ages, as the Bishop pretends; seeing all, or most of those Primitiue Heresies, Arianisme, Eunomianisme, Nestorianisme, Eutychianisme, etc. haue been anciently embrac'd and professed respectiuely by the Greeke Patriarchs and their Churches at some time or other. Neyther doth euen the present Greeke Church hold and teach it so entirely and soundly, as it ought, euen by the Relatours own <note n="*" place="margin">Relat. §. 9. pag. 24.</note> confession, touching their errour about the Procession of the Holy Ghost. Lastly wee haue prou'd, chap. 1. of this treatise, that the Greeks errour in that point is Fundamentall, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to <hi>vnchurch</hi> them.</p>
               <p>By <hi>a Church different from the Roman</hi> then, the Relatour should haue here vnderstood, without making any scruple about it, a Church <hi>different</hi> from her, not <hi>in place,</hi> but <hi>in doctrine;</hi> and differing also not in points <hi>Fundamentall</hi> only, (which is an other scruple too, as needlessly added) but in points not <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall</hi> also in Protestant sense; that is, a Church differing from the <hi>Roman</hi> in any point of doctrine which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church now teacheth; or in any of those points, which Protestants reiect, and for which they separate themselues from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. This, wee say, was the sense of Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> demand to Doctor <hi>White;</hi> and consequently must be the sense of Doctor <hi>Whites</hi> answer and concession to him, viz. that noe Church, differing in any points of doctrine what euer, (Fundamentall, or Not-Fundamentall) from the present <hi>Roman,</hi> could be assign'd, which held <hi>in all ages</hi> all Fundamentall points. And if our aduersaries like not his answer, wee challendge them againe to shew vs such a Church.</p>
               <p>Moreouer wee auerre, that from Doctor <hi>Whites</hi> grant aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 5.</note> A.

points, and <hi>the Not-erring</hi> in any Fundamentall point; granting the first of these, viz. that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath in all ages <hi>held vnchanged Fayth</hi> in all such points, to follow out of Doctor <hi>Whites</hi> concession, but not the second, viz. that she hath <hi>not erred</hi> in any point Fundamentall. But with what ground, or consonancy to himselfe and truth, lett the Reader iudge.</p>
               <p>His precense is, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath kept the Fayth <hi>vnchang'd</hi> only in <hi>the expression,</hi> as he calls it, or bare letter of the Article; but hath err'd in <hi>the exposition,</hi> or sense of it.

Can any man with truth say, that the <hi>Arians held</hi> the Article of Christs Diuiunity, or the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitarians, the doctrine of three diuine Persons, because they allow, and <hi>hold</hi> Scriptures, in which these Mysteries are contain'd? who euer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>  this word <hi>hold,</hi> in a question of Fayth, to signifie no more then profession, or keeping of the bare letter of the Article, and not the <hi>beleefe</hi> of the Misterie it selfe in its true sense? Is it not all one to say, <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques <hi>hold</hi> the doctrine of Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Inuocation of Saynts etc. and to say, they <hi>beleeue</hi> the sayd doctrines? Jf then it be true, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath euer <hi>held</hi> all Fundamentall points, 'tis likewise true, that she hath euer <hi>beleeu'd</hi> them: and if she hath euer <hi>beleeu'd</hi> them all, 'tis manifest she hath not <hi>err'd</hi> in any; there beeing noe other way (properly and truly speaking) wherby a man can <hi>erre</hi> against an Article of Fayth, but only by disbeleeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>If therfore it be granted that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>held</hi> and <hi>beleeu'd</hi> in all ages all Fundamentall points, it is by necessary <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> consequence likewise granted, that she neuer <hi>erred</hi> in any such points, how vnwilling soeuer the Bishop is to haue it so. He tells vs indeed (but his accusation has noe proofe,) that our Church hath erred <hi>grossly, dangerously,</hi> nay <hi>damnably</hi> in the <hi>exposition</hi> of Fundamentall points; that in <hi>the exposition both of Creeds and Councils,</hi> she hath <hi>quite changed and lost the sense and meaning of some of them;</hi> lastly that her beauty, in this respect, is but meere <hi>painting,</hi> as preseruing only the outside, and bare letter of Christs doctrine, but in regard of inward sense and beleefe, beeing neither <hi>beautifull</hi> nor <hi>sound.</hi> Thus he. But was euer calumny more falsely and iniuriously aduanc'd? Let our aduersaries shew, in what one Article of all the three Creeds, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath eyther <hi>lost</hi> its true sense, or <hi>err'd</hi> in her exposition of it. Beside, they must likewise shew, how this censure can stand with the Bishops former grant, touching the possibility of Catholiques Saluation. Jf true Fayth in all Fundamentall points be necessary to Saluation (as 'tis certaine none can be sau'd without it) and that true Fayth consists in <hi>the sense</hi> and inward beleefe, and not in the <hi>bare letter,</hi> how can those, which liue and dye in the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches Communion, beleeuing all things as she teacheth, and noe otherwise, attain Saluation?</p>

Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> seemes to lay the ground of his, vpon that which cannot be deny'd to be a Fundamentall meanes, and condition also, of Saluation, viz. Catholique Fayth; which vnless it be entirely and inuiolately professed, saues none: witness St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> in <note n="*" place="margin">Whosoeuer will be Saued, before all things, it is necessary that he hold the <hi>CATHOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QVE FAYTH:</hi> Which <hi>FAYTH,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept euery one doe keep <hi>WHOLE and VNDEFILED,</hi> with out doubt, he shall perish euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly.

                  </note> his Creed, admitted by Protestants. The Bishop declares the ground of his assertion in these words. <hi>To beleeue the Scripture and the Creeds; to beleeue these in the sense of the Ancient Primitiue Church; to receiue the fowre great Generall Councils, so much magnifyed by Antiquity; to beleeue all points of doctrine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receiu'd by the Church as Fundamentall, is a Fayth, in which to liue and dye cannot but giue Saluation</hi> to which he adds; <hi>in all the points of doctrine that are contreuerted between vs, I would faine see any one point maintained by the Church of England, that can be prou'd to depart from the Foundation.</hi> This, in fine, is the ground of the Bishops confidence.</p>
               <p>But I answer, his Lordship failes in two things. The first, that he doth not shew, that such a Fayth as he here mentions, is sufficient to Saluation, notwithstanding whateuer errour, or opinion, may be ioyned with it. The second, that he doth not shew, that at least his English-Protestant Fayth is really and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed such a Fayth as he here professeth; that is, in nothing different from the Fayth of the <hi>Ancient Primitiue Church,</hi> and from the doctrine of <hi>those fowre great Generall Councils</hi> he speaks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> . For as to the first of the pariculars, did not the Bishop himselfe but euen now affirme, that St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> followers <hi>were lost,</hi> without repentance, because they opposed the authority of the Church, which in, and by a Generall Council had declar'd their opinion to be erroneous? Put case then, that in after-times the whole Church, or a Generall Council of like Authority with that of <hi>Nice,</hi> should declare some other opinion to be erroneous, which were not sufficiently declar'd to be so, eyther by Scripture, Creeds, or those Fowre first Generall Councils; were not he that should hold it, after such definitiue declaration of the Church, or Council, in a like <hi>damnable</hi> condition with those followers of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> though he beleeu'd the Scripture the Creeds, and fowre first Generall Councils? If not, lett our aduersaries shew, why <hi>rebaptizers</hi> only should be put into a <hi>damnable</hi> condition meerly by the authority of the Church, or the Councils definition, and other people, who doe no less resist and contradict like defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and authority, should not.</p>
               <p>Doth not the Bishop himselfe in effect teach it to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable sinne, to oppose the definition of a Generall Council, when he auerrs, that the decrees of it <hi>binde all particulars</hi> to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and submission, till the contrary be determined by an other Council of equall authority; and censures the doing otherwise for
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57798:171"/>
                  <hi>a bold fault of daring times,</hi> and <hi>inconsistent with the Churches peace?</hi> How can this possibly be made good, if to beleeue Scripture and <note place="margin">§. 33. num. 5.</note> the Creeds in the sense of the Primitiue Church, with all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points generally held for such and to receiue the fowre first Generall Councils only, and noe more, be a Fayth, <hi>in which to liue and dye, cannot but giue Saluation?</hi> Did our Sauiour meane the <hi>Primitiue</hi> Church only, or only the fowre first Generall Councils and noe others, when he sayd, Matth. 18. 17. <hi>He that doth not heare the Church, lett him be vnto thee, as an Heathen and Publican?</hi> And if it be to be vnderstood (as without doubt it is) of the Church and Generall Councils in all ages, how could the Bishop, how can Protestants thinke themselues secure, only by beleeuing the fowre first Councils, and the Church of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue times, if they oppose and contradict others, or contemne the authority of the true Catholique Church of Christ, that now is?</p>
               <p>And for the second, viz. that the English-Protestant Fayth is not <hi>really</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> such a Fayth, as the Bishop here professeth, will appeare vpon examination, thus. You beleeue, say you Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, <hi>the Scripture</hi> and <hi>the Creeds;</hi> and you beleeue them in the sense of the Primitiue Church. J aske first, doe you meane <hi>all Scripture,</hi> or only a part of it? if part of it only, how can your Fayth be thought such <hi>as cannot but giue Saluation;</hi> seeing for ought you know, there may be damnable errour and sinne, in reiecting the other part? If you meane <hi>all Scripture,</hi> you profess more then you are able to make good; seeing you refuse many books of Scripture, that were held Canonicall by very many in the Primitiue Church, and admitt for Canonicall, diuerse others that were, for some time, doubted of, and not reckoned for any part of the Canon, by many ancient Fathers of the Primitiue Church, more then those were, which for that reason chiefly, you account <hi>Apocrypha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. You pretend to beleeue both Scripture and Creeds <hi>in the sense of the Primitiue Church.</hi> But when will this be prou'd? wee bring diuerse testimonies from the Fathers and Doctours of those ancient times, vnderstanding and interpreting Scripture in a sense wholy agreeable to vs, and contrary to your doctrine. Must all our allegations be esteem'd apocryphall, and counterfeite, or mis-vnderstood, because they impugne your reformed beleefe? must nothing be thought rightly alledged, but what suites with your opinions? you pretend conformity with the fowre first Generall Councils too: but the proceedings of those Councils cleerly shew the quite contrary.

               <p>Doe not the Prelats in the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> heare, with like attention and approbation, <hi>Philip</hi> the Priest, one of the Popes Legats to that Council, auouching publiquely in full Council, the authority of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successour in these words, <hi>noe body doubts</hi> (sayth he) <hi>nay it is a thing manifest, and acknowledged in all ages, that the holy and most Blessed Peter, PRINCE AND HEAD OF THE APOSTLES, AND FOVNDATION OF THE CHVRCH, receiued from our Lord Jesus Christ the Keyes of the kingdome of Heauen, and that to this day he still liues in his Successours, and determines causes of Fayth, and shall euer continue so to doe?</hi> With what confidence then could the Bishop pretend, that Protestants conform themselues to the doctrine of the fowre first Generall Councils? Those Councils submitt their definitions and decrees to the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> Protestants disclayme from him, as from an enemy of Christs Gospell. Those Councils ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him <hi>vniuersall Pastour,</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the Church;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57798:172"/>
Protestants cry out against him, as an Vsurper, and Tyrant ouer the Church. Those Councils confess him St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successour, who was Prince and Chiefe of the Apostles; Protestants call him, and esteem him Antichrist. The Councils, own his authority ouer the whole Church, as proceeding from <hi>Christ;</hi> Protestants allow him noe more power, by <hi>diuine right,</hi> then they allow to euery ordinary Bishop. Lastly, these Councils, with all submission profess, that the Pope was their <hi>Head,</hi> and themselues his <hi>members;</hi> Protestants giue vs, in contempt and derision, the nickname of. <hi>Papists</hi> for doing the same; that is, for owning subiection to the Pope and Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might instance in many other points, wherein Protestants disagree from the fowre first Generall Councils; but I pass them ouer, to take notice of what followes. <hi>There is</hi> (sayth the Bishop) <hi>but one sauing Fayth. But then euery thing, which you call DE FIDE (of Fayth) because some Council or other hath defined it, is not such a breach from that one sauing Fayth, as that he which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly beleeues it not, nay as that he which beleeues the contrary, is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>excluded from Saluation; so his disobedience therenhile offer no violence to the peace of the Church, nor the charity that ought to be amongst Christians.</hi> Wee doe not say that euery thing is <hi>de Fide,</hi> that some Council, or <hi>other,</hi> indefinitely speaking, be it generall or particular, hash defined; but that euery thing is <hi>de fide,</hi> which is defined by a Lawfull Generall Council. And for this, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously soeuer he is pleas'd to speake of it, (<hi>because some Council or other hath defined it</hi>) wee challenge all his adherents to shew, what one Generall Council (acknowledg'd for such eyther by themselues, or vs) did euer define any point of doctrine, which they did not require all Christians to hold and beleeue <hi>as matter of Fayth,</hi> after it was so defined: as likewise to shew, how 'tis possible for Christians to disbeleeue what such a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil hath defined, without making themselues guilty of that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of our Sauiour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. <hi>He that will not heare the Church, lett him be as an Heathen, or Publican;</hi> yea of that other, Luc. 10. 16. <hi>He that despiseth you, despiseth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why shall not <hi>such a man</hi> be excluded from Saluation, seeing that by the Bishops own doctrine the decrees of all Generall Councils <hi>are binding,</hi> till they be reuers'd by an other Council of like authority? why did he account it damnable sin to adhere to the condemned errour of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> after it was condem'd by a Generall Councill; seeing 'tis manifest, disobedience in that particular did of it selfe, neither offer more <hi>violence</hi> to the <hi>peace</hi> of the Church, nor to the <hi>charity</hi> that ought to be amongst Christians, then disobedience in points determined by other Generall Councils, is apt to doe, and hath euer done, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence witnesseth? So that in truth, to suppose a <hi>disobedience</hi> to Generall Councils in point of defined doctrine, which shall <hi>offer no violence</hi> to the peace of the Church, nor to charity that ought to be amongst Christians, is to suppose an impossibility, and in effect, to thinke, that rebellion may consist with the peace of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57798:173"/>
the state, and that to cast of obedience to superiours is not to contemn their authority.</p>
               <p>Wee doe not deny but there is a <hi>Latitude in the Fayth,</hi> as <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> the Bishop speakes; that is, all things pertaining to the doctrine of Fayth are not necessary to be <hi>expressly</hi> know'n and beleeu'd by all persons in order to Saluation; and this <note n="c" place="margin">Multa sunt <hi>quaenon Fide,</hi> quae non sunt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutè neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saria ad Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Eccl.

                  <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> authority cited by the Bishop rightly proues. But it follows not from hence, that any man may <hi>deny,</hi> or <hi>doubt</hi> of any point whatsoeuer, that he knows is defin'd and propos'd by the Church to be beleeued, as the Bishop and all Protestants doe. It is not in it selfe abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary to Saluation, to know or expressly beleeue many things reported in Scripture; as for Example, that <hi>Iudas hang'd himselfe,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul was thrice beaten with rods,</hi> that he <hi>left his cloake at Troas</hi> etc. but yet, for any man to deny, or doubt of these, knowing them to be testifyed in Scripture, I doe not doubt, but euen Protestants themselues will acknowledge to be a great sin, and without repentance inconsistent with Saluation. In like manner, though it be not absolutely necessary to know, or beleeue expressly all verities defined by the Church, (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> truly teaches) yet it may be, and is <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> not to disbeleeue, or doubt of any one point that is know'n to be so defined.</p>
               <p>As for our aduersaries <hi>beeing sure, that our</hi> peremptory esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing so many things, that are remote deductions from the Foundation, to be beleeu'd as matters of Fayth, hath, with other <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> errours, lost the peace and vnity of the Church, 'tis but a partiall and groundless faney, which all Heretiques and Schismatiques will plead as well as himselfe; when they are put to it, and may with as much right. Was there not more disturbance and tumults in the Church, during those Primitiue ages, by reason of Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, Pelagianisme, Manicheisme, and other Heresies that then raged, then there was for many hundred of years together before <hi>Luther</hi> began? in which time neuertheless eyther all, or most of the points now contested by Protestants, were as fully defined by the Church, and as generally beleeu'd by Christians, as now they are. With what truth, or conscience then can it be sayd, that the defining, or <hi>establishing</hi> such points haue <hi>lost the peace</hi> of the Church? True it is, the Greekish Church hath opposed the <hi>Roman</hi> for a long time; but what does that help Protestants? seeing the world know's, it is not for such points as Protestants doe now condemne in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but for such errours as they themselues, for the most part, doe as much condemne in the Greeks, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth. 'Tis euident, the Greeke Church consents with the <hi>Roman,</hi> in all the chiefe points of controuersie betwixt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and Protestants: and this generall peace of the Church might still haue continued, had not the pride, arrogancy, and temerity of Protestant Predicants first opened the gap to dissention, by reuiuing and setting on foote condemned Heresies, and by cooperating to so many other wicked, Schismaticall and vnchristian disorders, under pretense of reformation and obedience to the Gospell.</p>

A: C. tells his aduersarie, <hi>it is not sufficient to beget a confidence in this case, to say wee beleeue the Scriptures and the Creeds, in the same sense which the ancient Primitiue Church beleeued them.</hi> What says the Bishop to this? He confesses <hi>'tis most true,</hi> (to witt, that <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 2.</note> which A. C. told him) <hi>if he 'did only SAY so, and did not beleeue as he sayd.</hi> But (sayth he) <hi>if wee doe say it, you are bound in charity to beleeue vs, vnless you can proue the contrary. For I know no other proofe to men, of any point of Fayth, but confession of it and subscription to it!</hi> J reply, the Bishops answer falls short of A. Cs. demand. For who can doubt, but A. C. when he told the Bishop it was not <hi>sufficient</hi> in this case <hi>to say wee beleeue Scripture</hi> etc. mean't, that beside <hi>verball profession</hi> and giuing it vnder his hand, that he doth beleeue so and so, he should proue it by solid and conuincing arguments, that the sense in which he beleeues the Scripture and the Creeds, is the same with that, in which the ancient Primitiue Church beleeu'd them? for otherwise, he can neither be sufficiently assured himselfe, nor can he giue sufficient assurance there of to others.</p>
               <p>Just reason, I fay, had A. C. to demand this of the Bishop namely, that he should proue his Fayth to be agreeable to that of the Primitiue Church, <hi>obsignatis tabulis</hi> as they say, that is, by speciall vndenyable euidence, and not thinke it sufficient only to profess and affirm it to be so. But Protestants (to note it only in a word by the way) haue not the like reason to require any such thing of vs Catholiques, viz. that wee should positiuely and by <hi>speciall euidence</hi> proue our Fayth to be the same with that of the Primitiue Church; not that wee are <hi>vnable,</hi> or <hi>vnwilling</hi> to doe this in due time and place, but because beeing in full and quiet possession of our Fayth, Religion, Church, and all things pertaining thereto; by immemoriall Tradition and succession from our ancestours, wee doe vpon that sole ground viz. of <hi>quiet possession,</hi> iustly <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Teriull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian's</hi> whole booke <hi>de pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptionibus</hi> etc. for this.</note> 
                  <hi>prescribe</hi> against our aduersaries; and our plea must in all Law and equity be admitted for good, till they (who are our aggressours in this case) doe by more pregnant and conuincing arguments disproue it and shew, that our <hi>possession</hi> is not <hi>bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidei,</hi> but gain'd by <hi>force,</hi> or <hi>fraude,</hi> or some other wrongfull and vnallowed meanes.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman, that is in quiet possession of an estate receiu'd from his ancestours, is not to be outed of it, because an other say's, and perhaps <hi>beleeues,</hi> he has a better title to it; neither is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In like manner the Lady, beeing in possession of a Fayth, which for many ages together, had been professed by her ancestours, and generally by the whole Christian Church, 'tis not the Bishops telling her, that he beleeues the Scriptures and Creeds in the same sense the ancient Church beleeu'd them, that must eyther turn her out of

the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or iustly moue her to beleeue, that the Fayth of Protestants is agreeable to that of the Primitiue Church; but he must make it appeare to be so, by producing euident and cleere testimonies out of all, or the chiefe Doctours of those ancient times; otherwise his pretended beleefe of any such matter, is to be accounted folly, and his confidence, rashness.</p>
               <p>I adde, how is it possible for the Bishop to make good what his answer pretends viz. that his English Protestant Fayth is <hi>the same</hi> with that of the Primitiue Church. English Protestants (for example) beleeue the Popes power <hi>iure diuino,</hi> is no more then of an other ordinary Bishop: but the Primitiue Church accounted him to be the <hi>Souereign Bishop of the Church, the Bishop</hi> of Bishops, witness <note n="d" place="margin">Tertull. lib. <hi>de pudicit.</hi> cap. 10.</note>

from the faythfull Liuing; namely by the Oblation, or Sacrifice of the Holy Eucharist; by the prayers, alms-deeds, and other offices of Christian pietie, that were done for them; grounding this their beleefe both vpon Tradition and seuerall texts of Scripture; as wee shall make further to appeare in the following chapter, where this point is particularly to be treated.

C. be see interpreted, as the Bishop will haue it? what euer explication be giuen to the Bishops words, will serue A. C. as well: whose meaning only was, that there cannot be brought any arguments to proue our Churches departing from the Foundation, but more, and better may be brought to proue, that Protestants doe likewise depart from it in more and greater points. It is not to grant, that the arguments which Protestants bring, to proue our <hi>departing</hi> from the Fonndation, are solid and conuincing, or doe really proue that, for which they are brought. This the Relatour is only willing to suppose for himselfe, and to insinuate; which A. C. absolutely denyes.</p>

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57798:176"/>
such a confident demand in behalfe of his Church of <hi>England. Let A. C. instance, if he can, in any one point, wherein she hath departed from the Foundation</hi> etc. For that was already done to his hand. A. C. had already giuen him this very errour for instance, viz. the Church of Englands denying infallible authority to lawfull Generall Councils; this beeing in effect to deny infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility to the whole Church; and by consequence to subuert the ground of all infallible beleefe in any articles, or points of Fayth whatsoeuer. Nor does it help him to say, <hi>there's a greate deale of difference betwixt a Generall Council, and the whole body of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church.</hi> For what euer difference may be in other respects, in this, viz. of infallible teaching what is true Christian Fayth, and infallible beleeuing what is so taught, there is no difference betwixt the Catholique Church and a Generall Councill. For if such a Council may erre, the Church hath noe infallible meanes to rectifie that errour, or sufficiently to propose any other point of Catholique doctrine to be <hi>infallibly</hi> beleeu'd by Christians.</p>
               <p>His allegation of the second Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> for a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or oecumenicall, Council, shewes nothing, but what a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate cause the Bishop maintaines.

Very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily indeed, lett his friends make their benefitt of it. Jn the meane time, they may know, that as on the one side wee readily confess it very necessary, the Church should <hi>haue remedy</hi> against such Councils as this; so on the other side wee auerre, that the infallibility of Generall Councils truly and rightly so called, is such a Foundation of the <hi>Roman,</hi> that is, the Christian Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Fayth, that without it, wee know not <hi>what</hi> can be, nor has the Bishop as yet shew'n, <hi>how</hi> any thing can be <hi>certaine</hi> in the Fayth.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the same entire Scripture, Creed, and fowre first Generall Councils, in the same incorrupted sense, in which the Primitiue Church beleeu'd them?</hi> The Relatour in answer to him tells vs, that he beleeues Scripture, 1. by <hi>Tradition.</hi> 2. by other <hi>motiues of Credibilliy.</hi> 3. by the <hi>Light of Scripture it selfe.</hi> But first, this is not to make a direct answer to the question; which is not, whether Scripture
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57798:177"/>
can be <hi>any way</hi> beleeu'd or no, standing to the Bishops principles: but whether, and how he can be <hi>infallibly sure</hi> of what he does beleeue concerning it. Secondly, 'tis vndenyable in the common principles of all Protestants, and prou'd <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 7. 8.</note> already, that the two first of these, viz. <hi>Tradition</hi> and the <hi>motiues of Credibility</hi> can be no ground to Protestants of infallible Fayth, or assurance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Scripture: and for the third, viz. <hi>Light of Scripture it selfe,</hi> it is not only <hi>petitio principij,</hi> a begging of the question (for none of vs euer yet granted him, that there was <hi>such light</hi>) but also contrary to experience: there beeing noe man, that meerly by reading such books as are called Canonicall and others that are accounted Apocryphall, can come to know which are Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, which not; as may appeare by the example, not only of such as were neuer taught the maximes of Christian Religion, but also of many Christians, who though they be able to read, yet beeing neuer taught which books were Apocryphall, which not, know them not by reading.</p>
               <p>Whence it followes likewise, that all the insuing discourse, which the Bishop makes, touching his infallible beleefe of Scripture, falls to nothing; seeing what he layes as its principall Foundation, apparently sinks vnder the weight. For a meerly-humane and <hi>infallible</hi> assurance will neuer support an infallible Fayth of Scripture, as <note n="*" place="margin">§. 16. num. 6.</note> euen our Aduersary himselfe grants. Nor can he, in any better sort, make good, what he affirm's concerning the Creed and fowre first Generall Councils; namely, that he beleeues them <hi>infallibly</hi> in their true <hi>incorrupted</hi> sense, and <hi>knowes</hi> that he beleeues them so <hi>in points necessary to Saluation.</hi> For seeing he has no infallible certainty, that the words, or text of the Creed, and the acts of the Councils, or the books of the ancient Fathers, haue not been corrupted, how can he haue infallibility in the true sense of them, and their conformity to Scripture? He pretends indeed to be <hi>sure,</hi> that he beleeues Scripture, and the Creed, in the same incorrupted sense, in which the Primitrue Church beleeu'd <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> them, because <hi>he crosseth not in his beleese any thing deleuered by the Primitiue Church;</hi> and this againe he is <hi>sure of,</hi> because <hi>he takes the beleefe of the Primitiue Church, as it is express'd and deliuer'd by the Councils and ancient Fathers of those times.</hi> But how true this is, and how sincerely he takes the beleefe of the Primitiue Church, <hi>as it is express't by Fathers and Councils,</hi> may appeare to any, that duly considers, by the testimonies, wee haue already alledg'd against him vpon seuerall occasions, out of the Councils and Fathers, particularly in this very Chapter, and shall yet further alledge in those which follow.</p>
               <p>A. C. asks againe, what text of Scripture assures vs, that <hi>Protestants now liuing, doe beleeue all this</hi> (to witt, the Scriptures, <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>bands:</hi> and at this, his Lordship will needs seeme to wonder. But lett them wonder that will. The Querie will euer be found both rationall and pertinent, notwithstanding such wondering. For can any man deny but this is a good consequence: Protestants admitt Scripture to be the only infallible rule of Fayth; therfore they cannot beleeue infallibly <hi>all this</hi> aboue mentioned, without some particular text, or texts of Sripture to be shew'd for it? And had not A. C. iust cause to aske, <hi>whether all this be expressed in the Bibles, which are now in Protestants hands?</hi> For seeing it is not in our Bible, if it were not likewise in theirs, it would be <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> (J hope) sufficiently euidenc'd to a reasonable Aduersary, that it can be found in none. But (sayth he) it is not necessary that this should be shew'd by any particular text, because <hi>tis made plaine before, how wee beleeue Scripture to be Scripture, and by diuine and infallible Fayth too; and yet wee can shew no particular text for it.</hi> But how (wee pray) was this <hi>made plaine?</hi> He told vs indeed that he beleeu'd the entire Scripture, first by the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, then by other credible motiues, lastly by the light of Scripture it felfe. But the two first of these are, by his own confession of no infallible authority; and the third in effect no more then the <hi>Priuate spirit,</hi> as wee haue often demonstrated to him.</p>
               <p>But admitt the Bishop <hi>were sure,</hi> that the Primitiue Church expounded Scripture in the same sense as Protestants beleeue it, yet how will he be able to make good what he adds, standing to his own principles; <hi>this Rule,</hi> meaning the Scripture, <hi>as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded</hi>

               <p n="7">7. The Bishop tells vs, <hi>they haue the same Bible with vs:</hi> but I see not how this can be affirm'd with any truth. For Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> both leaue out many books, which wee esteeme part of our Bible; and those which they haue with vs, are corrupted both in Originalls and Translations.

Much less could the Bishop iustly say, <hi>that all is expressed in their Bibles, that is in ours,</hi> vpon this ground only, because <hi>all Fundamentall points are as proueable without</hi> the <hi>Apocrypha, as with it.</hi> For who sees not, that the same may be affirm'd with exclusion of diuerse other books admitted into the Protestants Canon, noe less then ours; for example, the Epistle of St. <hi>Iude,</hi> the two last Epistles of St. Iohn, the Epistle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> the books of <hi>Ester,</hi> Ruth, <hi>Paralipomena,</hi> yea perhaps all, or very many of the <hi>small</hi> Prophets? it beeing scarce credible

the Relatour, or any other Protestant should maintaine, there were any Fundamentall points of Fayth (in their sense) to be prou'd out of those books, which cannot be prou'd out of any other books, or parts of Scripture.

               <p>Wee agree with <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> that all matters of Fayth, speaking properly, <hi>are reueal'd</hi> only by the word of God <hi>Written</hi> or <hi>vnwritten:</hi>

                  </note> the margent at large (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Bishop thought not good to giue vs so much as one word, but only to make vse of the authors name) and therby cleerly perceiue, that it was not to purge the ancient texts of the Fathers writtings, but only the false readings, spurious notes, commentaries, and interpretations of Heretiques, vpon their sayd writings and texts, that the <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> was commanded to be made by the authority of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> while he was yet Cardinall and President of the holy Inquisition: not to speake of their alike false and corrupt translations of them; which were also forbidden. J say therfore, lett all our <hi>Jndices expurgatorij</hi> pass the sorutiny euen of our most rigid aduersaries; and lett them shew vs, if they can, wherein any authenticall writings of the ancient Fathers haue been eyther <hi>purg'd,</hi> or <hi>clipt</hi> by vs, or any thing of the text alter'd in point of reading, but vpon iustifyable and auowed reason; namely, the authority of some more ancient and better copie: and if they cannot, lett them here after, for shame at least, be silent, and obiect the <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> no more.</p>
               <p>A. C. asks further, <hi>whether Protestants be infallibly sure, that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. num 7.</note> 
                  <hi>they rightly vnderstand the sense of all that is expressed in their books, according to that which was vnderstood by the Primitiue Church, and the Fathers that were present at the fowre first Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councils;</hi> and for this the Bishop finds great fault with him, as asking the same thing ouer and ouer againe. Wee answer first, his Lordship might see by this, how earnest A. C. was for a direct and punctuall answer to his Querie. Secondly, the Relatour should haue reflected, that as yet A. C. had receiu'd no satisfactory answer to the demand; and till satisfaction be giuen in such cases, 'tis consonant enough to the rules of arguing, to repeate and vrge the demand: and to doe otherwise, were but to run from one thing to an other without end, and neuer sift out the certaine truth in any question whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the Querie is such, that it will be matter of eueriasting vexation to all that follow, or goe about to defend
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57798:179"/>
the Bishops assertions: it beeing euidently impossible to giue a satisfactory answer to it, without hauing recourse to the infallible authority of the Church, as wee Catholiques doe, when the like demand is made to vs by our Aduersaries. The Relatour indeed, out of his wonted liberalitie in this kinde, is pleas'd to call it a <hi>dry shift:</hi> but the reason he giues is no better, then a gross mistake. For the Churches authority does not always beget an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite</hi> Fayth, as the Relatour thinks, but very often an <hi>explicite</hi> one: to witt, when eyther the definition it selfe expounds to me the sense of Scripture, or that Church-Tradition concerning it, is soe cleere, that it needs not the definition, or declaration of a Council, to make it certainly know'n.</p>
               <p>Whersore seeing Generall Councils, by reason of their already-prou'd infallibility, are always to be presum'd to speake in that sense, which is agreeable to the doctrine of Christ; and that the vniuersall tradition of the present Church is also an infallible witness of that doctrine, wee Catholiques doe euidently shew, according to our grounds, how wee are infallibly sure, that wee vnderstand the texts of our Bibles conformably to the sense of those fowre first Generall Councils, and of the Primitiue Church of their times. For why? the sense of the Primitiue Church is necessarily inuolued in that of the Councils; and if there happens to be obscurity in the words of any Councils, by beeing <hi>infallibly sure, that that only can be their sense,</hi> which is conformable to the present Church-Tradition, and that the opposite sense cannot possibly be theirs; howeuer the words themselues may (perhaps) be wrested to it: by consequence wee are <hi>infallibly</hi> sure, that wee vnderstand Scripture in the same sense <hi>now,</hi> which the sayd Generall Councils and Primitiue Church <hi>anciently</hi> did; to witt, by the infallible authority and Tradition of the present Church.</p>
               <p>I answer to A. Cs. fourth Jnterrogatorie, which is, <hi>whether Protestants can be infallibly sure, that all and only those points, which they count Fundamentall, and necessary to be expressly know'n by all,</hi>

                  <hi>were so accounted in the Primitiue Church,</hi> the Bishop would seeme at last to tell vs <hi>which points are Fundamentall,</hi> and were esteem'd such in the Primitiue Church.

                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:57798:179"/>
from it?</p>
               <p>Nay wee are told, that euen the <hi>immediate deductions</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, are not <hi>formally Fundamentall for all men, but only for such</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>as are able to make and vnderstand them; and that for others 'tis enough, if they doe not obstinately and Schismatically refuse them, after they are once reuealed.</hi> But had not preiudice troubled his eye-sight, our Aduersarie might easily haue seen as much reason, to say <hi>'Tis Fundamentall in the Fayth,</hi> not to question, or deny <hi>Schismatically</hi> and <hi>obstinately</hi> any thing at all, that is sufficiently propos'd to vs as reuealed by God. Let him cite what he can out of the Fathers, he shall neuer proue, that a man cannot fall from the true fayth by an act of disbeleefe, so long as he beleeues the Articles of the Creed: seeing the Apostle teaches, that some <hi>fall from the Fayth</hi> by <hi>forbiding Marriage</hi> and <hi>certaine meates</hi> as absolutely vnlawfull: and many haue been condemned for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques in those ancient times, who neuer oppos'd the Creed. Now if a man may beleeue the Creed, and yet be damned for Heresie and mis-belcefe in other matters, how can Protestants assure themselues of Saluation, or be accounted Orthodox Christians, meerly, by this pretended conformity with the Primitiue Church in the beleefe of the Creed; vnless it could be prou'd withall, that they held no other vnlawfull doctrine? But certaine it is, that to deny Purgatory, the Popes Supremacy, and diuerse other points, as Protestants doe, is most vnlawfull and was so held by the Primitiue Church.</p>
               <p n="9">9. As for <hi>Tertullian, Ruffinus, St. Irenaeus</hi> and St. <hi>Basil</hi> here alledged by the Bishop, they neither seuerally, nor all together, make an infallible authority, to assure Protestants, that <hi>all and only those points</hi> which they account <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> were soe esteem'd by the Primitiue Church: which yet was the only thing, that A. C. in his Interrogatorie requir'd him to shew. The doctrine by vs deliuer'd, stands very well with the resolution of <hi>Occham</hi> here cited, <hi>that it is not in the power of the Church, or Council, to make new Articles of Fayth.</hi> For the Church neuer tooke vpon her to doe this, but only to declare <hi>infallibly</hi> what was <hi>expressed</hi> or <hi>inuolued</hi> eyther in Scripture, or the word of God <hi>not-written,</hi> viz. Tradition. And 'tis a meere vntruth to affirme, that Catholiques agree not in this, that <hi>all points determined by the Church are Fundamentall,</hi> in the sense declared. For neither <hi>Sixtus Senensis,</hi> nor any other Catholique did euer doubt, or make scruple of those books of holy Scripture, which they acknowledg'd to haue been defin'd by the Church for Canonicall: they only question some other books, concerning which wee haue not had as yet the resolution of any Generall Council; such as are the third and fourth of <hi>Machabees,</hi> the third and fourth of Esdras, the prayer of <hi>Manasses</hi> etc.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> hath something about those chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the booke of <hi>Ester,</hi> which Protestants count <hi>`Apocryphall,</hi> wherby he may be thought not to hold them for Canonicall Scripture, euen after the decree of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> But
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57798:180"/>
the reason was, because he iudged, that the decree of the Council touching Canonicall Scriptures, did not comprehend <hi>those loose vncertaine peices,</hi> as he calls them. Beside, his opinion therein was both singular and disallowed, as may appeare euen by the booke it selfe; where, <note n="*" place="margin">Sixtus Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens. Bibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth. Sanct. cap. 8.</note> ouer against the place, whence the Bishop takes his obiection, there stands printed in the margent this note, or censure. <hi>Non est haec Sententia Sixti probanda, cum repugnet sess.</hi> 4. <hi>Concilij Tridentini, quam ipse detorquet, ne videa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ei repugnare.</hi> 
                  <q>This opinon of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> (sayes the note) is not to be allowed, seeing it is contrary to the fourth session of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> which <hi>Sixtus</hi> wresteth, that he may not seeme to be contrary to it.</q> The edition of <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> his booke, where this Censure is found, is that of <hi>Paris</hi> 1610. <hi>in folio:</hi> which 'tis hardly credible that the Bishop himselfe should not haue seen; and if he had seen and did know it, with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or ingenuity towards his Reader, could he make the obiection?</p>
               <p>To what he sayth touching Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenths defining in the last Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> that <hi>the Pope is aboue a Generall Council,</hi> I answer, our Aduersaries know, that those Catholique Authours that hold the negatiue, doe likewise deny, that the point was there defined as <hi>a matter of Fayth,</hi> but only, that by way of Canonicall, or Ecclesiasticall Constitution, it was declar'd, that the right of <hi>calling, translating</hi> from one place to another, and likewise <hi>dissoluing</hi> of Generall Councils, did entirely and solely belong to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> Successour to St. <hi>Peter:</hi> those beeing the things, which had been formerly contested by the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi> against the Pope. likewise the sayd Authours deny, that the last Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> was a full Generall Council. <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>After so many questions (none of which as yet haue been sufficiently answer'd) A. C. inferrs, that his Aduersary <hi>had need seeke out some other infallible rule, or meanes, by which he may know these things infallibly; or else, that he hath noe reason to be so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as to aduenture his soule vpon it, that one may be saued, liuing and dying in the Protestant Fayth.</hi> What sayes the Relatour to this? His answer is, that <hi>if he cannot be confident for his soul vpon Scripture, and the Primitiue Church expounding and declaring it, he will be confident vpon no other.</hi> But this is still to begg the question. For the difficulty is, how he comes <hi>infallibly</hi> to know Scripture, and the exposition of the Primitiue Church? or that the Primitiue Church did not erre in her exposition? without <hi>certaine</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which, his confidence in this case, cannot be well grounded. He might more truly and ingenuously haue answer'd, if I cannot be confdent for my soule vpon the Scripture and <q>exposition of the Primitiue Church, receiu'd and interpreted according to my own priuate sense and iudgement, J will be confident vpon noe other.</q> For, this in effect he doth say; and with truth can say noe more, standing to his own principles.</p>

againe glanceth) in points they are oblig'd to know only <hi>implicitely,</hi> giues them sufficient infallibility in their Fayth; but hath noe place in this present debate. For wee now treate only <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 2.</note> of such points as are Fundamentall <hi>quoad rem attestatam,</hi> (as wee haue formerly distinguish't them) that is, according to <hi>the importance of the matter</hi> they containe; such as are the prime, radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Articles of our Fayth, which euery one is oblig'd, <hi>necessitate medij</hi> or <hi>praecepti,</hi> to know expressly: in so much, that where ignorance of these points is culpable, and through our owne default, wee are soe farre from thinking, that implicite Fayth can be sufficient for the attaining of Saluation, that wee teach the cleane contrary: asserting likewise, that in those of the first kinde, viz. which are necessary by <hi>necessity of meanes,</hi> euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible ignorance will not serue the turn. So little cause in truth had the Bishop to tells vs by way of <hi>Irony</hi> and scoff, <hi>that a Roman-Catholique may vse implicite Fayth at pleasure.</hi> As to his carping at the word <hi>know,</hi> vsed by A. C. the Relatour should haue know'n, that his aduersary takes it not in the most proper sense, for <hi>demonstratiue,</hi> or <hi>scientificall</hi> knowledge (as some speake) but only for <hi>certaine assurance,</hi> and for <hi>infallible beleefe,</hi> as it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taken by others.</p>
               <p>But as for Protestants, standing to the Bishops grounds, it is impossible they should haue infallible Fayth, eyther <hi>explicite,</hi> or <hi>implicite</hi> of any thing they bleeue; because the authority of the Church, beeing, in his opinion, fallible, they can neuer by force thereof be <hi>infallibly</hi> certain, that the books of Scripture, which it commends, are all, or any of them <hi>the word of God;</hi> or that the exposition of Scripture made eyther by the Church, or any priuate man, is agreeable to the true sense of the holy Ghost. Now, so long as he is not <hi>infallibly</hi> certaine of this, it may happen (for ought he <hi>knowes</hi> to the contrary) that some of them may proue not to be <hi>Gods word:</hi> and seeing the Churches authority attests them all alike, he may (if he please) conceiue a like feare of every one of them.</p>
               <p>What he further adds in this page (viz. 337.) is only matter of references, to what himselfe hath formerly deliuer'd: so as I thinke it also sufficient to referre my reader to what I haue <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 10.</note> answer'd in those places, viz. §. 25. <hi>num.</hi> 3. §. 33. <hi>Consid.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 1. §. 21. <hi>num</hi> 1. But I cannot sufficiently wonder to heare him affirme here, <hi>that he holds the authority of the Catholique Church as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> as <hi>A. C. does.</hi> This surely must be accounted a Paradox, or nothing can be iustly taken for such. For is not the greatest part of this comerence spent in debating <hi>the difference</hi> between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and A. C. toutching the extent of the Churches infallibility? and doth not the Bishop all along professedly sustaine, and endeauour to proue, that she is <hi>fallible</hi> both in <hi>the deliuery</hi> of Scriptures, and in the defining of all points; in his opinion, Not-Fundamentall? and also in her Traditions, euen immemoriall and vniuersall? And doth not A. C. in direct opposition to him, maintaine and assert the Churches infallibility in all these?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:57798:181"/>
But J wonder yet more at the proofe he brings for this assertion; to witt, his referring vs to §. 21. <hi>num.</hi> 5. of his owne booke. For there (<hi>pag.</hi> 139.) he expresly limits the Churches infallibility to <hi>absolute Fundamentall doctrines;</hi> which A. C. neuer doth: and in the progress of his discourse, explicating the sayd infallibility euen in Fundamentalls too, he falls so low, and attributes so small a portion thereof to the Church, that he brings it down at last to this pittifull state; <hi>and if she erre</hi> (sayth he) <hi>in some ONE, or MORE Fundamentall points, she may be a Church of Christ still, but not holy</hi> etc. Is this to acknowledge the <note place="margin">§. 21. num. 5. pag. 141.</note> Catholique Church as <hi>infallible as A. C. doth?</hi> not to vrge here the dangerous consequence, and also inuolued implicancy of the assertion it selfe; <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> which I haue already noted in my answer to that place.</p>
               <p>The rest of this Paragraph is spent only in repeating obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which haue been more then once sufficiently answer'd, viz. concerning <hi>Transubstantiation, Communion vnder one kinde</hi> etc. wherein wee cannot thinke our felues oblig'd to follow our Aduersaries example; but rather to remitt the Reader to the <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 22. 24.</note> places, where wee haue already giuen satisfaction touching those matters. As little notice shall wee take of his obiecting againe to vs the doctrine of <hi>deposing</hi> and <hi>killing</hi> of kings. This was added to inuenome the rest of his arguments, which he knew otherwise would not be mortall to vs. Wee hope, our demeanour in these late dismall distracted times of tryall, hath sufficiently cleer'd vs from all such aspersions in the iudgement of indifferent persons: nay indeed in the opinion of our greatest enemyes. For, who knowes not, that vnder the late vsurping powers, the greatest crime layd to our charge was our <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> to our Souereign? in so much as 'twas held by all that partie, a thing almost impossible, for a man to be a profess't Catholique and not a Caualier too. But to this obiection wee haue likewise <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 21.</note> already spoken what may suffice. To summe vp all in briefe, wee vtterly renounce all doctrine and opinions whatsoeuer, preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vnto, or destructiue of that loyall obedience and Fidelity, which is due to all Souereign Princes and Magistrates. And if any thing of that nature hath (perchance) dropt srom the pen of any of ours, wee owne it not, but censure it deeply, prohibite it strictly, and in case it be obstinately maintained, punish it seuerely, and lastly command all books to be corrected, that containe any such doctrine.</p>

               <p n="1">1. BVt lett vs return to A. C. who very charitably, and no less truly mindes the Bishop, that there is but <hi>one</hi> sauing Fayth, that by his own confession, <hi>it was once the Roman,</hi> and by iust consequence <hi>is so still, because 'tis granted, that men may be saued in it:</hi> wishing his Lordship therfore well to consider, <hi>how wee can hope to haue our soules saued without wee</hi>

                  <hi>hold entirely this Fayth;</hi> it beeing <hi>the Catholique Fayth,</hi> which, as St <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his Creed professeth, <hi>VNLESS A MAN HOLD'S ENTIRELY, HE CANNOT BE SAVED.</hi> To all which the Relatour tells vs, <hi>he hath aboundantly answered before,</hi> referring vs to §. 35. <hi>num.</hi> 1. <hi>and</hi> §. 38. <hi>num.</hi> 10. of his Relation. The question is not how <hi>aboundantly,</hi> but how <hi>sufficiently</hi> his Lordship answereth: and for that wee also referre our selues to the Readers judgement, vpon our replie there made. What he adds here, <hi>that A. C<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. conclusion hath more in it, then is in the</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:57798:182"/>
                  <hi>premisses,</hi> is manifestly vntrue, to any that obserues the force of the argument; which stands thus. There is but <hi>ONE Sauing Fayth;</hi> the <hi>Roman was once</hi> this <hi>sauing</hi> Fayth, and by the Bishops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is <hi>still a sauing Fayth:</hi> ergo, it is still that <hi>one sauing</hi> Fayth; and by consequence is still <hi>the Catholique Fayth.</hi> This inference, J say, is euident and vndenyable, vnless wee suppose eyther more <hi>sauing</hi> Fayths then <hi>one,</hi> or that the <hi>one sauing</hi> Fayth is not the <hi>Catholique:</hi> both which are euidently false, and contrary to our aduersaries own confessions.</p>
               <p>His discourse about <hi>Additions</hi> pretended to be made by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> vnto the Catholique Fayth, imports not much. For eyther the sayd <hi>Additions</hi> are such, as by reason of them the present <hi>Roman</hi> Fayth ceases to be <hi>a sauing</hi> Fayth, or they are not. Jf the first, he contradicts himselfe, hauing already granted that Saluation may be had in the <hi>Roman</hi> Fayth: if the second, it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily followes, that eyther the <hi>Roman</hi> Fayth is now the one sauing Fayth, or that there are more sauing Fayths then one; which the Bishop denyes. What he also affirms of the sayd Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> viz. that it hath added a <hi>new</hi> Creed to the <hi>old,</hi> and <hi>extraneous things, without the Foundation,</hi> etc. is noe more, then what the old Heretiques might as truly, and, no doubt, did as freely, obiect to those ancient Primitiue Councills: and if it be iust and sufficient, in defense of them, to assert, that <hi>the Additions</hi> they made, were only <hi>perfectiue,</hi> that is, further and more cleere <hi>explications</hi> of the Fayth formerly beleeu'd, and not <hi>corruptiue</hi> of the ancient Primitiue truth, wee thinke it sufficient to make the same answer in behalfe of the present <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Nor doe those words of St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> sett down in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining and end of his Creed <hi>This is the Catholique</hi> Fayth, signify any such thing as the Bishop pretends, viz. that <hi>this,</hi> and no other doctrine, is Catholique Fayth, <hi>this, and no more then is here</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>deliuer'd, is to be beleeu'd</hi> etc. I say, St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> his words admite not of this Gloss. For so wee might, without any breach of the Foundation, reiect in a manner the whole Scripture, with a good part of the Apostles Creed, and all other points of Christian doctrine beside. The Relatour himselfe could not be ignorant, that the non-rebaptising of Heretiques was a point of Catholique Fayth, already in St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> his time defind by the Councill of <hi>Nice;</hi> yet sure he finds noe mention of it in the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed: noe more then he doth, that our Sauiour was <hi>conceiued by the Holy Ghost, or born of a Virgin;</hi> not to speake of <hi>Remission of sinnes, Baptisme, Eucharist,</hi> or any other Sacraments, etc. none of all which beeing expressed in that Creed, will Protestants thinke they may be denyed, without breach of the Catholique Fayth, mean't by St. <hi>Athanasius?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To salue the matter in some sort, the Relatour here casts in <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> a <hi>Parenthesis</hi> in these words, <hi>always presupposing the Apostles Creed, as Athanasius</hi> did; meaning that the Apostles Creed presupposed, rhon (and not otherwise) this of St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> is so sufficient, that
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57798:182"/>
there needs no other, nor that any thing else should be <hi>added</hi> to it. But this helps him not at all. For first 'tis manifest enough, St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> supposed many other things, at the composing of his Creed, beside the Creed of the Apostles, viz. the whole Canon of Scripture, the decrees of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councill, the vniuersall Traditions of the Church, as matters appertaining to Christian Fayth: all which, are not only supernumerary, but inconsistent with the Bishops assertion, <hi>This, and noe other is Catholique</hi> Fayth. So that in reason it cannot possibly be thought, this Father mean't to signifie, that his Creed contain'd all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary points, whatsoeuer, pertaining to Christian beleefe, but only to express what was to be hel'd by Christians in those maine and principall articles touching the B. Trinity, our Sauiours incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, etc. which were at that time so much controuerted; and withall to giue vs a <hi>certaine Rule,</hi> or <hi>Forme</hi> of Catholique confession touching those points. Whence also 'tis euidently deduced, that as 'twas necessary to Saluation for Christians to <hi>beleeuo</hi> and <hi>confess</hi> according to the Catholique Fayth; in the points there specifyed; so, <hi>a paritate rationis,</hi> it is likewise necessary they should doe, in all other points and doctrines whatsoeuer. For doubtless, if the Catholique Fayth may be contradicted in any <hi>one</hi> point, without perill to a mans Saluation, it may be also in an other, and an other, yea in all the rest.</p>
               <p>A. C. goes on, and endeauours a little further to vnfold the meaning of this great father of the Church; obseruing, that in his <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 12.</note> Creed he says, <hi>without doubt euery man shall perish, that holds not the Catholique Fayth ENTIRE. that is, in euery point of it, and INVIOLATE, that is, in the right seuse, and for the true formall reason of diuine Reuelation, sufficiently applied to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by the infallible authority of the Catholique Church, proposing to vs by her Pastours, this Reuelation.</hi> To which discourse of A.G. the Bishop so farre agrees, as to acknowledge, <hi>that he, who hopes for Saluation, must beleeue the Catholique Fayth, whole and entire in euery point:</hi> which I note only by the way, as a matter worthy to be seriously reflected vpon, by all his followers. But then he obiects, the word <hi>Jnuiolate</hi> is not in the Creed, and falls a taxing the latin Translatour with errour, for so rendring St. <hi>Athanasius's</hi> word; which, sayth he, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ought to be rendred <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled.</hi> But I feare, the Bishop will here also be found in a <note place="margin">Baron. ad Ann. 340. num. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> .</note> mistake, rather then A. C. For first, <hi>Baronius</hi> shewes, in the yeare of our Lord 340. that St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> did himselfe compose and publish this Creed first of all in the latin tongue, namely when he presented it, as the confession of his Fayth, to the Pope and a Councill of Bishops held at <hi>Rome,</hi> whither he had been called, vpon occasion of some things layd to his charge by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques: and with the acts of the sayd Councill was it registred and preseru'd, till in tract of time, it came to be publiquely and generally vsed in the Church. Now, the latin copie reads <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ,</hi> and anciently euer did so; lett our Aduersaries shew any thing to the contrary: and 'tis euident by the Creed it selfe, that it
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57798:183"/>
was not this Fathers intention, to exhorte <hi>to good life,</hi> or to teach how necessary <hi>good works</hi> were to Iustification, or Saluation, but only to make a <hi>plaine</hi> and <hi>full</hi> Confession of the Catholique Fayth, concerning those two chiefe and grand Mysteries of Christian Religion, viz. of the B. Trinity, and the Incarnation of the sonne of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What the Relatour's reachis is in affirming, that 'tis one thing <hi>not to beleeue</hi> the Articles of Fayth in the true sense, and an other <hi>to force a wrong sense</hi> vpon them, intimating, that <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>this</hi> only is to <hi>violate</hi> the Creed, and not <hi>the other,</hi> I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I doe not well vnderstand. For, supposing I beleeue, that is, giue my assent to the Creed, sure I must beleeue, or giue my assent to it, in some determinate sense, or other. Jf therfore I beleeue it not in <hi>the true</hi> sense, I must necessarily beleeue it in <hi>a false;</hi> and what is that but to <hi>offer violence,</hi> or put <hi>a foreed</hi> sense vpon the Creed? vnless (perhaps) he would haue vs thinke the Creed were so composed, as to be equally, or as fairly capable of a false sense, as a true. But this is not the first time our Aduersaries acuteness hath carryed him to inconueniences. It is therfore a naturall and well-grounden inference, and noe <hi>straine</hi> of A. C. to assume, that Protestants haue not Catholique Fayth, because they keep it not <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>inuiolate,</hi> as they ought to doe, and as this Father (St. <hi>Athanasius</hi>) teaches 'tis necessary to Saluation for all men to keep it: which is also further manifest. For if they did beleeue any one Article with true diuine Fayth, they finding the same <hi>formall reason</hi> in all, viz. diuine Reuelation sufficiently attested and applied by <hi>the same</hi> meanes to all, by the infallible Authority of the Church, they would as easily beleeue all, as they doe that one, or those few Articles, which they imagine themselues to beleeue.</p>
               <p>And this our Antagonist will not seeme much to gain say, roundly telling A. C. that himselfe and Protestants <hi>doe not beleeue any one Article only, but all the Articles of the Christian Fayth, for the same</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem num. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>formall reason in all, namely because they are reuealed, from and by God, and sufficiently applied in his word, and by his Churches mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration.</hi> But this is only to hide a false meaning vnder false words. Wee question not, what Protestants may <hi>pretend</hi> to doe, especially concerning those few points, which they are pleas'd to account <hi>Articles of Christian Fayth,</hi> to witt, Fundamentalls only; but what they <hi>really doe.</hi> Now, that <hi>really</hi> they doe not beleeue, eyther all the Articles of Christian Fayth, or euen those Fundamentall points, in any sincere sense, for Gods Reuelation, <hi>as sufficiently applied by the ministration of the Church,</hi> is manifest from their professing, that the Church is fallible and subiect to errour, in all points not-Fundamentall, and euen in the deliuery of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from whence they pretend to deduce theyr sayd Fundamentalls: consequently, they can in no true sense beleeue any thing, as Catholiques doe, for <hi>the same formall reason sufficiently applyed.</hi> To beleeue <hi>all</hi> in this sort, as A. C. requires, and as all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques doe, were in effect to renounce their Heresie, and to admitt as
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57798:183"/>
matter of Christian Fayth, whatsoeuer the Catholique Church, in the name and by the Authority of Christ, doth testifie to be such, and require them to receiue and beleeue for such: which the world sees, how vnwilling they are to doe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The like arte he vseth in his answer to A. Cs. obiection (pag. 70.) viz. <hi>that Protestants, as all Heretiques, doe MAKE CHOICE of what they will, and what they will not beleeue, without relying vpon the infallible Authority of the Catholique Church.</hi> He answers first, that <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Protestants <hi>make no choice, because they beleeue all,</hi> viz. all Articles of Christian Fayth. But this is both false and equiuocall. <hi>False;</hi> because, as was iust now shew'd, they beleeue none with true Christian Fayth, as Catholiques ought; or for the true formall reason of diuine Reuelation, rightly applied, but only for, and by their owne election. <hi>Equiuocall;</hi> because 'tis certaine he meanes by <hi>Articles of Fayth,</hi> only Fundamentall points in Protestant sense: whereas 'tis the duty of Catholiques, and the thing by which they are most properly distinguish't from Heretiques, to beleeue all Articles, or points of Christian doctrine whatsoeuer, deliuer'd to them by the Authority of the Church, in the quality of such truths, as she deliuers them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he sayes, Protestants (with himselfe) <hi>doe rely vpon the infallible Authority of Gods word, and the Whole Catholique Church.</hi> True, soe farre as they please they doe, but not so farre as they ought; not entirely, as A. C. requires. And what is this, but to <hi>make choice,</hi> as all Heretiques doe? Againe why speakes he not plainly? If the Bishop mean't really and effectually to cleere himselfe of A. Cs. charge, of doing in this case, <hi>as all other Heretiques doe,</hi> why does he not say (as euery Catholique must, and would haue done) <hi>wee rely vpon the infallible Authority of Gods word, and of the Catholique Church,</hi> therby acknowledging the Authority of the Catholique Church to be an <hi>infallible meanes</hi> of applyinge Gods word, or diuine Reuelation to vs. Whereas to ascribe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility only to <hi>the word of God,</hi> and not to the Catholique Church, what is it in effect, but to doe <hi>as all Heretiques doe,</hi> and tacitly to acknowledge, that really and in truth, he cannot cleere himselfe of the imputation? Lett our aduersaries know, it is not the bare relying vpon the whole Catholique Church, (which may be done in some sort, though she be beleeu'd to haue noe more then a meere <hi>humane, morall</hi> and <hi>fallible</hi> Authority in proposing matters of Fayth) but it is the relying vpon the Churches <hi>infallible Authority,</hi> or vpon the Church, as an <hi>infallible meanes</hi> of applying diuine Reuelation; which can only make them infallibly <hi>sure</hi> both of Scripture and its true sense.</p>
               <p>A: C. therefore had noe reason to be satisfyed with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops answer, but had iust cause to tell him, that though Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in some things beleeue the same verities which Catholiques doe, yet they cannot be sayd to haue the same infallible Fayth which Catholiques haue. But the Bishop here takes hold of some words of A. C. which he pretends to be a confession, that Protestants are good Catholiques, bidding vs <hi>marke A.Cs. phrase;</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:57798:184"/>
which was, that <hi>Protestants in some Articles, beleeue the same truth, which other good Catholiques doe.</hi> The Relatour's reason is, because <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 14.</note> the word <hi>other,</hi> cannot be so vsed as here it is, but that Protestants as well as wee, must be supposed <hi>good Catholiques.</hi> J answer, 'tis cleere enough, A. C. mean't only this, that Protestants in some things beleeue the same truth with other people, who are good Catholiques; which is very true, but farre from implying that confession, which the Bishop would inferre from him. Howeuer, I thinke not the matter worth standing vpon. The Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe acknowledges A. C. <hi>intended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  to call them Catholiques; and if</hi> vnawares some thing slipt from his pen, whereby he might seeme to call them so, what matter is it? seeing 'tis incident, euen to the best Authours sometimes, to lett fall an improper expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To as little purpose is it for him to tell vs, that <hi>next to the infallible Authority of Gods word, Protestants are guided by the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>Church.</hi> For, as wee sayd before, so farre as they please, they are <hi>guided</hi> by the Church, and where they chinke good, they leaue her. Wee entreate our Adversanes to tell vs, what is this, but to <hi>follow their own fancy</hi> and <hi>the fallible Authority of humane deductions</hi> in beleeuing matters of Fayth? both which the Bishop doth so expressly disclayme in this place. To what A. C. adds, that by <hi>the Church of God</hi> he vnderstands here <hi>men infallibly assisted by the spirit of God in lawfully-called, continued and confirmed Generall Councils,</hi> the Relatour answers, according to his wonted dialect, <hi>that he makes no doubt, the whole Church of God is infallibly assisted by the spirit of God, so that it cannot by any errour fall away totally from Christ the Foundation. The whole</hi> Church cannot doe thus. Surely, his kindeness is great; and the Catholique Church is much obliged to him for allowing her such a large prerogatiue and portion of infallibility, as that of necessity, some one person or other must still be sound in the Church beleeuing all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Creed, or (if that be too much) at least all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points in Protestant sense. For so longe as but two, or three persons hold all such points, it will be true, that <hi>the whole Church</hi> is not by any errour <hi>totally sallen</hi> away from Christ the Foundation. All the lawfull Pastcurs of the Church may, in the Bishops opinion, erre, euery man of them, and fall away, euen from Christ the Foundation, yea draw all their people to Hell with them, without any preiudice to the promises which Christ made to his Church; if but two, or three poore soules be still found, whome God preserues from such errour, as our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries call Fundamentall. All is well; the gates of Hell doe not <hi>prevaile</hi> ouer Christs Church; though euery particular Christian, saue only some few in an age, perish by Heresie: the holy Ghost doth not cease to teach the Church all <hi>necessary truth,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that in all ages and times of the Church, he suffers such an vniuersall deluge of all damning and <hi>Soule-destroying</hi> errours as this, to ouerspread the whole face of Christendome.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This is the infallibility our Aduersary grants the whole
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57798:184"/>
But A. Cs. words concerning the holy Ghosts assistance in <hi>lawfully<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, continued and confirmed Generall Councils,</hi> oblige the Bishop some what further to declare himselfe in that point; <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> wherein, though wee sufficiently know his minde already, yet it shall not be amiss to heare him speake. He vtterly denies therfore (and that twice ouer for failing) that <hi>Generall Councils, be they neuer so lawfully called, continued and confirmed, haue any infallible assistance, but may erre in their determinations of Fayth.</hi> Whether they can or no, hath been already sufficiently <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 20.</note> handled, and the Relatours assertion confuted: so that there is noe necessitie of repeating what hath been sayd. All that I shall desire of the Reader here is, that from this and the former passage of the Bishop, he would take a right measure of his iudgement, and of the iudgement of all his followers, in this maine point concerning the Churches Authority, and to reflect how much they doe in reality attribute to it. They are oftentimes heard indeed to speake faire words, and to profess great respect to the Church and to Councils, especially such as be Generall, and oecumenicall; pretending at least to refuse none, but for some manifest defect, or faultiness; as that they were not <hi>truly,</hi> or <hi>fully</hi> Generall, or did not obserue legall and warrantable proceeding in their debates, etc. But lett them giue neuer such goodly words, lett them counterfeite <hi>Iacobs</hi> voyce neuer so much, here's the touch-stone of their iudgement and inward sense: whatsoeuer they say. this they all hold, Generall Councils, how lawfullysoeuer, and how lawfully and warrantably soeuer proceeding, haue no infallible assistance from God, but may erre, and that vniuersally too, (for so he meanes, as wee haue <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                  </note> already proued) that is, in all matters and points whatsoeuer, Fundamentall or Not-Fundamentall.</p>
               <p>But you will replie, the Bishop grants infallibility to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Council, to witt, <hi>de post facto</hi> (as his words are) <hi>after 'tis ended and admitted by the whole Church.</hi> I answer, this is to giue as much infallibility to a Generall Council, as is due to the meanest Society, or Company of Christians that is. For while they iudge that to be an Article of Christian Fayth, which is so indeed, and receiu'd for such by <hi>the whole</hi> Church, they are euery one of them, in this sense, infallible, and can noe more be <hi>deceiu'd,</hi> or <hi>deceiue</hi> others, in that particular iudgement, then a Generall Council; or then the thing that is true in it felfe, and also found to be true by the whole Church, can be false. In this indeed the Relatour is iust as liberall now to a Generall Council, as he was formerly to the whole Church, in <note n="*" place="margin">Relat. §. 25. num. 5.</note> granting it not to erre, while it erres not.</p>
               <p>The truth is, he vainly trifles in the whole business, and dallyes with the Reader by obtruding vpon him a Grammaticall, or at best, but a Logicall notion, or sense of the word <hi>infallible,</hi> in stead of the Theologicall. For how J pray, or in what sense is a Generall Councill acknowledg'd by the Relatour to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, euen <hi>de post facto,</hi> after tis <hi>ended,</hi> and (as he will haue it) <hi>confirm'd by the Churches acceptance?</hi> Certainly, if you marke it,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57798:185"/>
no otherwise, then euery true Proposition is, or may be sayd to be infallible, that is, <hi>hipothetically,</hi> and vpon supposition only. For surely no true Proposition, <hi>quâ talis,</hi> or soe farre as tis suppos'd, or know'n to be true, though but by some one person, can <hi>deceiue</hi> any man, or possibly be false. Jn this sense 'tis a know'n maxime in Logique, <hi>Quicquid est, quando est, necesse est esse.</hi> Euery thing that is, has an hypotheticall necessity and infallibility of beeing, since it cannot but be, so long as it is. And is it not (thinke you) a worthy prerogatiue of the Church, to be thus infallible in her definitions? Does not the Bishop assigne a very worthie and fitt meanes to apply diuine Reuelation to vs in order to the eliciting an acte, or assent, of diuine infallible Fayth? Now, that this is all he meanes by allowing Generall Councills to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible <hi>de post-facto,</hi> is euident from his own words, which he giues as the reason of that his concession. For <hi>soe</hi> (sayth he) <hi>all truth is,</hi> that is, infallible in it selfe, and <hi>is to vs, when 'tis once know'n to be truth.</hi> What, J say, is this, but to proclayme to all the world, that the decisions of Generall Councills are noe more infallible, then any contingent, yet true proposition is, though deliuer'd by a person neuer so much giuing to lying.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Finally J adde, that though A. C. speaks of a Councill <hi>sett down to deliberate</hi> (as the Bishop vrges) yet, when he styles it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 'tis euident in his principles, that eyther he meanes a compleate and full Councill, including the supreme Pastour of the Church ioyntly with the rest, and voting in Council with the rest of the Prelats, (in which case his suffrage is a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their decrees) or in case the chiefe Pastour be absent A. C. accounts it not a full and and compleate Councill, till his consent be had, and annexed to the votes of the other Prelats. Soe that the Relatour does but mistake A. Cs. meaning, when he talks of a Councill held, or supposed by him to be infallible <hi>A PARTE ANTE, when it first sitts down to deliberate</hi> etc. Neither doth A. C. vse any <hi>cunning</hi> at all in the business, but as much plaine dealinge as possible: nor had the Bishop the least cause to suspect, that the words <hi>lawfully-called, continued and confirmed</hi> were <hi>shuffled together by</hi> A. C. out of designe to hide his own meaning, or shrowde himselfe from his Aduersary. For are not the words themselues of most plaine and obuious signification? are they not also of absolute necessity to be vs'd by him, for the full and cleere expression of his meaning in this point? and doth he not, so often as occasion requires, constantly vse them (or the like) to that end, treating vpon this subiect? what ground, or euen occasion then, could the Relatour haue to obiect <hi>cunning</hi> and <hi>shuffling</hi> here?</p>
               <p>And yet by the way wee little doubt, but Generall Councils may, in a very true sense, be styl'd <hi>insallible</hi> euen <hi>a parte ante</hi> (as the Bishop speaks) <hi>at their first sitting down,</hi> and before any thing is so much as <hi>voted</hi> or <hi>deliberated</hi> vpon, by the Prelats; much less confirm'd by the Pope; to witt, by vertue of <hi>Christs</hi> promise; by which they are <hi>sure,</hi> in due time, to be <hi>led into truth,</hi>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:57798:185"/>
and preseru'd from errour in the issue and resule of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations, in the manner aboue-declar'd. euen as the whole Catholique Church is sayd by the Bishop to be infallible in Fundamentall points. For as Christ hath promised not to suffer the whole Church to erre in points Fundamentall, so he hath promised, that Generall Councils, consisting of the Head and Prelats of the Catholique Church, shall not erre in their definitions. So that to this infallibility the Churches acceptance is wholy vnnecessary. Nay it is certain, <hi>the whole Church disfusiue</hi> is soe farre from confirming, in any authoritatiue and proper sense, the decrees of such Councils, as wee in this case and controuersie style oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall, that it selfe (the Church <hi>difsusiue</hi> I meane) is absolutely bound to <hi>accept</hi> and receiue their desinitions, and cannot without Schisme and sinne refuse to accept them.</p>
               <p>The following Paragraph is wholy spent in palliating <hi>obstinacy</hi>

               <p>But as for those words of the Bishop, <hi>that a man may not vpon very probable grounds, in an humble and peaceable manner deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately doubt, yea and vpon demonstratiue grounds constantly deny,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>

First, he supposes that a man may haue <hi>very probable,</hi> yea <hi>demonstratiue</hi> grounds against the definitions of a Generall Council, and by vertue thereof, be warranted both <hi>deliberately</hi> to <hi>doubt,</hi>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:57798:186"/>
no otherwise, then euery true Proposition is, or may be sayd to be infallible, that is, <hi>hipothetically,</hi> and vpon supposition only. For surely no true Proposition, <hi>quâ talis,</hi> or soe farre as tis suppos'd, or know'n to be true, though but by some one person, can <hi>deceiue</hi> any man, or possibly be false. Jn this sense 'tis a know'n maxime in Logique, <hi>Quicquid est, quando est, necesse est esse.</hi> Euery thing that is, has an hypotheticall necessity and infallibility of beeing, since it cannot but be, so long as it is. And is it not (thinke you) a worthy prerogatiue of the Church, to be thus infallible in her definitions? Does not the Bishop assigne a very worthie and fitt meanes to apply diuine Reuelation to vs in order to the eliciting an acte, or assent, of diuine infallible Fayth? Now, that this is all he meanes by allowing Generall Councills to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible <hi>de post-facto,</hi> is euident from his own words, which he giues as the reason of that his concession. For <hi>soe</hi> (sayth he) <hi>all truth is,</hi> that is, infallible in it selfe, and <hi>is to vs, when 'tis once know'n to be truth.</hi> What, J say, is this, but to proclayme to all the world, that the decisions of Generall Councills are noe more infallible, then any contingent, yet true proposition is, though deliuer'd by a person neuer so much giuing to lying.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Finally J adde, that though A. C. speaks of a Councill <hi>sett down to deliberate</hi> (as the Bishop vrges) yet, when he styles it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 'tis euident in his principles, that eyther he meanes a compleate and full Councill, including the supreme Pastour of the Church ioyntly with the rest, and voting in Council with the rest of the Prelats, (in which case his suffrage is a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their decrees) or in case the chiefe Pastour be absent A. C. accounts it not a full and and compleate Councill, till his consent be had, and annexed to the votes of the other Prelats. Soe that the Relatour does but mistake A. Cs. meaning, when he talks of a Councill held, or supposed by him to be infallible <hi>A PARTE ANTE, when it first sitts down to deliberate</hi> etc. Neither doth A. C. vse any <hi>cunning</hi> at all in the business, but as much plaine dealinge as possible: nor had the Bishop the least cause to suspect, that the words <hi>lawfully-called, continued and confirmed</hi> were <hi>shuffled together by</hi> A. C. out of designe to hide his own meaning, or shrowde himselfe from his Aduersary. For are not the words themselues of most plaine and obuious signification? are they not also of absolute necessity to be vs'd by him, for the full and cleere expression of his meaning in this point? and doth he not, so often as occasion requires, constantly vse them (or the like) to that end, treating vpon this subiect? what ground, or euen occasion then, could the Relatour haue to obiect <hi>cunning</hi> and <hi>shuffling</hi> here?</p>
               <p>And yet by the way wee little doubt, but Generall Councils may, in a very true sense, be styl'd <hi>insallible</hi> euen <hi>a parte ante</hi> (as the Bishop speaks) <hi>at their first sitting down,</hi> and before any thing is so much as <hi>voted</hi> or <hi>deliberated</hi> vpon, by the Prelats; much less confirm'd by the Pope; to witt, by vertue of <hi>Christs</hi> promise; by which they are <hi>sure,</hi> in due time, to be <hi>led into truth,</hi>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:57798:186"/>
and preseru'd from errour in the issue and result of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations, in the manner aboue-declar'd. euen as the whole Catholique Church is sayd by the Bishop to be infallible in Fundamentall points. For as Christ hath promised not to suffer the whole Church to erre in points Fundamentall, so he hath promised, that Generall Councils, consisting of the Head and Prelats of the Catholique Church, shall not erre in their definitions. So that to this infallibility the Churches acceptance is wholy vnnecessary. Nay it is certain, <hi>the whole Church diffusiue</hi> is soe farre from confirming, in any authoritatiue and proper sense, the decrees of such Councils, as wee in this case and controuersie style oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall, that it selfe (the Church <hi>diffusiue</hi> I meane) is absolutely bound to <hi>accept</hi> and receiue their definitions, and cannot without Schisme and sinne refuse to accept them.</p>

               <p>But as for those words of the Bishop, <hi>that a man may not vpon very probable grounds, in an humble and peaceable manner deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately doubt, yea and vpon demonstratiue grounds constantly deny,</hi>

First, he supposes that a man may haue <hi>very probable,</hi> yea <hi>demonstratiue</hi> grounds against the definitions of a Generall Council, and by vertue thereof, be warranted both <hi>deliberately</hi> to <hi>doubt,</hi>

and <hi>constantly</hi> to <hi>deny</hi> such definitions; and yet tells vs, he must submitt both himselfe and grounds to the Church, in that, or an other Council. Eyther his grounds are <hi>really</hi> such as he speaks of, viz. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> , certaine and demonstratiue, or only <hi>seemingly</hi> such. If only <hi>seeming</hi> such, what is it but to giue power to euery <hi>Phanatique</hi> and <hi>presumptuous</hi> spirit, to oppose Generall Councills and contradict their definitions, whensoeuer he fancies to himselfe to haue an cuident text, or conuincing argument against them, how foolish and fallacious soeuer it be? If <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>true</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, how can he that knows them, submitt himselfe and <hi>his grounds</hi> to a Generall Councill? Can any thing be more absurd and vnreasonable, then that a true demonstration, and a true iudgement grounded vpon it, should yeeld to a fallible Authority; such as that of all Generall Councils is suppos'd to be? Againe, who shall assure vs, that the Generall Councill, to which he submitts, shall not desine the same article, or errour, which was defin'd before.? In this case, eyther he is bound to beleeue the article <hi>de nouo</hi> defin'd, or he is not. If he be not bound to beleeue it, why doth the Bishop teach, that notwitstanding a man may <hi>constantly deny</hi> the definitions of a Generall Councill vpon <hi>monstratiue</hi> grounds, yet he is bound to <hi>submitt</hi> himselfe and his grounds to <hi>an other</hi> Councill? if it be lawfull for him to oppose the second Councills definition, as well as the first's, where's his submission? If he be bound to beleeue as the second Council defines, 'tis euident, he is bound to preferre a fallible Authority before a true demonstration, and <hi>know'n</hi> to be such: which is not only absurd, but also impossible.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As to that text of St. <hi>Austin</hi> which the Bishop cites againe in his margent, touching <hi>the emendation of former Generall Councils by latter,</hi> wee haue <note n="*" place="margin">Chap 10.</note> already answer'd the obiection taken from it.

               <p>The like is to be sayd of <hi>Origen,</hi> whose testimonies to this purpose are so plentifull and cleere, that the Bishop himselfe <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 16.</note> professes to thinke (though most falsely) that <hi>he was the first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Purgatory.</hi> See him, <hi>Homil.</hi> 6. <hi>in Exod.

               <p n="9">9. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> therfore doth not more <hi>boldly,</hi> then <hi>truly</hi> affirme, yea euidently proue, <note n="e" place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 10. de Pur. gat. cap. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>that all the Fathers, both Greeke and Latin, did constantly teach Purgatory from the very Apostles times:</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that it must be held for an Apostolicall Tradition or nothing can be. Tis true, he diuides his proofs out of the Fathers for this point, into two ranks, as the Bishop obserues. In the first he reckons vp such, as affirme <hi>prayer for the dead;</hi> because, that doth necessarily inferre Purgatory, what euer the Bishop vainly
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57798:188"/>
insinuates to the contrary. For if there were no other <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>condition</hi> of beeing, for departed soules, but eyther Heauen or Hell, surely it were a vaine thing to pray for the dead; especially to pray for the remission of their sinnes, or for <hi>their refreshment, ease, rest, relaxation</hi> of their paines, as ancients most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doe. For the saynts in Heauen haue noe need of such prayers, and the Reprobate in Hell can receiue noe benefitt by them. So that, according to the doctrine and practice of the fathers in this point, 'tis necessary to acknowledge <hi>a third place,</hi> or <hi>condition,</hi> wherein soules both <hi>suffer payne,</hi> (as in Heauen none doe) and are capable of <hi>ease, refreshment,</hi> and <hi>deliuerance</hi> from their paines, as in Hell none are.</p>
               <p>To this, the Bishop giues a very slight answer. For not beeing able to deny, that the Fathers generally teach it to be good and profitable to pray for the dead, he tells vs, <hi>'tis most certaine the ancients had, and gaue other reasons of prayer for the dead, then freeing them out of Purgatory.</hi> But I answer, if <hi>by other reasons</hi> he means such as were exclusiue of Purgatory, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with that doctrine, the contrary is most certaine. Jf he means such as were consistent with the beleefe of Purgatorie, what doe they concern vs? wee doe not conclude Purgatory (as the Relatour here, and other of our Aduersaries commonly, but very falsely pretend, and impose vpon vs) from all kinde of prayer sor the dead, absolutely and generally speaking, but from that <hi>speciall</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> manner of praying for them, which the Fathers vse; namely their praying sor the <hi>remission of their sinnes,</hi> for the <hi>releasement of their paines,</hi> for their <hi>ease, comfort, refreshment, rest, deliuerance,</hi> and the like. From such prayers as these, wee conceiue Purgatory is proued; and that so vndenyably, as the Relatour finding nothing himselfe sufficient to answer, was forc'd to putt vs off, to the late Primate of <hi>Armagh's</hi> answer to the <hi>Jesuits challenge.</hi>

               <p>The practice of the Fathers is to pray for the <hi>soule,</hi> and not for the <hi>body;</hi> they teach that <hi>soules</hi> departed want our <hi>help,</hi> and not their bodies; and that when wee pray for them, they receiue <hi>ease, comfort</hi> and <hi>refreshment</hi> by our prayers; they teach, that wee obtaine <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>deliuerance from paine</hi> for them, and that by <hi>the help</hi> of our prayers, they are brought to eternall <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>happiness.</hi> Jn this manner, and to these ends the fathers both commend and practise prayer for the dead, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Bishop and his Authour most falsely pretend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

               <p>Againe, is not <hi>Dionysius Areopagita</hi> an Authour <hi>of the first three hundred yeares?</hi> You will say (perhaps) no, and call <hi>Erasmus, Laurentius Valla,</hi> and some few others to witness, that the bookes <hi>de Caelesti</hi> and <hi>de Ecclesiasticâ Hierarchiâ,</hi> and <hi>de Diuinis Nominibus</hi> etc. father'd commonly vpon him, are not the works of that <hi>Dionysius</hi> conuerted by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts. 17. 34. as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but of some other later Authour. I answer, <note n="*" place="margin">See Bellarm. de Scrip. Ecclesiastic. Baron. Tom. 1. Annal. Delrio's. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciae Areopagita.</hi>

Howeuer it may suffice, that the Authour of these bookes is confessedly by all, acknowledg'd for a writer of great Antiquity: and more particularly in our present case, that the now-cited Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> (himselfe a famous Antiquary) doth profess of him, that <note n="a" place="margin">Doctor Vshers An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to tho Iesuit. pag. 248. 249.</note> in his writings <hi>he takes vpon him the person of St. Pauls Scholar,</hi> though for his own part indeed, he holds backe which the rest, and will not <hi>expresly</hi> acknowledge him for more then an <hi>ancient writer.</hi> I say then, be it St. <hi>Denys</hi> the Areopagite, or be it some other Authour

of primitiue times doth not this ancient writer in effect teach Purgatory, when describing the customes of primitiue Christians for, and about the dead, <note n="b" place="margin">Dionys. de Ecclesiast. Hierarch. cap. 7 parte. 3.</note> he tells vs, that when the body is made ready for buryall, <hi>the venerable Prelate</hi> (or Priest) <hi>comes, and makes a prayer ouer him; in which he beseeches the diuine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness TO FORGIVE the party deceased all THE SINNES he had committed through humane frailty, in his life time, and to place him in the light and country of the liuing</hi> etc? would not both the Archbishop, and Primate haue thought that man a Papist, who should haue made the like prayer for his deceased friend in their hearing?</p>
               <p n="10">10. But lett vs see, how the Bishop endeauours to euade the <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 16.</note> authorities wee haue already alledged in proofe of Purgatory, together with others; which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> brings to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose out of the Fathers. First. <hi>Tertullian</hi> (sayth he) <hi>speaks expresly of Hell, not of Purgatory.</hi> But this is (expresly) a very poore shift: it beeing a know'n thing, that Purgatorie is commonly taken to be a part of Hell, and as it were, <hi>an vpper region</hi> of it, confining vpon the Hell of the damned; and therfore not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usually expressed in ancient writers by the generall name of <hi>Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or <hi>Hell.</hi> Beside, that <hi>refreshment,</hi> or ease of paine, which the Christians in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time (as appeares by his testimony already cited) begg'd of God for the departed soules, cannot be vnderstood of any soule in Hell, taken in the Bishops strict sense for the Hell of the damned: for there is noe <hi>comfort,</hi> nor <hi>ease</hi> to be expected: nor yet can it be vnderstood of any soule in Heauen; where there is noe <hi>paine,</hi> nor griefe. Wherfore, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, it must be vnderstood of soules, in some <hi>third place,</hi> where both <hi>paine</hi> is suffered, and case, or <hi>refreshment</hi> may be obtain'd: and that is Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he thinks St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaks not of Purgatory, as <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> wee would haue it, because he mentions <hi>a purging to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. which cannot be after this life:</hi> which certainly is both a frigid reason, and a great mistake in the Bishop: for, as Gold is refined and <hi>amended</hi> by the furnace, so is a soule in Purgatory refin'd and purg'd from the dross of <hi>veniall</hi> sinnes, which rendred it less acceptable in the sight of God; and consequently, she is therby <hi>amended,</hi> or made better then she was. And J would gladly know, of what <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>condition</hi> of soules St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> should speake, if he meant not to speake of those in Purgatory. For surely there's noe <hi>amendment</hi> of any soules in Hell; nor no suffering of <hi>paines,</hi> nor purging of soules in Heauen: and yet 'tis certaine, he speakes of the state of soules after this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Origen</hi> is granted to haue taught Purgatory; but withall tax'd with errour concerning that point: which I will not deny. J only say, his adding to the true doctrine of the Church concerning Purgatory, that false opinion of his own, viz. <hi>that all, euen the Deuills themselues after a time, shall be saued,</hi> can be noe preiudice to the weight of his testimony, in that wherein he neuer was tax'd of errour, but acknowledg'd to haue taught according to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57798:189"/>
the common sense and beleefe of the whole Church. Whatsoeuer <hi>Origen</hi> taught in other places, certaine it is, <note n="c" place="margin">Homil 6. in Exod.</note> in the place alledged by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> he teaches noe such Heresie; speaking there only of soules beeing expiated from light and veniall sinnes, which doe not deserue Hell, or damnation eternall. These he styles <hi>aliquid de specie plumby;</hi> they are in Faythfull soules as a mixture of <hi>lead,</hi> or some baser mettal in gold: soules are defiled by them. And then, putting a difference betwixt those soules, which haue much gold, and but small quantity of lead, and such as haue much lead, and but little gold, he sayes of them both, that they shall, after this life, <hi>be purg'd by fire,</hi> more or less, for a longer or shorter time of paine, according as they had more or less <hi>lead,</hi> that is, vice and sinne to be purged in them: but for others, viz. such as be all <hi>lead</hi> and haue noe <hi>gold,</hi> that is, noe true merit of vertue and grace in them, they (sayth <hi>Origen</hi>) <hi>shall sinke down</hi> into the bottomless pitt for euer. This is the summe of his discourse in that place: and can any thing be spoken more cleerly for Purgatory?</p>
               <p>In the fourth and fifth ages, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> brings more plenty of authorities; and the Relatour is pleas'd to call these, <hi>the great and learned ages of the Church:</hi> therfore, surely the less subiect to be seduced and led away from the truth, by any priuate false doctrine of Heretiques. <note n="d" place="margin">D. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bros. in Psalm. 36.</note> St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> is plaine enough for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory: for, speaking of what happens to the dead after this life, he sayes, <hi>some shall be saued as by fire;</hi> alluding manifestly to those words of St. Paul 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>If any mans worke burn, he shall suffer detriment; but he himselfe shall be saued, yet so, AS BY FIRE.</hi> But the words in St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> (<hi>AS by fire</hi>) at which the Bishop will seeme to stumble and pretend difficulty, relate not so much to the thing, or <hi>fire it selfe,</hi> as if <hi>St. Ambrose</hi> mean't not <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>true</hi> fire, or that it were not <hi>truly</hi> and really to be passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, saue only in way of similitude, or figure: but it relates to the <hi>person;</hi> to witt, of him that does pass thorough it; signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that those who are <hi>cleansed</hi> after this life, are not <hi>burn't vp,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Etsi no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </note> and quite destroyed by fire (as those in Hell are, ouer whom that fire preuailes for euer) but only that they <hi>suffer detriment</hi> for a while; like him, that passes through fire, and in his passage hath his haire and garments singed. Thus, I say it is, that St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> teaches, some are saued <hi>quasi per ignem</hi> (<hi>as by fire.</hi>)</p>
               <p>I adde, that suppose St. Ambrose by his <hi>quasi per ignem</hi> did not intend to signifie <hi>true</hi> and <hi>materiall</hi> fire, but only <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall,</hi> as paines analogicall to fire, yet it will not thence follow, that he intended not to signifie Purgatory: since it is not yet declared by the Church to be matter of necessary beleefe, that soules in Purgatorie are tormented by fire in that sense, but only that they endure <hi>paines</hi> and <hi>dolours</hi> there, by which they are purged, and which for their extremity are not vnfittly, according to Scripture phrase, express'd and signify'd by fire; what euer the <hi>meanes,</hi> or immediate instrument be, by which God inflicts them. See <hi>Concil. Florentin. in lit. vnion:</hi> likewise

St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> in his oration vpon the death of that good Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> where he prayes for his soule in these words, <hi>giue REST to thy Seruant Theodosius,—that REST, which thou hast</hi>

               <p>St. <hi>Hierome</hi> also is nce less plaine for a <hi>purging fire</hi> after this life; yea so expresly, that he makes it to differ from that of Hell only, because <hi>through this</hi> they pass, <hi>as the Israelites did through the red sea;</hi> but <hi>through that</hi> of Hell, none pass, but all (with the <note place="margin">D.

               <p>Howeuer the Reader shall doe well, to take a little notice of the Bishops <hi>doubling</hi> here. He makes a shew of answering the texts, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> brings, out of the fathers, to proue Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, but in stead of performing punctually what he pretends, is content to pass by, many of them, and to frame an answer only to some few, which he thought fitt.

Isaia.</note> mentioned by the Bishop, expresly nameing Purgatorie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, in allusion to that commonly-alledg'd Text of St. Paul. 1. c. 3. and 'tis euident likewise from the context of his discourse. For he speaks of sinnes already in part expiated by confession (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them for that reason to <hi>wither'd,</hi> or dead, grass) whose <hi>mortall,</hi> or eternall guilt, beeing remitted by the Sacrament, 'tis out of question they can be noe matter for Hell-fire <hi>to feed vpon,</hi> but only for that of Purgatory.

                  <note place="margin">Epist. 350.</note> as by sire.

               <p>And why is not St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen's</hi> a <hi>manifest</hi> place too? who exhorting his Auditory to good life and Christian perfection, tells them, <note n="g" place="margin">D. Greg. Naz. Orat. 39. <hi>in fine.</hi>

                  <hi>if they goe not that way in this life, they will, peraduenture, be baptized with fire in the next.</hi> Who sees not, that he supposes for certaine, that there is, after this life, a place and condition of beeing, wherein soules are <hi>baptized,</hi> that is, cleansed and purifyed by fire? For, as to the word <hi>fortè</hi> (<hi>peraduenture</hi>) which stands in the Bishops way, it relates to the persons only (viz. his Auditory) of whom it was really vncertaine to him, whether they should goe to Purgatory, or not; it beeing possible for them as yet, to escape it; namely by following good counsell, and applying themselues to perfection of holy-liuing. I say the word <hi>fortè</hi> (whick this father vseth) doth not import <hi>vncertainty.</hi> or doubtfullness, concerning the place, or state of Purgatory, but only vncertainty of their going thither, to whome St. <hi>Gregory</hi> then spake. As if I should say to some friend, <hi>take heed you doe pennance in time of health; for if you doe not, 'tis a bazard but you will goe to Hell.</hi> By this manner of speaking J doc not doubt of Hell; that is, whether there be such a place or not, but J doubt of my friends condition, and feare his going thither. Nor could St. <hi>Gregory</hi> indeed speake otherwise, then by <hi>peraduenture,</hi> in such a case, without a Reuelation.

Doubtless, <hi>perstringentur &amp; amburentur</hi> are words of too light signification to express the wofull and irreparable condition of those soules, who are wholy plung'd and swallowed vp in an abyss of torment.

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57798:191"/>
Howeuer 'tis patent enough, how resolu'd the Bishop was to cauill vpon this subiect, by the Criticisme he makes. For, if his obseruation be good, that <hi>PVTO is no expression for matter of Fayth, Boetius</hi> must be thought so meane a Christian, as that he beleeu'd neither Purgatory nor Hell, as matters of Fayth, seeing he vses the same word <hi>Puto</hi> in reference to them both.</p>

                  <hi>fire for purging of soules after this life;</hi> which can be no other, then the fire of Purgatory, which wee assert: in which the effects of mortall sinne, and also <hi>veniall</hi> sinnes are purged. Neither is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, that this <hi>purging fire</hi> is sayd by St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to be a <hi>fire that sleeps not,</hi> seeing his meaning is, that it goes not out, nor ceaseth to burn, till the soule be perfectly refined by it.

But how does this disproue Purgatorie? Yes, sayes the Bishop: for this Father teacheth withall, that <hi>the soule cannot suffer by fire, but in the body.</hi> Jf he meanes <hi>naturally</hi> and by <hi>materiall</hi> fire, Weo grant it too; but <hi>supernaturally,</hi> and by diuine power so ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, wee auerre, that both Deuills and damned foules doe now suffer by fire in Hell; though it be not matter of necessary Fayth, to beleeue, that soules in Purgatorie, are now purg'd by <hi>materiall</hi> fire. It sufficeth, that they suffer <hi>reall paines, reall afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>dolours,</hi> whatsoeuer those be, and by what meanes soeuer applyed; and that by suffering them, they are <hi>purged</hi> from their sinnes.</p>
               <p>What the Relatour adds here, concerning <hi>diuerse of the ancients, especially of the Greeks,</hi> viz. <hi>that they were a little too much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Plato's schoole;</hi> if his meaning be, that they were thereby led into errour, or that they corrupted the Christian doctrine with the opinions of <hi>Plato,</hi> or any other Paganish Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, 'tis a groundless calumny, and extremely iniurious to those worthies. But our Aduersarie seemes not much to care what he imputes to the fathers, soe he may impose vpon his Reader, and make him beleeue, those primitiue and zealous Assertours of Christian verity, against both Philosophers, Heretiques and all

               <p n="12">12. But St. <hi>Austin</hi> has the ill hap to be vs'd worst of all. The Bishop makes him <hi>say</hi> and <hi>vnsay,</hi> and <hi>wauer</hi> in his doctrine touching this matter, as if he had been rather a <hi>nouice</hi> in the Fayth, then a father of the Church; thence concluding, that the doctrine of Purgatorie was noe matter of Fayth in St. <hi>Austins</hi> time: for if it had been such, St. <hi>Austin</hi> would neuer haue spoken so doubtfully of it.

               <p>Compare this, good Reader, with that know'n maxime and resolution of St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Januarius</hi> (that 'tis <note place="margin">Epist. 118. c. 5.</note> noe better <hi>then insolent madness, to question, or dispute that, which the vniuersall Church holds</hi>) and tell mee, if thou can'st possibly thinke, that St. <hi>Austin doubted</hi> of Purgatorie. The thing he doubted of, was not, whether there were such a state of soules after this life, as wee now style <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but only, what was the most proper and genuine sense of that place of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> 1.

Of these wee confess, St. <hi>Austin</hi> seems in some sort to doubt, but yet so little, that 'tis eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he always allowes it for a good and sound exposition of

               <p>All which, presupposed and well reflected on, it could haue been no hard matter, sure, for the Bishop to haue reconciled all that St. <hi>Austin</hi> deliuers vpon this subiect, without making him seeme to <hi>doubt</hi> of that which he teacheth, <hi>datâ occasione,</hi> no less constantly, then he doth the doctrine of Heauen and Hell: or else to speake contrary to himselfe; which is neither beseeming, nor soe easily to be imputed to such a person, as this Father was know'n and confessed to be in the Church of God. Nor can I but wonder, seeing the Bishop grants, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> sometimes asserted Purgatorie, though at other times he left it doubtfull, why the Bishop and his party should make it such a necessary point of their doctrine to deny it; whereas St. <hi>Austin</hi> neuer deny'd Purgatory. Whence is deriued to Protestants that light, which St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and the whole Church of his time, could not see? They had the <hi>word of God</hi> then, as well as Protestants can pretend to haue it now; and were much neerer to the Primitiue and Apostolicall times; in which, euen by our Aduersaries acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, there was not that <hi>dross of superstition,</hi> which they complaine of in latter times. If it were a truth so important to Saluation, and so cleere in Scripture as Protestants now make it; or the beleese of Purgatory an errour so derogatory to the merits and satisfaction of Christ, as they say it is, how happen'd it, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> and the Church of his time, could not see both the one and the other?</p>
               <p>J must not omitt the Authorities of St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and St. <hi>Iobn Chrysostome,</hi> though the Bishop does in his answer; the first of which giues testimony to the doctrine of Purgatory, in these words. <note n="c" place="margin">D.

13. What can be sayd more then this, to the full assertion of our Catholique beleefe in this point? Especially, seeing out Aduersary himselfe grants, concerning St. <hi>Gregory</hi> and all the fathers after his time, that they vndoubtedly held Purgatory: so <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> that for a thousand yeares and more, he confesses Purgatory was the generall Fayth of Christians. Jt would be considered by indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent men, whether it be not sarre more likely, to haue been <hi>always</hi> the Fayth of Christians; and that our fore-fathers were in truth <hi>frighted into the beleefe of it,</hi> (as the Bishop will needs speake) by noe other meanes, then they <hi>were frighted</hi> into the beleefe of Hell; that is, by the Tradition of the Catholique Church, and the preaching of their lawfull Pastours conformably thereto. I conclude therfore, that Purgatory can be noe other then a doctrine of Apostolicall Tradition, if St. <hi>Austins</hi> Rule be good, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Baptism. cap.</hi> 24. which teacheth, <hi>that wee iustly hold all things of this nature proceed from the Apostles, if they be taught by the whole Church, and wee finde noe beginning,</hi> or first Institution <hi>of them in Councils Nationall, Prouinciall, or oecumenicall.</hi> Now wee challenge our Aduersaries to shew, when, or in what age the doctrine of Purgatory first began to be taught; or (which is all one) when the doctrine of Praying for the dead, <hi>that their sins</hi> might be <hi>remitted</hi> to them, that they might finde <hi>mercy,</hi> and milder <hi>chastisement</hi> from God, <hi>refreshment, ease</hi> of their paines, <hi>help,</hi> and <hi>reast</hi> in our Lord etc. first began to be practis'd in the Catholique Church.</p>
               <p>Neither doth <hi>Bellarmins</hi> prouing it from Scripture, hinder the point from beeing a Tradition of the Apostles. For does not St. <hi>Austin,</hi> with <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and all diuines, not excepting euen Protestants themselues, acknowledge the Baptisme of infants, and doctrine of Originall sinne, and diuerse other points to proceed from Apostolicall Tradition, and yet endeauour to proue <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 17.</note> them also from Scripture? much less does the Cardinall contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himselfe (as our Aduersary likewise pretends he doth) by endeaucuring on the one side, to proue Purgatory <hi>by nineteene places of Scripture,</hi> and yet auerring on the other, that <hi>wee finde no beginning of this doctrine.</hi> For first, his assertion that <hi>wee finde noe beginning of this doctrine,</hi> imports noe more, then that noe first Authour of the doctrine of Purgatorie could be found, <hi>since the Apostles;</hi> that beeing fully sufficient to his purpose; which was only to shew, that the beleefe of Purgatory was an Apostolicall Tradition. And yet secondly supposing his speech <hi>absolute,</hi> that <hi>no beginning at all</hi> could be found of this doctrine in any age, eyther since the time of the Apostles, or before, yet should he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himselfe, by thinking, or saying it might be prou'd by Scripture. Who doubts, but the doctrine of soules immortality is effectually prou'd out of the Gospell, and the bodies resurrection out of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> first Epistle to the Corinthians chap. 15? Yet will any man pretend, that the <hi>first beginning</hi> of those doctrines is found in the Gospell, or in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles? was not the immortality of the soule and resurrection of the body beleeu'd
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57798:193"/>
by the faythfull before Christs Incarnation? So that in truth the Relatour committs the grand absurdity himselfe, in arguing (as he doth) that if <hi>Bellarmin did finde it in Scripture</hi> (to witt, the <note place="margin">Ibidem;</note> doctrine of Purgatory) <hi>then he is false in saying, wee finde noe beginning of it.</hi> Certainly, to finde a thing to be <hi>taught,</hi> and to finde the <hi>first beginning of</hi> its beeing taught, is not all one, in any sober mans iudgement, except it be the Relatours. <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>
               </p>
               <p>What he adds touching <hi>Alphonsus a Castro's</hi> telling vs, <hi>the mention of Purgatory in ancient writers is almost none at all, and that it is not beleeu'd by the Grecians to this very day,</hi> is in part contrary to himselfe, who hath already confess't, <note n="*" place="margin">num. 16. in fine.</note> that from St. <hi>Gregories</hi> time, all the Fathers taught, and all Christians (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) beleeu'd Purgatory; and misunderstood in the whole. For certainly, 'tis only of the name (<hi>Purgatory</hi>) and quality of the fire there, that <hi>a Castro</hi> and some others speake, when they affirme, that few of the ancients beleeu'd Purgatory: it beeing impossible to conceiue, they could be ignorant of what is both generally taught by the Fathers, and was vnanimously, without the least difference, or dispute concluded both by <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> in the Councill of <hi>Florence,</hi> touching the <hi>thing,</hi> that is, the penall state of some Faythfull soules departed, after this life. The Bishop might as well haue told vs, that those Authours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the same, touching the Holy Ghosts proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, and of some other points, namely, that <hi>there is little mention of them in the ancient Fathers,</hi> (to witt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and <hi>in terminis</hi>) but yet without doubt suppose, those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Orthodox Pastours of the Church did euer teach the sayd points, as to the <hi>substance</hi> of doctrine and sense. <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordships assigning <hi>Origen</hi> to be the <hi>first Authour</hi> of the doctrine of Purgatorie is a manifest falsity, already disprou'd by the testimonies of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ancienter then he; likewise by St. <hi>Denys</hi> the Areopagite, contempory with the Apostles: to whom wee may adde <note n="a" place="margin">lib. 8.

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> also does the same with St. <note n="c" place="margin">Hom. 3. in Epist. ad Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</note> 
                  <hi>Chrysostome:</hi> yea once againe wee challenge our Aduersaries to nominate, if they can, any one ancient Father, or Christian writer, that euer noted this an errour, or <hi>priuate doctrine</hi> in <hi>Origen,</hi> that he taught Purgatory, or that in any sort intimates him to haue been the Authour, or inuentour of it: and yet the world knowes, <hi>Origens</hi> errours and priuate opinions were diligently noted by Antiquity. But this, 'tis sure enough, our Aduersaries can neuer doe: and therfore lett noe man thinke it vnreasonable in vs, that wee still confidently presume and assert, that this doctrine hath <hi>no beginning</hi> assignable, and consequently, according to St. <hi>Austins</hi> rule aboue mention'd, is to be thought an Apostolicall Tradition.</p>

                  <hi>Gods Prouidence, breed infallible Fayth in vs.</hi> Jn answer whereto the Bishop insists wholy vpon principles already confuted; viz. that deliberately to doubt and deny what is defined by Generall Councils, doth not <hi>take away infallible creditt from the whole Church;</hi> the contrary whereof wee haue often shew'n in this <note n="*" place="margin">See chap. 23.</note> Treatise. Likewise he tells vs, <hi>the creditt</hi> of the Catholique Church is <hi>safe,</hi> so long as she is held infallible <hi>in things absolutely necessary to Saluation:</hi> which <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> things neither himselfe, nor any body else, could euer yet resolue vs, <hi>what</hi> they are, or <hi>how</hi> to know them. And beside, seeing he teaches, that all points <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to Saluation are plainly sett down in the Creed and Scripture, how is it possible wee should haue need of the infallible Authority of the Church, now or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, to beleeue any such points of Fayth? Againe, if the whole Church may erre in points not <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to Saluation, noe reason can be giuen, but it may also erre in deliuering and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting any particular texts of Scripture, which containe matter, or doctrine not <hi>absolutely necessary:</hi> which supposed, it necessarily followes, that wee cannot beleeue with certaine, infallible and diuine Fayth, any thing deuer'd in Scripture it selfe, saue only a very few points; to witt, the chiefe and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Mysteries of our beleefe. Lastly, seeing the whole Church consists of all particular members, which can neuer be found out, and consulted with, by any person; and that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there can be no sufficient assurance had of what they all hold, as absolutely necessary to Saluation: how is it possible wee should be mou'd by their Authority (as the Bishop here supposeth) to beleeue all, or any points of Fayth absolutely necessary to Saluation? <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 17.</note>

               <p n="2">2. The Relatours next worke is to carp at the gloss, which A. C. giues to those words of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>how shall they preach</hi> etc. that is, sayth A. C. <hi>how shall they preach infallibly.</hi> By which manner of speaking yet, he does not meane (whateuer the Bishop imputes to him) <hi>to make euery Priest in the Church of Rome, that hath learning enough to preach, an infallible Preacher.</hi> He was not ignorant, that the natiue and immediate sense of those words, compar'd and ioyn'd with the fore-going, <hi>how shall men beleeue vnless they heare</hi> etc. is only to signifie, that for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Gospell, 'tis necessary there should be <hi>Preachers,</hi> and that noe man ought to take that office vpon him vnless he be <hi>sent,</hi> that is, ordain'd and called by Allmighty God. He was not so simple as to thinke euery priuate Preacher infallible. You will say then, why does he comment vpon the words <hi>how shall they preach</hi> etc? thus; <hi>how shall they preach INFALLIBLY, vnless they be sent from God, and infallibly assisted by his Spirit?</hi> J answer,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57798:195"/>
the reason hereof was, because the word <hi>preach</hi> (which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle vseth) doth not signifie <hi>sermons</hi> only, but absolutely, <hi>the announcing,</hi> or publication of diuine doctrine, by all such as are <hi>lawfully</hi> appointed to publish it, and in what manner soeuer it is necessary for beleeuers, that it be publish't and announced to them.</p>
               <p>Now, there beeing (confessedly) a twofold annunciation, or manner of publishing diuine doctrine to Christians; the one <hi>priuate</hi> and meerly <hi>ministeriall,</hi> which is perform'd by priuate and particular Pastours to their particular and respectiue flocks; the other <hi>publique</hi> and <hi>authoritatiue,</hi> viz. of the Pastours of the whole Church assembled together in Generall Councils: and this latter, in regard of the publique and vniuersall benefitt which comes by it, the more important of the two, A. C. could not doubt, but that really it was intended, and must necessarily be <hi>included</hi> in the sense of those words of the Apostle, <hi>how shall they preach</hi> etc. no less then the former. J say, that <hi>speciall</hi> annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or preaching of Christian doctrine, must necessarily be included in the latitude of those words, wherby the Prelats of the Church doe sufficiently applie diuine reuelation to Christian people, for the grounding and eliciting an assent of true diuine Fayth: which, as wee haue often shew'n, cannot be done by any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or meanes, which is not infallible. A. C. therfore takes not <hi>the whole,</hi> but only <hi>the principall part,</hi> or one principall kinde of <hi>preaching</hi> Christs Gospell, when he so glossed vpon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words. And well might he so doe; it beeing that, without which the preaching of all particular Pastours to their particular flocks, would be to little purpose; for they could preach nothing but vncertainties; or at best, but <hi>probable</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> doctrine.</p>
               <p>As little cause had his Lordship to taxe A. C. of <hi>bragging,</hi> because he auerrs, that <hi>wee</hi> (Catholiques) <hi>vse to interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by vnion, consent of fathers, and definitions of Councils.</hi> For, in a iust and true sense, soe wee doe: in as much as wee neuer decline, but alwayes follow that interpretation of Scripture, which hath consent of Fathers, and the definition of Generall Councils. Can Protestants say so much for themselues? And yet our meaning is not, that noe exposition of Scripture is good, but what hath express consent of Fathers, or the definition of some Generall Councill to backe it: wee doe not deny, but euen priuate persons may discourse vpon Scripture, and declare their iudgement concerning the sense and meaning of it; prouided, they neither hold, nor obtrude any sense contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent of Fathers, or the definitions of Generall Councils, but hold, and doe all things with due submission to the Church.</p>
               <p>But the Relatour will proue from the authorities of <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Canus,</hi> cited in his margent, that the Apostle in this place, speaks not at all of <hi>infus'd</hi> (that is, of diuine and infallible Fayth) but <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> of <hi>Fayth acquit a,</hi> to witt, by naturall and humane industrie and meanes; which beeing not infallible, nor requiring any infallible Authoritie in them that preach it, the Bishop thence concludes,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57798:195"/>
that A. C'. Gloss is not good, but rather <hi>that he grossly abuses the text by it.</hi> J answer first, the precedent discourse and reason giuen for the gloss, doe sufficiently discharge A. C. of that imputation; leauing the note of a Precipitate censure vpon his aduersary. Secondly I say, the Bishops information <hi>abuses</hi> him; there beeing not one word, or syllable <note n="*" place="margin">Scotus. in 3. sent. D. 23. quaest, vnicâ.</note> in <hi>Scotus,</hi> which denyes <hi>infused,</hi> that is supernaturall, diuine, true, Christan and infallible Fayth to be vnderstood in that Tex't of the Apostle. Tis true, <hi>Scotus</hi> alledges the words in particular proofe of Fayth <hi>acquir'd,</hi> viz. of that Fayth, which is gained by <hi>hearing</hi> of particular Preachers, and depends only on their Authoritie. But yet he there maintaines (with all Diuines) an absolute necessity of <hi>Fayth infused,</hi> or supernaturall; which, as the Bishop himselfe here proues out of <hi>Canus,</hi> must rest vpon some infallible motiue; and consequently requires an infallible preaching to applye it sufficiently to vs: which is all, that A. C'. gloss imports. Adde hereunto, that <hi>acquired</hi> Fayth beeing, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ordinary course of Gods Prouidence, prerequired and antecedent to Fayth diuine and supernaturall, (as <note n="b" place="margin">Canus Loc. Theol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lib 2. cap. 8. §. <hi>cui et tersiuni.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Canus</hi> likewise here teacheth) it cannot in any sort be suppos'd to exclude it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, by an argument <hi>a fortiori,</hi> 'tis euidently concluded, that the text ought to be extended to diuine and infallible Fayth, as well as to humane and acquired. For if wee cannot beleeue, euen with naturall and acquired Fayth, <hi>without a Preacher,</hi> surely much less can wee beleeue, with infus'd and supernaturall Fayth, without one: still speaking according to ordinary course: which <hi>Preacher</hi> must also be infallible, eyther in his owne person, as all the Apostles were, or as he deliuers the doctrine, and performes the office, committed to him by an infallible autority; such as is that of the Church, by whome, euery particular Preacher is deputed to deliuer the doctrine which she holds. I might vrge also the common consent of interpreters, who expound the place of noe other Fayth, but that, by which Christians are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify'd and sau'd; which surely, can be noe other, but supernaturall and infused Fayth. And this is most certain, whateuer <note n="*" place="margin">Biel. iu 3. sent. Dist. 23. quaest 2. art. 2 Conclus. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Biel,</hi> out of his priuate opinion, asserts to the contrary. But wee haue stood longer vpon this subiect, then the small importance of it requires: since neither our, nor A. C'. doctrine touching the infallibility of Generall Councils, does at all depend vpon this text; but is sufficiently prou'd by those other <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 20.</note> already alledged to that purpose.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Bishop in the next place tells A. C. <hi>he has ill lucke in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem, num. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>fitting his conclusion to his premisses, and his consequent to his antecedent.</hi> The business is, because he seems, from the assistance of the holy Ghost to inferre infallibility. But J answer, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary hath not <hi>much better lucke</hi> so often to mistake, and peruert A. C'. meaning. For certainly, A. C. does not deduce infallibility, eyther of Church, or Councils from <hi>any assistance</hi> of the holy Ghost <hi>whatsoeuer,</hi> but from <hi>such assistance,</hi> as is <hi>necessary</hi> for them
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57798:196"/>
both: and from thence infallibility is rightly and inuincibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as wee haue often shew'n, by the grand inconueniencies, which otherwise would vnauoydably follow both to Religion and the Church. What therfore he vrges, <hi>that the ancient Bishops and Fathers of the Church were assisted by Gods Spirit, and yet not held to be of infallible creditt,</hi> is beside the purpose: A. C. making no such inference, as the Relatour by this obiection, supposes him to doe.</p>
               <p>As for the question which A. C. asks, <hi>if a whole Generall Council, defining what is diuine truth, be not of infallible Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditt, what man in the world can be sayd to be infallible,</hi> the <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Bishop seems rather to slight, then satisfie it, when he sayes, <hi>J'le make you a ready answer; noe man; no, not the Pope himselfe. No. Lett God and his word be true, and euery man a lyar;</hi> citing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4. But what? cannot Gods word be true, vnless the Pope and Generall Councils be held <hi>fallible,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to <hi>erre,</hi> when they define matters of Fayth? were not those words of the Apostle true, when both himselfe and all the rest of his Fellow-Apostles, liu'd vpon earth, and were infallible? And if they were true <hi>then,</hi> why not also <hi>now,</hi> though the Pope and Generall Councils be held infallible? Certainly A. Cs. question deseru'd a better answer then this; or rather was vnanswerable by the Bishop, without deserting his auowed principles. For thus J argue <hi>ex concessis.</hi> Jf Generall Councils, defining what is diuine truth, be not of infallible creditt, noe man, nor men in the world, can be sayd to be so: this the Bishop grants. But then, if neither Generall Councils, nor any man in the world, be of infallible creditt, who sees it not to follow, there can be noe infallible creditt amonge men, noe, not in the whole Church, euen in points Fundamentall? For seeing noe testimony can be of infallible creditt, except it be know'n; and that it is impossible for any man <hi>certainly</hi> to know, eyther who those are that make vp <hi>the whole</hi> Church, in the Bishops sense, or that they doe all of them beleeue and testifie such a point of doctrine to be Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, and absolutely necessary to saluation, how is it possible for <hi>the whole</hi> Church, in that sense, to be of infallible creditt, or to giue infallible certainty to any points whatsoeuer, whether Fundamentall, or not Fundamentall, whether <hi>absolutely</hi> or not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>absolutely necessary to Saluation?</p>
               <p>To his Aduersaries demand, <hi>why a Generall Councill; if it may erre in defining one diuine truth, may not erre in defining an other,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem. num.</note> 
                  <hi>and so in all, the</hi> Relatour answers by way of Confession, that it <hi>may erre euen in all,</hi> to witt, of <hi>like nature;</hi> vsing this limited manner of speech (<hi>in all of like nature</hi>) on purpose to auoyd inconueniencies, and that he might, vpon occasion, take the aduantage of his wonted distinction between Fundamentall points. For so presently (as it were by way of anticipation) he tells the Reader, that <hi>of things not absolutely necessary to Sabuation</hi> (or not-Fundamentall) <hi>there can be noe necessity of infallible certaintie in the whole Church, much less in a Generall Councill;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:57798:196"/>
quently, 'tis noe matter with him, though a Generall Councill be suppos'd lyable to errour in <hi>all</hi> such points, as well as in <hi>any one.</hi> But it sufficeth, that wee haue <note n="*" place="margin">Chap 3. 14.</note> already shew'n the contrary both for Church and Councill: namely, that in many cases, it may be absolutely necessary for the Church to haue infallible certaintle of points in their owne nature, not <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to saluation; or (which is all one) to haue such points, when brought into controuersie amongst Christians, <hi>infallibly</hi> defined by a Generall Councill: so as wee need not trouble the Reader here, with repetitions.</p>
               <p>Nor could it serue his turn, or iustify his assertion from beeing, in the highest degree, iniurious and derogatory to the honour and authority of Generall Councills, though it were otherwise: that is, though wee had not already prou'd a necessity of infallibly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defining, by Generall Councills, all controuerted points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whatsoeuer, whether absolutely, or not-absolutely necessary to Saluation. For 'tis certaine enough, the Relatour holds, that Generall Councills may <hi>possibly</hi> erre euen in points, that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to Saluation, or Fundamentall, as wee haue heretofore <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 20 24</note> obseru'd, though he declines somewhat the open profession of such a doctrine. But this suppos'd, lett his adherents tell vs, what does his maxime (if <hi>in one, possibly in all</hi>) proclaime, but that a Generall Councill may, not only fall into errour, in defining some one, or other point of Christian Fayth, but euen totally Apostatize, and define against Christianity it selfe? A proposition, sufficiently confuted by its own apparent impiety, and which may iustly serue for a second instance of our Aduersaries sincerity, when they profess fo much esteem and reuerence towards Generall Councills.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wee doe not say, that Christ our Sauiour <hi>left infallibility in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>his Church to satisfie eyther contentious, or curious, or presumptuous spirits,</hi> as the Bishop would seeme to impose vpon vs: for 'tis euident enough, by the experience the world hath of the seuerall sects and Heresies of Protestants, that such kinde of people will be satisfy'd with nothing, but the full swing of their own obstinate and erroneous phansies. Nor will wee, Catholiques, euer desert the confession and defence of it, because such people will not be satisfy'd. But wee tell them, Christ left that legacy to his Church, for these ends, viz. to guide the humble and sober-minded <hi>securely</hi> and <hi>certainly</hi> in the right way of Saluation; he left it also to curbe the <hi>contentious,</hi> to restraine the <hi>curious,</hi> and to giue sufficient checke to such <hi>presumptuous</hi> spirits, as should dare, in matters of such high and difficult nature, as the truths and Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion are, <hi>to be wise in their own eyes,</hi> and to preferre their priuate phansies before the publique and generall iudgement of the Church, and their own lawfull Ecclesiasticall superious: none of all which ends could be effectually attain'd, or duly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for, without the sayd infallibility: which therfore, for the Relatour or any other, out of priuate opinion, to goe aboute to take away from the Church, is without doubt both intolerable
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:57798:197"/>
                  <hi>presumption</hi> and <hi>errour;</hi> especially doing it vpon no better grounds and pretense of reason, then he layes down here; viz. because <hi>the Foundation</hi> (that is, in his sense, all Fundamentall and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely-necessary doctrine) <hi>is so strongly and plainly layd down</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>in Scripture and the Creed. Stongly</hi> and <hi>plainly</hi> layd down, does he say? Surely the Bishop when he wrote this, thought little of those swarms of <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Heretiques, who deny such points of Fayth, as he himselfe grants to be Fundamentall. To say those points are so <hi>strongly</hi> or <hi>plainly</hi> deliuer'd <hi>in Scripture</hi> &amp;c. as not to require some other infallible authority, beside Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to support and make good our beleefe of them, must needs argue a very <hi>strong preiudice,</hi> to any man that duly considers, how those controuersies are handled betwixt the Orthodox and them, and how equally those Heretiques bandy texts with their Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries both wayes; that is to say, as well vpon the offensiue as defensiue part; as well by <hi>opposing</hi> the truth with the pretense and allegation of many Scripture-texts, as by <hi>answering</hi> and <hi>euading</hi> what euer is, by their Aduersaries, argued out of Scripture for it, or against them. So as indeed, a <hi>modest man</hi> (to borrow a little of his Lordships own style) <hi>may iustly wonder,</hi> whither the Bishop would <hi>haue vs to runne for</hi> infallible <hi>certainty</hi> in those points, if not to Generall Councill: which yet he will by noe meanes allow vs to doe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But A. C. (sayes the Bishop) <hi>hath more questions to aske.</hi> His next is, <hi>how wee can, according to ordinary course, be infallibly assur'd, that a Council erres in one, and not in an other point, when she equally defines both, by one and the same authority, to be diuine truths.</hi> This may be thought a <hi>shrewd</hi> question too; and the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 22.</note> does a little discouer himselfe <hi>nettled</hi> by it, in telling vs, that <hi>A. C. turns Questionist here, to disturb the business,</hi> viz. which his Lordship had with Mr. Fisher, and <hi>indeed the Church, as much as he can.</hi> Howeuer, he answers the question by distinction, thus. <hi>If a Generall Councill erres</hi> (sayes he) <hi>eyther it erres in things abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary to Saluation, or in things not necessary.</hi> If in the first sort, <hi>wee may be infallibly assur'd by the Scripture, the Creeds, the fowre first Generalls Councills and the whole Church, where it erres in one, and not in an other point.</hi> Jf in the latter sort, <hi>'tis not</hi> requisite, in his opinion, <hi>wee should haue any infallible assurance</hi> at all, viz. whether the Councill errs, or errs not in such points, or <hi>in which</hi> of them she does, and in which she does not erre. Where first good Reader, obserue (what J hinted aboue) the Bishop doth not deny, but a Generall Councill may erre <hi>in things abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary</hi> to Saluation, seeing he here prescribes thee a rule, how to know <hi>infallibly</hi> when such a Councill does erre in such matters, and when not; to witt <hi>Scripture, the Creeds, the fowre first Generall Councils,</hi> and <hi>consent of the whole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I aske, why doth he referre vs <hi>to the fowre first Generall Councils and the whole Church,</hi> to know, when a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill erres in things necessary to Saluation, and when not? Fyther the fowre first Generall Councills were infallible in their defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or no: if infallible, why are not other Councills also infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:57798:197"/>
seeing Christ hath not made promise of infallibility to one Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councill more then to an other? Jf not infallible, how can J by their authority be <hi>infallibly</hi> assur'd, that an after-Generall Councill hath err'd, or doth erre in some things absolutely nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssary to Saluation? Againe, what does he meane by <hi>the whole</hi> Church, by whose authority he pretends wee may be <hi>infallibly</hi> sure when a Generall Councill erreth in things absolutely necessary? If all part<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>icular persons that hold the Fundamentalls, where shall I finde them? what meanes can I possibly vse, to be certainly assur'd of their testimony? If only the generality of all particular Churches, they are noe more <hi>the Whole</hi> Church then a Generall Councill is; seeing all beleeuers make vp the true Church of Christ. Neither can I, by the consent of <hi>the Whole</hi> Church only, be <hi>infallibly</hi> assur'd whether some after-Councills definition be erroneous in matters Fundamentall. For seeing the essence of the Church, according to the Bishop, consists in the beleefe of such points as he terms Fundamentall, vnless J know before-hand all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, how can I know what particular Churches, or Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes of Christians, doe constitute <hi>the Whole</hi> Church? How can J be certaine, but that some particular Church, whose iudgement J refuse, may by beleeuing the point controuerted as truly Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, be a part of the whole Church; and some others, whose testimony J embrace, may by not-beleeuing the sayd point, be no part of the Church whose consent J seeke?</p>
               <p>I demand secondly, how does this rule of the Bishop hold good, <hi>The Scripture, Creeds, fowre first Generall Councills, and the whole Church shall infallibly assure mee, when after-Councills erre in defining Fundament all points?</hi> Does the <hi>Scripture, Creeds, fowre first Generall Councils</hi> etc. particularly tell vs, or giue vs any certaine and infallible rule, by which wee may know, when it is <hi>Fundamentall</hi> errour to contradict what they teach, and when it is not? or to know what and how much of the doctrine they containe, is <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to Saluation, and all the rest only <hi>expedient</hi> and profitable? Jf they doe, wee request some of the Relatours friends to be so charitable to vs, as to shew vs that rule, or direct vs where to finde it: for as yet, wee Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, neuer heard of such a thing. If they doe not, how is it possible for vs to be <hi>infallibly assured</hi> by them, when a posteriour Councill erres in <hi>one point,</hi> and not <hi>in an other,</hi> when it defines both of them for diuine truth by <hi>one, and the same authority equally?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Relatours answer therfore, as to the first part of his disiunctiue (which concerns Generall Councills erring in points Fundamentall) is so manifestly vnsatisfactory, that it may be iustly wonder'd, how he could thinke it should giue satisfaction to that Querie of A. C. And as to what he affirm's in the latter part, viz. that <hi>'tis not requisite to haue infallible assurance in points not absolutely necessary to Saluation,</hi> our answer is, wee haue <note n="*" place="margin">chap. 23</note> fully prou'd the contrary. Wee only demand here, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the determinate beleefe, that such and such books (for
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57798:198"/>
example the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Epistle of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> St. <hi>Iude,</hi> etc.) are diuine Scripture, or the word of God, be in the list of the Bishops <hi>absolutely-necessaryes,</hi> or not? He could not haue sayd they are, without condemning a very great part of Orthodox Christians, for three or fowre hundred years after Christ, <note n="a" place="margin">Epist, ad Dardan. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seb. lib. 6. c. 14.</note> if St. Hierome and others say true: and yet 'tis certaine the Relatour does not only assert, but earnestly endeauour <note n="*" place="margin">Relat. §. 16. num. 6. 7.</note> to proue, that wee ought to haue insallible assurance of this point. Seeing therfore the Bishop pretends, infallibly to beleeue, that these books of Scripture are the true word of God; and that he cannot beleeue this, but for the Authority of the Church some ages after the Apostles, eyther he must grant, that our infallible beleefe may be grounded vpon an authority meerly fallible (which is absurd, and often denyed by himselfe) or that the Church is infallible euen in points not absolutely necessary to Saluation.</p>
               <p>His next period containes only a long and captious discourse touching the words <hi>one and the same authority,</hi> vsed by A. C. in framing his demand to the Bishop; it beeing euident to any man, not vnwilling to see, that when his Aduersary supposed a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, according to the Relatours opinion, to define both truth and errour, <hi>by one and the same authority equally,</hi> he mean't precisely <hi>the authority</hi> of the Councill, abstracting from any other, whether of Scripture, Tradition, consent of Fathers, or the like. It is cleere, I say, from the subiect aboute which A. C. treahs, that his meaning could be no other then this, viz. that the sayd Councill, in the supposed case, intended to define, and did actually define both the pretended falle article and the true one with sull conciliary authority, and did as much exact the infallible beleefe of <hi>that</hi> as <hi>this,</hi> by vertue of the power they had from Christ to determine such matters, and the obligation that is vpon Christians to receiue and submitt to their determinations, in such cases, vnder paine of <hi>Anathema.</hi> Now lett our Aduersaries if they can, shew vs how 'tis possible to be <hi>infallibly</hi> assur'd, that a Councill erring in <hi>one,</hi> doth not erre in <hi>the other</hi> point, when she defines both by <hi>the same Authority</hi> in this sense, that is, by her own Authority pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely: for example, how a man may be <hi>infallibly</hi> assur'd, that a Generall Councill err'd not in defining that <hi>there is Originall</hi> sinne, as well as in defining that <hi>there is a Purgatory;</hi> as well in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining that the <hi>Apocalipse</hi> is diuine Scripture, as that the Books of <hi>Machabees</hi> are: and once againe wee aske them, in case a Generall Council defines any point of doctrine, verily iudging it to be agreeable to Scripture, how can our Aduersaries be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly</hi> sure, that it is not so? or that their contrary interpretation, is better, then that of so great and learned an Assembly of the Prelats of the Church?</p>
               <p>To tell vs therfore (and dispute the matter soe largily as he doth) that <hi>there is not the same Authority of Christ, of Scripture, and the whole Church</hi> in the falsely-defined Article, that there is in the true, and that <hi>the Scripture doth not equally giue eyther ground, or power, to define truth and errour,</hi> what is it but to trifle tediously?
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57798:198"/>
For wee neither say, nor suppose, any such thing. So as the Bishop by his discourse here, meerly labours to declare <hi>ignotunt per ignotius:</hi> it beeing a thing wholy vnknow'n to vs, yea impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs to know <hi>infallibly</hi> and <hi>certainly,</hi> when the Councill defines matters equally, <hi>by and according to the Authorities</hi> of Scripture, or the whole Church, but by the Councils own Acte; that is, by her definition so express't and fram'd, as there can be noe iust cause to doubt, but that she defin'd, or presum d her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to define both the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> point conformably to Scripture and the sense of the whole Church. See now, what great reason the Relatour had to obiect <hi>cunning</hi> and <hi>falsity</hi> to A. C. in this business.</p>
               <p>Our Aduersarie here againe runnes from the marke. A. C. <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 2.</note> in giuing the reason of his former demand, speaks of <hi>examining</hi> only, and not of <hi>iudging,</hi> as his words shew. <hi>If wee leaue this</hi> (sayth he, meaning the erring and not-erring of a Generall Councill, in the points which the Bishop supposes she defines <hi>fallibly</hi>) <hi>to be EXAMINE'D by euery priuate man, the examination not beeing infallible, will need to be examined by an other, and that by an other. Without end, or euer coming to infallible certainty</hi> etc. The. Bishop answers, that <hi>he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>  vs the way, how an erring Councill may be rectifyed, and the peace of the Church eyther preseru'd or restor'd,</hi> etc. viz. §. 32. num 5. §. 33. consid. 7. num. 4. of his Relation: and wee haue likewise shew'n all his pretended <hi>wayes</hi> to be deuicus, and not to lead to the <hi>end</hi> he aymes at. But does he there, or any where else, shew, how wee may be <hi>infallibly</hi> assur'd, that a Councill erring in one point, does not also erre in the other, in the case aboue mention'd; which is the only thing his Aduersary here vrges him withall? does he shew, that A. Cs. obiected <hi>process in infinitum</hi> can be auoyded by any priuate and fallible <hi>examination</hi> of the Councils decrees? or does he prescribe any other meanes of <hi>examining</hi> them, but what is, in his own opinion, fallible at least, though (perhaps) not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate?</p>
               <p>First, he assignes <hi>Scripture</hi> for a way to examin a Councils definition: but how can the examiner be <hi>sure</hi> the Scripture beares that sense, in which he vnderstands it, and not that, in which the Councill vnderstands it? Secondly, he assignes the fowre first Generall Councils: but how can he be sure, that their Authority in defining is such, as euery one ought to obey, and not that of after-Councils? Thirdly, he assignes the Creeds, as containing all things necessary and Fundamentall in the Fayth: but does he meane all of them? all the three, Apostolicall, <hi>Nicen, Athanasian?</hi> By his words it seemes he doth, for he makes noe difference betwixt them; and in reason 'tis necessary he should, seeing 'tis euident, the Apostles Creed alone, will not ferue the turn: it making no express mention of the Diuinity of Christ, and of the holy Ghost, nor of the Mystery of the Trinity, Jncarnation etc. which yet wee confidently presume are (all of them) <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi> points in the Bishops Creed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:57798:199"/>
But then wee aske, how come these latter Creeds (the <hi>Nicen</hi> and <hi>Athanasian</hi>) to be infallible; seeing their Authours, in the composing of them, were fallible and subiect to errour, in the Relatours opinion? How can they be a ground of <hi>infallible certaintie</hi> to me, if possibly in themselues they man be false? which, though it cannot be sayd, or suspected of the Apostles, (nor, by consequence, of their Creed, as it was compos'd and publish't by them) yet wee make a Querie, what <hi>infallible</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority assur'd the Bishop, or assur's vs now, that the Creed which wee haue at present, and commonly call <hi>the Apostles Creed,</hi> is really <hi>the same,</hi> which the Apostles first composed? or that wee haue it entire and vnchanged? Tradition, or the Church, by the Relatours grounds, must not be pretended here; seeing they are (both of them) fallible with him, and may deceiue vs. It followes then, euen from his own principles, that he neither hath, nor can haue <hi>infallible certainty</hi> for his beleeuing the Creeds: and as for the fowre first Generall Councils, the Relatour must needs haue less pretense of reason to alledge them for a ground of infallible certainty in beleeuing; seeing in all his booke he neuer acknowledges, nor with consonancy to his own doctrine could acknowledge, Councills to be infallible, euen in Fundamentalls. Where is then his infallible certaintie, for that <hi>one</hi> Fayth <hi>necessary to Saluation?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. How farre the Relatour speakes truth, when he sayes, <hi>be giues noe way to any priuate man to be iudge of a Generall Councill,</hi> lett any man iudge, that considers his doctrine. Liberty to <hi>examine</hi> euen the definitions of Generall Councils, if <hi>they see iust cause,</hi> he does expressly grant to <hi>priuate</hi> persons; yea and some kinde of <hi>iudgement</hi> too, he allowes them, viz. that of <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> though not the other of <hi>power,</hi> as he distinguishes. But is there not a inake, lurking in the grass here? may wee not feare fome poyson vnder the gilded pill of his Lordships distinction? This <hi>iudgement of discretion</hi> (as he calls it) especially if common experience and practice may expound it, what does it signifie less, then a <hi>power</hi> assum'd by euery priuate person, not only to <hi>examin</hi> the validity of such reasons and grounds, as confirme the defined article, but <note n="*" place="margin">See Relat. §. 38. num. 15. p. 345.</note> 
                  <hi>constantly to deny both it and them,</hi> if his priuate spirit, or <hi>discretion</hi> tells him, that he hath <hi>better reasons</hi> for the contrary, or that the Councils definition is an errour? Has not this always been the way and methode of Heretiques? To what end doe they, at any time, put themselues vpon this scrutiny of examining the definitions of Generall Councills? was it euer for any other reason, but to see, whether they could finde a flaw in them? which, when they persuaded themselues to haue once spy'd, did they not presently, in their own vayne hearts, fall to despise the Councill (which they suppos'd to erre) as ignorant and ouerseen in their proper business? did they not vsually thereupon pretend scruple presently and tenderness of conscience, in lieu of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary obedience and submission? Did they not forthwith imagin themselues <hi>inlightened</hi> persons; and soone after that, <hi>oblig'd in</hi>

                  <hi>conscience</hi> to impart their pretended <hi>lights</hi> to other people, and vnder a pretense of informing <hi>weaker</hi> brethren, draw them to the like <hi>discret examining</hi> of the Churches defin'd and generally receiu'd doctrine with themselues? Js not this the know'n <hi>course</hi> of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? Is not this Satans methode, by degrees to vsher in publique and generall defections from the Authority both of Generall Councills, and all the Lawfull Pastours and Gouernours of the Church? See in effect the whole benefitt of the Bishops goodly deuise. This, and very little else (as the experience of all ages and times shew) is the fruite that comes to the Church and true Religion, by allowing priuate persons this <hi>iudgement of discretion,</hi> or liberty to <hi>examin</hi> the definitions of Generall Councills.</p>
               <p>Not to vrge, that from this doctrine of the Bishop it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily and plainly followes, that the Authority of Generall Councils is of noe greater force, for the settling of our Fayth and the satisfaction of our vnderstanding in matters of Religion, then the testimony and resolution of any priuate man is, or may be. For if J be allowed to examin the grounds of the one as well as of the other, and may (if in my owne priuate iudgement J thinke J haue iust cause) as lawfully <hi>doubt,</hi> and <hi>deny</hi> the desinitions of the one, as the resolution of the other, wherein doe J attribute more to a Generall Council, then J doe to a priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? Seeing 'tis euident, that neither the one, nor the other haue further Authority with mee, or command ouer my vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then their seuerall reasons, in my own iudgement, deserue; and that, if the reasons of a priuate man appeare to mee to be more weighty and conuincing then those of a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, J am permitted freely and without sinne to embrace the sayd priuate persons opinion, and refuse the doctrine of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Councill.</p>
               <p n="7">7. His asserting so confidently, that <hi>for things necessary and Fundamentall in the Fayth, wee need noe assistance from other Generall Councills, beside the fowre first,</hi> seemes noe less strange, and is sufficiently disprou'd euen by euidence of fact. For hath not the assistance of posteriour Generall Councils, since the fowre first, been really and <hi>de facto</hi> found necessary for deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining matters of Fayth? what doe our Aduersaries thinke of the fifth Generall Councill, or second of <hi>Constantinople?</hi> was it not matter of Fayth, and <hi>necessary to Saluation,</hi> what this Councill defin'd against the Heresie of <hi>Origen</hi> and his Adherents? what thinke they of the sixth, against the <hi>Monothelites</hi> was not the doctrine and beleefe of <hi>two distinct wills</hi> in Christ, defin'd by this Councill, in the Bishops opinion, as Fundamentall in the Fayth, as the doctrine and beleefe of <hi>two natures,</hi> defin'd by that of <hi>Chalcedon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, may not fresh errours arise? may not some new vnheardof Heresie spring vp, corrupting the Fayth contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fundamentall matters, in Religion? Jf they doe, shall it not be necessary for the Church, that such errours be condemned by Generall Councils? The Relatour pretends here that <hi>some</hi>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:57798:200"/>
that <hi>some of our own, very honest and learned men</hi> (as he is pleas'd to qualifie them, when it serues his turn) <hi>are of the same opinion with him</hi> in this point, citing in proofe hereof, certayn words (as he pretends) of <hi>Petrus de Alliaco,</hi> an ancient Schoole-Author, otherwise know'n by the name of <hi>Cardinalis Cameracensis. Vertsstmum esse</hi> &amp;c. <hi>'Tis most true; all things</hi> (pertaining to Religion) <hi>are well order'd by the fathers, if they were as well and diligently obserued.</hi> But first, here's a great mistake. The words which the Bishop cites, are not the words of <hi>Petrus de Alliaco,</hi> nor any part of the booke which he wrote <hi>de reformatione Ecclesiae,</hi> and presented to the Councill of <hi>Constance,</hi> but of one <hi>Orthuinus Grauius</hi> who publish't it, with diuerse other small tractates of that nature, in his <hi>fasciculus rerum expetenilarum</hi> etc. printed at <hi>Basil.</hi> 1535. as any man may see that peruses that booke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, admitting they were, or that <hi>Petrus de Aliaco</hi> did in his treatise say the same thing in effect, yet were it little to the Bishops purpose. For the Authours meaning is, that those Fathers haue so well ordered all things in respect of the Mysteries which were then opposed by Heretiques, that if they were well obserued, there would be noe need of making new definitions in reference to the same doctrine. But he does not deny, but that vpon new emergent occasions, other Generall Councills may be necessary in the Church: nay the designe of his whole treatise is to shew, that how well soeuer <hi>all things had been order'd and determin'd</hi> by former Councills, yet by reason of the long Schisme that had been in the Church, and of many Heresies springing vp, the Authority of an other Generall Councill (to witt, of <hi>Constance</hi>) was necessary, as well to determin the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted points of Fayth, as to extirpate the Schisme, and all other abuses and disorders in the Church. With what truth then could the Bishop pretend, that <hi>Petrus de Aliaco</hi> is <hi>of the same opinion</hi> with him touching the <hi>no-necessity</hi> of making <hi>any new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations</hi> in matter of Fayth by any Generall Councills whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, <hi>after the fowre first?</hi> And as for <note n="*" place="margin">in 1.

                  <hi>Holkot</hi> what euer he may teach concerning Heresie or Infidelity, when the errour is not know'n to be against the definition, or vniuersall Tradition of the Church, yet doubtless, when it is know'n to be so (and vnder that quality only wee dispute of it with the Bishop) neither he, nor any other Catholique Authour, will deny it to be formall Heresie or Infidelitie, to hold it.</p>

But for matters, which the Church hath found necessary, for preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Schismes, preseruation of vnity, and for vindicating, or

               <p n="9">9. But the Relatour will now giue vs a reason why it cannot <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 24.</note> be necessary for the Church to haue power, <hi>infallibly</hi> to determin points not-Fundamentall in Protestant sense, although, euen by his own supposition, they be <hi>diuine truths,</hi> and theyr opposite errours <hi>dangerous</hi> to soules.

(<hi>there must be Heresies</hi>) whence he concludes; <hi>'tis out of doubt, Christ neuer left such an infallible assurance, as is able to preuent them, or such a mastering power in his Church, as is able to ouer-awe them.</hi> But J answer, what consequence is here?

                  </gap>  there will (vnauoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably) be Heresies; crgo the Church hath not full powre to condemne them, and to vindicate the contrary truth? To mee the contrary seemes farre more iustly and rightly concluded, viz. that because there will be Heresies euer and anon springing vp, amongst Christians, therefore the Pastours of the Church haue, and ought to haue, all necessary power to obuiate their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and to preserue the flocke of Christ in the integrity of true Fayth: which (as wee haue often shew'n) cannot be done; if the Pastours of the Church lawfully assembled in Generall Councills to that purpose, should eyther themselues happen to crre, or to determine the truth, withless then absolute and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable certainty.</p>
               <p>But as to the obiection it selfe, the Bishop cleerly mistakes our meaning. When wee say the Church hath power to <hi>preuent Schismes and Heresies,</hi> it is not mean't, that they shall not <hi>be at all,</hi> but so as they shall not be without <hi>iust</hi> controule and censure, so as they shall not so much as seeme <hi>lawfully</hi> and <hi>reasonably</hi> to <hi>be</hi> nor so farre preuaile by theyr <hi>beeing,</hi> as to peruerte the true doctrine of the Church. Heresies may be; but the Faythfull members of the Church, hauing due care of themselues, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their duty well towards their lawfull Pastours, shall be euer fully secured against their snares, and none deceiued by them at least, not vnto damnation or guilt of mortall sinne, but such as through their own voluntary fault and negligence, <hi>suffer</hi> themselues to be misted by them. Could his Lordship possibly be ignorant, that the Church susficiently <hi>preuents</hi> Heresies and Schismes, on her part, when she <hi>certainly</hi> declares the truth, and <hi>rightly</hi> determins the matter, about which Christians began to contend, and to be diuided in opinion one from another; when the duly censures and anathematizeth the contrary errour? lastly when she vseth all lawfull and practicable meanes within her
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57798:201"/>
power to preuent and extirpate them? This is <hi>preuention</hi> both necessary, and also sufficient, on the Churches part; and this beeing done, if the effect follow not, it must not be ascribed to want of any spirituall power and authority in the Church, but only to the incorrigible pride, obstinacy and malice of her rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious children; which nothing, but the hand of God, can ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule and <hi>master.</hi>

               <p>A thing most cleere and manifest in all ciuill Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth's, prudently instituted: wherein, when seditions and rebellions happen to arise, (and they doe happen sometimes in the very best) wise men doe not thinke 'tis for want of any requisite power and authority in the chiefe Magistrate, or state, to command and compell all men to be obedient to lawes; but that it proceeds from those vnauoydable distempers, which by corruption and frailtie of humane nature, are incident to mens mindes, and which can neither be foreseen, nor quelled, in an instant, by any power on earth.</p>
               <p>J adde, that the Relatours obiection (<hi>oportet Haereses esse</hi> &amp;c.) has as much force to proue the Church <hi>not infallible,</hi> euen in points Fundamentall and <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to Saluation; and would exclude the necessity of any infallible power and authority in the Church, to <hi>preuent</hi> errours contrary to such points; which were repugnant euen to the Bishops own assertions. For, the words of St. <hi>Paul, ther must be Heresies,</hi> are as true of errours contrary to Fundamentall points, as other; and there will be Heresies, more or less, in all ages, in matters <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> as well as in things <hi>not necessary.</hi> Yea surely, according to the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles and opinion of Protestants, such errours only are properly to be esteem'd Heresies, which are contrary to Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and absolutely necessary points; in regard they say, that sauing Fayth may consist with all other errours whatsoeuer. So that, if because Heresies <hi>must be,</hi> or <hi>will be,</hi> the Bishop will conclude, there is neither <hi>infallible certaintie,</hi> nor any <hi>meanes</hi> of <hi>infallibbe certainty</hi> in the Church for the <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>determining</hi> the truth, in such points as are contested by Heretiques (as he doth most plainly and euidently pretend to conclude, by his alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this text) he must in consequence also confess, there is noe infailible certainty, nor <hi>meanes</hi> of infallible certainty, less in the Church, for the teaehing and beleefe of any points at all, euen of the most absolutely and vniuersally necessary.</p>

               <p>Wee acknowledge the Church of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> is sometimes, by Antiquity, styl'd a <hi>Mother-Church,</hi> and <hi>the Head</hi> of all other Churches.

               <p>Secondly, as to the words, wherby St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> professes to <hi>Gornelius,</hi> that he for his part, did exhort all that sayld out of <hi>Africke</hi> to <hi>Rome, that they should acknowledge and embrace the ROOTE and matrix of the Catholique Church,</hi> who can imagin any other thing should be mean't by them, but that he exhorted such people, when they came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that they should ioyne themselues to the partie and communion of the lawfull Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> because his Communion was <hi>the roote and matrix</hi> of the Church, and haue nothing to doe with the Schismatiques?

                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:57798:204"/>
that <hi>vnity</hi> is the roote of the Church. Beside, what satisfaction, or iust apologie could St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> thinke it would be to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> (already somewhat offended with him, though by mistake, for not duly acknowledging his Authority) to tell him, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted all people that came out of Africke to <hi>Rome,</hi> that they, should <hi>acknowledge</hi> vnity to be <hi>the roote</hi> of the Church, or that they should <hi>keep the vnity</hi> of the Church in generall, without specifying his communion, or the communion of the lawfull Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in particular?</p>
               <p>The acknowledgement then of <hi>the roote</hi> and <hi>matrix</hi> of the Church, which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> here meanes, and exhorts good Christians to make and constantly stand to, when they came to <hi>Rome,</hi> hath doubtless something in it more <hi>speciall</hi> then this; that is to say, it must relate to that, which euen by St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> own iudgement <note n="b" place="margin">Ad Petri Cathedram, vndè vnitas Sacerdotalis exorta est. D. Cyprian. lib. 1 Epist. 3.</note> elsewhere deliuer'd, is the <hi>roote</hi> and <hi>matrix</hi> of the Churches vnity; to witt, the lawfull Successour of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whome the Church it selfe owes her vnity, and aboute whome, there was at that time dispute and controuersie, and a doubt rais'd amonge Christians at <hi>Rome.</hi> So that with very good reason, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> might exhort such as sayl'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This indeed was a conuenient subiect of exhortation, and well worthy of St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> charitie and zeale; but that he should exhort them to any thing else in this place, or noe more then the Relatour will seeme to thinke, is wholy incredible.</p>
               <p>But the Bishop conceiues, it could not be St. <hi>Cyprians meaning</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> here, to teach, that the Sea of Rome is <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>

His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because <hi>that there was at this time, an open Schisme at Rome; two Bishops Cornelius and Nouatian; two Congregations, which respectiuely attended and obserued them: soe that a perplexed question must needs haue diuided theyr thoughts, which of these two had been the roote and matrix of the Catbolique Church.</hi> I answer first, supposing it had been, for a while, really doubtfull to St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and those of <hi>Africke,</hi> which of the two Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> (<hi>Cornelius</hi> or <hi>Nouatianus</hi>) were the right and lawfull Bishop: yet to those that were at <hi>Rome,</hi> and vnderstood the true and certaine carriage of affaires, touching their respectiue elections, it was not doubtfull; at <hi>Rome,</hi> without question, the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this mater was sufficiently known. Now wee say, St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> intent, in the words alledged was not (precisely) to exhort people to adhere eyther to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> or <hi>Nouatianus,</hi> in particular and by name; but to adhere to him, they should for certaine finde, by the generall report and iudgement of the Faythfull at <hi>Rome,</hi> to haue been lawfully and Canonically chosen Bishop of that Church, and not to ioyne themselues to him, that was chosen Schismatically.</p>
               <p>Secondly I answer, 'tis not so certain as the Relatour sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57798:204"/>
whether at the writing of this very Epistle, it were really doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himselfe, which of the two, <hi>Cornelius</hi> or <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatianus,</hi> were the true and lawfull Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> yea vnless the Publishers of <hi>St. Cyprians</hi> Epistles haue by mistake inuerted the order of them, the contrary seemes to be cleere; because by the 41. 42. 44. all precedent to this alledged by the Bishop, it manifestly appeares, that both St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his Colleagues had been already, by intelligence from <hi>Rome,</hi> so fully satisfy'd touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lawfull election of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that they both denyed <note n="c" place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munione eos nostrâ statim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Wherfore, the Bishops following deuise, viz. that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> should require all strangers trauelling to <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>suspend their Communion there,</hi> that is, to communicate neither with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> nor <hi>Nouatianus,</hi> till they saw, <hi>how the Catholique Church would incline to approue, or disapproue, their respectiue elections</hi> (to speake truth) is but an ayery fiction; it beeing by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his Colleagues presum'd to be euen then sufficiently know'n and certaine at <hi>Rome,</hi> which of the two was lawfully chosen Bishop: otherwise, to what purpose should they send their Legats out of <hi>Africke</hi> to be certainly inform'd of the truth touching that matter? J adde, when, or how could the Catholique Church declare her iudgement in the case so authentically, as to oblige all persons to acquiescence? would the Bishop haue had all Christian strangers to suspend their communion both from the one and the other, till a Generall Councill had determin'd the controuersie? or how could a Councill possibly determine it, but by and vpon such <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> grounds, as did already make it vnquestionable at <hi>Rome,</hi> which of the two was the true Pope?</p>
               <p>Wee acknowledge indeed, with <hi>Baronius</hi> here cited By the <note place="margin">Baron. ad Ann 154. num. 64.</note> Bishop, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his Colleagues did for a while <hi>suspend their Communion</hi> from both parties; which vpon this occasion they might iustly doe; yet not <hi>separate</hi> from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as the Relatour, too hastily inferres. For it was <hi>for a while,</hi> as it were <hi>sede vacante</hi> to them in <hi>Africke,</hi> till they had receiu'd sufficient informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who was lawfull Bishop of that Church: which as soone as euer they had obtain'd, they shew'd by their practice, how necessary they held it, to be in Communion with him. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> then did very well to exhort all Christians, that had occasion to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> to acknowledge and sticke close to <hi>the roote and matrix</hi> of the Church, that is, not to suffer themselues to be draw'n into
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57798:205"/>
Schisme, or to side with the Schismatiques, but Constantly to adhere to the true and lawfull Bishop of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And as this was a proper exhortation for St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to make, so was it also a iust and sufficient Apologie for him to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he did neither disowne the Sea Apostolique, nor slight the true Bishop thereof. Whereas, if wee suppose him to meane only, according to the Bishops exposition of his words, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should acknowledge and hold the vnity of the Catholique Church in generall, but suspend their Communion both with <hi>Nouatian and Cornelius</hi> too, till the Church herselfe should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin the controuersie, what respect doth he shew to the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Sea and its lawfull Bishop, more then he doth to an Hereticall party, and the Schismatique which they followed?</p>
               <p>Beside, this imaginary suspension of Communion, till the Catholique Church should declare her approbation or disapproue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the sayd elections, is cleerly refuted by the very Epistle, which the Bishop cites: wherein, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his Colleagues profess in esfect, that they did not expect any such declaration of the Church, but that vpon the first report, or answer of their Legats from <hi>Rome</hi> touching the election passed, letters were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to be sent, to all the Bishops of <hi>Africa,</hi> to suspend their Communion noe longer, <note n="e" place="margin">vt—rete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a per nos veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, et ad comproban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Ordina. tionem tuam factâ Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate maiore, LITERAE FIERENT, vt te vniuer si Collegae nos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri, et Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tuam, id est Catholicae Ecclesiae vni tatem paritèr et charitatem probarent fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitèt et reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerent.

               <p n="2">2. By the way, good Reader, I pray, obserue and iudge, whether St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth not here sufficiently expound himselfe, and shew what he meanes by those words <hi>roote and matrix</hi> of the Catholique Church, when speaking of the Communion of the Pope, he plainly pronounces <hi>that it is the vnity of the Church.</hi> What is this but to say with vs, and directly contrary to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours Gloss, that it is <hi>the roote and matrix</hi> of the Church? For, seeing the forme, or at least the most formall and essentiall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church, is vnity in the profession of the true Fayth, if the Popes communion be that, which giues <hi>vnity</hi> to the Chnrch, and tyes all together in the profession of the true Fayth (as St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> here affirmes it to be) sure, noe man can be so vnreasonable, as to thinke it deserues not to be styled <hi>the roote and matrix</hi> of the Church. Not to vrge, that in these very Epistles St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> blames the Schismatiques at <hi>Rome,</hi> for their endeauouring to create a new Bishop there, against one that was already lawfully elected and ordain'd, vpon this ground, that by so doing, they did, as much as in them lay, procure <hi>Ecclesiam alteram institui</hi> (the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Epist. 44.</note> of <hi>an other</hi> Church) which, sayth he, <hi>nefas est nec licet fieri</hi> (may not in any wise be attempted) telling them, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings herein, were <hi>contra Institutionis Catholicae vnitatem,</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that vnity, in which all true Catholique Christians were <hi>instructed,</hi> by the very principles of Catholique Religion, to hold and maintaine) that it was <hi>contra Sacramentum semel traditum diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae dispositionis &amp; Catholicae vnitatis</hi> (against that <hi>Order</hi> or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which God, <hi>once for all,</hi> appointed in his Church, for the

               <p>What are all these testimonies but so many euident conuictions and demonstrations of the Relatours huge mistaking, (not to say any worse) when he pretends, that by <hi>the roote and matrix of the Church,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> vnderstands noe more, but <hi>the vnity of the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall?</hi> nor are they any whit infringed by what he brings out of St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epistle to <hi>Iubaianus</hi> written against the <hi>Nouatians,</hi> who durst rebaptize Catholiques: in which Epistle St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath these words, <hi>WEE ARE THE HEAD OF BAPTISME.</hi> What makes this against vs? For first, the Bishop himselfe acknowledges, that by <hi>WEE,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth not vnderstand his own <hi>person,</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> precisely, but includes all other particular true Churches, and chiefly <hi>the Roman,</hi> where <hi>Nouatian</hi> himselfe was baptized. <hi>The Head of Baptisme</hi> then in St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> meaning, are all true Churches, as they stand in due subordination and Communion <hi>vnited</hi> with the <hi>Roman,</hi> and not otherwise: which wee willingly grant. But yet it followes not from hence (as the Bishop would haue it) <hi>that it is all one to be head, or roote of Baptisme, and to be head and roote of the Church.</hi> For the whole Church, as <hi>one</hi> by Communion with the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> may properly enough be styled <hi>the head of Baptisme,</hi> which signifies noe more, then that the chiefe and ordinary power of baptizing, is in the Catholique Church: but it will neuer be proper to say, the Church is <hi>the head and roote of the Church;</hi> for that were to make <hi>the whole</hi> to be only a principall part; which is absurd.</p>
               <p>Now that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did hold all true Churches to be <hi>ONE,</hi> by Communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop and Church, is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently euidenc'd by what is aboue sayd. Nor can he with reason be <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> vnderstood in any other sense, when he speakes those words in the beginning of that period cited by the Bishop, <hi>Nos qui Ecclesiae vnius caput et radicem tenemus,</hi> etc. For as by <hi>Ecclesiae vnius</hi> it will not be denyed, but he meanes the Church Catholique, soe by the words <hi>caput et radicem</hi> (if wee expound him with conformity to his already cited assertions) wee cannot possibly vnderstand any thing else, but the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Sea: the one, as <hi>head</hi> ruling and commanding by Authority: the other, as <hi>matrix,</hi> by Communion, embracing and comprehending all true Christians,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57798:206"/>
or the whole Catholique Church on earth.</p>
               <p>Beside this, 'tis very obseruable what the Relatour himselfe alledges, and concludes out of an other Epistle of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> viz. that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>Africke</hi> sent their Legats to <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> on purpose to bring the <hi>`Nouatians,</hi> that is, the Schismaticall <note place="margin">lib. 2. Epist.</note> partie there, to the vnity and Communion of <hi>the Church vniuersall,</hi> but that by reason of the obstinacy and stiffness of those Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, <hi>their labour was lost.</hi> Now (for ought appeares to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by the sayd Epistle) the reduction of the <hi>Nouatians</hi> to the Churches vnity (whereof by the Bishops own confession St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> there speaks) was nothing else, but the bringing them to obedience and Communion with <hi>Cornelius</hi> the lawfull Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Relatour himselfe also intimates: and consequently, it must be acknowledged, there is something in resisting and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the lawfull Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath greater contrariety to the vnity of the Church, then there is in resisting and opposing any other particular Bishop.</p>
               <p>And if it were otherwise, why should all the Churches of <hi>Africa</hi> esteeme themselues, and the whole Church soe concerned in it? why should they send Bishops of their own, on purpose to <hi>Rome,</hi> to reduce the Schismatiques, with so much diligence and care, to the obedience of their lawfull Bishop? what reason can be giuen of this, but that they foresaw and fear'd, that if a Schisme proceeded there, the whole Church would, in a short time, come to be inuolued in it, and diuided into two seuerall parties, by acknowledging two heads, or <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops? When <hi>Nouatus</hi> sett vp <hi>Maiorinus,</hi> the first Donatist Bishop, at <hi>Carthage,</hi> against <hi>Caecilian</hi> the lawfull Bishop; and when <hi>Meletius</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> had their seuerall parties at <hi>Antioch;</hi> likewise, when <hi>Anthimus,</hi> an Eutychian Heretique, was intruded into the Sea of <hi>

                     </gap> 
                  </hi> against the Catholique Bishop thereof, there was noe such thing fear'd as breaking the Generall vnity of the Church; there bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still a visible and certainly-know'n head of the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, viz. the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who by his authority, kept all in vnity, and first or last rectify'd and composed those dissentions. But here, of necessity it would haue been otherwise. For the breach of Ecclesiasticall vnity beeing in the very head, fountaine, and roote thereof, would (vnless preuented) vnauoydably, in no long time, spread it selfe ouer the whole Church: and thence it was, that the Bishops of <hi>Africa</hi> thought it necessary, with extraordinary diligence, to make vp the breach there, and reduce the separated parties to vnity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Tertullian</hi> (whome the Relatour also cites) makes nothing against vs. For he only affirms, that all those many and great <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Churches founded by the Apostles, <hi>are that ONE Church, which is from the Apostles;</hi> and <hi>that they are all FIRST</hi> (or primitiue) <note place="margin">Tertull. lib. de praescript. cap. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>all of them APOSTOLICALL, because they doe all of them allow and approue ONE VNITY;</hi> that is, (say wee) an vnity deriued from <hi>one,</hi> and center'd in <hi>one;</hi> who is no other, but St. <hi>Peters</hi> lawfull Successor, the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> by subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:57798:206"/>
vnto whome in Fayth and discipline, as vnto the vniuersall Pastour of the Church, all particular Churches are made <hi>one,</hi> and doe in effect continue <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the same</hi> Catholique, Primitiue, and Apostolicall Church, or Churches, which the Apostles first of all founded. So that, till our aduersaries either disproue this gloss, or giue a better, wee shall make no scruple to assert, that in <hi>Tertullians</hi> iudgement as well as St. <hi>Cyprians, Rome</hi> (or the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) may well be termed <hi>the roote and matrix</hi> of all other Churches, because none remaine in the Catholique Church; but by <hi>vnity</hi> with <hi>Rome</hi> and the Bishop thereof.</p>
               <p>Nor matters it, that <hi>Pamelius</hi> reckons vp diuerse Churches <note place="margin">ibidem.</note> (which he calls <hi>Originall</hi> and <hi>Mother-Churches</hi>) before the <hi>Roman.</hi> For as to the name (<hi>Originall</hi> and <hi>Mother-Churches</hi>) wee haue giuen the reason of it in the precedent chapter, when wee spake of the Church of <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> and for the thing, viz. that he <hi>reckons. Rome in the last place</hi> (as if therfore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were to be accounted inferiour to those other) wee answer, his Lordship would neuer haue made this obseruation <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 368. and pag. 371, in margin.</note> twice, had he, first consulted the Master of Ceremonies about it. For he certainly, would haue resolu'd him, that in marshalling dignityes subordinate one to an other (as the case was here, all the particular Churches mentioned by <hi>Pamelius</hi> viz. <hi>Smyrna, (Philippi, Corinth, Ephesus,</hi> beeing subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to <hi>Rome</hi>) the Principall, or Souereign is to be ranked in the last place. Doth <hi>Pamelius,</hi> or <hi>Tertullian</hi> himselfe, acknowledge the like priuiledges and authority in regard of the whole Church, to belong to those other originall and <hi>Mother-Churches,</hi> which they doe to the <hi>Roman?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for that irreligious Acte of the Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> (which the Bishop mentions) 'tis but too much imitated by Protestants. For as he sett vp the Image of <hi>Jupiter in the very place</hi> where <hi>Christ</hi> suffered; and as he profaned <hi>Bethlehem</hi> with erecting the Temple of <hi>Adonis,</hi> as thinking to destroy Christian Religion, by laying wast the place where it was first founded; soe doe our Aduersaries plant all their batteries against <hi>Rome:</hi> persuading themselues, that if they could beate downe that chiefe fortress of the Catholique Church, they should soone destroy our whole Church. But as that Heathenish Emperour (<hi>Adrian</hi>) did, soe doe these enemyes of God and true Religion; they labour in vayne. For the Church is <hi>inuincible,</hi> the gates of Hell it selfe cannot preuaile against her: and <note n="a" place="margin">D.

               </p>
               <p>Jn the most principall and proper sense then, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (and that only) is both the <hi>rocke</hi> and <hi>roote</hi> of the Church-Catholique, as beeing by institution and appointment of Christ, principally and solely ordain'd to supplie the place, and performe the office both of <hi>rocke</hi> and <hi>roote</hi> to all other Churches whatsoeuer; how be it, in a less principall and limited sense, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

errours in Religion be not sinne, so long as the person that holds them, opposes not the know'n truth, or holds them not against conscience; and that by the Bishops own confession also, 'twas not possible for him to know, that the lady, by embracing our Fayth and Church, did any thing contrary to her conscience, or oppos'd any truth she knew, vpon what ground could he condemn her of sinne in what she did; or say (as in effect he doth) that she could not <hi>so easily answer to God</hi> for her doing so, as she might for going to his English-Protestant Church? wherein, euen by his own grounds, (beeing suppos'd to be a Roman-Catholique) she did manifestly committ sinne, in doing against her conscience (which is always sin, more or less) in dissembling with God and the world, in matters of so great moment, in halting on both sides, and in <hi>beleeuing</hi> Religion after one sort, and <hi>practising</hi> it after an other. <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>

As for what concerns Catholique Authours, who may possibly affirm it lawfull, in some cases, and with due limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, for Catholiques to goe to Protestant-Churches, there doctrine is necessarily restrained vnto such countries and places, in which, going to Protestant-Churches is no <hi>distinctiue signe</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that is, where it doth not with any presumption signify, that a man is a Protestant: which falls out otherwise in <hi>England.</hi> For here it hath always been held a conformity <hi>to</hi> and <hi>with</hi> the Protestant Religion professed in <hi>England,</hi> to goe to Church: and therfore, not allowed by any of our Diuines; who neuer giue way to the profession of false doctrine. Now, who is more guilty of dissimulation in Religion, which the Bishop charges vpon some of our partie, then the Bishop himselfe? Doth he not §. 35. <hi>punct.</hi> 5. professedly allow possibility of Saluation to such Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, as doe both <hi>wittingly and knowingly associate themselues, euen to the gross superstitions of the Romish Church, and such as come euen neere to Idolatrie,</hi> only because they beleeue the Creed and hold the Foundation? what is this but to teach it lawfull, at least no sinne excluding Saluation, to ioyne ones selfe outwardly to a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Church, in a superstitious, false, and euen Idolatrous way of worshipping God, contrary to ones knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stience only for some temporall and worldly respects? and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that men are not alwayes bound to <hi>seeme and appeare</hi> as they are, but sometimes at least, may haue liberty to <hi>weare a masque?</hi>

Truly for my part, I am soe farre from thinking, such an impossible case as the Bishop here putts, would eyther <hi>command peace,</hi> or <hi>confound peace-breakers,</hi> that is, the Authours or Abettours of priuate and contrary opinions in Religion, that I see nothing in the world, more likely to animate and encourage them still to persist in their obstinate refractariness, and to cast off euen all sense of due obedience and reuerence of the Churches authority.</p>

               <p>Againe, standing to the Bishops principles, and the common practice of his partie expounding them, who but <hi>himselfe and his fellowes</hi> shall be iudge, whether a lawfull and free Generall Councill hath defined, or doth define, <hi>by and according to Scripture?</hi> Doth not the Relatour himselfe expressly teach §. 38. <hi>num</hi> 15. <hi>that if a Generall Councill shall forget it selfe, and take vpon it to define things not absolutely necessary to be expressly known, and actually beleeu'd by all, neither it, nor the whole Church hath any such infallible assistance but that Christians</hi> (<hi>euery priuate Christian</hi> he sayes num. 23.) <hi>may vpon iust grounds both deliberately doubt, and constantly deny the definitions of such Councils?</hi> Likewise doth he not tell vs (<hi>Ibidem. num.</hi> 24.) <hi>that it is no pride, not to submitt to know'n and gross errours</hi> defin'd by Councils; instancing by name in the Councils of <hi>Lateran, Constance,</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> as hauing made erroneous definitions in matter of Fayth? what is this in effect but to teach, that noe man is bound to admitt the doctrine defined by Generall Councills, meerly for the Authority of the sayd Councills? and if not, who sees it not manifestly to fallow, that cuery priuate Christian (that is, in other terms, <hi>himselfe or some of his followes</hi>) is by our Aduersarie made iudge of Controuersies, and allowed to <hi>take the Authority</hi> vpon them, of censuring all for superstition and errour, that suites not with their priuate iudgement? which is the thing his Lordship, but euen now, confessed to be <hi>great pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Relatour will proue from the testimony of A: C. himselfe, that he is not guilty of <hi>pride</hi> in this particular, viz. of making himselfe Judge of Controuersies, etc. For why, <hi>A: C.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>taxes him for giuing too much power to Generall Councils, and binding men to a strict Obedience to them, euen in case of errour.

If it be true, viz. that the Bishop by his doctrine, doth really binde men to a <hi>strict obedience</hi> to the definitions of Generall Councills <hi>euen in case of errour,</hi> how grossly doth he contradict himselfe when he sayes, <hi>'tir noe pride, not to submitt to know'n and gross errours,</hi> euen of Generall Councills? and teaches, that a <hi>priuate man, vpon iust</hi>

                  <hi>grounds, may both deliberately doubt, and constantly deny the defined doctrines of some Councils?</hi> This surely, is in effect to deny both internall and externall obedience too, to Generall Councils. For if wee may <hi>deliberately</hi> doubt, where is internall obedience? If wee may <hi>constantly</hi> denie, where is the externall? Doth he not also teach, <hi>Ibidem. num.</hi> 23. that a priuate Christian may, not only <hi>consider</hi> and <hi>examin</hi> the definitions of Generall Councils, both for <hi>his own and the Churches satisfaction,</hi> but also <hi>propose his doubts</hi> in opposition to the Councils doctrine, in such manner as the whole Church shall be oblig'd to call an other Generall Councill to consider of the matter etc? How can this be done without <hi>expressing</hi> dislike, or shewing some <hi>externall</hi> disobedience to the precedent Councill? lett our Aduersarie, if they please, shew how. But wee haue already, chap. 20. and 21. largely treated of this subiect.</p>
               <p>To as little purpose is it for him to plead, <hi>that be submitts his iudgement in all humility to the Scripture, interpreted by the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church.</hi> But, that this is a false pretense wee haue all along in this treatise demonstrated; but more particularly, <hi>chap.</hi> 20. 21. The Bishop proceeds, saying that he submitts <hi>vpon new and necessary doubts to the iudgement of a lawfull and free Generall Councill.</hi> Fairly spoken. Vpon <hi>new and necessary doubts</hi> he will submitt; not otherwise. But wee must know, in the Bishops sense and according to the principles already aduanc'd and resolutely insisted vpon by him, noe doubts are <hi>necessary,</hi> but such as concern matters Fundamentall in Fayth, that is, as he perpetually explaines himselfe, absolutely necessary to be expressly know'n and beleeu'd by all Christians for Saluation. So that, in all other points of doctrine, eyther determin'd and defin'd already, or hereafter to be determin'd and defin'd by the Church, he does vpon the matter openly profess, that he will not submitt to the iudgement of a Generall Councill but follow his own priuate opinion, though contrary to it. Now what is this, but to take vpon him to be iudge of controuersies, in opposition to Generall Councills, and to censure for superstition and errour what suites not with his priuate fancie?</p>

               <p>Why therfore shall A.

A. C. in his vnderstanding of Scripture followes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Generall Councills; the Bishop relyes vpon no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, but this own; teaching that Generall Councills may erre in their exposition of Scripture, euen in points Fundamentall and absolutely necessary to Saluation. A. C. acknowledges, he can be <hi>infallibly</hi> certaine of nothing in matter of Fayth, by the bare letter of Scripture and the light of his own vnderstanding only: the Bishop is confident, that by the letter of Scripture only, and his owne iudgement, he can be <hi>infallibly</hi> assur'd of all necessary points of Fayth. A. C. is ready to submitt his iudgement to a Generall Councill in any point of doctrine, whatsoeuer seeming reasons, or grounds he may priuately haue to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: the Bishop allowes a man, vpon <hi>probable</hi> grounds to doubt, and vpon cleerer grounds to deny and oppose the definitions of such a Councill. A.C. thinks it an vngodly presumption to taxe Generall Councills of errour and superstition; the Bishop makes noc scruple to censure diuerse of them for damnable errours. A. C. holds it altogether vnlawfull for any Christian to dissent from the Catholique Church, in any point of defined doctrine whatsoeuer, great or small; the Bishop maintaines, that the whole Catholique Church may erre, both grossly and dangerously in all points not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57798:211"/>

Lett any indifferent person then be iudge, whether that which A.C. char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vpon the Bishop concerning <hi>pride,</hi> and taking vpon him to be iudge of Controuersies, in opposition to Generall Councills, may be <hi>as iustly turned vpon himselfe,</hi> as the Relatour here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
               <p>His next Paragraph only tells vs what was the conclusion of his first-publish't <hi>Relation of the conference with Mr. Fisher;</hi> wherein he falls againe to his wonted custome, of charging his Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary <note place="margin">Ibidem. num? 5.</note> (indirectly at least) with what he does not own. A. C. doth not maintaine the Pope to be infallible <hi>in all controuersies of Fayth,</hi> otherwise then in and with a Generall Councill; witness his own words in the end of his answer. <hi>I wish</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain and his lord, and euery other man carefully to consider, whether it be not more Christian</hi> etc. <hi>to thinke that the Pope, beeing St. Peters Successour, WITH A GENERALL COVNCILL, should be iudge of Controuersies,</hi> and <hi>his Pastorall iudgement</hi> (viz. in and with such a Councill) <hi>be accounted infallible, then to make euery man that can read Scripture, an interpreter of Scriptures and decider of Controuersies,</hi> euen to the controuling of Generall Councills, <hi>or to haue noe iudge in controuersies of Fayth at all.</hi> This is the summe of all that A. C. teaches, touching the Popes infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: and if the Bishop could really thinke this to be such a <hi>brayne-sicke deuice,</hi> as he talks of, I doubt it will be thought by some, that his own head was not alwayes in good temper.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A. C. to shew, that in matters of Fayth wee ought to submitt our iudgements to such doctours and Pastours, as by a continuall visible succession, haue without interruption or change, <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 6. 7.</note> brought the Fayth down from Christ and his Apostles to these our dayes, and shall, by vertue of Christs promise, in the like continued succession, so carry it downe to all future generations till the end of the world, makes vse of that text of St. <hi>Paul, Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. 12. 13. etc. where 'tis sayd, that <hi>Christ ascending, gaue some to be Apostles, some Prophets, some Euangelists, some Pastours and teachers, for the perfecting of the Saynts, for the worke of the ministery, for the edifying of the Body of Christ, till wee all come, in the vnity of the Fayth, and of the knowledge of the sonne of God, vnto a perfect man</hi> etc. 'Tis true, some from this place gather the Popes infallibility too, as well as the necessary succession of lawfull Pastours; because it is intimated, there shall be noe more wanting, in the sacred Hierarchy of the Church, the office of of an <hi>Apostle,</hi> then the office of a <hi>Pastour, or teacher,</hi> till the end of the world. Now to the office of an Apostle two things are necessary, viz. <hi>infallibility</hi> of iudgement in teaching, and <hi>power</hi> of iurisdiction, or gouernment, ouer the whole Church-Wherfore, seeing (as they suppose) 'tis manifest from this text,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:57798:212"/>
that an <hi>Apostleship</hi> must always be in the Church, and that noe other Ecclesiasticall Pastour can, with any probable pretense, lay clayme to that office, but only the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> as he is St. <hi>Peters</hi> successour, they conclude, that the successour of St. <hi>Peter</hi> must of necessity haue those two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>  of Apostleship ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his person; that is, he must be infallible in his doctrine and haue iurisdiction ouer the whole Church. So that it could not haue been counted <hi>a meere begging the question</hi> in A.C. had he alledged this text expressly in proofe of the Popes infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; which yet the Relatour himselfe cannot affirme that he did.</p>
               <p>And 'tis of it selfe, cleere enough, that A. C. alledges it to proue the continuall succession of Pastours and doctours in the Church, who haue brought down the <hi>vnchanged</hi> Fayth of Christ, from the Apostles to our dayes: this beeing one part of the proposition he had layd down, and by consequence, was to proue; and none of his other marginall allegations, viz. Matth. <note place="margin">A. C. pag. 73. 74.</note> 16. 18. † 18. 18. Luc. 22. 32. looking that way, but only at the infallibility of Generall Councills, or of the Popes <hi>Pastorall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in them; which was the second part. This succession of lawfull Pastours A. C. auerres it apparent in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and cannot be shew'n in the Protestant Church. The Bishop not beeing able to deny but a <hi>continuall succession</hi> of lawfull Pastours is rightly concluded from this text, has this only to answer, that 'tis not necessary, <hi>that this succession should be personall in any one particular Church, Roman or other.</hi> Admitt it were not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; what doth this help the Bishop, or his party? Protestants are farre enough from shewing any succession for themselues, eyther in a particular Church, or in the Church vniuersall. And the scope of A. Cs. argument here, beeing only to exclude, or barre Protestants (and with them all other Nouellists and Sectaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side) from beeing eyther in whole, or in part the true Church of Christ, it serues his turn well enough, that they can shew no such <hi>personall continued</hi> succession at all: for thence 'tis conuinc'd, they are noe part of the true Church; which 'tis confess't, must haue alwayes such a personall succession of lawfull Pastours, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, or other in some Church, or other, handing downe the <hi>vnchanged</hi> Fayth of Christ, in all ages, from the Apostles to the end of the world: and if our Aduersaries doe pretend to such a succession, lett them shew it.</p>
               <p>But then secondly I say, though it appeares not precisely by this text alone, that the abouesayd succession should be <hi>personall in any one particular Church,</hi> yet seeing 'tis certaine, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour did chiefly radicate and fown'd this succession <hi>in him,</hi> that was to be <hi>the chiefe</hi> of these Pastours, (to witt, St. <hi>Peter</hi>) and in <hi>the line</hi> of those, that were perpetually to succeed him, of necessity it was to be more eminently <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>perpetuall</hi> in <hi>

                  </hi> and <hi>them,</hi> then in any other. Wee confess also, that if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had continued (as by his first institution he was) only <hi>vniuersall</hi> Pastour of the whole Church, and had not been <hi>particular</hi> Bishop
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57798:212"/>
any one citty, or Diocess, his successours would haue succeeded him only in his <hi>vniuersall</hi> charge. But seeing besides this, St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and dyed Bishop of that Sea, and that his successours in the <hi>vniuersall Pastourchip</hi> haue likewise alwayes hitherto succeeded him in that <hi>particular</hi> charge, viz. as Bishop of <hi>Rome, per accidens</hi> at least, and <hi>de facto</hi> (though not absolutely and by vertue of any diuine institution) it comes to pass, that this succession of Pastours is now determined vnto a <hi>particular</hi> Church, and is as visible, perpetuall, vninterrupted in a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Church, as it is in the Church vniuersall; and so must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily continue, vntill St. <hi>Peters</hi> successours shall cease to be Bishops of that particular Church. For till they doe, the Pope wheresoeuer he chances to liue or dye, is still true Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by vertue of his beeing so, the succession of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pastours founded vpon him, is still <hi>vninterrupted</hi> in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>In this then, and in noe other sense, doe wee maintaine the succession of lawfull Pastours to be <hi>local</hi> or determined to a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> place, or Church. Nor is it by any, thought so absolutely necessary, as that if eyther the citty of <hi>Rome</hi> should be quite destroyed or wholly possess't by Jnfidells, or by any other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent made vncapable of beeing any longer the Sea of St. <hi>Peters</hi> successour, and therevpon the Apostolique Sea be remou'd from thence to some other citty, that therfore the succession it selfe, wherby the Gouernment of the supreme Bishop or Pastour of the Church, is perpetuated, should faile, or be broken off. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheless it cannot be deny'd but the Fathers, (who in this point looke vpon the <hi>principall</hi> and <hi>adiunct</hi> as one thing, that is, vpon the <hi>vniuersall</hi> Pastourship as connex't, and as it were, <hi>fix't</hi> to the <hi>particular</hi> Diocess of <hi>Rome</hi>) doe cleerly make the <hi>locall</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> succession of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> a signe and marke of the true Church. <note n="a" place="margin">Iren. lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> Witness St <hi>Jrenaeus,</hi> reckoning vp the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops from St. <hi>Peter</hi> to Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> who sate in his time, and testifying, that <hi>by this succession, all Heretiques are confounded.</hi> And if the same Father mentions the like succession <hi>in some other Churches of Asia</hi> (as the Relatour vrges) yet it is <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> with manifest deference to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> to which, he there professeth, <note n="*" place="margin">Iren. <hi>vbi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But our Doctour needs no such help, as the Bishop imagins; it is but fairly and rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding him, and the business is done. Doctor <hi>Stapleton,</hi> when he teaches, that sound doctrine is inseparable from true and lawfull succession, takes succession <hi>collectiuely,</hi> or for <hi>the whole</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of lawfull Pastours in any particular age of the Church: meaning therby, that it can neuer happen, that <hi>all the lawfull Pastours</hi> of the Church, in any age, should desert sound doctrine, or teach Heresie: he takes it not <hi>distributiuely</hi> for any <hi>particular</hi> Pastour, or Pastours of the Church; all which generally speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he knowes very well may erre in their own persons, and desert sound doctrine. Like as when the Bishop himselfe teaches, that the Catholique Church cannot erre in points Fundamentall, he meanes only that <hi>the whole</hi> Church cannot so erre, but any <hi>particular</hi> person, or member of the Church, may. Now what contradiction is there betwixt these two propositions, <hi>the whole succession</hi> of lawfull Pastours cannot be separated from sound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and <hi>some particular Pastours</hi> (that is, part of the whole) may, and become of <hi>Pastours wolues?</hi> truly iust as much, as there is betwixt these; <hi>the whole</hi> Church of Christ cannot fall away from the truth; but euery particular member of the Church may.</p>
               <p>This worthy Doctour therfore will neuer be forc't (as the Relatour thinks, and would faine haue it) <hi>to quit the great note of Church-succession,</hi> that he may agree with the Fathers: but he will inuincibly and vnanswerably maintaine that, which both the Fathers and himselfe meane by this great note: to witt, a <hi>legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate succession,</hi> a succession of Pastours, which hold <hi>entire,</hi> both the <hi>vnity</hi> and <hi>Fayth</hi> of the Church: this beeing the summe and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot of all his doctrine touching this point; namely, that the true Catholique Church is <hi>know'n</hi> by this, that there is in her a perpetuall succession of lawfully-sent Pastours, deliuering and receiuing the doctrine of Christ one from an other continually, or in all ages: which likewise they are always to be suppos'd to haue done, and to doe, so long as the Church, in no succeeding determinate age, notes any change of doctrine, or publique introduction of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelty, to hane been made by any of them; nor that any such change is found recorded by any of those approued Authours, who liued in the respectiue ages of the Church, and in their writings, left report to posterity, of all such publique <hi>occurences,</hi> both concerning Religion and the Church, as happened in and about their times. Wherfore to accuse the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>change in doctrine</hi> (as the Bishop here, and all Protestants doe) without alleadging such Authentique proofe, what is it, but out
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:57798:214"/>
their own arbitrary presumption and malice, to pass an vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and rash censure vpon their mother, contrary to all rules of equity, truth, iustice, and Christian pietie? Till therfore such proofe of change be alledged from sufficient and creditable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, all prudent and impartiall men will iudge the accusation signifies not much, saue only, that the Church is vnworthily and shamefully wronged by her Aduersaries; which is no new thing.</p>
               <p>This then is the <hi>haire</hi> (if wee may so speake) in which the <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> strength of that our English <hi>Sampson</hi> (Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi>) lyes: which none of the <hi>Philisthims</hi> of <hi>Gath</hi> or <hi>Ekron</hi> (eyther Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, or Presbyterian Aduersaries) whateuer they may talke, shall be able to <hi>cutt off.</hi> The promise and power of Christ so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it, that no Aduersarie powers shall euer preuaile against it.

               <p n="11">11. Those pretended <hi>Schim's,</hi> which the Bishop obiects out <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> of <hi>Onuphrius;</hi> (that is to say, the <hi>contestations,</hi> which haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been, touching elections to the Papall dignity, wherby se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall persons at the same time haue pretended to be Pope,) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinder, nor make voyde the legitimate and necessary suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi> maintaines it. For first, euen when differences did happen, there was for the most part a lawfull Pope presently chosen vpon the vacancy: so that the succession of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops was not at all broken off, or interrupted in this case. And for the guilt of Schisme (if any were) it lay only on their part, who willfully opposed the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pope after he was sufficiently declar'd. Secondly, when it so happened, that eyther a lawfull Pope was not presently chosen, or that it was not certainly know'n, which of the pretending parties was the lawfull Pope, yet neither in this case was the succession itselfe euacuated (as any man in reason may see) but only suspended for a while, or the euidence thereof, as to the person succeeding, <hi>pro tempore</hi> obstructed. For eyther by death, or by cession and resignation of the pretendants themselues, or by depriuation of those, whose elections were notoriously ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, or by some other lawfull and Canonicall meanes, first or last, the right of election to the Apostolique dignity, was always cleer'd of doubt, and legally settled vpon <hi>one person;</hi> whome therevpon the whole Church presently acknowledg'd for true Pope.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> as wee may call it, or the time, that such <hi>Contestations</hi> about the Popedome lasted, though it were an vnhappy state of the Church to be so diuided within it selfe, yet for the most part, there was noe <hi>formall Schisme</hi> on eyther part. For neither did the <hi>Anti-popes</hi> themselues, properly speaking, separate from the Catholique, or <hi>Roman</hi> Church, so as to deny its Authority, but only contested, <hi>for a time,</hi> with the person of
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:57798:214"/>
that was lawfull Pope, and vpon a presumption, at least pretended, that themselues were Pope, and not he. And though there had been <hi>formall Schisme</hi> on their part, yet seeing there was none on his part that was true Pope, what man can be soe vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to thinke that the fault of <hi>pretenders</hi> could preiudice the lawfull succession of him that was rightly chosen? Now our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries (wee hope) know, that the line of succession is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, not by the <hi>Anti-popes,</hi> but by the true Popes. To which wee may adde, that in all such cases, viz. of contestations about election to the Papacy, when the matter was <hi>really dubious,</hi> as it was not of any absolute necessity for the Church or the seuerall prouinces of Christendome, to acknowledge eyther the one, or the other <hi>pretendant</hi> for true Pope; so it was lawfull for them to acknowledge him for such, whome they did <hi>bonâ fide</hi> and prudently iudge to haue been lawfully chosen. <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>

               <p n="12">12. To A. C. friendly and serious aduice, that his Lordship <note place="margin">Ibidem. num. 9.</note> would <hi>consider carefully, whether it be not more Christian, and less brain-sicke, to thinke that St. Peters successour together with a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councill, should be an infallible iudge of controuersies in matters of Fayth, then to make euery man, that can but read Scripture, an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of it and a decider of Controuersies, or to haue noe iudge at all in such matters,</hi> the Bishop answers, that he hath <hi>consider'd all this carefully,</hi> and findes himselfe no way chargeable with the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies which A. C. specifies, of making euery priuate man iudge of Controuersies and a Controuler of Generall Councils; or else of admitting noe iudge at all to determin such Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies. His reason is, because <hi>he admitts Scripture interpreted by the Primitiue Church, and a lawfull and free Generall Councill, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining, according to them, to iudge of Controuersies; and holds, that noe priuate man whatsoeuer may be iudge of these.</hi> But here the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop himselfe is in <hi>the briers.</hi> For tell mee, I pray, how does this doctrine (<hi>noe priuate man whatsoeuer may be iudge of these</hi>) consist, with what he professedly auowes * elsewhere, as wee haue often <note place="margin">Chap. 20. 21.</note> seen, that <hi>priuate</hi> Christians may <hi>vpon iust grounds,</hi> both delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately <hi>doubt,</hi> and constantly <hi>deny</hi> the definitions euen of Generall Councils? and that if they erre <hi>grossly</hi> and <hi>dangerously</hi> (as in his opinion they may, and haue done) <hi>'tis noe pride</hi> to refuse submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to them? Is not this to make <hi>priuate</hi> men iudges of these things; that is to say, whether or noe Generall Councils doe determine according to <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>Primitiue</hi> Church? A thing, which the world sees, all Protestants doe take vpon them to iudge; and the Bishop himselfe as freely as any, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his great, but feigned profession here, to the contrary; and

vtter disclayming from that <hi>desiunctiue</hi> imputation of eyther <hi>a priuate iudge, or noe iudge.</hi> Jn the very next line he openly professes <hi>he cannot swallow this proposition, that the Pope with a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>should be iudge.</hi> Yet the <hi>Primitiue</hi> Church did, not only <hi>swallow</hi> this proposition, but also very well <hi>relish</hi> it; witness its willing and absolute submission to the sowre first Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, consirm'd by the Pope, as <hi>iudges</hi> of those grand and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Controuersies, that were then agitated; and allowing noe priuate man to <hi>examin</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> their definitions, whether they were consonant vnto Scripture or not. He should haue done well to haue told vs, what other iudge but this (the Pope with a Generall Councill) in Controuersies of Fayth the Church hath had? what other iudge but this euer was, or indeed can be acknowledg'd for such matters? And thersore, if this iudge be not admitted, and that absolutely by vs, 'tis certain, eyther no iudge at all will be found to end these Controuersies, or in the finall deuolution of the business, euery <hi>priuate</hi> man will be made iudge.</p>
               <p>The Relatour (had he pleas'd) might haue found a sufficient answer in <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> to the matter he brings out of <hi>AEneas Syluius,</hi>

Neither can the meere <hi>want of learning</hi> (which the Bishop here obiects to some Popes) be any sufficient preiudice against their authority; nor hinder the operation and assistance of the holy Ghost from concurring with them, and working by them in all cases necessary. The Apostles themselue, and many worthy Bishops in the Primitiue Church, were persons of noe great learning; and 'tis the counsell and wisedome of God, for the most part, to chuse the <hi>weake</hi> things of this world, to confound the <hi>strong,</hi> and the <hi>foolish</hi> things of this world to confound the <hi>wise.</hi> Nor doe wee make the infallibility of the Church to depend vpon the <hi>Pope alone,</hi> as the Relatour perpetually insinuates, but vpon <note place="margin">

               <p>Lett this therfore remaine as a settled conclusion, that the <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Catholique Church is infallible in all her definitions of Fayth; and that there is noe other way but this to come to that <hi>happy meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of truth and peace,</hi> which the Bishop will seeme so much to haue <hi>laboured</hi> for, in his lifetime.
