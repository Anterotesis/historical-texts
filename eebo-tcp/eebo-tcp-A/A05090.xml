         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HItherto (Right Honorable) haue our malignant aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
had their full scope against vs with the lavve in
their ovvne handes, and haue made no spare or consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to accuse, blaspheame, condempne &amp; punish vs, yea to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
&amp; publish vs as damnable heretikes, schismatikes, sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
seditious, disobedient to Princes, deniers &amp; abridgers of
their sacred povver &amp;c, to the eares &amp; eies of all men openly in
their pulpits, and in their printed bookes, published by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
&amp; approbation of their Church. No triall all this while
vpon anie sute or complaint graunted vs: Either ciuile, that we
might knovv for what cause &amp; by what lavve we thus suffer,
which yet is not denied the most horrible malefactors &amp; offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors:
Or ecclesiasticall by the word of God, where place &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
might be giuen vs to declare &amp; pleade our ovvne cause in
sobrietie &amp; order: that so the meanes appoincted of God for our
recouerie might be vsed, and we (wherein we should be found
to erre or transgresse) might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced to our faces by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and left inexcuseable. But in stead of this christian
course, they haue shut vs vp novv more then three yeares in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
&amp; close prisons from the aire, from all exercise, from all
companie or conuersation with anie person, from all meanes so
much as to write, yncke &amp; paper being taken &amp; kept from vs,
<pb facs="tcp:4716:3"/>
and a diligent watch both by our keapers held ouer vs, and also
continuall searches vpon one pretence or other made, where we
were rifled from time to time of all our papers and writinges
they could find. And being thus streightly kept &amp; watched from
speaking or writing, their conscience yet giuing them no rest in
all their prosperitie and pleasures, whilest we the Lords poore
witnesses against their sinnes breathed (Not to speake of their
secret &amp; indirect meanes wherby they sought to take avvay our
lyues) they suborned (amongest sondrie others) tvvo special in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
<hi>M. Some</hi> &amp; <hi>M. Giffard</hi> to accuse &amp; blaspheme vs pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquelie
to the viewe of the world, etch of them in tvvo bookes,
the one labouring to proue vs <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> the other <hi>Donatists</hi> in
the same. Which Bookes they haue preferred especiallie to your
Honor, as the chiefe obstacle that hindered them from their
violent and bloudie course, of the same intent (no doubt) that
their predicessors the chiefe Priestes and Pharasies accused our
Sauiour vnto <hi>Pilat,</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> vnto the Romane go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours.
Yet euen all this, we hope, the Lord hath disposed to
the furder manifestation of his truth, by directing our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
to bring our criminations before your Honor. Of whose
wisdome &amp; equitie we haue so great experience &amp; assurance,
as we can not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> henceforth doubt to be condempned vnheard,
or to find therein worse vsage, then our Sauiour &amp; the Apostles
found at those heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rulers. Wherfore we addressed our selues
(by such meanes as the Lord administred, and as the incomomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of the place, and the infirmities of our decaied bodies &amp;
memories would permit) to our defence, or rather to the defence
of that truth, wherof God hath made &amp; set vs his vnvvorthie
witnesses, though as signes to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against, and as monstrous
persons in this sinfull generation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And haue herevnto vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<hi>Mr. Giffards</hi> two reprochfull blasphemous Bookes: Shevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true causes of our seperation from the parish assemblies,
confirming &amp; approuing the same to be both true and sufficient
<pb facs="tcp:4716:3"/>
by sondrie weightie reasons &amp; expresse scriptures: Refelling by
the like all the friuolous cauills and iniurious sclanders which
M. G. hath there brought to hide their sinnes, deface the truth,
and to defame vs. As also shevving such apparant dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
betvvixt the <hi>Donatists</hi> and vs, both in the causes of our &amp;
their seperation, and in the maner of our &amp; their proceedings,
and in sondrie errors they held, as no man of anie knovvledge or
iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before attempted, or shall hereafter be able (with anie
truth or conscience) to compare vs vnto them herein, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
M. G. for this his vnchristian dealing with vs. All whose
vnsanctified reproches whervvith his bookes through euerie
sentence are seasoned in stead of better grace, herevpon fall to
the ground, and remaine vpon his ovvne, and not vpon our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.
This defence when whe had through the mercifull hand
of our God finished, though not with anie shevv of humane
wisdome or arte, so much as in simplicitie of the truth &amp; inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
of our heartes, we held it our dutie to present in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in alreuerence &amp; humilitie vnto your honorable vievv &amp;
graue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That both sides being heard according to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and our ansvveres as well as their criminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s duly expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
your sentence, or at the lest approbation, might proceede ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the truth. Crauing herein no furder fauour, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the equitie of our cause &amp; innocencie of our doings:
Nor yet shunning any furder triall of the one or the other, that
your Honor shall appoinct or thinck meet; whether with these
our aduersaries, or anie other that shall be contrarie minded,
whosoeuer. Beseaching your Honors perdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for this our bould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
the rather because such necessitie was layed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by
the hand of God, through the importunate chalenges &amp; insolent
prouocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of these our accusors: whose mouthes must either be
stopped, or else through our defalt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy truth of God, which we
beleeue &amp; professe, yea &amp; our innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie be betraied to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
infamie of these our reprochfull aduersaries, to our ovvne
<pb facs="tcp:4716:4"/>
perill and future iudgment, to the scandall of all that professe
the same truth with vs, but chiefly to the offence and torning
backe of manie, euen of the whole land, from the streight waies
of the Lord, euen the waies of life and peace. All which mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
(we trust) shalbe preuented by these our simple inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
the Lord giuing testimonie and blessing to his ovvne
word: The truth wherof shall shine forth in our simplicitie,
the povver therof be made manifest in our weakenes, to the
discouerie &amp; reformation of these publique enormities in the
false worship, open sacrilege, antichristian ministerie &amp; hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
disorder exercised and soffred in this land, and to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of all the delusions &amp; vaine promises and persvvasions
of these false Prophetts, whervvith they haue a long time (for
their ovvne fleshlie pompe and filthie lucre) seduced the whole
land, dravven them into, and held them in the wrath &amp; heauie
iudgments of God. That so the mightie hand of God working in
the heart of our Souereigne Prince &amp; Nobles, especiallie through
your Honors faithfull counsell and furtherance; and also in the
heartes of all the Commons, when the truth of these things shall
be shevved vnto them, a general and sincere conuersion to the
Lord may be made, euen from all things that novv are, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
shall be found contrarie to his holie will, whither in the
publique estate of all, or in the priuate estate of anie. For sure,
as euerie perticular person goeth forvvard from faith to faith
as knovvledge is increaced, euerie day teaching other vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life: So in the publique estate of the Church no change that is
made according vnto the truth, as the publique error is espied,
ought to be held strange or dangerous. But most heauenlie is
that harmonie, where all the members kint together in the same
faith, both in general and perticular, with one accord goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in their callings and duties, still amending what is found
amisse, and daylie indeuouring to doo better. Then should
<pb facs="tcp:4716:4"/>
there not be found anie such vnchristian contention abought
the truth, pleading and spurning against the truth, or persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the truth. Then should the Lords dreadful iudgments,
which novv hang ouer the whole land for these sinnes, be
auoided, and his blessings in stead therof be multiplied. But
sure in the meane time vntil these sinnes be remoued out of
Gods sight and redressed, there is no peace to be looked for or
asked of the Lord, there is no pleading with or against him,
hovvsoeuer the false Prophet may goe abought to heale the hurte
of this people as a light euill, saijng peace peace when there is no
peace, and to repaire the breaches that are as the sea, with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered
stuffe and vaine visions tending vnto abdication.
Wherfore, to the torning avvay of so great euills, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of so great and inestimable benefites to our Souereign
Queene and Contrie, as we haue not with-holden our vtmost
indeuours to the discouerie of the publique enormities &amp; sinnes
of these times, in all truth and freedome, being readie yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to witnesse and approue the same, if such neade be, to the
face of our greatest aduersaries and gainsayers, by the euidence
of Gods word: So novv it remaineth that we instantly beseach
your Honor, euen in the name of God, before whome we shall
all of vs shortly appeare to our accompt &amp; iudgment, by whome
this chardge is layed vpon you (the cause being novv brought,
and by both sides, asvvell our aduersaries as vs, layed open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Honor) that you would novv be a meanes to her
right excellent Maiestie that these weightie and dangerous
matters may be no longer wrapped vp or put off in securitie

In the one of these Bookes he laboureth to defend &amp; cleare the parish

said christians obiect against them, and forsake them for, witnessing &amp;
suffring in bandes &amp; persecution against the same vnder the handes
of those popish Prelats &amp; Romish Priestes. In the other Booke he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoreth
to recouer the blame he iustly suffred in the first for reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
sclandering, blaspheming, accusing these faithfull and innocent

which we forsake these parish assemblies: Namely, the prophanenes,
wickednes, confusion of the people which are here receiued, reteined
&amp; nourished as members. The vnlawfullnes of their whole ministrie
which is imposed vpon them, reteined &amp; mainteined by them. The
superstition &amp; idolatrie of their publique worship in that deuised Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourgie
which is imposed vpon them. And the forgerie of their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
ecclesiasticall gouernment, to which al their Churches stand
subiect, are such and so apparant, as not only proue these parish assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
not to be true established Churches of <hi>Christ:</hi> But if it were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
(which can neuer be proued) that they somtimes had bene true

without anie due calling to the faith by the preaching of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
going before, or orderly ioyning togither in the faith, there being
no voluntarie or perticular confession of their owne faith and duties
made or required of anie; and last of all, no holy walking in the faith
found amongst them. Who can say that these Churches, consisting of
this people, were euer rightly gathered or built according to the rules
of <hi>Christs</hi> Testament? Or who can say that this people in this estate are
<pb facs="tcp:4716:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the communion of Sainctes? Or who (without sacrilege) in this estate
can administer the holy things of God vnto, or in the same communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with this people? Likewise, where these parishes haue a false &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian

true established Churches of <hi>Christ?</hi> to the building &amp; ministerie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Christ</hi> hath ordeined, instituted, and prescribed a certaine ministrie
vnto the worldes end: Or who (without sacrilege) may ioyne vnto, or
communicate with a false &amp; antichristian ministrie? <hi>Christ</hi> also hath gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto his Church perpetuall and alsufficient rules in his holy word
for the whole administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his established churches,
to which they are bound, wherby they ought to buyld, proceede and
walke. Those Churches then that receiue an other Leitourgie, an
other foundation, other rules for their administration &amp; gouernment,
cannot be said the right and true established Churches of <hi>Christ.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may anie faithfull man ioyne vnto them in this administration &amp;
gouernment, without heynous impietie and denying the faith. The
more perticular proofe aswell of these Arguments as of these trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
insue hereafter in this treatise. These reasons all men may
see proue directly these Parish assemblies not to be the true established
Churches of <hi>Christ</hi> to which anie faithfull christian may ioyne himself
in this estate; especially, when all reformation vnto the rules of <hi>Christs</hi>
Testament is not only denied, but resisted, blasphemed, persecuted.</p>
            <p>How then are <hi>M. Giffardes</hi> eies bound and couered with the spirit of
slumber, that still dreameth of a true Church, ministrie, sacraments,
worship, gouernment in this estate; and will not be wakened by these
reasons, or anie thing that can be said or aledged against their vngodly
doings; though he can neither approue these his strong co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
by the rules of Gods word, nor disproue these euident char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the fower principall transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by vs aledged against their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
assemblies. Which yet he indeuoreth to put away &amp; shift off by
shameles sclanders &amp; ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntruthes; gyuing out: That we condempne
a Church, for that wicked men come with the godly to the publique
exercises of religion: For that there are some vngodly men of the
church: For that there are some wantes in the calling of the Ministers,
and in the outward discipline: As also, some imperfections or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the worship, which are not fundamentall. The vntruth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
our verie Propositions (though we should no furder answere) shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to his face: Where we charge, and the word of God condempneth
their assemblies, for that they consist of prophane multitudes neuer
orderly gathered vnto, or walking in the faith. There shall whilest the
Church consisteth of mortall men alwayes be wicked in the Church.
But <hi>Christ</hi> hath his fanne in his hand to make cleane his barne flore:
And hath gyuen power &amp; commandement to his Church to cast out
the wicked from amongest them. We acknowledge that the Prince
ought to compell al her subiects to the hearing Gods word in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
exercises of the Church: yet cannot the Prince compell anie to
<pb facs="tcp:4716:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be a member of the Church, or the Church to receiue anie without
assurance by the publique profession of their owne faith, or to retaine
anie longer, then they continue &amp; walke orderly in the faith. Againe,
we condempne not their assemblies for some faltes in the calling of the
ministrie; but for hauing &amp; reteining a false &amp; antichristian ministrie
imposed vpon them: Such we here proue their whole ministrie to be
in <hi>Office, Entrance, &amp; Administration.</hi> In like maner, we forsake not their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
for some faltes in their gouernment or <hi>Discipline;</hi> but for stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
subiect to a popish and antichristian gouernment. And such we
here proue theirs to be in the officers, Courtes, proceadings. Neither
refreigne we their worship for some light imperfections (as he saith)
but because their worship is superstitious, deuised by men, idolatrous,
according to that patched popish portesse their seruice booke; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

idolatrous or blasphemous: We impudently lye, &amp; vnsufferably sclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in so faijng. He therfore indeuoreth to pourge them of all popish
&amp; superstitious opinions &amp; abuses, shewing how cleare the Church of
England is of the same. Yet will not <hi>M. Giff.</hi> be thought to plead for or
iustifie anie publique abuse of the Church, but only to plead against
the <hi>Brownists</hi> that speake worse of these things then they are: For these
are no fundamental errors, such as polute the worship, but only light
imperfections &amp;c. Well, we will refer the discussing of the nature of
them how heinous they are, vnto their due place. Only here we would
know of <hi>M. Giff.</hi> what foundation these things themselues haue in the
word of God, and what warrant he can there shew for them. If he can
iustifie them by the word of God, then verely our offences are no lesse
then he hath said, that blame them to be idolatrous, popish, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.
But if these trumperies haue no foundation or commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in Gods word, but are the deuises of men; then we would know whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
God requireth or accepteth such worship at their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des? And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being made the publique worship of God and administration of
their Church, they be not idolatrie? And then how they may offer, or
<pb facs="tcp:4716:8"/>
the faithfull be constrayned to such idolatrie, to such worship, as God
neither requireth non accepteth. And with what conscience he can,
or how he dare stand a minister of that Leitourgie and worship, which
the cannot approue by the word of God, and which he would not be
thought to allowe of, the abuses therof being so manifest &amp; odious in
his owne eies. Especially now with what conscience he can thus blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
&amp; condempne vs for refreining that worship which he cannot
approue, and doth not alowe: Or how he can so earnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly inueigh
against those most forward and zealous hearers, who though they will
heare their sermons, yet withdraw from the booke seruice, for the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and euills they see therin. This <hi>M. Giff.</hi> in the Epistle to his second
booke, saith, is a more grieuous sinne then they suppose. In deed, if
the poore soules knew what they did or ought to doo in refreining the
publique false worship of the Church, they would and could haue no
spirituall communion with those ministers or people that still exercise
and will not be withdrawen from the same false worship, which they
condempne &amp; forsake; nor yet would or might they heare their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sermons that are ioyned &amp; conformed to the same idolatries and
abuses. But to the matter; vntill <hi>M. Giff.</hi> can proue by the word of God
this publique worship and administration according to their seruice
booke in those poinctes wherin we blame them, there is no cause he
should exercise it himself, allure others thervnto, or condempne vs for
refreigning the same as we are commanded of God in as manie places
as true worship is inioyned, and false worship forbidden. In all this
then he but bewraieth his owne shame &amp; hipocrisie in condempning
&amp; blaspheming vs for doing the will of God, in aluring others to false
worship &amp; idolatrie; and in doing that himself for filthie lucre &amp; feare
of the world, which he for shame of the world dare not alow, neither
can iustifie. Yea, &amp; whatsoeuer he colourably pretendeth &amp; aledgeth
in his second Booke to couer &amp; excuse the shame &amp; infamie of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
yet is he become an earnest pleader for all the corruptions and
abuses of his Church, not granting vnto vs anie one of the abuses we
reproue to be vnlawfull &amp; vngodly, lest we should thervpon vrge him
to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same left &amp; refreined (though not publiquely put downe &amp;
reformed as he accuseth) by the faithfull: and so they should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned
for the practise, and we iustified for the refreining these
things. Therfore he is driuen to plead for, mitigat, excuse, to tollerate
with his vttermost shiftes &amp; cauills all these abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s whatsoeuer.
Which yet are so heinous and of so high a nature, as no pretexts of the
Princes or churches power, of ceremonies of things indifferent, no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions
of substance &amp; forme, of fundamental and not fundamental
errors &amp; corruptions &amp;c: can hide, but the are found heinous trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
of the law of God, detestable abuses of the worship of God.
And he in practising and pleading for them is found but as the Dogge

He proueth them within the Couenant by the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,

where the promise is made to the thousand generation.
As also by the greatest corruptions and faltes that he can anie where

are the maine pillers &amp; ground-worckes of al their buildings, and
his writings; which being pulled downe, their whole frame falleth to

            <p>An other pitifull reason he bringe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an humane bodie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting of maimed or deformed members: Which
yet so long as life remaineth in it, is said an humane bodie. So the
Church, though it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist of mained &amp; deformed members, yet whilest
it hath the life, viz. true faith in CHRIST in it, yt is to be held a true

this comparison beyond the Apostles scope &amp; proportion <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. Nor
yet how manie errors &amp; inconveniences would insue of such racking

ioyned, but only such members vnto the publique ministrie as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed

yt: And they that destroy the Temple of God, them shall God destroy.
Now then to his inference of instance. We denie this body of their
Church to consist of these true members spoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. Neither of
those liuing precious stones 1 <hi>Peter.</hi> 2. Neither to be built according to

to construe &amp; correct. And if ther be found or rather abound anie
imperfect or redundant sentences, let those be imputed chiefly to the
want of better skill in the writers, and partly to their decayed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to the inconveniencie of the place, the continual tossings &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiles,
searches &amp; riflings, and no peace or meanes giuen vs either to

the Reader, not to be withdrawen from the truth by anie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived
opinion either of our tenuitie of giftes and base estate, or of
the excellencie and multitude of our aduersaries, for that were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to themselues: But rather diligently to ponder their owne wayes
&amp; the issues therof, and where they finde themselues to erre, speedely
to retorne to the truth without cunctation or excuse; that so they may
finde peace and assurance to their owne soules. Which grace we
euen wish to our greatest enimies, and shall not cease

our indeuoures.</p>

the causes of our seperation, and of our
purposes in practise, withstood by G. G. defended by
H. B. as followeth.</head>
            <p>WE seeke aboue all thinges the peace and protection of the
most high, and the kingdome of CHRIST IESVS our Lord.
2 WE seeke and fully purpose to worship God aright,
according as he hath commaded in his most holy word.
3 WE seeke the fellowship of his faithfull &amp; obedient seruants, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with them to enter Couenant with the Lord, and by the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his holy Spirit, to proceed to a godly, free, and right choise of
Ministers and other Officers by him ordeyned to the seruice of his
Church. 4 WE seeke to establish and obey the ordinances &amp; lawes of
our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> left by his last will &amp; Testament to the gouerning &amp;
guyding of his Church, without altering, changing, innouating, wres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or leauing out anie of them that the Lord shall gyue vs sight of.
5 WE purpose (by the assistance of the holy Ghost) in this faith &amp; order
to leade our lyues, and for this faith &amp; order to leaue our lyues, if such
be the good will of our heauenly Father, to whom be honor &amp; glorye
Amen.</p>
            <p>6 AND now that our forsaking &amp; vtter abandoning of these
disordered assemblies as they generally stand in England,
may not seeme strange nor offensiue to anie man that will

wilfull transgression. But al this is couered and cured at once [if so be
you couet &amp; labour in your calling to haue CHRISTS outward gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp;c.] To discusse here how far euerie Christians dutie &amp; calling
extendeth herein, vvere to dismisse all your answers at once, and to
pluck away the mantle of shame wherwith you couer your nakednes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4716:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your negligence, and all your abhominations. In this place therfore
we will only ask you these 2 questions. First; whither anie which haue
their calling of Antichrist, or be his marked Ministers, or waged ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
can truly and vprightly couet &amp; labour for the sincere gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of CHRIST, which is his whipp wherwith he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kourgeth out all
thieues, intruders and idle-bellies out of his house. The next questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is: Whither to remaine wittingly and seruilely in the bondage and
yoake of Antichrist 29 yeares, be to seek &amp; labour for the gouernment
of <hi>Christ</hi> faithfully in your callings, or to vphold and vndershore the
kingdome of Antichrist rather?</p>
            <p>But to transport the name of <hi>Christs</hi> kingdome which is chiefly spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and in the heart, vnto that which is but a part &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How diuerslie the kingdome of God is read in the Scriptures, we
will not contend with you (although it were not hard to shew either
your ignorance or forgetfulnes herein) Only this we say; our words
can carie no such construction, muchlesse such an erronious opinion,
as you (abounding in your owne sense) haue not only collect, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.
In the first our words being, That we seeke the kingdome of
<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> our Lord, cannot be thus restreined to <hi>Christs</hi> outward orders
and gouernment in his Church; especially, if you had pondered that
which followed, where in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Article (after your diuision) we haue
expressed this point in perticular. Neither (if we should admit you y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
interpretation) could you collect from thence [that the kingdome of
God could not be in anie, vnlesse they haue this] But as we vsually
reade in the olde and new Testament <hi>Christs</hi> kingdome to be taken for
his true visible Church here in earth; so we acknowledg his vniuersall
Church &amp; kingdome to extend to all such as by a true faith apprehend
&amp; confesse <hi>Christ,</hi> howsoeuer they be scattered, or whersoeuer dispersed
vpon the face of the earth: Yet both with this <hi>interim,</hi> without true faith
&amp; obedience can be no true Church, no true Christian.</p>

seek to resist and suppresse yt. But we must shew [that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
priuat men to set yt vp]. First God commandeth in his law
euerie one to seek the place where he putteth his name: CHRIST in
the Gospel, to seek the kingdome of God, to take his yoake vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them,
&amp;c. Againe, CHRIST hath left but one forme of gouernment in his
last Will and Testament vnto his Church, which he hath fealed with
his blood; and therfore not left yt arbitrable at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleasures of Princes,
or pollicies of tymes to be done or vndon, but made yt by a double
right inuiolable,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> both by his word and his Testament; so that the
Church of God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither be gouerned by anie other lawes or gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
neither ought yt to be without this; for God holdeth them all in
the estate of enimies, which haue not his Sonne to reigne ouer them.
Now then the faithfull are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to gather togither in CHRIST
his name, with promise of direction &amp; protection, and with authoritie
not only to establish his lawes &amp; ordinances emongst them, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to gouerne his Church therby. For the kingdome of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
not in word but in power. Now this assemblie of the faithfull
before they be planted &amp; established in this order, consisteth hitherto
but of perticular priuat persons, none as yet being called to office or
function. Therfore we may well conclude, that God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth his
faithfull seruants, being as yet priuat me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, togither to build his church,
according to the true patterne of <hi>Christs</hi> Testament (without altering,
changing, innouating &amp;c.) And for this we haue the example of the
primatiue Churches for our patterns and warrant, which sued not to
Courtes &amp; Parliaments, nor wayted vpon Princes pleasures, when the
stones were in a redines, but presently hauing receiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of <hi>Christ,</hi>
receiued likewise the ordinances of <hi>Christ,</hi> and continued in the same.
Againe, if they should tarie Princes leisuers, where were the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you speake of? Princes neuer punish them that obey their hestes.
And thus because you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not endure the fierie triall of persecution, you
vtterly (by your perfidous tolleration) abrogate at once the crosse of
<hi>Christ.</hi> And (that you might enioy this worldly peace &amp; fleshly pleasure
for a season) you care not to make <hi>Christ</hi> attend vpon Princes, and to be
subiect to their lawes and gouernment. But (alas) it were fitter with a

So then, if it fall out that the lawe and word of God condempne

            <p>To blazon your transgressions as they deserue, requireth rather a

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now we were perswaded by the word of God that the true Minister
of <hi>Christ</hi> could not be a Minister of idolatrous &amp; false worship. Such in
our first cause of our comming out from emong you, we proued the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> worship in your assemblies to be. Then we were perswaded by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word
of God, that a true Pastor could not stand a heard to the Lords goates,
and swyne, blessing them with the blessing of the faithfull, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them the holy things of God, as the Sacraments &amp;c. Such in our
second cause we proued both you and your people, as they generally
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4716:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
stand in your Parishes, to be. And now in this third cause your self, by
but repeating part of our words, doo giue a strong &amp; sufficient reason.
Namely; that your Ministrie is thrust &amp; imposed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your Churches,
&amp; not freely chosen by the Lords faithful people according to <hi>Christ</hi> his

for Prophetts: But if this wee speake be that vvhich God by them hath
vttered, then you deride not vs so much as them, nor them so much
as the Spirit of God that spake in them. [But the Prophetts of God
lied not in anie thing; but euerie man may see that wee haue in the
former Article lied.] The Deuill is the author of lies, sclaunders, false
accusations against the Saincts &amp;c, and therof hath his name: All that
make or loue lies are his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and shalbe shut off the Citie of God.
This chardge wee haue repelled in the 2. Transgression; where wee
proued all receiued into your Church by Baptisme, and are reteined in
your Churches, because you haue not the powre of <hi>Christ</hi> to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat
anie. Thus still you fall into the pitte you make for vs, by Gods

1. <hi>That where the true faith is, ther can breake forth no great faultes, errors, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses.</hi>
Or this absurde maner of speache. 2. <hi>That all errors &amp; deformities in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

of CHRIST rightlie planted and established, where the people were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
into the bodie of the Church before they were dulie caled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the faith, or had made profession therof: where they haue not the
true ministrie of CHRIST, but a strange antichristian ministrie imposed
vpon them: vvhere they haue not the gouernement of CHRIST, but of

            <p>AS to the heresie he speaketh of, we doubt not, nether euer thought,
but the best Church that consisteth of mortall men, may fall ether
of negligence or of ignorance, into greiuous offences, and dangerous
errors: Yea we doubt not but that some famous Churches &amp; Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

to proue your worship false and idolatrous, your peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
answere is; That they but make appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our vanitie and <hi>Anabaptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
error. Our vanitie, in that the 3. first 1. <hi>of the invention of man, 2. of that

these wordes <hi>imposed;</hi> wherin we chalendge such a freedome to the
Church, as that nothing may be imposed vpon the flockes, that the
Church-gouernours shal decree by the worde. The 3. first of these
reasons whereby his worship was proued to be idolatrous, he quietlie
suffring to passe and carry their conclusion, laboureth to proue al but
one. Because saith he, <hi>whatsoeuer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inventeth in the worship of GOD is erroneous;
And whatsoeuer is erroneous therin was invented by man; For al false worship is mans inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether it be the invention of the man of sinne or anie other, it is al one before God, vvho
respecteth not persons, but the vvickednes of the sinne.</hi> Wel, howsoeuer we might
insist and shew difference betweene that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinne that <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and
others that haue not such cursed marckes vpon them; howsoeuer also
we might shew differences betwixt the deuises of other more godlie
men (which deuises peraduenture in themselues conteine no errors,
vntil they be abused, set vp, enioyned and read in the church &amp;c) and
the <hi>Popes</hi> Portesse, from which execrable pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t al these idolatrous graftes
are fetched: Yet wil we not stand vpon lighter matters with you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
whether the reasons may be said three or one. It sufficeth vs,
and we content our selues to haue proued &amp; obteined, That the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of your Church is erroneous, yt being made of the invention of
man: And your self hath confessed, <hi>That vvhatsoeuer man inventeth in the vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

Commandment, That whatsoeuer worship is deuised by man, and
whatsoeuer deuise of man is put into the worship of God, is idolatrie.

we should chalendg such a freedome, as nothing might be imposed
vpon the Church which the Church gouernours should decree by the

meaneth: Or ells are so possessed with malice, as you make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce what truth you cal heresie, or heresie you cal truth, as appeareth
by your vniust chardging of vs, and your vngodlie defending al the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations
of the tymes. Who but you could drawe this hereticall
collection from our wordes? we in the same sentence, and in the verie
next worde immediatlie going before, hauing protested your worship
to be erroneous? How maie it followe, that because we denie errors to
be imposed vpon the Church, Therfore we denie that such thinges as
the Elders shal determine of by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God, may be imposed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Church? Whie what the Elders decree by the worde of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said to be the invention or the commandement of man, but of
God, by whose direction they but pronounce and performe the will of
God. But no error can be said to be of the worde of God, and euerie
invention of man (by your owne confession) is erroneous; Therfore we
may stil &amp; againe here conclude, that seing the worship of your church
of <hi>England</hi> is made of the invention of man, euen of the man of sinne,
erroneous, and imposed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, yt is false &amp; idolatrous, and such as
no true Elders may impose, or the true Church of <hi>Christ</hi> receaue. Furder
we say, that no true Elders of the Church, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Church yt self
may decree or impose anie thing by way of lawe, which <hi>Christ</hi> hath not
decreed &amp; imposed in his worde. And if you hold otherwise (as your
popish phrases <hi>Decree, impose vpon the flockes</hi> seeme to import) then we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that you both hold a <hi>Papistical</hi> &amp; <hi>Anabaptistical</hi> error, and vtterlie not
onlie corrupt the worship &amp; gouernment of <hi>Christ,</hi> but bring in a new
worship &amp; gouernment by bringing in &amp; setting vp your owne decrees
&amp; deuises as the <hi>Papistes</hi> &amp; <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> doe.</p>
               <p>NOw co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth their <hi>Leitourgie</hi> or <hi>Seruice-Booke</hi> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

by the word of God. The defence wherof Mr. GIFFARD though he be
a sworne Priest after &amp; vnto the orders therof, yet he verie loathlie and
doubtfullie vndertaketh at the first entrance, as one that carieth a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and a iudge, that could tell an other tale in his owne conscience.
He confesseth that as no mans workes are per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and great faultes in this Booke, though (as yt should seeme) none of
those perticulars which we recited vnto him (onlie the <hi>baptisme by weomen</hi>
excepted) seing the laboureth to defend all the rest. But we which for
some errors and spots hould it to be an idolatrous booke, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

And in that we affirme yt to be <hi>a pregnant Idoll, ful of errours, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

These great wordes nether convince vs, nor cleare you; let them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remaine vpon your accompt. The truth of our chardges, and the
qualitie of your transgressions, shall by and by appeare by the discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the perticulars. And for all your greate threates of heresie, we
still for the faultes we haue alleadged (though there were no more,
(as by your owne confession ther are both manie more and greater)
dare affirme your worship to be false, idolatrous, and abhominable.
The vvorde of God caleth him an heretick that obstinatelie holdeth

Whersoeuer and whensoeuer they were invented, yt is certaine they
were brought into and left in the Church by the POPE, and are stil vsed

which he can no way colour or excuse by anie politicke lawes, or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

make that lawfull, which the word of God condemneth. No politick
lawes can excuse the Church from breaking the Commandements
of God. Nether may these fastes be esteemed ciuill actions, because
the Princes lawe commandeth them: For so might all their vvorship
of God be held ciuill actions, because the Princes lawes in like maner
commandeth them. But these fastes are commanded and solemnly
proclaimed in their Church and that by the Priest, as he is directed by
his <hi>Rubrick,</hi> orderly as they arise in their Calendare. The people are

al other strange actes, wonderful and extraordinarie deliuerances both

And what warrant they haue in <hi>Christes</hi> Testament for this. But if they

aswel be brought into the Church also, and be enioyned by lawe, as
this; and then what end would there be of these deuises, and what

not requite you with euil wordes, but let the proofe of these matters
declare who is a lyer and impudent. We would therfore first knowe of
you where you haue learned to make the burial of your deade an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
action, part of the Pastors office, and to make it an especial
part of your worship, if not of the POPE? Then where you learned to
burie in your Hallowed Churches and Church-yardes (as though

therbie. It were needles also to shewe, howe this your <hi>Leitourgie,</hi> Dirige

curious to relate the watching, preparing, arraying, crossing, dressing
the corps to the graue, also the array of the Mourners with all the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
of the <hi>Heraldes,</hi> the attyre of the Priestes aud Clarckes, with

they can saye in the vulgare tongue, the articles of their faith &amp;c. Also
in an other place of their said seruice-booke there is an expresse lawe.
<hi>That none shalbe admitted to the holye Communion, vntil such time as he can say the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme,

that yt is litle vsed? But what a monstrous matter is this confirmation
of their Church, where the Baptisme of CHRIST is to be confirmed of a
wretched man, if he were (as he is nothing lesse) a seruant of CHRISTE?
Yea that <hi>Christes</hi> faithful serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (whom CHRIST hath alredie publiquely

the comfortable table of the Lorde, vntil they haue a popish Bisshop
his confirmation? Not here to mention the binding of the faith of
the whole Church to an <hi>Apocrypha Catechisme.</hi> Yet to make this their

that by their <hi>imposition of handes and praier, such as are so confirmed by them,

Can this prayer be of faith to praye against lightning in the middest of

to punish his enemies by dearth, plague, warre? Finally where learned

them to the miserale people, being with none more or so much

vvhom how he rewardeth or refuteth, let this his blasphemous popish

Let the readers by this time iudge, and howe smoothly
he hath passed by and coulored, yea swallowed vp all these abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
transferring all the blame and reproach vpon the poore seruants
of CHRIST, that condemne this trash, and admonish him. Euill signes
ether of a true Minister, or true christian. None speaking by the spirit
of God iustifieth error or blasphemeth the truth at any time. How far
he hath sought to iustifie these antichristian deuises &amp; popish enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and blasphemed vs for speaking the truth, Let his booke shewe.
Yet bringeth he against vs a certaine Secte in their Church which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
certayne thinges as corruptions &amp; such as neede reformation,
and therfore would know how we could abandon al th'assemblies for

TO this he saith we make a double answeare: First that vsing a part,
they doe homage to the whole. Then, that the best part of this
Booke is an abhomination to the Lorde &amp;c. This dubblenes is of your
owne heart, who dissembling with God and your owne conscience to
auoyde ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shame, care not what wrong you doe others, or what iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
you heape vpon your self against the daye of wrath. Our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
was but one, and this. That you knewe neuer a Minister that
vseth not the Booke, that standeth not vnder this Idoll. Or that had
throwne it out by the power of Gods worde, or with-drawen the people
from yt with al their preaching these 29. yeares: But that they all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
by yt, ioyne their gospell to yt, minister to that people that vse
yt &amp;c. That the conningest of you that vse the best and leaue the rest,
connot make that best part you vse other then a piece of swynes-flesh,
an abhomination to the Lorde. And that the perswation of your
consciences could neither iustifie your worship, cleare your selues, or
satisfie others: Especially when we see your consciences to tollerate &amp;
to submit vnto the whole, to vse part in respect of your homage, and to
refuse part for shame of the worlde. This you were ashamed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serte,
because you were not able to answeare. Therfore in all this they
but counterfeite, and you cauil. What folly can you finde in this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That in vsing part they doe homage for the whole? Stand not all
your Ministers bownd to this Booke, sworne in their canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to administer according to the order prescribed therin, and not

And the Arch-Deacon and Commissarie, to censure the same? How
then (seing all your Ministers stand in this subiection vnto yt) would
you haue vs thincke that the part they vse is not in respect of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to the whole? Or howe woulde you haue vs thincke that they
condemne anie part therof, when they speake not against yt and cast yt
not out by the power of the worde, nether with-drawe themselues, nor
the people from yt, but ioyne in prayers &amp; sacramentes with them that
vse yt? Is this to condemne yt, or to condemne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues rather in the
things they do? Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you with your fleshly reason put this away? Might
they not by your reason stand sworne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Masse-Booke, ioyne to such
idolatrous priestes &amp; people as vse yt, yet if in their owne conscience
or secretly they dislike some faultes therof, be as cleare as these Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
you speake of are of the corruptions they condemne? There are
some truthes &amp; some good things in the Masse-Booke also. You vse
no good reason to persuade vs by your Schismes and diuisions in your

Scriptures then we see may be abused, yet no way iustifie anie part of
the wicked action or naughty thing to which they are applyed. The
Scriptures are holy &amp; good of themselues, yet when they are thus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
rent, dismembred, constrayned, peruerted, abused, ioyned to
these idolatries, they no way iustifie any part of the vvorship, but make
the whole more execrable. We can saye then that those Scriptures
vvhich you thus prophane and abuse to your idolatries aboue-said (as
your idoll feastes and all your idol vvorship and ministration) are in
their due place &amp; true vse, holie, reuerend, gratious; But vvhen they
are abused, peruerted, and ioyned to patch vp this idolatrie, they make
the whole the more execrable. All the Scriptures then of God are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and euerie part therof are detestable Idolls. All which Idoll and euery
part therof vve can condemne, and yet preserue the sacred maiestie

               <p>1. IN that they presume to giue and enioyne their prescript
wordes in praier, they take the office of the Holie Ghost
awaie, quench the spirit of the ministrie, and of the whole
Church, stop and keepe out the graces of God, thrust their owne
idle deuises vpon the whole Church, yea vpon GOD himselfe
whether he wil or no:</p>
               <p>2. IN that bie their Leitourgie they prescribe what and how
much to reade, at Morne to their Mattens, at Eauen &amp;c,
teachinge the Church and ministrie to pray by nomber, stint, and
proportion, it is not onely popish, but most friuolous and vayne,
disgracing and not instructing the Church and ministerie:</p>
               <p>3. IN that by this their Leitourgie they prescribe vnto the
Church what Scriptures publiquelie to reade and when to
reade them, as these Chapters and Psalmes at their mattens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
noone, those at after noone &amp;c, On all the dayes that they
haue publique meetings and seruice through the yeere, and soe
from yeere to yeere. They therebie take from the Church the
holie and free vse both of the Scriptures and spirit of GOD.
They therbie conceale and shut out of the Church a great part of
GODS holie worde which they reade not. As also abuse without
order those scriptures they enioyne to be read:</p>
               <p>4. IN that they shread, rend, and dismember the Scriptures
from the holie Order and natural sense of their context,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4716:36"/>
to make them Epistles, Gospels, Lessons, select Psalmes, to their
festivals and Idol worship aboue-said, They most heinouslie
pervert and abuse the Scriptures to the high dishonor of GOD &amp;
their owne feareful iudgment.</p>
               <p>5. IN that they bring in and commaunde the Apochrypha
writings to be publiquelie read in the Church: They both
mainetaine and publiquelie teach the dangerous errors therin
contayned, to the poysoning and subverting of the faith of the
Church. They thrust these deuises of men into the place of GODS
worde, causing the people therebie to reuerence and esteeme
them as the holie Oracles of GOD, of like aucthoritie, dignitie,
and truth, and to resorte vnto them to builde their faith ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
and therbie they bring in an other foundation into the
Church: besides the high iniurie donne vnto GOD therbie:</p>

               <p>IN Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> his former answere vnto this <hi>Transgression</hi> he then not

These assemblies as openlie guiltie of this confusion, sacriledge, &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

But now vpon better aduise (the world being greatly changed with the
reforming Priests since that tyme, and no hope left for that sect to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
aganst the Bisshops) he hath changed his copie quite, building
againe those Romish abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he had before destroyed, as in the
<hi>Transgression</hi> aboue handled appeareth. And nowe in this <hi>Transgression,</hi> as
one greatly greiued that such large wordes had escaped him, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to retract them in the best maner he may, and to salue al againe
by saying, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth neither approue such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of prophane men to the Sacrament, nor yet suffer it in practize
wholie, howsoeuer they are admitted through the negligence of the

Church of <hi>England</hi> may not iustly be reproued for suffring &amp; approuing
this sinne.<note place="margin">1 Corinth. 5</note> Ells th'Apostle faulted for reprouing the whole Church of

approue &amp; mainetaine these wicked Ministers who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue made,
is manifest, in that they doe not censure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their heinous offences.
That these Ministers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit this sacriledge, your self hath in your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

thus to publish and condemne them (and that to such as you hold he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks

censured them, or you for the Churches wilful default had forsaken
either the Church or the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If they be to be esteamed the true Ministers
of CHRIST (which office they professe to beare in your Church) then
great is your sinne thus disorderlie to blaspheme, iudge, and publish
them. If they be not to be esteamed the true Ministers of CHRIST, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as great is your sinne in ioyning vnto them in communion of prayers
and Sacraments &amp;c, and in not separating from them and from that
Church which thus presumptuouslie doth make, impose, and maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
such an antichristian vngodly Ministerie. Thus your disorderlie
and vnchristian behauiour towardes your bretheren, yea the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of your Church, (wherof your self by profession standeth as yet a

whole assemblies of <hi>Christ,</hi> of rending and tearing vp the tender plants

of <hi>England</hi> hath censured these Ministers and assemblies. If we would

But we remitt you to the iudgment and vengeance of the Lord
for all your blasphemie and cursed speaking: stil witnessing against
the sinnes of your Church, prouing if God at anie tyme wil giue you
repentance.</p>
               <p>FVrder in your former answeare you affirmed, that you knewe manie
Congregations in <hi>England</hi> where the Pastor repelled th'vnworthie
from the Sacraments &amp;c. We replyed, That euen in those special
Congregations all the prophane and their seede were at the first recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
as in all your other Congregations. And that this <hi>Suspention</hi> of the
Pastor wherbie he repelled, was popish and Antichristian, euen the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of that idol shephearde, rebated, without edge or poynte, of
no value, or power &amp;c, and therfore this could be no separation, seing
the suspended stil remayned of and in your Church. That al without
exception were receiued in these Congregations we proued, because
all without exception of anie were baptized. That none were or could
be there put out we proued, because the Parson and his whole flocke,
or al these special Pastors or flockes together, haue not that power
which our Lorde IESVS CHRIST hath giuen vnto his Church vnto the

               <p>THus after he hath manifestly falsified our wordes and changed our

and to convince vs. Which being donne, he followeth the
chace so whotely, spending &amp; opening his mouth freely into all maner
blasphemie, as he driueth vs into sondrie heresies &amp;c. But now if we
might be so bolde to awaken the man out of his cholerick dreame,
and to call him backe againe to our former reason after all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicte,
pursute, and triumph, he shalbe founde to haue skirmished all
this while but with his owne shadowe, and neuer to haue comen neare
our Argument, and so all his reproches and heresies must be fayne to
returne back againe into his owne heart, where they were forged and
whence they proceded. Our former Argument being reduced into
forme, was to this effect. Into what Congregations all are receiued as
members, and the said Congregations haue not the power of our Lord
IESVS CHRIST to caste out anie by excommunication, there al the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
multitudes without th'exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any one person, are receiued
into &amp; retayned in the bozome and bodie of that Church, or of those
Churches. But in those special Congregations he spake of, where the
Pastor doth repell from the Sacrament, al are receiued as members, and
the Parson &amp; whole parish, Or all those Pastors and their flock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4716:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Therfore euen in those speciall parishes where the Priest
by their seruice-booke repelleth from their Sacrament, are all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
multitudes without th'exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any one person receiued into
&amp; reteined in the bozome &amp; bodie &amp;c. Here Mr. GIFFARD finding the
<hi>Maior</hi> or first Proposition irrefragable, The <hi>Minor</hi> thus proued vnto him,
because al in these parishes are baptized, and the Parsons <hi>suspention</hi> is not
CHRISTS <hi>excommunication,</hi> hath sought to escape by changing &amp; falsifijng
our reason, which otherwise he was neuer able to answeare, He hath
quite chaunged yt by putting in a newe <hi>Minor Proposition.</hi> Namely, for
these peculiar Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wherof he made instance, he hath put the
whole Church of <hi>England</hi> as they sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d one bodie altogether. And is now
driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to mingle these his select Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations with the other <hi>Most parte
of Churches &amp; Ministers</hi> whom erewhile he condemned &amp; graunted guiltie
of this transgression, and also to praye in ayde &amp; appeale vnto the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
excommunication of that antichristian <hi>Hierarchie</hi> of their Church
Gouernours. And this by furder falsifijng our wordes in both his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
vizt.</hi> Where we said <hi>haue not CHRISTES power to cast forth anie by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi>
he saith <hi>haue no power to cast forth anie by excommunication.</hi> We neuer
doubted but the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as also her mother of ROME hath a
false kinde of excommunication exercised in the power of the <hi>Dragon</hi> &amp;
of the Beaste; but we stil denie that they haue that true <hi>Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication</hi>
which is exercised in the name &amp; power of CHRIST, which only belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to the Church of CHRIST. Thus if the man had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his worcke
before him, and proued as he had gonne, happely his triumphant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
would not so sast haue followed; Then should he haue had
lesse to feare, and more to reioyce of his doings, wheras now his recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
&amp; iudgment are yet behinde. But if Mr. GIFFARD would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salf
to take his aduersaries into the field with him before the fight, and
giue them leaue to bring and vse their owne vveapons, then (seing he
vvill needes haue the question now generall of the whole Church of

this <hi>Second Transgression:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where all the prophane and vngodly are receiued into and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
in the Church as members therof, there cannot be

               <p>But in the Church of ENGLAND all the prophane multitudes

               <p>Therfore the Church of ENGLAND in this estate cannot be

               <p>THe first Proposition is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed through the whole Bible from the

therof, and they haue not the power of CHRIST to caste forth any by
orderly exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, there all the prophane multitudes may iustly
be said to be receiued into and reteined in the bozome and bodie of
the Church. But in the Church of <hi>England</hi> al the prophane mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of the land were together without difference or separation receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, neither haue they the power of CHRIST orderly to cast
forth any by true excommunication. Therfore al the prophane mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
are truly said to be receiued into, and to be reteined in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zome
and bodie of their Church. This aucthor his two exceptions
to the first Proposition of the <hi>repelled</hi> from the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and such is
depart of them-selues, no waye diminish the truth, or hynder the
course therof. For the <hi>suspended,</hi> they still remaine members of their
Church. For such <hi>Papists, Hereticks, &amp; Schismaticks</hi> as depart of themselues,
though they ought also to be cast out by orderly <hi>Excommunication,</hi> yet are
they not nor can be in this their Church so cast out, howe infectious
and wicked soeuer they be, because they haue not the power and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
of CHRIST amongst them. So that nowe all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
wil be about the second Proposition, whether the Church of
<hi>England</hi> haue receaued in al the prophane, &amp; whether yt haue the power
of our Lord IESVS CHRIST to cast forth any by true excommunication.
Thus far forth it is manifest &amp; cannot be denyed, That the whole land,

prophane of the lande are receyued into the bodie of bozome of this
Church, if so be that there then were at the beginning of her Maiesties

the contrarie, lest we plucke vp the wheate <hi>Math.</hi> 13. What
spirit leadeth vs, and possesseth him and his Church, as also how they
sorrowe and mourne for their sinnes, Let th'ocasions of these contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies
betwixt vs, their tyrannie, our sufferings, and this his present
writing declare. Wee blame, and witnesse against manie most heynous
&amp; horrible sinnes. So far are they from acknowledging the same, that
they wil not be confessed amongst the bleamishes of his Church. Yea
insteade of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance they persecute, he blasphemeth, and in euerie sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of his booke casteth at vs in his furie these his fire-brandes, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
arrowes, and deadly dartes, wherwith his whole Booke is seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
insteade of better grace, and al for shewing &amp; admonishing them
of their sinnes. Vnto this place. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. which he bringeth against vs
for plucking vp the tares, he must acknowledge these his weake pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
euen al the prophane multitudes &amp; deluge of people, to be those tares,
or ells he cannot vse yt against vs, or blame vs for plucking them vp.
This if he confesse, then can they not be held in this estate the children
of the kingdome, that tender wheate, that blossomed and made fruite.
Then hath he granted vs as much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this poynte as we require,
yea and iudged them as far as we iudge; which is not concerning their
future, but their present estate. Their election or reprobation we leaue
to that great hous-holder the maker and iudge of all, conteyning our
selues within the rules of his reuealed worde, whose iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lighten, or pronownce the wicked innocent; against whose iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts who so spurne or resist, but stomble at that rocke which wil grind
them to powder. If Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> vnderstand the field in this place to be
the Church, he choseth rather to insist in the errour of others, then in
th'exposition of our Sauiour himself; who saith, <hi>verse. 38. That the field is
the worlde, the good seede are those Children of the kingdome, but the tares are the Children of
the wicked one</hi> If yt should be vnderstoode of the planted Church, then
were al the rules, ordinances, censures, and gouernment of the Church
vtterly abolished. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might al be receiued in, and none at anie tyme
for anie offence cast out of the Church &amp;c. Then also could not the
ciuile Maiestrate put anie offendor to death, for that were to roote out
the <hi>Tares.</hi> Neither can these <hi>Tares</hi> be vnderstoode of those hypocrites
whose sinnes appeare not; for then could not the Disciples discerne,
iudge, and seeke to roote them vp. Or being so vnderstoode, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to those multitudes of prophane, whose heynous sinnes are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.
Let the <hi>Tares</hi> then be the children of the wicked one, and not the
Sainctes of CHRIST: Let the tares be in the worlde, and not in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4716:40"/>
Church, seing our Sauiour himself so pronounceth them, and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his disciples so to thinck of them. Yet let not his disciples in anie
inordinate zeale seeke to roote them vp, seing they haue nothing to
doe to iudge them that are without.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 12. 13.</note> But let them rather by al meanes
seeke their ingrafting, in instructing them inal gentlenes, if so be that
God at anie tyme wil giue them repentance to the acknowledging of<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25</note>
the truth, that they also may be partakers of the like mercie and grace

               <p>WHat then hath Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> gayned by this place? That the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
&amp; such as neuer made true voluntarie profession of their
owne faith (other then that prescript verbal confession which is enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to them al in their <hi>Seruice-booke,</hi> which a childe of 4. yeeres olde may
say after the Priest as wel as they) may be receaued into the Church.
Or that al sortes of open wicked grosse impenitent offendors may be
reteyned in the Church as members. This he must proue, or ells all
that he saith is nothing to the purpose, seing we chardge their Church
as heynously guilty of, and wilfully obstinate in these transgressions.
But insteade of prouing, he slilie seeketh to cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the question, by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Churches of CHRIST, and these vngodly multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

these two starting holes, <hi>the hypocrites, and the prophane,</hi> as one cannot
knowe whereto find him, or wherof he affirmeth. It being graunted
that the children of hypocrites ought to be baptized, he wil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hervpon
conclude, that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the prophane also. Which if yt be denied,
then he wil make no conscience to giue out, that we denie baptisme to
the seede of Hypocrites in the Church. Thus standing vpon no
grownde, he flitcheth &amp; fleeteth vp and downe, seeking in an euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to shifte off the truth wherwith he is pressed. First presupposing
that al these multitudes of prophane &amp; wicked are within the Church:
Then endevouring to proue that al the children of such prophane and
wicked as he termeth within the Church and to professe <hi>Christ,</hi> ought
to be baptized. Wherin, before we come to the consideration of his
reasons, we must note vnto the reader in his Proposition expresse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie,
error, and sacriledge: Contrariety, in that he with the same
mouth in the same sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce pronounceth them as prophane &amp; wicked,
and also as faithful and members of the Churh, such to whom the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venante
and the seales therof belonge. Error, in that he thus iudgeth
and blasphemeth them, if they be faithful &amp; members of the Church:
As on the contrarie if they be prophane &amp; wicked, to iustifie their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
whilest they are obstinate in such sinnes; Yea furder to harden
them therin, to giue the seale of the Couenante vnto their children in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4716:40"/>
respect of their profession, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be donne without open &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sacriledge; for if they be to be iudged prophane &amp; wicked, then are
their children also (vntil they make profession of their owne faith) to
be held of vs as prophane; the deuised writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their Church
cannot sanctifie or iustifie either the one or the other vnto vs. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
the Church cannot denie to receaue those Parents or that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
vnto the communion of the Supper, whose infantes they baptize
in that estate. And thus by Mr. <hi>Giffards</hi> diuinitie may the bodie and
bloude of <hi>Christ</hi> be prostitute to the open prophane and wicked, whom
he thus proueth within the Couenant.</p>
               <p>THe interest of Gods Couenant (saith he) doth not depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their

time of their <hi>Apostasy</hi> (wherof he speaketh) because the Lorde nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

was not then vtterly take from the Iewes, as it is now. For though the
Lordes time to abolish that material Ierusalem that he might bring in

                  </gap>, to be esteemed the true
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4716:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church of CHRIST. His 3 stowte reasons wil not al proue this poynte.
Though they held many poyntes of true and sounde doctrine, yet the
many heresies they held, &amp; those (as this man himself in an other place
of his booke confesseth) <hi>Fundamental,</hi> doe poyson and leauen the whole
lumpe. There is no heretick that holdeth not some truth. As to their
holy Sacrament of Baptisme, yt being deliuered by a false ministrie,
after a false maner, with new adulterate elements of salt, oyle, chreame
&amp;c, with their magical incantations &amp; signes &amp;c, and that to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators,
can no waye giue them christendome, as this Popish Priest sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth.
Or if this Baptisme in the Popish Church be an holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; true seale of the couenant, then would we knowe of Mr. GIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FARD
or his learned abettors, whie their other Sacrament of the <hi>Supper</hi>
or <hi>Altare</hi> should not also be held in the same accompt? Or how the
Church may be said to haue one true, holy, and auaileable Sacrament
to be receaued, an other so blasphemous and execrable as is to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred,
at the same instant? Or what kinde of Couenant this is that
hath one true authenticke seale, an other forged and adulterate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
vnto yt? Furder also we would knowe, if the baptisme of the
Church of ROME be a true and holy Sacrament, whie they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
any from fetching the same there, and how they dare schisme
from that Church that hath the Couenant sealed and confirmed vnto
them. His second reason of some in al kingdomes that hold the faith,
is aboue shewed not to iustifie, but to condemne the Church of ROME:
But all those that had any communion with them in their worship &amp;c
in the tyme of Poperie, cannot in this estate be said to hold the true
faith, or to be members of the Church of CHRIST. His third reason
concerning the infantes is yet as false &amp; fonde as the rest: For neither
are the infants of these idolators by vs to be iudged holy, or to receaue
baptisme, as he himself <hi>Pag.</hi> 49. confesseth; Neither can these infantes
anie waie iustifie their wicked Parents, or the open idolatries &amp;c of the
Romish Church.</p>
               <p>Againe, although it be most true that the truth was before error and
apostasie, yet herevpon it followeth not that error &amp; apostasie are of in
the truth, as this man would conclude of <hi>Antichrist;</hi> That because he is
said to rise in the Church of God, and to sit in the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God, Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the place where he now raigneth &amp; rageth is the Church of God.
But by all these rules of the word of God we finde the Sinagogues that
<hi>Antichrist</hi> hath erected to be of the false &amp; malignant Church, and the
Church of ROME pronownced by God himself to be that great Whore.
Howsoeuer then <hi>Antichrist</hi> might haue his original and worcke in his<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 7.</note>
mysterie in the visible Church, yet as soone as his wickednes brake out
and was apparant,<note place="margin">Reuel. 9. 1.</note> he forfeited his place &amp; was to be caste fourth, as the
Angells that sinned were precipitate out of heauen,<note place="margin">Reu. 12. 10. 11. 12.</note> and cast headlong
into Hel. Yea those Churches that neglected thus to doe, and spared
him, in the iust iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God lost their happie estate, became guiltie
of his sinne,<note place="margin">Reuel. 12. 4.</note> and partakers of his iudgment, and fel away with him.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4716:46"/>
So then this phrase of <hi>Antichrist</hi> his sitting in <hi>The Temple of God</hi> might be
much better vnderstoode, then thus grosly to affirme thervpon that
<hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tichrist</hi> now sitteth in the Church of God. Whether we vnderstand
this his sitting in the Temple of God, as in regarde of his original be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was reueled; Or in that he should sit where sometimes the true
Churches of CHRIST had bene,<note place="margin">Reuel. 18. 7.</note> which he should so destroy &amp; waste, as
there should be no shape or steppes of any of them left vpon the earth,
as it was foretold <hi>Math. 24. 29. Reuel. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 14. Or ells of those counterfeight
names and titles of the <hi>Temple &amp; Church of God</hi> which the false Church
should arrogate and take vnto her self; Howsoeuer, nothing is more
sure then that all these abhominations cannot remaine in the Church
of God. And in that it is in the same verse said that <hi>Antichrist</hi> shalbe lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

And aswel might it from the same verse be enforced, that <hi>Antichrist</hi> is
God, as that the place where he raigneth is the Temple of God:</p>

Iuda in their apostasie, and this vniuersall falling away and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the time of Poperie, to prooue the Church of <hi>England</hi> aswell as
these the true Church of God, he at length addeth a conclusion in this
authenticall assertion of his owne. The Church of <hi>England</hi> in the tyme
of Poperie was a member of the vniuersall Church, and had not the
being of a Church of CHRIST from ROME, nor tooke not her begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of being a Church by separating herself from the Romish Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
&amp;c. If he here meane that the Lord had his secret ones chosen
and knowen vnto himself in <hi>England</hi> in the tyme of Poperie which were
members of the vniuersall Church, vve graunt vvel. But what were
this to approue the generall estate of <hi>England</hi> in the tyme of Poperie
when they were throughly infected with the apostasie and idolatrie of
the Church of ROME, to be a visible member of the vniuersal church?
So that albeit they had not their being a Church from ROME, yet they
had their not being a Church from ROME, when they were defiled
with their apostasie and idolatrie. Wherfore to haue this conclusion
passe, yt had beene needfull that Mr. GIFFARD had approued &amp; made
euident demonstratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Scriptures that the Church of ENGLAND
was rightly gathered vnto and established in that holy faith and order
which CHRIST hath left vnto his Church in vniuersall and perticular
according to the rules and examples in his Testament: Then, that in
tyme of Poperie they fel not away from this holy faith and order: And
that nowe they contynue and faithfully walke in the same faith and
order. This if he had donne, then had he proued that which
now he beggeth and assumeth. Then had he powerfully convinced
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4716:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and stopped the mouthes of al Schismaticks and gaynesayers for euer.
But with al his learning and labour he hath not enterprised, neither
euer is able to proue this by <hi>Christes</hi> Testament. The tyme past &amp; estate
present of their Church of <hi>England</hi> witnesse the contrarie vnto his face,

and in what sort they haue at this daye caste forth the tyrannie &amp; yoak
of <hi>Antichrist</hi> with his abhominations, idolatries, heresies, false Worship,

to confirme by the schisme of Israel, the apostasie of Iuda, and the

to which power their whole Ministerie and people stand and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynue

               <p>ANd now this aucthor not being able to iustifie the publique excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of their Church of <hi>England,</hi> seketh to withdrawe vs from
the present question, by mouing two newe questions: And from those
(after his accustomed maner) laboureth to confute vs. Because the
<hi>Assumption</hi> euen as he himself with longe studie had changed, contriued,
and framed yt, could not yet serue his tourne, His first questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this.
If the Bishop with sondrie other Ministers of the Gospel do dulie exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4716:48"/>
an obstinate wicked man, is he not excommunicate before
God? We first answeare, That the Bishop or the Church of <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> doth
not excommunicat for anie wickednes or crime whatsoeuer, be yt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so heynous, though obstinacie be ioyned thervnto, as for Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
murder, witchcraft &amp;c, but only for contempt of their Courtes, for
not appearing, or not paying their exactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The we answeare, that the
Bishop neuer caleth anie other Ministers to this actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Furder we answeare, that this Lorde Bishop is no Minister of the
Gospel or Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> and therfore he hath nothing to do with
th' excommunication of anie member of the visible Church; Neither
may or wil anie true Ministers of the Gospel ioyne vnto the Bishop in
this busines. But if they should, we say that such excommunication is
not allowed before God, because it is founde contrary vnto his worde.
Yet this we say,<note place="margin">

These are euill speaches and harde reportes to be gyuen out vpon the
people of God, the chosen of CHRIST, partakers of the same pretious

occasions, complaintes, and matters of offence that howrely arise in
so manie sondrie Congregations, especially where all the multitudes
are receiued in as members, they should doe nothing ells through

these Pastors &amp; Elders neuer be able to exercise their owne ministri &amp;

Againe, if euerie Congregation should be thus posted ouer and sent to

Gods ordinance &amp; erecting their owne deuises, al sinne aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
&amp; ouer-floweth, and no sinne (though obstinatly held &amp; persisted

they excommunicate for no sinne; but as the faultes aboue alleadged
are held but bleamishes in their worship, so the greatest sinnes &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
are held but infirmities in their life by the Prophets of these

               <p>Neither will his other kindes of excommunication in their English

doth suspend such notorious wicked and impenitent from the Table
of the Lorde, yet admitteth he them stil to the prayers and ministrie of
the Church in this estate, and holdeth them stil me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers as before. The
Lord saith that excommunication when the sinne is publicke and the
offender obstinate, is the only remedie that we can administer for the
salvation of the partie, and the preservation of the whole Church. The
Church of <hi>England</hi> saith that <hi>Excommunication</hi> is to rough and seuere to cut

it would be knowen of this discipliner this suspender, in what estate we

refuseth to heare the Church, that such an offender in open Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

should reiect anie from the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; of the Church,

to auoyde offence, to preserue the holy mysteries from contempt, is
to cause the Church according to the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God to reiect
&amp; caste out such offenders &amp; wicked persons: so shal he be sure not to
deliuer the holy things of God vnto doggs. Yea if the Church should
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4716:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
refuse to caste them out, then ought he to staye his ministerie, and not
to communicate with other més sinnes, or in this estate to execute the
ministerie of <hi>Christ</hi> vnto them whilest they refuse to obey <hi>Christs</hi> voyce.
But instead hereof this sacrilegious Priest &amp; his compaignions are not
afraide to prostitute &amp; sel the bodie &amp; bloude of <hi>Christ</hi> to the open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
notoriously wicked, skorners, and contemners, for their wage,
offrings, tithes  thus trampling the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God vnder their feete,
and compting the bloode of the Testament a common thing. What
florish soeuer they may seeme to make with this their wooden dagger
of <hi>suspension</hi> (which rather manifesteth their follie and presumption, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
anie waye cleareth them of this sacriledge) great is their presumption
in that they take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this absolute power ouer the whole Church
and ouer the Table of the Lord, to repel whom they liste of their owne
sole aucthoritie from the communion of CHRIST and of his Church,
wherof they are but Ministers and perticular members in the best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
and not Lords &amp; sole rulers. And yet greater is their presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in that they dare thrust out the holie ordinance of God (namelie
publick <hi>Excommunication)</hi> and in place therof set vp their owne deuised
idole <hi>suspension;</hi> which what kinde of censure it is, may appeare by that
which hath bene said. Yt hath no foundation or warrant in CHRISTS

with whom he hath disanulled the couenant.</p>
               <p>The aucthoritie of their Portesse their seruice-booke, wil no way
iustifie either them or yt. The abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of that booke haue bene
a little touched, yet is not this wretched man ashamed to stand vnder
that monstruous idole, and to professe that all the Ministerie of <hi>England</hi>
vse that booke in the publick prayers, and administration of &amp; prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
from the Sacraments. The vanitie and follie of this idole <hi>suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
most plainely appeareth vnto al men by the litle good it doth in anie
of these Parrishes where al prophanenes and iniquitie stil aboundeth.
The Bishop, his Chauncelor, or Commissary may with one worde of
their mouth heale the greatest wounde the Parrish-Priest can make
with this <hi>Suspension,</hi> whatsoeuer Mr. Parson saye. They haue power to
absolue anie that he bindeth; and how cheape their absolutions are, is
not vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to anie whore master in al the Parrish. The Bishop hath
power to make and to depose Ministers at his pleasure; he hath power
ouer the whole ministration; he prescribeth howe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whom they
shal administer. What truth then is in these wordes that the Bishop
cannot take away that power which their seruice-booke giueth them,
when he may absolue the partie, disanul the <hi>suspension,</hi> depose the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
&amp;c. In that he saith the Bishop is but a Minister and no Lord ouer
their faith and conscience, The same will euerie Popish Priest say of
their soveraigne Lorde the POPE, to preserue the dignitie of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie:
The POPE writeth himself but the seruant of the seruants
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4716:53"/>
of God. What Lordlie authoritie the Bishop hath &amp; exerciseth, and in
what seruile subiection the Priestes &amp; all the Parishes stand vnto their
Courtes &amp; iurisdiction, shal hereafter more appeare when we come to
the discussing of those poyntes. In the meane while we willingly assent
vnto Mr. GIFFARD, that the christian reader shall iudge whether their
seruice-booke be not a fit Portesse for such Priestes, and this <hi>suspension</hi> a
fit toole for such worckmen. Still affirming euen with wonder that if
the iudgmentes of God were not vpon their right eye and vpon their
right arme, they might perceaue how their Lordes the Bishops dresse
them, and how this weapon they allowe them wanteth both edge and
poynte &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing finished his answeare to our assumption, he procedeth
to a former answeare where he denied the Consequence. That
where wicked prophane men are receiued into &amp; reteyned in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zome
of the Church, there the couenant is disanulled with them, and
they are no longer Godes people, but a false antichristian Sinagogue.
To disproue this, he alleadged that there were but fewe true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
that frequented the Temple amongst multitudes of prophane &amp;
vngodly men. To this he now addeth the examples of the Church at
<hi>Corinth</hi> and of the seuen Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> &amp;c. We before answeared &amp;
stil answeare, that there is no comparison betwixt, or Argument to be
drawen from those Churches which were rightly gathered &amp; establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and these confused Bibilonish Synagogues of theirs. The Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
were a peculiar separated people vnto the Lorde from the worlde.
The people of these other Churches were wonne, caled, and gathered
vnto CHRIST by the preaching of the Gospel, euery one entred into the
Church by the voluntarie professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his owne faith. No vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
or Gentile might enter into the Temple to offer any gift there.
All, nor yet the greater part of the Citie of <hi>Corinth,</hi> nor of these other
parts of <hi>Asia</hi> were not receiued into the Church as members; But here
in their Church of <hi>England</hi> al the whole land is receiued in, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
from open idolatrie without any voluntarie professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their
owne faith by the people in perticular, yea without the preaching of
the Gospel going before to call them vnto the faith. Therfore in these
reasons he but beggeth the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and assumeth that which he ought
to proue, Namely, That these multitudes of all the prophane &amp; al sorts
of wicked persons, were sometymes rightly gathered vnto and entred
couenant with the Lorde, hauing the true ministrie &amp; gouernement of
CHRIST set ouer them, and nowe being fallen into some sinnes are not
cast out but stil retayned in their Church. This if he had donne, then
had there bene some cause y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he might haue brought against vs th'ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of these Churches. Then should not we haue needed to haue
shewed him his follie twise. Yet this if he had donne (the contrarie
wherof is manifest to al that remember the beginning of her Maiesties
raigne, or but behold the present estate in the same, or rather in more
confusion, sinne being more encreased) Yet then we should easily haue
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4716:54"/>
put difference betwixt those Churhes that ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded at the Apostles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
and these which reiect all the rules &amp; ordinances ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
of CHRISTS Testament as pernitious and intollerable to th'estate of
this land, and persecute al such as admonish them of, and will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
with them in their idolatrie &amp; sacriledge.</p>
               <p>WE also in our former writing shewed him how the faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God in the idolatrous dayes of Kinge ACHAS, MENASSE,
AMON, IEHOIAKIM &amp;c: refrayned from the Temple, being so polluted
and defiled, and mixed not themselues with the wicked in idolatrous
worship. <hi>This Mr. GIFFARD confesseth to be true, and
that it was theire duetie so to doe.</hi> But he saith we do not argue
whether the godly did ioyne with the wicked in idolatrie, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the wicked were suffred and did ioyne with the godlie in true
worship. To the question we haue aboue spoken: Only this by the
waye we drawe from his owne confession, That if the godly in those
dayes did wel in separating from &amp; not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating with the wicked
in those times of publick idolatrie, then ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not we be blamed which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
&amp; withdrawe our selues from these prophane assemblies, where
such abhominable idolatrie and sacriledge is publickly vsed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced,
as we haue aboue proued; and thus are we by him cleared and
iustified, Againe we convince him of his owne mouth thus, If the
faithfull did well in those tymes to withdraw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and separate themselues
from the wicked in their idolatrie which then was publickly set vp,
Then was not the publick estate of the Iewes in those tymes of vs to be
held the true Church of God. For the godly maie at no tyme separate
from the true Church of God, nor repayre vnto the false Church. And
thus by himself is an end put at once to all his cauils wherbie he hath
endeuored to prooue the Iewes in these most corrupt tymes to be the
true outwarde church of God, and to accuse vs of heresie that affirme,
where such heynous transgressions are obstinatly defended &amp; persisted
in by the whole Church, there the Couenant (vnto the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the
faithful) is disanulled, there the faithful may not communicate. And
verie ignorant is Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> if he thinck that the wicked and prophane
may either be receiued into the Church, or retayned in the Church as
members. The wicked &amp; prophane which were neuer entred into the
Church, may &amp; ought to be caled to heare the ministrie of the worde
of God in the Church, as the meanes wherbie they may be caled vnto
the faith, and so vpon their profession be receiued as members into the
fellowship &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the Church. But vntil they make open &amp;
voluntarie profession of their owne faith &amp; obedience, they cannot be
receiued as members, or haue communion with the Church. Then
vntil Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> proue that the prophane multitudes and open wicked
which neuer made anie voluntarie profession of their owne faith and
obedience, may be receiued as members into the Church, he cannot
iustifie these Parish assemblies of <hi>England,</hi> or convince vs. Furder we
graunt, that wicked men, such as fal away from their profession and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4716:54"/>
obedience, shal daylie arise in the church, ells there should be no cause
of <hi>Excommunication.</hi> But when their sinne is publicke, then ought the
Church to ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sure it, and if they be founde obstinate, to caste them out;
ells were there no vse of <hi>Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication.</hi> We graunt also, that the Church
sometymes of negligence, delaying in due tyme to caste out such wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
is notwithstanding (if they amend vpon admonition) to be held
the true Church of God. And this our aduersarye himself <hi>Pag.</hi> 56.
acknowledgeth that we confesse, although now forgetting himself (his
heart being fraught with malice) he bursteth foorth in the gall therof,
accusing and sclandering vs to hold these heresies. <hi>That where any
wicked and open sinners worship together with the Church as
members of the Church / there the Couenant is disanulled with
the whole Church. Againe / that where corrupt maners breake
forth in those that professe the Gospell / they be not only vtterly
voyde of fayth which offende / but also all they that worship to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with them (though neuer so much grieued at their sinnes)
are fallen from the Couenant. Thirdlie that we make the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes
of Gods Couenant to depend vpon the worckes of men / 
and not of the free grace and mercie of God.</hi> How could this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser
drawe these heresies from this assertion? <hi>It is the Church of CHRIST
vvhich hath the power to Excommunicate though it fault much by negligence in executing
the same.</hi> Doth not the expresse contrarie herein appeare? How can he
then reconcile these chardges of his vnto this proposition of ours? Or
can he produce any one sentence that euer we wrote or spake contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
such odious doctrines as these? Yf not, these heresies must stil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne
to his owne throate, as to the sepulchre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the sprange;
these chardges must remayne vpon his reckoning &amp; not vpon ours.</p>
               <p>WE hold that the open prophane and wicked, such as were neuer
caled vnto the faith, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be receiued into the Church as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
before they make open and voluntarie profession of their owne
faith and obedience. He that hath from the beginning distinguished
light from darcknes, hath alwaies made difference and separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the world &amp; the Church, caling the one the Sonnes of God, the
other the daughters of men; preseruing the one in his Arcke, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the other in the floode: he chose and separated to himself out
of the whole world one peculiar Nation and people to be his visible
Church, to whom no prophane which made not professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same
faith might be admitted or ioyned in their worship. The worde
<hi>Ecclesia,</hi> or Church, we knowe to be a companie caled forth from the
world, as were CHRISTS Disciples, and the faithfull in all places at the
first gathering of the Church. Againe we hold that such as are dulie
entred into the Church falling from their profession, and after
due admonition remaine obstinate and hardened in their sinne, ought
by the Church to be excommunicate: And if the Church being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
&amp; stirred vp vnto their duetie refuse to obey &amp; execute the
commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, that then vnto the faithfull it ceaseth to be the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4716:55"/>
true Church of God, and ought to be auoyded vntil they repent. The
Church of CHRIST must euer be obedient vnto CHRISTS voyce, which
voyce when they openlie despise &amp; wilfully resist, they are a companie
of rebells &amp; not a companie of Sainctes. When they fal away from the
faith, they fal away from the Couenant of God; when they obstina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lie
persist in sinne &amp; wilfully despise Gods voyce, they fal away from the
faith. Faith belieueth, reuerenceth, and obeyeth Gods worde so far as
yt is reueled vnto them, and neuer wilfully despiseth or reiecteth anie
anie part of the same. God can neuer be seuered from his worde; they
that despise &amp; reiect Gods worde, despise &amp; reiect God himself. <hi>Christ</hi>
ruleth and reigneth by the scepter of his owne worde, they that are not
subiect vnto, but wilfully disobey that word, are not subiect vnto <hi>Christ,</hi>
haue not him a Kinge, but a Iudge ouer them. Seuere lawes &amp; iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are set downe in God his worde against presumptuous sinne, yea
against al sinne wherof they denie to repent. God hath executed these
iudgments vpon the Angels that sinned, vpon the original world, vpon
the Nation of the Iewes: Neither wil anie vayne titles of Church, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
&amp;c. excuse or deliuer them (being founde in the like transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions)
from the like iudgments. God is iust, &amp; his iudgments are alike
pronounced &amp; executed against al, as against one, being founde &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
remayning in the transgression of his lawe. Nowe then vvhilest
vve conclude, that vvhere the people were neuer rightly caled vnto the

But multitudes of prophane &amp; al sortes of vvicked persons, idolators,
Atheists &amp;c, euen the whole land without any choice, any separation,
receiued into their Church as members, without any voluntarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of their owne faith, that in this estate they cannot be esteemed
the true planted Churches of CHRIST, With what conscience or truth
can this vngodly man herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defame &amp; divulge vs to hold this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
<hi>that where corrupt maners breake forth in those that professe
the gospell / they be not only voyde of fayth which offend / but all
they also which worship together with them (though neuer so
much grieued at their sinnes) are falen from the Couenant.</hi> How
can he liken these rowtes of prophane Atheists and wicked persons of
the world to the faithful seruantes of CHRIST in his Church, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
their open wickednes (which they commit even with greedines)
to the faultes &amp; eskapes of frailety or neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sainctes? Againe
whilest we affirme, That where open obstinacie is ioyned vnto publick
sinne, whether yt be in the whole Congregation or in any perticular

               <p>HE laboureth to defend this sacriledge &amp; confusion by th' examples

that they should not see his rest; yet were not cast out of th' assemblie

committed idolatrie, that <hi>Moses</hi> both did execution vpon the chief Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators,

               <p>That he made also a separation and especiall choise of his Disciples

none but such as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed their sinnes. The same course toke our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
CHRIST, sending forth his disciples to preach the gospel of the
kingdome, who receiued and baptized none but such as repented of
their euill life, and gaue obedience to their doctrine: these our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
acknowledged, receiued, taught, instructed, guided as his

he gaue ouer to be spoyled and deuoured of their owne rulers, and
one of an other, to be guided by those wicked and idoll sheepheardes
vvhose soule abhorred him, and his soule loathed them. Yea how ful
a separation there was betwixt these sheepheardes and these flockes,
the hostilitie they shewed vnto our Sauiour and his Disciples by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating,

them, euerie where in the historie of his life doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
Furder that he communicated not with them in their feastes,

plentifully. He a longe season when the Iewes laid wayte to kill him
refrayned <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> At other tymes when he came thither,
it was not to keepe the feastes together with them, so much as to
take occasion vpon such concurse of people to instruct them, and
to call them vnto himself. He sometimes went not at all, sometimes
went at the mid-feast, And when he was there he kept not the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
together with them before the Temple according to the lawe
<hi>Deutronomie. 12. 5. Leuit.</hi> 17. But he kept yt apart with his Disciples in
a priuate chamber: As when there was no publicke assemblies, as in

<hi>Exod. 12. 2 Chron.</hi> 35. yea he kept yt vpon an other daye, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon the 14. of the first moneth according to the lawe, and not
vpon that daye the Iewes kept theirs, which was a daye after, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
euidently by the historie. <hi>Math.</hi> 26. For the Iewes solemne
feast or cessation ought by the lawe to haue bene vpon the 15. daye, the

and kept their feaste vpon the <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> deferring the Paschal by
their tradition one daye longer then the lawe commanded: <hi>Leuit. 2. 4.

euident that our Sauiour and his Disciples did not communicate

sinne and obstinacie. By whose example this great Clearke Mr. GIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FARD

Yet to make the matter more sure, he bringeth certaine Churches
planted by the Apostles, As the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the Churches
of <hi>Asia.</hi> In the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were factions and schismes, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the teachers, negligence in the Gouernours, th' incestuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
suffred, contentions among the people and that vnder heathen
Iudges; They feasted in idoll temple, they prophaned the Supper of
the Lorde, they abused spirituall giftes, some denied the resurrection
of the deade; yet the holie Ghost vouchsaueth them the name of
the Church of God. Well, what of all this? Therfore the wicked
prophane multitudes which were neuer rightly gathered to the faith,
may be receiued as members into the Church. We see no such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent.
The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was orderly gathered by the Apostle
vnto the faith, none receiued but such as belieued and made open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of their faith and obedience, Sainctes by calling. Agayne the
Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was rightly established into that order, and had such
Ministers, Officers, and ordinances, as CHRIST in his Testament had
assigned and th' Appostle instituted: so hath not the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
but popish and antichristian, Therfore no comparison thus far foorth
betwixt the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Neither can
these faults wherein he compareth the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the church
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and wherein it is founde like vnto, or rather far without all
comparison to exceede them, make the Church of <hi>England</hi> the true
Church of God. What is yt then this learned man would conclude
from thence? That the open prophane and obstinate wicked may be
retained in and by the Church, wittingly and willingly after admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet that Congregation not cease to be the true Church of
CHRIST. This he striueth to proue; And therfore where it is allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> repented at the Apostle his admonition,
and is by the Apostle himself said to haue shewed them selues pure in
that busines. 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. he maketh vnto this a double answeare. One,
that they were Godes true Church before they repented; The other,
that all did not shewe repentance as appeareth. 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. 20. 21. To
the first we answeare and neuer denied, That they being rightly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto the faith and orderly established in the faith (notwithstanding
that grieuous sinnes brake out amongst them) so long as they despised
not admonition and refused not to repent, were to be still held and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed
as the true Church of CHRIST, who if we confesse our sinnes
is faithfull and iust to forgiue vs our sinnes, and to clense vs from all
iniquitie. But as we haue often said, this maketh against Mr. GIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FARD,
because the Church of ENGLAND was no such true Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that and wherein these faultes were and are committed. Vnto his
second allegation, that all shewed not repentance for the vncleannes,
fornication, and vvantonnes vvhich they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted; We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it as the Apostle recordeth it to be a great fault in the whole
Church, That they did not more diligently search out the sinne, and
speedely caste out the sinners that remayned impenitent. Yet was this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4716:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Church but a fault of negligence, and not of anie obstinacye;

                  </gap>hers.
Yet euen this slacknes and negligence the Apostle thus
sharplie &amp; seuerely reproueth, threatning (if they amend not) to come
with a rodde, and with the power of CHRIST against them. He neither
iustified nor flattered them in their sinnes, as this false Prophet doth,
who hath no better argumentes to pleade for o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> iustifie this apostasie
and obstinacie of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then the greatest sinnes and
odious faultes of other Churches. But to such a height &amp; measure is
their wickednes encreased, as all the sinnes of all Churches in all ages
are too narrowe to couer the bedd of their fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>  Neither can
those fearefull breaches &amp; lamentable ruines in the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi>
heale the wounde of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If God so threatned or
menaced those Churches to come and feight against them, to remoue
their candle-sticke &amp;c, vvhat shalbe the iudgmentes of the Church of
<hi>England?</hi> what can she expect, whose sinnes so far exceede, which taketh
boldnes to contynue in sinne, and pleade for the same from these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
which the Lord hath lefte as monumentes of terror to all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terities.
Yet in all these desolations of these Churches can there be no
comparison betwixt these barbarous confuse assemblies, and those
Churches which sometymes were rightly gathered and established
vnto the faith, and into the order of CHRIST: and so all Mr. GIFFARDS
labour and paynes herein is lost. Neither will this conclusion followe,
That because yt ceaseth not to be a Church by and by where the open
wicked are not separated (because the Church sometimes may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such sinnes of ignorance or of negligence) Therefore the godly are
not defiled which communicate with these open wicked in prayers, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes,
and other spirituall exercises. Might he not aswel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that because yt ceaseth not to be a Church herevpon, therfore
yt is no sinne. But if yt be a sinne in the whole Church, then is the
whole Church guiltie of &amp; defiled with that sinne.</p>
               <p>NOwe as Mr. GIFFARD laboureth to drawe this conclusion, so stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
he to proue this proposition, That the admission of the open
vvicked &amp; impenitent to the table of the Lorde doth not defile either
the Sacrament or the faithfull receiuers. Herevnto he hath gathered
a fewe stale reasons. 1. As that the wickednes of the Minister doth not
difile the holy thinges of God: <hi>Iudas, Ely</hi> his Sonnes, the <hi>Scribes &amp; Pharasies</hi>
were wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet were the thinges they administered holie. 2. Then
that the godly communicant toucheth not the sinnes of others, but the
holie thinges of God; because there cannot be a separation from the
wicked in bodie or bodily thinges alwaies: but they which touche not
their sinnes obey the commandement <hi>Come out from amonge them, separate
your selues &amp; touche none vncleane thing.</hi> That the blame of receiuing such wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
resteth only vpon such as haue the power of the discipline in their
handes, and not vpon priuate members which mourne &amp; lament to see
such fowle matters wincked at, which mourners are cleared <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:4716:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
TO discuse these pointes in perticular would make this discourse
ouer long, breiflie therfore this we say. To the first, that difference
must be put betwixt hypocrites (whose wickednes is onlie knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto
the Lord) and such wicked, whose sinne is knowen vnto the Church.
The publicke ministrie of secret hypocrits that are rightly caled to a
lawful office, and execute their office without fault or blame, is holie,
blessed, and profitable to the whole Church (which can but looke vpon
and iudge the outwarde action and estate, and not the hearte and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of anie) yet this their ministerie is vnavayleable to themselues,
and maketh to their owne greater condemnation. But where the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
is detected of, and remayneth obstinate in anie transgression, his
ministration is not acceptable to the Lord, neither ought to be suffered
or ioyned vnto of the Church. The Lord willbe sanctified of all that
come neere vnto him. Vnder the lawe he required an holie ministerie
to serue in the priestes office without outward mayne or bleamish, lest
he defiled the holie thinges of the Lorde; The offerings of anie other
were not acceptable to the Lorde. It is also written that the sacrifice of
the wicked is an abhomination to the Lord, as if they cut off a dogges
heade, or offred swynes bloode. They haue nought to doe to declare
the Lords ordinances that hate to be reformed, and caste his worde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
them. The Church ought not onlie to forbid such to adminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but to cast them out of the fellowship, which if the Church neglect
and refuse to doe, them are they guiltie of the open or wilful breach of
Gods holie ordinances in suffring his holie name and ministerie to be
prophaned, yea in ioyning thervnto and reioycing therin. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
by him alleadged no waye help him. <hi>Iudas</hi> whilest he remayned
with our Sauiour was an hypocrite, his sinnes vndiscoured, yea vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committed,
so longe in that estate his publicke ministerie was lawful,
holie, and acceptable vnto others. The ministerie of the Sonnes of <hi>Eli</hi>
(after their wickednes was publick) wea abhominable vnto God, to be
detested of all the faithful: yet was the sinne of the people verie great,
who vpon and for the sinnes of these wicked prestes abhorred the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes
of the Lorde, which were euer to be esteemed most holie, being
lawfullie administred, otherwise they are not the offrings of the Lord.
The people then (as nowe) grewe into Atheisme and all impietie, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring
all Gods worship, and refusing to be at anie chardge, louing
the creatures better then the Creator by seing the great insolency and
inreverence of the prestes. Touching the <hi>Scribes and Pharasies</hi> we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
said enoughe.</p>
               <p>TO his other allegations, that the faithful are not defiled by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
with the open and obstinate wicked in the Supper of the
Lorde and other spiritual exercises, because they touche not the sinne
of the wicked but the holy thinges of God &amp;c Surelie this is verie odd
diuinitie, contrarie to al the groundes of scripture that we haue read
of. We had thought that all the communicantes at the Lordes Table
had bene ioyned &amp; commingled together into one spiritual body euen
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4716:60"/>
into CHRIST, as manie grapes are there bruzed into one cup, manie
graynes into one loafe. Furder we had thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no obstinate offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whose sinne is publicklie knowen, might haue beene admitted
to that holie Table without wilful sacriledge and high prophanation
of those holie mysteries, both in all the Communicantes and in the
Minister.<note place="margin">Leu. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 21. 22</note> Wee reade in the lawe plentifullie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the leprous or

guiltie, and their reioycing or feast not good before the Lord, likening
the whole Church to the lumpe, the wicked person and sinnes kept
amongst them to the leauen, their reioycing to the eating of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schal
&amp;c: Which most direct place this ignorant sacrilegious Priest
would put away and falsifie by likening this reioycing here spoken of
to a glorying in the sinne of th' incestuous, as though the Church of
<hi>Corinth</hi> had euer bene so beastlie. And by endevouring to separate the
elements of the breade and wyne in this Sacrament from their mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
sense, the communicantes that receiue the same together, from
their spirituall communion they haue one with an other, the whole
Church from the preparation and care they ought to haue both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and perticularly in administring and receiuing the Sacraments,
And hauing thus royled the pure fountaynes, he confowndeth the
sense and distinct doctrines of the Apostle, by bringing in certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
where the wife, seruant, passenger, vpon some especial dueties
and necessities, may be occasion eate ordinarie bread with th' excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.
Whervpon he concludeth, that the faithful also may vpon
necessitie (as if the Church wil not caste out the open wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent) communicate with them in the supper of the Lorde. And
if so be these faithful mourne and are grieued for this wilful sacriledge
of the Minister and the rest of the Church, then they touche not their
sinne, but the holie thinges of God, and are cleare <hi>Ezechell.</hi> 9. because
the separation from the wicked cannot alwaies be in bodie, as in the
cases by him alleadged of eating common breade with them. But let
this cauiller knowe that there is no comparison, much-lesse anie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
betwixt the eating common breade, and the eating of the
Supper of the Lorde with the open wicked and impenitent. There is
no such spiritual mysterie, communion, or commixture in the first, as
in the second. Common bread is not forbidden the wicked, but these
holie pledges vtterlie are, they ought not to be caste to hogges and
dogges. Neither are we forbidden al ciuile conversation so absolutelie
with them, as we are all spirituall communion. In the one vve see
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4716:60"/>
prouision and exception made for duetie and necessitie. In the other
there is no such duetie or necessitie, neither anie such prouision and
exception mentioned in the Scripture, vntil these Priestes to defend
their port-sale and open sacriledge deuised these shiftes. The scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
vtterlie forbiddeth and repulseth the open wicked &amp; impenitent
from this holie banquet by more then the <hi>Cherubins</hi> shaking the edge of
a sworde. So far are the open wicked from being admitted to this
feaste, as they are to be caste out, to be deliuered vnto <hi>Sathan,</hi> so far are
they to bee kept from all communion with CHRIST and with his
Church. But none are to be admitted to this Sacrament, but such as
outwardly stand in the faith, and therby (vnto the iudgment of the
Church) haue fellowship with CHRIST and his members. The verie
action or <hi>Symbole</hi> yt self sheweth this communion vvith CHRIST, and
one vvith an other. 1. <hi>Corinth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. 16. and</hi> 12. 13. No sophistrie can disioyne
the mysterie or signification from the outward elements and action,
neither the communion from the participation in this action, so far
as vve may iudge.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> As the vnworthie receiuers are guiltie of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and bloode of the Lorde, so the Church in admitting, adminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
vnto, and communicating vvith them, is guiltie of most high
sacriledge and prophanation of the holie thinges of God, especially
they doing it wilfullie and wittinglie. Now then if they all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
in this action, and this action deliuered in this maner be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
how should they not all be guiltie? Can anie man here say
that anie of the Communicantes in this case toucheth not the sinne,
but the holie thinges of God, vvhen first in this action they are all
spirituallie commingled and ioyned together, then the verie action
vvhich they all doe (as they doe it) is most highe sacriledge not a
touching but an open, (if not a vvilfull) prophanation of the holie
thinges of God? Can th' aucthoritie of the Church excuse them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God? Or vvil it here excuse them to say they cannot doe vvith
it, because the power of the discipline is not in their handes? We
haue aboue shewed that euerie member hath interest in the power of
the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that the power to receiue in and to caste out belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to the vvhole Church, and not to the Presbiterie or anie perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
member of the Church onlie: Neither yet these matters refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the wil or choise of the Church, but rules prescribed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom
and vvhen to receiue, whom and vvhen to caste out. As vpon publick
profession of faith and obedience with desire of ioyning, the Church
cannot refuse but must receiue, so vpon publicke sinne and obstinacie
ioyned to the same, the Church must then caste out, and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not retaine
without sinne: Which sinne becommeth so much the more heynous
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they doe it wittinglie &amp; willinglie, but most of al whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obstinacie is
added, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church wil not be admonished, neither ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Though
euerie private member ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not excommunicate or reforme the publicke
actions of the Church, which are donne contrarie to the worde, yet
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4716:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
euerie priuate member may &amp; ought to refraine such publick actions,
as they see to be contrary to the worde, and to admonish the Church
&amp;c. And in so doing they depart not from the Church, neither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
from the Communion, so much as preserue the Church &amp; the
communion: Our fellowship must alwaies be in the faith, out of the
faith we maie haue no communion with man or Angel in knowen
sinne. They that depart from the faith depart from the Church, and
breake the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We may not followe a multitude or the mighty
in euil. It behoueth euerie christian that receiueth to knowe what the
action is he doeth, to knowe what he receiueth and howe he receiueth,
to knowe by whom and with whom he receiueth. We say not now (as
some in the idlenes of their conceipt coniecture) that we ought to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and iudge euerie one that communicateth: No it sufficeth vs if
they by outward profession stand stil members, and remaine not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict

They must knowe that the Minister that deliuereth is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the outwarde rules (so far as they maie iudge) a lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Gospel, and that the communicantes by outward professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(so far as they can iudge) stand in the faith; Ells can they not discerne
what the communion of the Church or the action they doe, is. It wil
not suffice or excuse them to saye they mourne and are grieued for the
sinnes of the wicked with whom they communicate, and for the sinne
of them that should put them from the Sacrament, yea caste them out
of the Church, and deliuer them ouer vnto <hi>Sathan,</hi> for the humbling
their flesh, and the preservation of others from the contagion of their
sinne, yea of the whole Church from the wrath of God. How should
they be said to mourne for the sinne of these wicked, with whom they
feast and reioyce in this heauenly banquet? From whence al sorrowe,

What then hath this great clarck gayned by this traditional diuinitie,
saue bewrayed his corrupt iudgment &amp; great ignorance of the truth of
God, yea even of those principal actions wherof he professeth himself
a Minister? What hath he obtayned or endeuoured by al this discourse
to prooue, if not that all these prophane multitudes and rowtes of all
sortes of wicked may be receiued into and nourished in the Church

trifles, whie then these graue Fathers these holy men so violently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

also let them consider &amp; acknowledge, that these triffles or titles they
vsurpe are prooued most execrable blasphemies, names vvritten vpon
the heades of the Beast, and not vpon the members or Minister of <hi>Christ.</hi>
And in their best allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they are directly contrarie to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of <hi>Christ,</hi> who prohibiteth his Ministers all such titles,

their owne deuises for the publicke worship &amp; administration,
stinting and limiting the Pastor what wordes to reade and say, what
scriptures to reade on this and that daye through the yeere. They
limite and restraine the doctrine of the Pastor from speaking against

to be error, be yt neuer so grosse, popish, blasphemouse, nor anie

office, entrance, and administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Pastors office, whether these
Bishops possesse this office, be rightly caled and entered to the same,
and faithfully administer &amp; execute the same. The teachers office for
the reasons aboue-said they cannot hold or chalendge, both in regarde
of the fastuous titles &amp; inordinate power and aucthoritie which they
vsurpe &amp; exercise ouer all the ministerie, euen such as they cal Pastors,
and ouer all Churches, causes, censures &amp;c, which can at no hand be
ioyned or agree vnto the christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Teachers office. As also for that they,
their ministrie, and office belongeth not to any one peculiar Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
The like reasons maie be drawen from their Popish entrance
and administration, seing they take vpon them to deliuer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and attend not vnto doctrine only or diligently, giuing ouer &amp;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4716:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ceasing to preach whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they list, neither submit the doctrines they teach
to the ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sure &amp; tryal of other Prophets by the Scriptures. For al which
reasons and sondrie other, they cannot be said to haue or exercise the
christian Teachers office. Last of al, the office of gouerning Elders
they haue not, for all the same reasons; In that they are not chosen of
&amp; belong not vnto any perticular Congregation to which they should
be bownde by duetie to attend. Neither euer did we reade in al <hi>Christes</hi>
Testament of any Bishops or Ministers (setting aside those temporarie
offices of <hi>Apostles, Prophets, Euangelists</hi> that where chosen, did attend, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister

in that office &amp; place they are caled vnto, as a worke enough for
him that thinketh himself most able to dischardge it. And sure most
monstruous &amp; impossible it were for one man faithfully to attend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Congregations, Except they can also shew that one sheepheard at
one &amp; the same time can diligently feed &amp; guide two or many flockes
far distant in place, Or that one candle may be put into two candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
and giue light vnto two seueral houses far distant asunder at one
&amp; the same instant. If the one be impossible, so is the other. Yet stand
these men Bishops or Ouerseers not only to manie Churches each one
of them, But their Primate giueth, or rather selleth lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior

proue them to be no christian Bishopps, in that they exercise some ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
office or offices together with this their pretended ministrie.<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 14.</note>
Which is not only expresly forbidden &amp; vtterly vnlawful by the worde
of God, but also impossible for any man to performe both, or either of
both faithfully whilest he keepeth both. God himself hath made two
distinct and seueral offices, and appoincted vnto them two distinct &amp;
seueral persons for Ministers: It being no more lawfull for a Bishop
to execute the ciuile Magistrates office, then for the ciuile Magistrate
to administer the Sacraments. What mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>struous parsons then are they
which thus confounde &amp; commingle in their owne persons these two
diuers and distinct offices and powers? Might not they that assume
both the swordes into their handes, carry them acrosse also in their
cote armour, aswel as their holie Father the POPE? What a monstrous
confusion and perturbation make they both in Church and common
wealth herebie? disturbing the holie order that God himself hath set
for the gouernement both of the Church and common wealth in this
worlde, remouing yea vtterly breaking downe therbie all the limites
and bowndes which God hath set and established for all estates, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
offices, callinges, actions, so that no man by this meanes either
knoweth his duetie, or orderly walketh within the bowndes of his
calling, wherbie it is come to passe that the whole land ouer-floweth
with all impietie, violence, cruelitie and iniquitie, as in the dayes of
NOE,</p>
               <p>Thus by al these reasons haue we proued, and al that haue not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made shipwrack of faith &amp; good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, or that stand not vowed
bond seruantes to their apostaticall throne, must confesse, That these
<hi>Arch</hi> &amp; Lord <hi>Bishops</hi> are no true christian Bishops according to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of CHRIST, neither haue or exercise any lawful office or ministri of
or in the Church of CHRIST. If then they be not members of that body
belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to that heade CHRIST IESVS, it must needes followe that they,
their offices, &amp; ministrie are false &amp; antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, belonging to an other
head, an other bodie, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antichrist, and that whoore the false Church
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4716:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his spouse. If their inordinate power and irregular ministrie be found
contrarie to al the rules and ordinances of <hi>Christes</hi> Testament, then can
yt not be of God, belong vnto, or vsed in <hi>Christes</hi> Church, or be blessed
to the gouernement or saluation of his people: Then must it needes be
the power and throne of <hi>Sathan</hi> giuen to the Beast, accursed, giuen to
seduce, and to drawe all the children of wrath to distruction. Neither
shal Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> or all the false Prophets belonging to their throne, be
able to tourne away or withstand those iudgments and plagues which
are powred out of the Lordes viall vpon the throne of the Beaste, or
with their soft tongues to licke whole the woundes of the Beaste, that
are giuen with that two edged sword that procedeth out of CHRISTES
mouth. It shal not help them though they raile and blaspheme and
gnawe their tongues for grief. For their kingdom shal wax darke, and
Antichrist shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sume &amp; be abolished as he is reueiled,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 8.</note> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same
light: the Lord himself hath spoken yt. How weake nowe &amp; sclender
are Mr. <hi>Giffards</hi> defences for these his Lordes the Bishops. <hi>That the Bishops
haue not their caling, consecration, or power from the Pope, but from their Church. That they
haue by oath renownced the Popes vsurped power and tyrannie. That they do not maintaine
or defend the religion and lawes of Antichrist, but professe and aduance the gospel of Christ,
and by the liuely word cut downe all idolaitre, heresies, abhominations. That they vsurpe not a
Lordship ouer the faith and consciences of men, but their peculiar power is onlie in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of external discipline. Therfore we vvith manifest and vvicked sclander call the
Bishops Antichristian.</hi> If you demande the proofe of al this, wee refer you
to Mr. <hi>Giffards</hi> bare affirmation without anie one reason in his learned
answeare to the <hi>Brownistes, Page.</hi> 75. If he were himself sometime of an
other minde, you must thincke it was before he had so neere friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with, or was imployed in such trustie seruices by his Lord of <hi>Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
Who, as also his Lords grace, must not be driuen to proue euerie thing
they affirme, that were enough to put young diuines vnto, their ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
mouth is sufficient warrant to all the Churches in <hi>England.</hi> Yet I
would of their curtesie they would giue vs their Schismatiks that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be so satisfied, leaue to doubt (though we wil not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) whether
their <hi>Caling, Consecration,</hi> and this their <hi>Power</hi> first came not from the <hi>Pope.</hi>
For albeit we haue heard that the offices of <hi>Prouincial Bishops, Arch Bishops,
Metropolitanes</hi> where almost when this general defection from the gospel
so much foretold of began to breake out and appeare, longe before the
<hi>Pope</hi> obtayned his <hi>Supremacie</hi> ouer al other Churches and Ministers: Yet
might it be that this maner of their caling, solemne consecration, and
lardge irregular power of his <hi>Lords Grace</hi> &amp; <hi>Lord Bishops</hi> sprong from their
vnholie Father the <hi>Pope.</hi> Who when he was inthronized by <hi>Sathan,</hi> had
receiued the Dragons high commission, to be his <hi>Vicare general</hi> in earth,
could not of his fatherhoode but prouide for these his natural childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and bestowe them in his garrison Cities, as his <hi>Tetrarches, Lieutenants</hi> &amp; <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,</hi>
with magnificent titles, priuiledges, power, and authoritie to rule
in his name and absence, euen as his owne engrauen image ouer all
Realmes, Countries, &amp; Territories within their Fathers dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4716:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(as we haue also crediblie hearde) there was neuer a <hi>Lorde Arch-Bishop</hi> or
<hi>Lorde Bishop</hi> with such titles, priuiledges, power, hearde of before the
Pope created them. Notwithstanding because wee haue these thinges
but bie hearesay, and would be lothe to affirme of things so vnsure, we
wil content our selues to haue proued and shewed the Arch Lord Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
to be no true Ministers of the gospel and Church of CHRIST,
and therfore of themselues antichristian, from whom or howsoeuer
they rise it skilleth vs not. Neither shall it auaile them though they
haue broken their faith and schismed from the <hi>Pope,</hi> cast off his yoke,
renownced his vsurped power and tyrannie, when they themselues are
rounde to vsurpe, retaine and exercise, if not the same, yet as anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
&amp; enormous a power as the <hi>Pope,</hi> retayning the same Courts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Officers, Cannons, constitutions, priuileges ouer all Churches, Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

the censure of anie Church, exercising their aucthoritie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandementes
contrarie vnto and aboue all lawes both of God and of
their Prince; whose <hi>Royall Courts and writts</hi> are not of power to baile anie
one committed by the leaste of their hierarchie, assuming vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
both the swordes, exercising together and at once both ciuile
and ecclesiasticall offices &amp;c. How well they aduance the Gospel of
CHRIST, that blaspheme the same, and pronounce the rules, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and ministrie therof intollerable, and persecute all such as
either speake against them, or for yt, Let the tyrannous hauocke they
make in the common wealth of poore christians in the prisons of the

heresies, and popish abhominations, let the seruice-booke and
publick worship of their Churche, shewe. Which whilest with a
stronge hande they obtrude vpon euerie conscience, as also impose
vpon the Church, is not this to tyrannize and exercise a Lordship ouer
the faith and conscience? Or (to speake as he doth) is this nothing
but to execute the external discipline, to make and impose a newe <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourgie</hi>
for the whole administration of the Church? Or is it likelie
that this marcked Minister of ANTICHRIST knewe what the outward
gouernment of CHRIST in his Church meaneth, that saith yt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth

Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> can imagine such a Congregation and such members

heare admonition, or suffer reproof, which is the meanes giuen of God
to bring them to amendement. Yet Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> maketh this holie out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

the conscience; the myserable diuines of this age, not to be of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

tyranny all such as pleade for <hi>Christes</hi> gouernement, and wil not subiect
their bodies and soules vnto their antichristian yoke. But yet for all
this they exercise no Lordship ouer the faith and conscience, though
they vsurpe, exercise, and impose this strange ministrie, ministration,
and gouernement in and ouer the Church. All this saith Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi>
is but th'administration of exernall discipline, and concerneth not the
conscience, (especiallie if it be seared with a whote Iron as Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi>
is.) Wherfore we doe impudentlie and wickedlie sclander when wee
therfore conclude that the Bishops be antichristian, and whosoeuer is
ordayned by them, hath his ministrie from Antichrist and from the
Deuil. What kinde of ministrie your Lord Bishops exercise, and auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie

strange, false, forged, antichristian, such as belong not vnto and

WE would gladly learne of him what office in the Church of God,
<hi>Chancelors and Commissaries,</hi> may be said to exercise, for we confesse
that in <hi>Christes</hi> Testament we neuer read of their names or offices: they
are strangers there, and we in all the worlde knowe not from whence
they came or who brought them into the Church, if not their Father

and iudicial causes, such as by the lawe of God deserue death, and only
belong to the Princes royall aucthoritie, to whom therfore God hath
committed his sworde: Whose iudgment seate &amp; aucthoritie for anie
priuate person to vsurpe, is iudged rebellion both by the lawe of God
and of this land. For all that take the sworde shall dye in the sworde
<hi>Math.</hi> 26. 52. Againe these <hi>Chauncelors and Commissaries</hi> are <hi>Ciuilians</hi> (laye men
as they cal them) &amp; not Priestes, therfore we meruaile how they came
to exercise such an high ministrie ouer and in the Church.</p>
               <p>The same we say of their other <hi>delegate ciuile Doctors</hi> of their Courtes &amp;

These handle both ecclesiastical and ciuile causes mixtlie, after
a most corrupt and litigious maner, amongst whom al things are venal
in their Courtes &amp;c, wherof in due place: sufficeth it here to finde
them in name, office, and vse counterfeit, forged, false, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or warrant in Gods worde, such as not <hi>Christ</hi> but <hi>Antichrist</hi> deuised &amp;
brought in.</p>
               <p>As to the persons in their high <hi>commission</hi> they are of two sortes, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ecclesiastical, and partlie (for countenance and fashion sake) ciuile;
Of the ecclesiastical we haue aboue entreated. Neither finde wee that
anie ciuile person may exercise anie ecclesiastical office or function: as
to ouer-see so manie Churches, to decide and determine ecclesiastical
causes, or to execute the censures of the Church, as by way of office or
by vertue of anie humane commission, especially after that vngodlie
maner, which is in al things so contrarie to the order <hi>Christ</hi> hath institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
so contrary to the faith, power, and libertie of <hi>Christes</hi> Church, as
were not hard to shewe if we should examine their procedings by the
rules of Gods worde. And great ruth it is that so noble and honorable
personages should be so highly abused by these wicked Bishops. The
Lorde in mercie shew them their deceipts, the error and daunger of
their wayes.</p>
               <p>Yet of this gouerning ministrie remayneth the <hi>Arch head Deacon</hi> of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> to be considered of, who is no smale officer of this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4716:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church, hauing and keeping his solemne iudiciall Court, <hi>Synode,</hi> and
procedings in such ecclesiastical causes as fal within his consideration,
with absolute power in his owne name also to cite, sommon, iudge,
and punish all such parish Churches with their Parsons and Ministers
as fal within his limites. To impose taskes vpon Pastors, what scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to reade priuately euerie daye, what to conne by heart, and to

(if such be his learning that he can) may administer the worde and
Sacramentes, and haue a benefice or two for neede. Howsoeuer, he
may pleade and boaste of his antiquitie aswell as the <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> and of
the great cause of his erection and necessarie vse of his office &amp;c. Yet
seing we finde no mention of his name, or vse of his office, in all the

with such stately Courtes and absolute iutisdiction, and that not ouer

must, or rather the Lorde hath giuen the same sentence of them, that

the boundes of his owne office in sobrietie, and not to intermeddle
with the Pastors office also, with the ministration of the worde and
sacramentes: yea to exalt himself and vsurpe power and iurisdiction
ouer his superiors, not only ouer many <hi>Pastors,</hi> but ouer manie whole

skill aright to discusse whither and how they sprange from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,

not their Artes, Aucthors, exercise, and vse of their learnings, dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,

help him, or their store of learning shewe, that they haue not
bene and are not thus imitiate and brought vp. In their grammer
scholes it cannot be denied, but they learned and learne the latine
tongue from the most heathenish and prophane aucthors, lasciuious
Poets &amp;c, which are allowed with the priuiledge of the Church of
ENGLAND as most christian rudiments to be taught the youth in the
publicke scholes. When they haue passed all those formes, and can
both say much of those aucthors by heart and vse their phrase, then
are they sent to the Vniuersitie to learne the artes, and to be instructed

they instructed both publickly and priuately in Logique &amp; Rethorick
in the Elenches and Topickes, in the tropes and figures of all kindes;
wherein they must be perfect, for these artes are of speciall vse vnto
them, and to serue at all assaies. Then procede they to philosophie, &amp;

lost, founde &amp;c. These thinges it were frensie if not blasphemie
to call vayne and curious artes. Mr. GIFFARD would neuer beare it at
the handes of such blinde schismatickes (whose bane such deipe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is) seeing these sciences are vulgarely taught, studied, practized,
allowed, and maintained not only in the <hi>vniuersities</hi> but of the whole
Church of ENGLAND, as by their yeerely prognosticatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s euerie where

<hi>Curious,</hi> because Mr. GIFFARD saith <hi>Luke</hi> speaketh only of coniuration
<hi>Act.</hi> 19. But let him approue these lawfull by the scriptures, and surely I
wil gladly confesse mine ignorance &amp; sinne in caling these studies and
artes prophane, curious, vnfit for a christian, much more for a Minister
of the Church. Otherwise let not any through mine vnskilfulnes
(who peraduenture repeate not aright or in due place the tearmes of
these artes, as hauing either forgotten them through longe disconty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
or may be, neuer learned them aright) take occasion either to
carpe at me therfore, or especially to thincke the better of these vaine
and curious, yea vnlawfull and vnchristian artes and studies, which
haue not only no warrant in Gods worde, but are directly contrarie
vnto and expresly forbidden in the same, as were not harde to shewe
and prooue, if the subiect were not to lardge, and should not make to
wide a <hi>Parenthesis</hi> in this treatise, and drawe it out to a greater length
then I would. I will not therfore stand here to discusse their philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall
probleames, paradoxes, axiomes, or seuerall sentences and
opinions, which are authenticall and currant amongst them, how euill
they agree to the worde of God: Or to shewe how far these curious
inquisitors, these starr-gazers, astrologians, calcars, wisardes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
exceede the boundes of faith and sobrietie, and passe the limites
of Gods reueiled will: Or whether they maie wander by these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish

their other vaine, curious, fonde, triffling and vile artes, and studies,
which were endlesse. Onlie in this place I must here add vnto those
publicke professed artes aboue recited, the studie of all heathen and

In these artes and studies are these <hi>Academical diuines</hi> or rather <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticke

they are once a litle exercised and instructed that they beginne to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

shall directlie proue by the scriptures these thinges to be lawful, then

For howe possible or likelie that is, for so manie younge men in

noseled in such heathen vanitie, prophannes, vaine-glorie, curiositie,
superstition, disorder, dissolutenes, and (as is said) contempt of Gods

               <p>Yet would I not here, that anie should deeme or suppose that wee

kept in holie order. Then, that the artes and sciences which are thus
taught or studied, be not vayne, curious, or vnlawful, but necessarie &amp;
godlie. Thirdlie, that they be not taught, exercised, or practized after
anie prophane, vaineglorious, or superstitious maner, but in al sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,
modestie, and in the feare of God. To these fewe rules if their <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities,

which they nowe pretend) the scholes of all godlie learning to garnish
the Church, to furnish the common wealth with fit and vertuous men

wil not be pleased or serued with in his Church.</p>
               <p>Let not Mr. <hi>Deane</hi> vnder the visarde of a christian name and office
thincke to escape, for when we bring him to the light, we finde him
but a counterfeight, hauing neither the office nor ministration of a
christian <hi>Deacon.</hi> The christian <hi>Deacons</hi> office is faithfully to collect and
distribute the almes and contribution of the Church. But these <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Deanes</hi> feede themselues &amp; their troupes, I say not of the weekely
almes of their Church (for that they neither gather, neither would it
suffice the tenth part of their pompe) but of the Lordships, landes, and
fees of their Church; lying loytering in their stately pallaces, and not
distributing to the poore of that Congregation according to th'ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of the <hi>Elders</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> A christian <hi>Deacon</hi> keepeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
within the limites of the office he is called vnto, and doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
with th'execution of their offices which belong not vnto

<hi>Cathedral Deacons</hi> take vpon them the ministrie of the worde and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
manie of them hauing personages beside their Deanerie; And
hauing bene Pastors before, yet for liuing and promotions sake, are
not ashamed to goe backe to the <hi>Deacons Office,</hi> or to retaine both offices.
Neither doth the christian <hi>Deacon</hi> vsurpe such place, preeminence, and

nothing common or like to a christian Deacon, either in office, caling

Therfore what titles soeuer they carrie, or pretextes they make,

being but recited, &amp; the light of the gospel being but brought to their

broode they are. Yea let this light of the Gospell be brought to the
tryal of their ministrie &amp; ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though nothing be said to them,
but they only put to approue themselues by Gods worde, you shall see

being ful of poore persecuted christians in great distresse and miserie,

               <p>IT now remayneth that we take like sodaine viewe of the third sorte,
the <hi>seruile</hi> ministrie of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> namely these <hi>Parsons, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cares,
Curates, Hirelings, Preachers, Deacons.</hi> These were blamed to Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> to

                  <hi>Names</hi> &amp; <hi>Offices,</hi> also to haue as strange &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
an entrance vnto their office &amp; administration in their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
as also that their support &amp; maintenance is not such, as belongeth
to the ministrie of the Gospell. In these poinctes we desired Mr. G. to
approoue the ministrie of <hi>Eng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>and,</hi> or his owne ministrie by the rules of
CHRISTS Testament. This if he had donne, al controuersie had ceased,
and we yeilded. Al this by his owne bare worde of affirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; neuer
a place of scripture, he proueth in lesse then one page of his booke.
He affirmeth their names to be Ministers of the Gospell, <hi>Pastors,</hi> and
<hi>Teachers.</hi> That the names of <hi>Parsons &amp; Vicares</hi> are not to make any distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4716:74"/>
of the ministrie, but of the maintenance annexed to the same.
That the <hi>Offices</hi> they beare, are to teach &amp; instruct their flockes by the
wholesome worde of God, to administer the sacramentes, and to make
publick prayers. These he is sure are prescribed in CHRISTES Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and if our eye were not malignant we might espie them there.</p>
               <p>THAT these names &amp; offices of <hi>Pastor</hi> &amp; <hi>Teacher,</hi> with this administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
spoken of, are in CHRISTS Testament, we neuer doubted or

carie, trulie haue, and execute the names, offfices, and functions
of these christian <hi>Pastors &amp; Teachers,</hi> all the doubt is. And more then
Mr. GIFFARD his bare worde, we as yet haue not to assure vs therof: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we haue even with importunitie begged and vrged him, or
any of his fellowes, either directly to approue their ministrie by the
rules of CHRISTS Testament in their <hi>Office Entrance</hi> and <hi>Administration:</hi> Or
ells to prooue vnto vs by the worde of God that such <hi>Offices, Entrance</hi> vnto
and <hi>Administration</hi> in their offices, is not now necessarie and of necessitie
in the Church of CHRIST: but that the Prince (whose honorable name
they ouer much abuse to the patronizing of all their abhominations)
or rather the POPE (to whose kingdome this antichristian ministrie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
hath power to erect a newe &amp; other ministrie in office, entrance,
and administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the Church, then that of <hi>Christes</hi> Testament. In
al which if this ministrie of <hi>England</hi> cannot by th'expresse rules of the
word be iustified, al the powers in earth or Hel cannot make them the
true Ministers of the Gospel. For other ministrie &amp; offices of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel
is not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the Church, then those CHRIST hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in his Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Neither may any other <hi>Entrance</hi> or <hi>Administration</hi>
be ioyned to that <hi>Ministrie</hi> &amp; those offices, then is in CHRISTS Testament
appoynted. If therfore we shew that these Ministers haue not those of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
that entrance, or administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mentioned in <hi>Christes</hi> Testament, it
shal be enough to shew them conterfeite, strange, and antichristian.</p>
               <p>First then by Mr. <hi>Giff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> his leaue, we must a litle insiste euen vpon these
strange names of <hi>Parson &amp; Vicare,</hi> which were giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their first founders
&amp; creators at the erection of their ministrie &amp; offices, and are not read
of in all the booke of God: Neither are any of those names which our
Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> hath giuen &amp; knyt vnto his ministrie, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; expressing of their seueral offices, and therfore ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at no hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
vnto the ministri of the Gospel. Neither may any mortal man be
so presumptions to giue other names &amp; denominations vnto his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
ministrie &amp; holie offices, then the Lord of the house himself hath
giuen. Neither may or will the true Ministers of <hi>Christ</hi> carye any other
names or titles (as in regarde of their ministri or office) then <hi>Christ</hi> hath
giuen to their ministrie &amp; office. But Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> denieth these names to
make any distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ministri, but only of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> state of maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
annexed vnto the same. Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aske him one question; what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is there betwixt the <hi>Arch and Lord Bishops,</hi> and the parish <hi>Parsons and
Vicares</hi> of the Church of ENGLAND in respect of their ministrie, if these
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4716:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
names be not giuen to put difference betwixt, and distinction of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
office &amp; ministrie? I trust he will not say these Lord Bishops &amp; Parsons
haue al one office &amp; ministrie in their Church. I belieue his Ordinarie
wil hardly agree to him in this poynte. Let him finde therfore a newe
distinction to help this matter. Againe, we could say to M. <hi>Giffard,</hi> that
these names of <hi>Parsons</hi> and <hi>Vicares</hi> do not only distinguish their ministrie
from their Lord Bishops Arch-Deacons, Deanes &amp;c, but yet maketh a
distinction euen amongst themselues, betwixt them &amp; such of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rouing Ministers, which haue no certaine flocke or chardge, but
as sone as they are made Ministers vnto and of any one certaine flock,
then take they forthwith their denominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that flocke or towne, as
the Bishops doe of the greate Cities, and are then &amp; not before called
Parsons or Vicares of such a Towne. To conclude, these names of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
&amp; Vicare being distinct names, and hauing distinct liuings appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
vnto them, belonging also to one &amp; the same church or Towne,
and being giuen to two diuers men &amp; so possessed at one and the same
tyme, cannot but belong to two diuers offices of their Church, Except
two me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may also haue &amp; execute one &amp; the same office at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
as wel as one man may execute two or moe diuers offices of their
Church at one instant. But sure these <hi>Paradoxes</hi> are so inaudible &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
yea so impossible in the Church of CHRIST, as I see not how
all Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> his logique and learning can reconcile them to the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>But to come to the offices of these <hi>Parsons &amp; Vicares,</hi> Mr. <hi>Giff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> saith (if we
may belieue him) they are <hi>Pastors &amp; Teachers,</hi> yet setteth vs not downe
who be the Pastors, &amp; who be the Teachers of their Church. It should
seeme by his speach that these two, the <hi>Parson</hi> and <hi>Vicare,</hi> are one office,
namely, <hi>Pastors,</hi> and that such hireling Predicantes as himself are the
Teachers of this Church of <hi>England.</hi> Let vs first consider of their <hi>Pastors,</hi>
by comparing them to the <hi>Pastors</hi> office. The true christian Pastor is
placed of God in his house his church,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 7.</note> as a Steward both to diuide the

doth not add more power, but more helpe and seruice to the

when the true ministrie ceased, as in the generall apostasie, they could
neuer againe be recouered in the Church: because they cannot haue
this ordination of true christian <hi>Elders,</hi> and so must the ministrie, sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

daies were ordayned. Other <hi>Elders</hi> then of the Popish Churche there
were not then to be founde. Now these are sure groundes that cannot
be doubted of. The true ministrie of <hi>Christ</hi> doth not belonge vnto, and
may execute no ministrie in the false Churche. Neither yet hath the
execrable ministrie of the false Church anie thing to doe to ordaine
the true ministrie of CHRISTES Churche, neither is their <hi>Ordination</hi>
auaileable. If then the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> and the ministrie therof were
false and antichristian, then cannot the ministrie of these men which
was then in that estate giuen and receiued, be esteamed the true minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of CHRIST belonging to his Church. But now if they hold the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the true Churche, and her <hi>Elders</hi> true Ministers of <hi>Christ,</hi>
then is it vtterly vnlawfull to with-drawe, depart, or separate from the
true Church at anie tyme: And then were al these, and are al they in a
most deadlie schisme: Mr. <hi>Caluins</hi> distinction, that he separated from
the corruptions of the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not from the Churche of
<hi>Rome,</hi> wil not here stand. For therby they confesse the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi>
the true Church, and that they for the corruptions of the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte.
Which corruptions if they be not such and so incurable as to
make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no Churche, then is it not lawfull for anie
such corruptions to depart from, and to forsake the true Church, and
then are they all stil in schisme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by their owne doctrine, and so no true
Ministers. This I haue thus lardglie written of the true <hi>Election</hi> and
<hi>Ordination</hi> of Ministers, because I finde so great ignorance and error
amongst the <hi>Diuines</hi> of the Churche of ENGLAND therin. Some of
them (as the most reformed) that seeme to seeke CHRISTES <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi>

or looked after in this busines, except they be so euill beloued as some
come to crye shame of them at that verie tyme: Which if they doe, yet
must the matters be too badd and broade, that wilbe receiued there.
And as to this probation that is there made, it is but to know whether
they haue the latine tongue, and how they can construe some sentence
of some aucthor. If they be not prompt they shall be holpen, or haue
more easie questions, or tyme giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, if so be they haue anie fauour
with Mr. Examiners, they are verie meane clarkes which are there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
or sent away if they bring money in their purse, without which
there is no ministrie to be had in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Such other as
yet cannot endure this seuere tryal, hauing only their mother tongue,
are to resorte to their Lord Bishop at his house more secretly; where if
they can make anie frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto him, they shal not misse of their desire;
for the Bishop maie, or at least doth make Ministers, aswel privatlie in
his owne house, as publickly at this sollemne tyme &amp; place. But these
approued, they are brought arayed in their white Ministeriall vesture,
vnto the Bishops chayre, where he solemnelie sitteth in his <hi>pontificalibus.</hi>
At whose feete these Ministers that woulde be, are caused to kneele
downe; where hauing certaine articles read vnto them, vnto which
they are sworne &amp; subscribe, then are they by the Bishops owne mouth
made and pronounced Ministers, vzt. <hi>Deacons,</hi> certaine chapters of the
Bible enioyned them as a taske to reade euerie daye, as also certaine
bookes to studie dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly: his orders also with the Bishops great seale
at them in a Boxe, are deliuered them; for which they must paye full
sweetlie. Thus is he made half Priest, to reade the booke and serue a
<hi>Cure,</hi> but not to enterprise to preach without the Bishops special licence
written, sealed, and wel paied for, thervnto: neither may he adminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the sacraments, vntil he haue his ful orders, and be made ful Priest.
Yet nowe is he a fit <hi>Curate</hi> for anie parish, a fit <hi>Clarke</hi> for anie benefice,
come by yt where he can, For here is he made Minister of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> in general, without certaine flock or chardge, and is sent into
the wide worlde with his licence to geat him a liuing where he may.
Wherbie sondrie of them (by reason of the multitudes that are dailie
made) are driuen to make verie harde shifte, to teach young children,
or to become house-Priests (I meane not nowe Chaplains, for they are
rufflers) for verie meane wage. Yet must I needes saye, the Bishop ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
an especiall care to preuent this, for he hath certaine of their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
friendes to be bounde I thincke, or ells to testifie, that they haue

               <p>Wel, being nowe stepped into the ministrie, it is not longe for the

where he must be inducted, an other Priest deliuering him the

hath a bell-rope put into his hand, and must knole a Bell: After which
a peale is ronge, and he caried to some feaste-house or other, insteade

may not be seuered from the ministrie of the Gospell, then haue they

               <p>And now whether we haue lyed (as Mr. GIF. verie boldly chardgeth

cometh to the parish, taketh possession of the Parsonage, and theire
Minister he will be, whether the people will or not; they must receiue
him, and may not keep him out, how bad soeuer he be. And whereas
Mr. GIFF. bringeth instance to prooue that the ministrie is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
because that sondrie flockes haue those <hi>Pastors &amp; Ministers</hi> of the
Gospel that they haue desired and made choice of by sute vnto the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones,</hi>

shal neuer be able to shew that any christian Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did or might
doe. And to the choice he speaketh of, I weene they were Ministers,
yea Pastors, before they chose them; And being so, they then by the
rules of CHRISTS Testament ought to belonge vnto some certaine and
peculiar flockes; which if they do, how then may they chuse the Pastor
of an other flocke to make him their Pastor? what kinde of choice will
M. <hi>Giff.</hi> make his? whilest he goeth about to stop the gap, he maketh it
wider. But now to their chopping, chaunging, and leauing of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
at their owne pleasures as more gaynful are offred, without the

when they can proue that the Gospel may be in this maner vsed

them the true Ministers of <hi>Christ.</hi> But in the meane while because this
is impossible, and cannot without blasphemie be enterprised, without
sinne be thought; because also we finde vpon this present Ministrie of
theirs, euen al the markes of the false Prophet, that are written in the

except we wil with them condemne the truth of God, and call CHRIST
execrable.</p>
               <p>Neither yet is this their preaching (considered euen in yt self) set
apart from all the abuses and enormities aboue recited, such, as they
glorie of, abounding with such great learning, excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t giftes, and rare
graces of the spirit, or answearable to that heauenly exercise of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
in <hi>Christes</hi> Church. Of their education and learning euen from
the grammer schole to the pulpit, you haue alreadie hearde: as also
their Diuinity to be traditional, wholly deriued from other mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges
and books, both for the vnderstanding, diuiding, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of al scriptures, as also for all doctrines, questions, and doubtes
that arise, and not springing from the fountaine of Gods spirit in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
according to the measure of knowledge, faith, and grace giuen
them. So that these dumbe blinde guides and watchmen doe but see
with other mens eyes, but speake with other mens mouthes, and (as
one of their chief aucthors saith of them) without these bookes they
as are blinde as molles, as mute as fishes, not able of themselues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
open, and interprete almost anie scripture, Or to discusse, iudge,

when anie newe question vnwritten of before ariseth, they are either al

they speake, so manie opinions and sentences, as speakers. Yea euen
in the thinges they reade and teache (there being so great diuersitie &amp;

great difference &amp; contrarietie in their doctrines which they publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

of sondrie, yea almost all places of scripture, but euen in most

That they are but brotherly dissentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they agree in al <hi>fundamentall</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines.
A happie tourne it were, that those <hi>fundamental</hi> doctrines were

of these sinnes, any spirituall weapons, or ecclesiasticall censure in a

yea such and so many perticular tymes as they commit the same, who
then should nomber them? All these sinners and sinnes are in this

               <p>THE <hi>maintenance</hi> of the ministri of the Church of ENGLAND is of these
fower sortes 1. Either by lordly reuenues, with their royal rightes,
ciuill iurisdiction, Courtes baron, tenancies &amp;c, belonging thervnto.
2. Or by fees and pollages taysed &amp; rauened in their spiritual Courtes,
for iudging pleading, solliciting, writing, fetching vp, sommoning.
3. Or by gleabes and tithes. 4. Or ells by annual set stipendes.</p>
               <p>The first forte of these we haue alreadie shewed to belong to Princes,
to ciuile Lordes and persons, and to be vtterly vnlawful and forbidden
to the ministrie of CHRIST. Mr. G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ordinance of the Church, cannot mainteine them. Neither will that
worde <hi>Philoxenos,</hi> which they so lardgly stretch &amp; interpreat, carrie half
this pompe.</p>

                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:4716:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To the second sort we affirme these Courtes, Officers, Iudges, Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,
Proctors, Registers, Purseuantes, Sommoners, together with all
their functions, the orders of their Courtes, maner of iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
&amp;c, where all thinges are pleadable if not vendible for money,
where al causes euen the most foule, finde their aduocates, colours, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
delayes for mony &amp;c, Al these spiritual Courtes, officers, iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
pleadings, customes, we finde diuelish &amp; antichristian, and not
to appertaine to the Church &amp; kingdome of CHRIST, but to belong to
the kingdome &amp; throne of Antichrist, and of the Beaste. And therfore
may conclude that they are the reuenues of sinne, not to belong to the
ministrie of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>The third kinde, these tithes, we finde merely ceremoniall, to haue
bene ordayned for,<note place="margin">Nomb. 18.</note> and belonged vnto the Leuiticall ministerie vnder
the lawe. We finde them an inheritance of the Leuites: An offering of
the people: Therfore they cannot in this maner by lawe by tyed to the
ministrie of CHRIST, be made an inheritance vnto them, an offring of
the people vnto them. For if there be a chandge of the Priest-hoode,

the Church also (alleadged by Mr. G.) sheweth it ecclesiastical, for the
Church maketh no ciuile decrees, yt medleth not with th'execution of

&amp; decrees, we haue in the first parte of this booke spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Church
is bounde to the lawes of God, and may make or receiue none other
lawes then God hath made. <hi>Christ</hi> is the only Law-giuer &amp; Kinge of his
Church. Againe, this decree of the Church to ordaine y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the ministerie

to the wil, yea to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> being of <hi>Christ,</hi> in receiuing that lawe &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
which <hi>Christ</hi> hath abolished together with the Leuitical minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
And aswel might they reuiue the Leuitical ministrie, or any other

CHRIST hath abolished, be yt neuer so contrarie vnto him; yea and
to abrogate whatsoeuer <hi>Christ</hi> hath instituted, be it neuer so necessarie.
How bold the Church of <hi>England</hi> is in these thinges, in their tithes, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings,

To the set stipendes also and gleabes, I in like maner affirme them

Holding this proposition firme, that where CHRIST hath instituted
a maintenance for his Ministrie, the Church may not devise or receiue
anie newe or other lawes for the maintenance of their ministrie, then
CHRIST hath giuen. CHRIST then hath ordayned that they that
dresse the vineyard &amp; feed the flocke, should eate of the fruict of that
vineyarde and of the milke of that flocke, to which they attend. This
mainetenance in other places is set downe to be the free contribution

By this corrupt custome also sondrie intollerable inconueniences &amp;
grieuous mischieues doe ensue. This setting out land or certaine rates
by way of lawe or bargaine in euerie parrish or Congregation to the
Minister, doth hinder the Church from the choice &amp; vse of such other
Ministers as <hi>Christ</hi> in his Testament hath ordained to the gouernement
and seruice of his Church, the parrish or Congregation neither inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to haue more, neither indeed suffred to haue more, or by this
meanes able or willing to keep more. This setting out landes, tithes
&amp;c, to the Minister by way of lawe, doth alwaies presuppose of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a true established Church, and true Minister in those parrishes vnto
the worldes end: those landes and tithes being appropriate &amp; bounde
thervnto, and hauing none other owners. Which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth
those grosse popish errors of a personal and continuall succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Ministers, and local contynuance of a visible Churche. Againe
when this liuing is thus by lawe giuen to a Priest for terme of his life,
be he neuer so vnable, vnworthie, or negligent, the parrish is so long
bounde vnto him, and can by no meanes get rid of him. yea be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so bad, his faultes &amp; errors neuer so fowle, they cannot without or
vntil their Lord Bishop wil, geat rid of him, they must mainetaine him
and receiue his Ministry, whether they wil or no. Furder these annual
liuinges by lawe and set stipendes by rate, presuppose alwaies one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
and certaine estate both of the Parrishoners &amp; Ministers, The
one, euen euerie person euer to be able to pay so much, The other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to need more or lesse: Yea that alwaies to the worldes end all the
Parsons &amp; al the Parrishoners of that towne shal neuer need or be able
to giue more or lesse, whether the Lorde send scarcity of ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie, dearth

of these liuinges, the Parson of some one litle Hamblet where are not

to liue on, an other of a much greater towne not hauing twentie
poundes, yea peradventure ten poundes by yeere for that chardge he
hath to liue vpon: And this for euer without regarde of the needes or
laboure of them, it being alike to them &amp; their successors whosoeuer.
To conclude, the tithes &amp; set stipe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of these Parrish Priestes being of
the goods of the prophane, most wicked, and vngodly, euen of al their
parrish indifferently; yet are more odious &amp; vnmeet for anie christian
Ministers, who are not to stande hierdes to such dogges &amp; swine to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister

It was not lawfull for the Priest vnder the lawe to receiue the offring of
anie stranger from the faith, such might not enter into or offer in the
Temple. Neither nowe vnder the Gospel maie the vnbelieuing haue

               <p>NOwe let vs see what arguments Mr. GIFFARD after more then two
yeeres studie hath brought vs to approoue his ministrie by. He
told vs erewhile that they were true Ministers of the Gospel, Pastors &amp;
Teachers, had a true calling and ordination; Nowe come his proues.
<hi>The ministerie of the Gospell vvhich bringeth the vvorde of faith and reconciliation betwixt
God and the vvorld, is the true ministerie of CHRIST, for the Diuel and Antichrist ordaine
no such ministerie. Nowe the ministerie of the Church of England doth bring no vvorde nor
doctrine but the sacred Scriptures; yt preacheth faith in God through CHRIST, and the
doctrine of repentance, deliuering the holie Sacraments as seales to confirme the same. Let all
the schismaticks of the vvorlde barck &amp;c.</hi> I am lothe to take Mr. GIFF. in a
<hi>Parologisme</hi> at the first where reasons are so geason, lest hereafter we haue
no more, especially lest we haue more varyance about the forme then
about the matter in this, yet when he shall haue reduced it to right
forme, he shall then but haue begg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d that which we demanded, and
still looke that he should prooue. vzt. That their ministrie is the true
ministrie of the Gospell. This, because euerie true ministrie of the
Gospell is in some office, vnto which office there must needes be a true
and lawfull calling, therefore we desired him to prooue their ministrie
in the office, entrance, &amp;c, by the scriptures. Mr. GIFF. giuing vs his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:4716:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bare worde that they are <hi>Pastors &amp; Teachers,</hi> making no proofe thereof,
quite ouerskippeth their office and entrance, and prooueth them Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
because they doe administer. As if a priuate person should rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thus. I haue knowledge of the lawe, I administer true iustice and
iudgment, Therfore I am a true Iudge, a lawfull Magistrate. Doth he
thinck that this reason wil excuse this vsurper either before God or his
Prince? If he then wil haue anie better speede, let him prooue his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
directly and plainely by the scriptures, first in the office he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth,
then in his <hi>caling</hi> vnto his office, as al the Apostles and true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of CHRIST haue donne, and ought to doe. And then if he can
iustifie his administration and be founde faithfull, he shall haue praise
with God and man. Otherwise by this balcking and begging that he
should, and hath bene so often vrged to prooue, he but manifesteth his
weaknes and forgerie in those poynctes, and but to loseth as many of
these preposterous argumentes, as he bringeth. Yet that he be not too
far conceipted, or any other deceiued with this argument, against his
next booke, we giue him to wiete, That the second part of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a false and impudent assumption. The Church of ENGLAND
bringeth and emposeth an other worde and other ordinances then the
holie scriptures, as that deuised abhominable <hi>Leitourgie</hi> their idoll ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice-booke,
the rule and foundation, yea the verie matter &amp; substance
of their publick worship, and administration, their popish supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
ceremonies and trincketts, their vngodly and antichristian ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
ministrie, and gouernement. To all these abhominations they
ioyne, or rather subiect and abuse the, Gospell. And therfore preach
not faith in God nor CHRIST, neither the doctrines of repentance tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sincerely: but denie God in their workes and CHRIST in his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
They beare the yoke of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> drawe all the people vnto
them, souder them euen the most wicked &amp; impenitent in their sinne
and iniquitie, with their prayers, preaching, and sacramentes. Not
suffring any to forsake these seene sinnes and abhominations, or to
come vnto CHRIST, but drawing and holding all the land vnder the
wrath of God &amp;c.</p>
               <p>NExt he by the way maketh a learned apologie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dumbe Pastors
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> his bretheren, against whom if yt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
that their ministrie is not the ministrie of reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because
they cannot preach the Gospel; He here setteth downe a learned note
by way of two rare distinctions. We must first he saith distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the ministrie &amp; the Minister. The man may be of the Diuel, and
yet his ministrie of God. Then we must distinguish betwixt the <hi>function</hi>
yt self, and the execution of the same. As when the office is laide vpon
one that cannot preach, the <hi>function</hi> it self is entire, the defect only in the
execution therof; Therfore the ministrie of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is
the ministrie of the Gospell, though some doe not, and others cannot
preach. Sure this is so subtily contriued, as men of meane iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4716:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
capacitie shall neuer be able to perceiue how it is or may be brought
about. The first <hi>Distinction</hi> is graunted, so the sinne of the Minister be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,
or not such as disableth him to the ministrie. But what of this,
may any open, vnworthie, or insufficient person be a Minister? Or is
the ministrie of such a one good &amp; acceptable? Ther is no such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from hence to be gathered. To the second in like maner it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
not, because we may distinguish and put difference betwixt the
office yt self and the execution of the office, that therfore any office
of the Church may be giuen to anie open vnsufficient, or vnworthie
person; Or if yt be, that the ministrie of such a one is good or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable:
For the calling of the Church cannot enhable such open
insufficient to the ministrie, whom God refuseth, or make acceptable
that ministration, which God disaloweth. Nowe then these dumbe
Pastors that cannot preach, are apparantly insufficient and incapeable
of that office, therfore no calling of men can make them true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Ministers: And being no true or lawfull Ministers, their ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is then vnlawfull, accursed, abhominable to God &amp; men. These
then being allowed Ministers, and their ministration publiquely by
lawe approued, and receiued in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the publicke ministrie and ministration of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
to be vnlawfull, accursed, and abhominable thus far foorth, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Mr. <hi>Giffardes</hi> payre of distinctions. Otherwise, if he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to prooue the ministerie of the Gospell to be in yt self alwaies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
holie, and blessed, notwithstanding the infirmities &amp; faultes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
this all men will graunte, and needed not his learned distinctions to
prooue the same. But what is this to prooue the ministrie of these
dumbe Pastors, Or the other ministrie of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be
that ministerie of the Gospell: which we for all the reasons aboue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
confidently denie.</p>
               <p>HIs second reason. <hi>Such as haue the caling &amp; ordination of the Church, haue the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of CHRIST, For it is giuen to the Church to cal &amp; ordaine Ministers.</hi> In the
next sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his <hi>Minor</hi> followeth. <hi>In Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Ministers haue their caling &amp; ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Church of GOD, Therfore &amp;c.</hi> To the <hi>Maior</hi> he addeth a clause, that yt
may be a true caling notwithstanding some faultes of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <hi>or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;</hi>
So he vnderstand this <hi>otherwise</hi> to be of negligence, and not of anie
wilful &amp; obstinate transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: Or not any of those pere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptorie faultes
excepted by the holy Ghost, which disable the elect &amp; disanul the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
then we thus far assent. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we reason of the caling of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistri
of <hi>England,</hi> we speake not of a true caling, though vnperfect with
some faultes of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or negligence, but of a false counterfeit &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

caling, which we haue proued &amp; affirme theirs to be. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Church ought alwaies to be yt caling of <hi>Christ</hi> prescribed in
his Testament, which theirs is not. To his <hi>Minor</hi> now, first we denie the
Churche of <hi>England</hi> to be the true established Churche of <hi>Christ.</hi> He
prooueth it thus <hi>That people vvhich hath forsaken heresies and false vvorship, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4716:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
imbraced the doctrine of the Gospell hath in it the true Church vvhich hath the power.</hi>
Wee obserue much subtiltie and feare in this <hi>position.</hi> For whereas he
ought to haue affirmed <hi>Are the true Church, and haue the power,</hi> he fearefullie
&amp; subtilly saith <hi>hath in it the true Church, which hath the power,</hi> not daring to ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
or ioyne issue of their outward estate, but leauing himself a start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hole to flee to such secret ones as God may call and haue amongst
them. We doubt not but God hath in Turckye or Persia, yea in the
Church of ROME manie deare elect; but should we therfore say that
Turcky, Persia, Rome, are the true Church? We affirme also &amp; will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
against al the false Prophets of the world, that in this land the
Lord hath such a people that haue thus forsaken heresies &amp; false wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
embraced the Gospell, and haue this power of CHRIST. But we
denie this their Church to consist of this people, to haue forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
&amp; false worship, to haue truly embraced the Gospel, or to haue this
power of CHRIST, to elect, ordaine, exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, or to redresse anie
enormitie: but are dryuen to these antichristian Bishopps for al these.
Who receiue not power of the Church, but vsurpe and exercise abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
power ouer the Church, yea the whole power of the Church, as
hath bene shewed. Which is vnlawfull either for the Church to giue,
or for any true christian to receiue or execute. Neither can th'auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of anie mortall men or Parlament make that lawfull, which God
in his worde condemneth and forbiddeth. And so euen by this his
owne allegation, all this ministrie made by &amp; standing vnder this vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
inordinate antichristian power of the Bishopps, are also vnlawfull.
To which if we add the vnlawfulnes of the office these Ministers are
called vnto and execute, the vnlawfulnes of their calling in the whole
maner therof vnto, by, and in no flocke certaine, the vnlawfulnes of
the ordayners, as also of the ordayned, their open ambition, greedines,
and insufficientcy, their false maner of probation and ordination,
with all the vngodly and execrable ceremonies, vowes, othes, subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vsed to the same, none can mistake this caling and ordination of
the Ministers of ENGLAND, for that true &amp; holie election and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church of CHRIST: without which true caling there can be
no true Minister. No true Church may vse or can iustifie anie such
false caling as theirs. And so still we must leaue Mr. GIF. to proue the
office &amp; caling of his ministrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> THis Clarke procedeth to an other reason. <hi>That ministrie is of God, which is

They build not vpon but destroye the house of God, the bodie of

to their face, and sheweth what maner of worckmen they are: where
we finde not one pinne, nayle, or hooke in due order and proportion
according to the true paterne. They feed not the Lordes sheepe but
the Lordes goates, and that not with wholesome foode, with sincere
milke, that they might growe and be encreased therby, as the generall
sinne, prophannes, and ignorance of al estates both Priestes and people
declare. Neither guide they in the way of godlines, but in the wayes of
destruction and calamitie. They haue al declined &amp; bene made toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of a true Ministrie, which as yet is not proued: Neither doth
this reason proue a Ministrie, so much as shew the infallible effectes of
true doctrine &amp; true preaching, whether it be by Ministers, or by other
faithful, which haue the gift of prophecie, knowledge, interpretation

might they aswel with the Papistes permit the worde of God only vnto

dayly, we dare affirme that others besides Ministers may conuert soules
and begeate faith. So then this argument <hi>of the effectes</hi> proueth not so
much a true ministry, as it doth proue true doctrine. For no false doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
can beget true faith, though manie which be no Ministers may
beget true faith. Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reasoneth verie corruptly &amp; deceiptfully
in attributing the conuertion of soules as proper &amp; peculiar to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie,
which is not so, and in bringing these effectes to proue a true
ministrie, which only are to proue true doctrine. And nowe to Mr. <hi>Gif.</hi>
his assumption. Wee denie that any false ministrie hath promise of
blessinge, or is sent of God for the conuertion of soules, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
we finde it accursed, and sent of God for the seducing of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.
The ministrie then of the Church of <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> being proued false
in Office, Entrance, and Administration, can haue no such promise
or blessing of God as Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> assumeth. If it be demaunded then
whether al vnder this ministrie be damned. I say it is a newe question,
and kept secret to the Lorde, who onlie knoweth who be his, when
&amp; how to call them. It becometh not vs to giue anie such finall iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of matters not knowen vnto vs: Yet this wee may be warrant of
the whole scripture saie, That the waies of the false Churche and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie
are the waies of death, and haue no promise of saluation. But
for the persons wee iudge charitablie, euen so longe and so far as wee
may, measuring them by our selues, as wee sometymes were, hoping
and not doubting, but God hath manie thousandes deare elect there,
yea euen in the Popish Churches, whom he in his due tyme by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
meanes wil cal. If Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> here insist &amp; say that many of those
thousandes are couerted by their ministrie, Therfore their ministrie
is not in the power of ANTICHRIST, or of the Diuel, but of God, hauing
that sure seale that worcke of the holie Ghost. We haue aboue answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that this rather approueth the doctrine then the ministrie, and is to
be attributed to the worde of God, rather then to the person of man.
Furder, that the false ministrie hath no promise of blessing. Yet doe
wee not herebie restraine the infinite power of God from sauinge or
calinge his elect euen by the doctrine of the false Churche: which
though it be so throughly leauened, corrupted, peruerted, abused, yet
can the Lorde bring the truth of his lawe and gospel which is there
read, and after their maner preached in such sorte, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

heathen, in the false Church amongst the false worshippers, by what
meanes yt pleaseth him: yet may not we herevpon either resorte vnto

his wil vnto vs is, that we alwaies obey and rest in his reueiled wil, and
not to presume vpon his infinite will and power, which he keepeth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

the execution of our Ministery is ioyned the effectual grace, power,

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:4716:89"/>
but indeed the true ministry of <hi>Christ.</hi> Ells al that haue liued thus
manie hundred yeeres before you in our Church, and knew not these
newe learninges you hold, are damned: Ells all that haue died in our
Church are damned: yea ells you must hold al the Kinges and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Nobles, Pieres, and people in our Church reprobates &amp;c. But let
vs come to your selues ye that are the aucthors of this Schisme. Where
had you your faith, your first knowledge of God and of <hi>Christ,</hi> if not in
this Church by our ministrie? we haue the true scriptures amongst vs,
we teache truly concerning the Godhead and the thee persons therof,
God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the Holy Ghost, though dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
in persons, yet one God &amp;c: We preach <hi>Christ</hi> in his two natures
verie God and verie man. That he came into the world for the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of al mankinde. <hi>That God so loued the world that he gaue his only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sonne,
that whosoeuer belieueth in him should not perish, but haue life euerlasting.</hi> Wee preach
<hi>Christ</hi> crucified for our sinnes, dead, buried, risen againe, ascended, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
We preach him in his three offices to be our <hi>King, Priest,</hi> and <hi>Prophet:</hi>
Wee preach al the <hi>fundamental</hi> articles of our christian faith; and as wee
preach, so you belieue al these. Yea and we appeale to your conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whether you haue founde ioy and comfort in your owne soules at
the preaching of these doctrines. Againe, we preach the lawes of God
in the tables, and beate downe such sinnes as wee see to be contrarie to
the same, in such sort as manie are drawen to repentance, to hatred,
sorrowe, and remorce for sinne: And these againe wee raise vp with
comfort and hope of forgiuenes, and with the promises of eternal life.
These things if ye schismaticks feele not, yet vnto many others which
by our preaching are converted vnto the Lorde indeed, which vnto
feare &amp; trembling doe feele the power &amp; sweetnes of the liuely worde,
we may say as the Apostle vnto the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in like case. If I be not an
Apostle vnto others yet ame I one vnto you, ye are the seale of mine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleship
in the Lord. And as for you <hi>Lutherans,</hi> if you contynue not,
that is not our default, if you fal from grace. It is enough for vs that
you haue felt this maiestie of the worde, and it sufficeth to proue our
ministrie that the power of the holy Ghost goeth with y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, when men
haue bene so moued, though they contynue not, seeing the reprobate
may feele this power and taste this sweetnes for a tyme. Now then our
ministry being thus proued by the law and the Gospel, and by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the holy Ghost in these powerful effectes, How can you thus
separate from the meanes of your saluation, from that ministry which
hath begotten in you, or at least doth begeat in others this knowledge,
faith, comfort, &amp;c? Our ministrie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being thus proued, our Church
must needes followe, for a true ministrie doth not belong, neither is at
anie time founde in a false Church. Yea you must graunt that whilest
we hold the true foundation, wee are the true Church, though we erre
in matters of circumstance &amp; other doctrines, as you thincke: yet that
taketh not away our beeing of a Church. The <hi>Churches at Corinth, Gallatia,
Asia</hi> abounded with many faults, errors, corruptions, as we reade, yet are
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:4716:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
saluted by the Apostles, recorded by the holy Ghost as true Churches.
Now that we hold the foundation, our confession of the articles of our
christian faith, the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes, the Lordes prayer, &amp;c. (which
you also confesse and vse) shewe. Therfore whilest you depart from
vs, you depart from the true Church. Herevpon they might also vse
those rethoricall flowers of Mr. GIFFARD his diuinitie to rayle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
and invaye. That they are ranck <hi>Donatistes, Lutherans,</hi> ignorant,
furious, franctick, schismatickes, yea damnable heretickes, forsaking
the ministerie and truth of God, condemning the Church of God,
bringing the holie ministerie thereof into contempt, and so bring in
flat atheisme, barbarisme, rebellion against Magistrates &amp;c. Howe
thincketh Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> would not these argumentes fit the, Papistes aswell
against them, as they do him against vs? Is he not driuen to hard shift,
when he must borrowe weapons of them to defend himself, his
Church, ministrie, worship, gouernment? They must needes stand
fast when they are built vppon their groundes. Let him then first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
the <hi>Papistes</hi> to these reasons, before he bring them against vs, and
then if he be not satisfied he shall heare what we can say to them. For
sure if they be not of force to bring them home againe to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of ROME, they wil neuer perswade vs to goe backe to them. In
the meane time Mr. <hi>Gif.</hi> we signifie vnto you concerning this reason
which you vrge and dilate, That it is a ground of <hi>Anabaptistrie</hi> to iustifie
open transgression by inwarde motions. It is a grounde of <hi>Atheisme</hi> to
pleade for or tollerate sinne, because of such good effectes as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to procede therof.</p>
               <p>Mr. GIFFARD his next argument is drawen from our confession.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  <hi>VVe confesse that they vvere blessed Martyres that suffred in Q.</hi> MARIES <hi>daies. But

other last before, and is built vpon the same popish and <hi>Anabaptistical</hi>
grounds. Touching the persons of these Martyres, we haue alreadie in
our first replie vnto your answeare, set downe our christian opinion
and iudgment. Yet can this argument of their persons no more iustifie
this antichristian ministrie of Lord Bishops, parrish Parsons, mercea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie

The forgerie of their whole administration, preaching, worship, sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
is furder discovered, then these winde-shaken fig-leaues can
hide the shame therof. The truth is, howsoeuer the Lord doth reserue

his first answeare (whilest he stoode of the <hi>Reformistes</hi> side a sutor for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>)
durst neither for shame denie, not yet for feare affirme, he
sought by mouing, and after his maner prouing, a newe question, to
obscure and tourne away, at the least (vntil he sawe furder howe the
tymes would goe) to shift off the present <hi>proposition,</hi> that pressed so sore,
with such ambiguous doubtful delphicke words &amp; speaches, as might
be interpreted in what sense himself list, And he salfly tourne to that
side that were likest to preuaile &amp; carrie the creadit in the world. First
by way of <hi>Supposition</hi> and <hi>Admission,</hi> in these wordes. <hi>If it were admitted that
there is some yoke of antichristian gouernement, Vnder which the poore Church may groane, is

                  </gap>ce and turne to which side he would.
As wel might he from hence haue stoode of the <hi>Reformistes</hi> faction, by
saying that he neuer sought to plead for, or to defend this gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of these Prelates (but euen in these wordes he doth affirme and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
yt to be a yoke of antichristian gouernement, a bondage, an
oppression of the Church &amp;c.) As now being reuoulted to the <hi>Pontifical</hi>
side, he saith, he did but propounde it by way of question, supposition,
admission. For the present gouernment, he holdeth yt the true &amp; very
gouernment of <hi>Christ</hi> in substance &amp; matter, howsoeuer yt haue not the
same forme, and be not executed in that maner which <hi>Christ</hi> hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed;
Of which <hi>forme</hi> there is great question, whether it be permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
or variable; Neither wil he meddle with the discussing therof, because
he wil displease neither side. But this he held, and holdeth, That the
true Church may be oppressed and remaine vnder some yoke of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. That it is the lot of the Church to be oppressed
with outward bondage, to be made to keep the vineyarde which is not
her owne, to be beaten of the watch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Gif.</hi> was answered vnto
these, That there is great difference betwixt ciuile bondage, and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
bondage: Betwixt outward oppression or persecution, and
an antichristian yoke or gouernment. That the Church had beene or
might be in ciuile bondage vnto, outwardly oppressed and persecuted
by either ciuile magistrates, as Pharao, Nebuchadnezzar &amp;c, Or by
false ecclesiastical Ministers, proud antichristian vsurpers, as <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

willinglie suffred and wittinglie borne, and yet remayne the Church
of CHRIST. and this by sondrie places of scripture he endeuoreth
to proue.</p>
               <p>First vnto his distinction or diuision of an antichristian yoke into
straight and lardge, outward and inwarde, we acknowledge yt without
the compasse of our reading, or vnderstanding. Wee stil affirme that
no yoke or gouernement but only <hi>Christes,</hi> may be borne or receiued of
the true Church. We furder saye, and already haue proued, that al the
lawes and ordinances of <hi>Christes</hi> Testament (howe outwardly and smale
soeuer they may seeme) concerne the conscience: and that the wilfull
omission and transgression therof, bondeth both bodie and soule vnto
iudgment, without repentance. So likewise we hold, that euerie anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
yoke chardgeth and bindeth the conscience, both bodie and
soule, It being opposite vnto, and a transgression of CHRISTES lawes
and ordinances. And therfore wonder how these <hi>Academical diuines</hi> these
pleaders for iniquitie d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re hatch vs these poysoned distinctions, of
lardg and straight <hi>antichristian</hi> yokes, the one binding, the other not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the conscience. Except they can shewe Gods lawe. Or ells
some transgression of Gods lawe that bindeth and chardgeth not the
conscience. Vntil Mr. <hi>Gif.</hi> can doe this, he must giue vs leaue not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
his curious distinction of lardge and straight yoke, outward and
inward. Wee thincke also his reason somewhat hardlie constrayned,
when he concludeth, because <hi>Antichrists</hi> yoke is spiritual, Therfore
onlie inwarde. Wee call yt spirituall because yt commeth (as also
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:4716:93"/>
                  <hi>Antichrist</hi> himself doth) by the effectual worcking of <hi>Sathan:</hi> As also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is wholly about spiritual and ecclesiastical actions and proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
But shal we therfore say yt is onlie inwarde? Might not by these
reasons the whole visible Church yt self, al the publicke ministration,
actions, and ordinances therof, as also euerie person &amp; member therof
be said only inward, because they are al said spiritual? Againe it semeth
that Mr. G. litle vnderstandeth what an Antichristian yoke is, that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
euerie sinne and disorder arising in the Church, an antichristian
yoke. We confesse the Church may transgresse of negligence or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
yea &amp; so suffer such vngodlie presumptuous persons &amp; Ministers
to abuse their power for a ceason; yet this is not willingly to beare, or
wittingly to receiue anie antichristian yoke; neither cease they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
to be true Churches, whilest they despise not admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither
refuse to repent being reproued. Yet this we saie, the Church greatlie
sinneth in suffring such presumptuous inordinate persons, whom they
ought to cast out. And if so be the Church either want wil, and refuse
to cast them out being admonished; or want power and be not able to
cast them out being discouered, but it brought in subiection &amp; remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage to these guides, yt ceaseth in this estate vnto our iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be the true Church of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And nowe to the scriptures Mr. G. bringeth, that the true Church
may wittingly and willinglie be brought into bondage of some anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
yoke <hi>Ezech. 34. Ierem. 5. 31. Ier. 20. 1. Ioh. 7. 13. Iohn.</hi> 9. 22. First wee
say, that these Ministers were by office and caling true Ministers of the
Temple, but their Ministers by office and calling are not, and so no
comparison. Then we say, that these were now so wholly degenerate
and apostatate in <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> and <hi>Zedechiahs</hi> tymes, and the whole state so
corrupted and fallen from God into most execrable idolatries, as they
were not to be held the true Churches of God, but were pronownced
by the holy Ghost whores, murtherers, idolaters, so commanded to be
iudged, esteamed, and forsaken of al the faithful: As euerie where in
those prophecies of <hi>Ezechiel &amp; Ieremiah</hi> appeareth, &amp; we haue lardglie in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> SECOND PRINCIPAL TRANSGRESSION proued, And himself in that
estate confessed, that they ought to be abandoned by the godlie. For
the generall estate in the time of our Sauiour CHRISTS Ministrie
and suffringes, wee haue also proued, that they were that malignant
persecuting Church, which did excommunicate CHRIST and al that
confessed and belieued in him: from whom our Sauiour and his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
separated.</p>
               <p>And now to the place of the third epistle of <hi>Iohn. I vvrote to the Church, but
of them Diotrephes louing the primacie receiueth vs not. For this if I come, I vvil bring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
the vvorkes vvhich he doeth, prating against vs vvith malitious vvordes, and not
content in these, neither himself receiueth the brethere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and them that vvold he forbiddeth, and
casteth them out of the Church.</hi> These verses I haue thus englished to the
worde, because me thinckes the vsuall translation (though in yt selfe
not euil) seemeth a litle too much to nourish some false collections,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:4716:93"/>
which neither the wordes nor circumstance of the text wil beare. But
now what wil Mr. G. gather or conclude from this place? <hi>Diotrephes</hi> he
saith abused the power of gouernment ambitiouslie. If he meane the
power of the whole Church, the power of communication, it would
be shewed and proued wherein. If he say, in that he cast the bretheren
out of the Church, We would first knowe of him what bretheren the
Apostle there speaketh of, whether those stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, or such members of
that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation as were willing to receiue those stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, and whether
they were caste out by waye of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication. If he say those mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that were willing &amp;c, we affirme the whole context, the argument
of the Epistle precedent, the faultes of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> reckoned vp, &amp; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
subseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to shew the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, that he meaneth of the other
godlie strangers, <hi>Gaius</hi> in the premises being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for interraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those strangers. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> here blamed for these faultes, Of an
ambitious humor louing &amp; aspiring to be chief or first, and could not
endure to be vnder the Apostles. 1. Therfore he receiued not the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
letter, 2. He pratled against them with euil wordes, 3. neither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
receiued these stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, 4. But forbad them that would, 5. And so
kept or caste them out of the Church. The admonition was, that they
should not imitate euil, but good &amp;c. Manie reasons might be drawen
from these circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances, from sondrie wordes in the original, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by the right diuiding of these two verses it wil appeare, not to be
meant of the abuse of anie censure of the Church, of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication.
As also by the exhortation drawen from these faultes. For how could
<hi>Gaius</hi> or anie other of the Church imitate him in this, when there was
no more Pastors of that congregation but <hi>Diotrephes</hi> (if he were a Pastor
as they suppose) and by their rule onlie the Pastor maie exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate?
But what now if it were admitted (which can neuer by this scripture be
proued) that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did both vsurpe &amp; abuse the power and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, what wil Mr. G. collect and enforce from hence?
First that this tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous oppression did not make them to be no longer
<hi>Christes</hi> Church which remayned vnder him. Wel, and what wil, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
hereupon, That these Parishes which wittinglie remaine in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
vnder the yoke of these popish Prelates, which receiue this false
antichristian ministrie, this popish idolatrous worship &amp; ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces &amp;c.
are the true Churches of <hi>Christ?</hi> As ther is no consimilitude (except in
this one poincte of euil, wherin yet these Parishes far exceed) so is ther
no consequent or comparison betwixt a Church &amp; no Church, a true
Church &amp; ministrie, and a false Church &amp; ministrie. Neither haue we
a better argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in al Mr. G. his booke to approue the ministrie &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedings
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most odious sinnes &amp; faultes
of other Churches; which were not recorded by the holy Ghoste for vs
to imitate or to pleade for sinne by, so much as left for examples, and as
yt were lande markes, to flee sinne by. Againe this Church here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned
not wilfullie vnder this tyrannie of <hi>Diotrephes;</hi> They neuer had
bene reproued and admonished, therfore. Howsoeuer we iustifie not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:4716:94"/>
or tollerate the least sinne that God condemneth in his worde, yet we
make not anie sinne, vntil impenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie and obstinacie be ioyned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
to disanul and breake the Couenant with God. Neither doe we
make euerie inordinate and presumptuous part (when the Ministers
of the Church extend themselues beyonde their lyne and the limites
of their office) straight waye an antichristian yoke, if they be not seene
or repressed at the first. For as it is said, both the Church and Ministers
may sinne in such thinges and transgresse the rule of ignorance or of
negligence. And so what wil this example helpe their Church, which
standeth wilfullie and wittinglie in seene bondage vnto these anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Prelates? But Mr. G. saith the Apostle did not will the faithful
to separate themselues, or not anie longer to obeye <hi>Diotrephes</hi> in anie
thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wel, and euen this his owne fonde collection doth shewe, that
<hi>Diotrephes</hi> sinne was neither so preiudicial, heynouse, or publicklie
knowen to the Church, as he would make yt. For if <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had
either vsurped the whole power, or abused the publique gouernment
of the Church so far, as to caste out of his owne sole aucthoritie in his
owne name what bretheren he luste, yea those of the most vertuous
and charitable, he had not to haue bene suffred in the Church, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
to haue remayned a Minister with such publicke heynouse sinnes
vpon him. This had bene contrarie to the lawes and rules of <hi>Christes</hi>
Testament, to the practize and procedings of the other Apostles, to the
safetie of the Church. To al which it is not credible or audible, that
this Apostle would be so contrarie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither may it be inferred from this
place without grieuous peruerting the scriptures, and iniurie to the
holy Ghost. If <hi>Diotrephes</hi> fault had bene in this nature so heynouse and
publick, what needed the Apostle to say: <hi>If I come I will declare or bring his
worckes to remembrance,</hi> the Greeke worde is hupomneso. <hi>submonebo. I will
submonish.</hi> Againe, the begining of the. 10. <hi>verse,</hi> Dia touto. <hi>propter hoc for this.</hi>
sheweth an other cause, an other mattter, an other fault. Mr. <hi>Giffardes</hi>
other place. <hi>Iohn 16. v.</hi> 2. serueth his tourne as euil. <hi>They shal caste you out of
their Synagogues, yea the hower cometh that euerie one that killeth you shal thinck he doth</hi>
GOD <hi>good seruice.</hi> It is strange that Mr. G. should thincke and vse this as
spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the true Church, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the verie next verse hath these wordes.
<hi>And these thinges they wil doe vnto you, because they haue not knowen the Father nor me.</hi>
I hope these are no marckes of the true Church, not to knowe God
nor <hi>Christ,</hi> or to vse such barbarous hostilitie towardes the disciples and
faithful seruantes of <hi>Christ.</hi> If then these marckes, this tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous vsage,
&amp; the bloode of the Sainctes be founde vpon the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
they shal by this glasse and place descrie her to be the malignant perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
<hi>Synagogue,</hi> and not that persecuted Church consisting of <hi>Christes</hi>
true disciples and faithful seruants &amp; witnesses. As to his other shote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancker

transgression for answeare, which place and argument he shal there
find lardglie handled and discussed.</p>
               <p>IN the next poincte Mr. G. in his bad conscience finding the litle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
from ciuile to antichristian bondage, quite forgeteth, forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
&amp; tourned the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, And would now make vs or at least make
others belieue that we hold that the Church maie be in no outwarde
bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage. wheras we hold yt may not beare <hi>Antichristes</hi> yoke, or be brought
into anie antichristian bondage. Hauing fullie set downe this opinion
as ours, he pronounceth vs. <hi>Anabaptistes,</hi> and wondreth how so prowde a
spirit could be in rotten flesh, so flatlie to contradict the spirit of God
in these places <hi>Genes. 15. Exod.</hi> 20. and al the places of the Prophets, where
the Lorde threatneth that they should be ledd into <hi>Babilon,</hi> &amp; be there
in bondage. To take awaye his wonder though not his follie, We giue
him againe and againe to vnderstand, That we neuer denied but that
the Church might be in ciuile bondage, in bodilie oppression, but
neuer might be brought into anie antichristian bondage, either lardge
or straight, outward or inwarde, as he distinguisheth. And therfore
willed him to put difference betwixt ciuile and antichristian bondage,
betwixt bodilie oppression, persecution &amp;c, and anie ecclesiastical an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
yoke. Wee acknowledge the Church to haue bene in ciuile
bondage, in great persecution and bodilie oppression in <hi>Egipt</hi> &amp; <hi>Babilon;</hi>
But that they were there in anie ecclesiastical bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage, or receiued anie
antichristian yoke, we vtterlie denie. And demande of Mr. G. where
he can shew that anie of that faithful there bowed downe to their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries,
receiued anie newe lawes and ordinances at those tyrantes for
the worship of God, the administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church;
Or if he can shew that anie did thus, whether those persons were by the
worde of God to be esteamed members of the Church? And as to the
place by him alleadged. 1 <hi>Corinth. 7. 21. 22. Art thou caled a bond seruant care not

that difference which we are driuen so often to inculcate vnto him
betwixt ciuile and antichristian bondage, The one here shewed to be
an holie estate and calling, no preiudize to the kingdome of God, or
to the libertie of the Sainctes, The other in al those places aboue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to be contrarie to the kingdome of CHRIST, to our christian
libertie and faith, to be intollerable, and not to be borne or suffred of
the Church, or anie member of CHRIST. In as much as <hi>Antichrist</hi> is an
aduersarie, an opposite and lawlesse fellowe, that lifteth himself vp not
onlie against, but aboue God, shewing himself that he is God, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.

immediatlie. <hi>Here is the patience of the Sainctes, here they that keep the commandements,
of</hi> GOD <hi>and faith of</hi> IESVS. Wherevpon we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that no antichris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
yoke, not euen in the least things is to be borne or suffred in <hi>Christes</hi>
Church by waye of subiection not for the space of one hower, But all
thinges rather to be vndergonne, then to stoope downe to the Beast to
beare his marcke, or worship his image.</p>
               <p>BY this tyme Mr. <hi>Gif.</hi> hauing shot off al his newe ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to litle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
retireth himself againe to his old skonce, &amp; wil by no meanes
be driuen from his two places of the <hi>Songe.</hi> Wherbie (when he before
so missed to proue the Church in anie antichristian bondage) he nowe
letteth that matter fal, and bringeth these places to proue the Church
to stand in outwarde bondage. Which doctrine thoughe it was neuer
by vs denied, but that the Church might be in ciuile &amp; bodily bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage,
yet wee affirme nothing lesse to be proued by these places. In the first
vvee hope Mr. G. wil not be so grosse to take those vineyardes for locall
vineyardes,<note place="margin">Cant. 1.</note> and that setting or putting to keepe them, for ciuile or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie
bondage. for besides that nothing could be more grosse or diuers
from that heauenlie spirituall argument of <hi>Salomon</hi> in that songe, Soe
would CHRIST neuer wil the Church or anie member of the Church,
to shake off anie lawfull or ciuile yoke in that maner, to depart from
their earthlie Lords &amp; Masters, to refuse such lawfull seruice &amp; honest
labour as they shoulde enioyne them. Likewise to the seconde place
There may great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be put betwixt bondage,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.</note> and persecution or
oppression. That the Church there was in grieuous persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
but that yt was in anie bondage we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not by that text or anie cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
therof perceiue. Thus Mr. G. euerie way misseth his marcke,
and as a giddye droncken man he reeleth from one side to the other.
Sometimes endeuouring by these places to proue the Church in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to some antichristian yoke, yet not daring to affirme those vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes
(which her mothers sonnes put her to keepe) to be <hi>Antichristes</hi>
vineyardes, which if affirme and proue not, there is no antichristian
yoke to be dreamed on in that place, al the strength of his reason or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delusion lijng in these wordes <hi>The Sonnes of my Mother vvere incensed
against me, they set me the keper of the vineyardes, mie vineyarde that to me I kept not.</hi> The
true interpretation whereof it here booteth not to stande vpon, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
that no antichristian yoke or bondage can from this place, or
from anie one worde therof be drawen and inforced. But yet Mr. G.
doth herein presse vs vvith these places of the songe, in that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
did not here separate themselues from vnder these euil pastors
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4716:95"/>
and gouernours, as herestickes and schismatickes doe. And this he
againe proueth by th' example of our Sauiour and his Disciples, who
did not separate themselues from the high Priestes, Scribes, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasies,
so long as the vineyarde was not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them &amp;c. To which
proof he hath in the SECOND TRANSGRESSION his ful answere. To
these places: In the first the Church hath an absolute and direct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
from God himself, To goe foorth, not to staye in the steps
of that flocke, to feed her kids aboue the tabernacles of those sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes.
In the second we can but wonder to see Mr. G. so insensate &amp;
grosse to imagine, that these persecuting watchmen were Ministers or
members of the true Church. Especiallie seing the two Churches so
liuelie in that place described, The one malignant &amp; persecuting, the
other the true Church and persecuted. Betweene which I weene there
is as great a separation as betwixt light and darcknes, betwixt hel and
heauen. Neither did the Church there staye with, or was stayed by
those watchmen, but went to the Daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to seek and
enquire for <hi>Christ;</hi> much-lesse (as this man doteth) stayed in their fould
in their tentes, Or remayned vnder the gouernment and bondage of
those persecuting watchmen that openlie opposed against <hi>Christ,</hi> and
could not endure that the Church should seek him. Neither can anie
thing be imagined more false or contrary to the argument of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
songe, then that the Church of <hi>Christ;</hi> may at anie hand beare or
stand in anie bondage to the yoke of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Whose necke <hi>Christ</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornes
with chaynes, and she againe her doore postes with garlandes
for him. <hi>Song. 1. 9. &amp;</hi> 6. 13. Vnder whose heade CHRITES left hand

about which bedd sixtie, valiant men of the mightie men of <hi>Israel</hi>

then, what honor or homage, especiallie what bondage is left here to

               <p>YEt procedeth this graceles man furder, And is not afraide to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
That the Church &amp; euerie member therof is in some spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

learned Priestes of <hi>England</hi> are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to let publiquelie passe from their
viewe and correction, because yt pleadeth for the antichristian vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the one, and the seruile bondage of the other. But when
this argument shal neuer so litle by the worde of God be skanned, yt
shalbe found most heretical and blasphemouse. For verilie if after our
faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> wee be now left in anie bondage to sinne, then doth sinne
stil liue and raigne in vs, and we stil bounde vnto and with yt, then hath
not <hi>Christ</hi> fullie freed vs from the curse of the law, Death, and Hel. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was not <hi>Christes</hi> death a sufficient ransome for, neither exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to al our
sinnes, neither hath he subdued or set vs free from al our enimies, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue we as yet anie perfect peace or reconciliation with God, And
then was his comming vayne, then can no flesh be saued therbie, then
must wee looke for an other redeemer, or ells looke for him to come
againe to dye for our sinnes that remaine and raigne in vs. For the
rewarde of the least sinne is death, being a transgression of Gods lawe;
And if wee be in bondage to sinne, then are we not Kinges and Priestes
vnto God. Is not this a meete Minister of the Gospel, that knoweth
not yet the worck of our redemption, the benefite of <hi>Christes</hi> death, the
priueledge of the Sainctes, that cannot and will not learne to put dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the frailtie or pronenes to commit sinne which is in
this mortal flesh of all the faithful, and that bondage and subiection
to sinne which is neuer founde in anie of the faithfull, after they haue
once trulie acknowledged and embraced <hi>Christ?</hi> Howsoeuer the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> may allowe &amp; publish these doctrines,
yet are they most odious &amp; execrable to the soule and conscience of all
that knowe, feare, or loue the Lorde IESVS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>NOwe at length we are come to the second proposition of our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or rather to the fourth TRANSGRESSION wherewith their
Church of <hi>England</hi> is chardged, vzt. <hi>That their Churches are ruled by and wilfully
remaine in subiection vnto an antichristian and vngodly gouernment contrarie to the institution
of our Sauiour CHRIST.</hi> This wee shewed in our first writing by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
and present estate of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in their whole minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
worship, administration, ordinances, ceremonies, censures, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
customes, Courtes, to be antichristian, euen the same yoke and
gouernment that the <hi>Pope</hi> sometimes exercised by those his naturall
children and vnfaithful seruants the Bishopps, who nowe haue gotten
this power into their owne handes. Most of these (if not all) haue
bene alreadie in this present treatise declared and proued to be idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
popish, blasphemous, false, and antichristian, wholly swarued
from the rules of <hi>Christes</hi> Testament. Anie of these howe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. hath

Wherof nowe is arisen a great question in their Church, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Apostolicke forme of discipline which they prescribed to the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:4716:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Churches, should be perpetuall, or variable. The <hi>Reformistes</hi> that hold
yt perpetuall sue and complaine to the Parliaments for the same Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolicke
forme to be established, and to haue this present gouernment
of these Bishopps and their false <hi>hierarchie</hi> with their Courtes and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
quite remooued out of the Church and abolished. The Prelates
that holde yt arbitrable at Princes pleasures according to the variable

speake against their power, and present gouernment, with al possible
hostilitie. yet al this deadlie debate M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. couereth in a worde, calling
it but a questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about the outward forme of discipline: As also hideth
all the other most heynouse and detestable enormities that arise and
flowe from their monstruous antichristian gouernment, vnder the
same title of outward forme of discipline. For both sides he saith doe
agree in the matter That CHRIST hath left a power to his Churche to
chuse, to trye, and to ordaine Pastors and Teachers, And likewise that
he hath giuen the power of admonition, suspension, excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Onlie here is the difference, that th'one side woulde haue this power
exercised by <hi>Presbiteries</hi> of Pastors, Teachers, Elders, as in the Apostles
tyme; The other hold it the more salf and quiet waye to commit this
power to the handes of the Bishop. Which side holdeth the truth you
shall hereafter knowe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Giffard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wil then tell you of which side he wilbe. Till then he wil take the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
side against the <hi>Brownists</hi> tooth &amp; nayle, and affirme their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be the holie gouernment of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the defaultes therof not
such as make yt to become antichristian, or a yoke of bondage, as the
<hi>Brownist</hi> with open throte exclaymeth. And for the other side (wherof
he sometyme was) they, howsoeuer they woulde haue yt remoued, yet
are far from the <hi>Brownistes</hi> opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for they for the peace of the Church
had rather sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnder yt, then vnder <hi>Christs</hi> crosse by witnessing against
yt. Concerning the opinions of both these sides for the execution of
this discipline they speake of, wee haue alreadie shewed both sides to
erre, and fully refuted their seueral opinions by the way in the SECOND
PRINCIPAL TRANSGRESSION, where we haue declared that th'execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sures &amp; power of the Church belongeth neither to such
a sequestred withdrawen presbiterie, Nor yet to anie one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but vnto
the whole Churchioyntlie &amp;c. We haue also in that <hi>Second Transgression</hi>
shewed the forgerie of their idol <hi>Suspension,</hi> and of the popish <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi>
of these Bishops. And how the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath no power to
exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate any person for any sinne or heresie whatsoeuer: but only
abuse this most high iudgment of God vpon earth, to their filthie lucre
and pompe, excommunicating for nothing but for contempt of their
antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Courtes, Or for not paying their rauenous fees and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as also absoluing them for money when they please. Whervpon

                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:4716:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that <hi>admonitions</hi> were vayne &amp; fruictlesse amongst them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not

Moreouer in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> THIRD PRINCIPAL TRANSGRESSION we haue shewed,
how their Churches haue no power in themselues to elect or ordaine
them any Ministers, but are inforced to receiue them from the Patrone
&amp; the Bishop, whether they will or no. Where we haue also set downe
the counterfeight and false maner of the ordination and institution of
their Ministers or Priestes. Whereby euidentlie appeareth what kinde
of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t this their discipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is. So that
here remayneth the lesse to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this poyncte, the chief matters
being alreadie handled. Onlie here we wil a litle entreate of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
betwixt these Bishops and Priestes about their <hi>forme of Discipline,</hi>
and somwhat generallie of their Courtes in fewe wordes, and so put
an end to this poyncte.</p>
               <p>THis controuersie M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. affirmeth to be about the <hi>forme</hi> &amp; not about
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter of discipline, wherin both sides agree <hi>That Christ hath
lefte a power to his Church</hi> &amp;c. Doth not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. deserue high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandations,
that with one logicall distinction can both defend all the
Popes <hi>hierarchie, Courtes, Cannons &amp;c.</hi> and make also these two opposite fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the Bishops &amp; Priestes to agree in matter? So that now belike al
this long bitter hostilitie, contention, and controuersie amongst them
hath bene about no matter. And then wil not this rare distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hide
or excuse the blame of either partie. Againe (saue that we wil haue no
strife about inanitie of wordes) we alwaise tooke the <hi>forme</hi> to haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the beeing to the thing, and to haue bene so principal a parte therof, as
yt might neuer be seuered from the same, howsoeuer in vvay of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
the forme and the matter may for argument sake be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
For euen common sense teacheth, that no man or creature may
be separate from their peculiar and natural, forme or shape. Neither
anie member of them from that forme, place, and office, which God
hath giuen &amp; appoyncted to that member. But al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hould yt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous
to haue a mixte or false shape. How much more impossible &amp;
intollerable were it, but to admit anie other forme, or to change that
forme which God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; apoincted to anie actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church?
Either that forme which God hath giuen &amp; prescribed is no true and
right forme, Or ells those actions without that true and right forme,
cannot be said those true actions of the Churche. Howe monstruous
then is their presumption that dare vndertake to change, yea to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
those formes, rules, ordinances that <hi>Christ</hi> hath prescribed to his

the true forme (for here we reason not of faultes in a true forme, but of
a diuers &amp; false forme) is reason enough to shew, that it is not that true
gouernment which <hi>Christ</hi> hath instituted, And then must yt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe

that stand vnder yt to stand vnder the yoke of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and not to haue

All which he hopeth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. will not say to be of the <hi>forme</hi> of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.
For sure he holdeth a true ministrie and the rules of the Bible

to reprooue or refuse, no not so much as call into question anie
thing they do or decree, to rebuke or censure these inordinate lawlesse
fellowes for anie thing they doe either publickely or priuatly. The
Church must receiue &amp; obey as most holie, whatsoeuer they decree or
impose with al reuerence as the oracles of God, though they be neuer
so contrarie to the worde of God. The Church or any other member
of the Church in these Courtes be not permitted so much as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde

Advocate or Proctor, after their popish order and custome. Where for

the faithful, such as speak against, and will not of conscience and faith

               <p>To discusse or perticulate the seuerall &amp; innumerable errors, faultes,

procedings of the seuerall Courtes that belong to these Prelates anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
regiment, I am not (as I haue said) able, neither were yt in this
place expedient. By this which hath bene here generally said of them,
their Courtes, and proceedinges, appeareth, how contrarie they are to
that gouernment, and to those ordinances which CHRIST hath establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and set ouer his Church for euer. CHRISTS Scepter is an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Scepter, a Scepter of righteousnes. He hath set downe a most
perfect &amp; absolute gouernment to his Church. He hath perticularly
and exactly prescribed what officers, lawes &amp; ordinances he requireth
in his Church. He cannot be separate from his owne gouernment.
He ruleth not his Church by anie other officers or lawes, then by his
owne which he hath instituted. These godlesse Prelates then, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poinct
other officers and lawes vnto him &amp; ouer his Church, wrest not
only the Scepter, but the Kingdome out of <hi>Christes</hi> handes. And al such
as stand vnder the antichristia gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of these presumptuous idol
shepheardes,<note place="margin">Zech. 11.</note> stand not vnder <hi>Christes</hi> staffe, amenitie, vnder his Scepter
of grace, as the sheepe of his fould within his couenant &amp; protection;
but as the sheepe of destruction vnder his yron rodd,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> wherwith they
shalbe broken as a Potters vessel. Here is our controuersie touching
this fourth principal transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fully decided &amp; determined by Gods
owne mouth; That all which stand vnder anie false ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
stand not within the Couenant, but vnder the wrath of God.
All the mitigations then, reasons, and delusions of the false Prophets,
shal neuer be able to make voide, tourne away, or diminish these iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
otherwise then by their vnfaigned repentance &amp; speedie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertion
from their euil wayes.</p>
               <p>HITHER TO hath M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gif.</hi> brought vs not one reason or place of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to prooue the present gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of these Prelates and their
<hi>hierarchie,</hi> to be that heauenly gouernment which CHRIST hath institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his Church, but hath grieuouslie peruerted manie scriptures to
prooue that the Church might stand vnder some antichristian yoke,
although we in our first writing in this 4 PRINRIPAL TRANGRESSION
blamed yt, as false and antichristian, In our second shewed yt to be such
in the Officers, Courtes, Cannons, procedings. Now at length for a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:4716:102"/>
clusiue reason to prooue and determine all the poyncts at once; and to
shut vp his booke, he hath hatched &amp; brought vs foorth this worthie
reason to rest vpon. <hi>If the execution of discipline by Bishops be the yoke of Antichrist,
and if all the Churches vvhich doe stand vnder the same doe vvorship the Beast and be not
christians, it must needes follow that such as did euer execute this power, were Antichristes,
and no children of GOD at that time or before thei repented. But by your owne confession ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of them died blessed Martyres. I conclude therfore, That the Brownistes cannot but vvith
heresies and most heinous iniurie &amp; inordinate dealing condemne a Church as quite diuourced &amp;
separate from CHRIST, for such corruptions &amp; imperfections in Gods vvorship as be not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
nor destroy the substance: for that wicked men come vvith the godly to the publick
exercises of religion: for some wantes in calling &amp; ordaining Ministers, and in ecclesiastical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BElike Mr. GIF. is hard driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when this old popish reason alreadie by
vs answeared, and now by him not ouer wel repayred, is fayne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his cheif corner stone to approue this Church in all these char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dges,
and the only reason he can bring for the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> &amp; regiment of
the Church of <hi>England.</hi> By this reason his holie Father the POPE was
wonte to defend his triple Crowne &amp; apostaticall Chaire. Because in
the same haue sit manie godly Bishops &amp; blessed-Martyres &amp;c: so that
if the office, power, and dignitie of his Popedome be antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then
must all these godly learned men that haue executed the same needes
be <hi>Antichrists,</hi> and not true members of CHRIST, vntill they repent: But
they neuer were founde to haue repented these thinges, yet are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by al that knewe them in that age to be learned &amp; godly: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. and all this horned Cleargie and Lordly <hi>hierarchie</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
cannot without schisme reuoult from, without heresie pronownce, this
holie Sea &amp; office antichristian &amp;c. Let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. now he seeth the fordge
&amp; issue, bind or loose, followe or leaue this argument, at his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
&amp; perill. If he suppose to escape by shewing discrepance betwixt
these godly predecessors &amp; vngodly successors in manie circumstances
and vertues: And so thinck this reason wil not presse him half so sore
as it doth vs: yet let him consider (though I will not be the POPES ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate)
that they here reason of the same office, and not of the same
circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, and that these godly predecessors executed the self same
office with these their bad successors. Yea so might th'example be put,
as yt should be without anie great difference in circumstance also. And
as to the difference betwixt the persons of the one and of the other, (if
that may be a solution to this argument) we shall not greatly need to
feare, finding this viperous generation, these idle, proude, wordlie,
fleshlie, persecuting, blasphemous Prelates, nothing so like these their
godly predecessors these Martyres, in laboures, humilitie, bowntie,
spiritual &amp; holie conuersation, faith, patience, loue of the truth, of the
Sainctes of CHRIST &amp;c, as they are in that which is euill in these anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
titles, offices, Courtes, iurisdiction, reuenues, pompe &amp;c.
Which, (as we before said vnto you) so say we againe, that no men or
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:4716:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Angels can iustifie where Gods worde condemneth, though all the
Martyres in the worlde should dye in and for them. We may not be
leed or drawen by the examples &amp; persons of men (how good soeuer)
from one iote of Gods reueiled truth. The best men we see doe erre
and sinne, there neuer was or shalbe anie man, that erreth and sinneth
not in manie thinges. But should we because good men haue donne
euill and erred, therfore iustifie sinne and error? That were high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
greiuouslie to tempt God, and to abuse the holie Scriptures,
which recorde not mens faultes to that end. What sinne or error might
not so by th'example of some good man or Church be iustified? yet
these are M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. GIFF. his best reasons for his Church, ministrie &amp;c. and
here his only reason, to approue the gouernment of these Bishops and
<hi>hierarchie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now as we here iustifie &amp; allowe not any sinne by the examples
&amp; persons of the godly; so condemne we not these godly mens persons
for sinne &amp; error, vntil obstinacie be ioyned thervnto, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. GIFF.
cannot shew in these holie Martyres. And therfore we denie the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of his <hi>Maior</hi> or first <hi>Proposition;</hi> That because the office &amp; iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they executed were <hi>Antichristian,</hi> therfore the men that exercised them
were <hi>Antichristes,</hi> and not children of God. We may vtterly condemne
the sinne, and yet not so peremptorily condemne the sinner. It is a sure
position that euerie sinne is of the Deuil, yet is there no consequence
therof, that euerie one that sinneth is of the Deuil. we see no such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. would persuade of that matter. The godly may sinne
of ignorance, of negligence, of fraylety, yet not thervpon vntill obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie
be added vnto sinne, cease to be christians. These godly Martyres
so lately escaped out of that smokie fornace of the popish Church,
could not so clearely discerne, and sodenly enter into the heauenly &amp;
beautiful order of a true established Church. It is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one dayes
worcke, to gather, to plante and establish a Church aright, much more
so manie thowsand seuerall Churches as are supposed in this land. It
can be no wonder that those godly men being so vnexpert and vnexer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in his heauenly worcke, neuer hauing liued in, seene, or hearde of
any orderly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Sai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nctes, anie true established Church vpon
earth of so many hundreth yeeres, euer since the general defection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Antichrist</hi> so much foretold of in the Scriptures, no maruaile I say, if
they erred in setting vp the frame. But what then? should we therfore
iustifie or persist in their errors? especially should we reiect the true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of CHRISTS Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which reproueth our workes, and sheweth
vs a better course? should we not suffer our worckes to burne, after the
maner of these deceitful workmen of these tymes? God forbid. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
should we receaue their reward &amp; perish with our worckes.</p>
               <p>Now to the second propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this argument we haue alreadie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
our minde concerning the suffringes, faith, and death of these
Martyres. We finde them obstinatly to haue resisted no part of Gods
worde or truth he gaue them sight of at anie tyme, but to haue bene
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:4716:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
verie faithfull &amp; constant euen vnto bandes &amp; death in that truth they
were come vnto. Furder we doubt not but they truly repented them of
al their sinnes knowen, and faithfully laid hold of Gods mercie in <hi>Christ
Iesus</hi> for al their secrete &amp; vnknowen sinnes. Gods grace we are assured
is so much greater then all our sinnes, as the sea is greater then one
dropp of water. Therefore we doubt not of their happie and blessed
estate; all their sinnes &amp; these false offices &amp; ministrie, which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
in their ignorance amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the rest, being forgiue them. Th'ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
then &amp; errors of these Martyres will not approue the antichris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
offices &amp; gouernment of these Prelates, nor yet iustifie the publick
worship, ministrie, confusion, sacriledge of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mvchlesse wil these two lame propositions of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. his final argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
beare vpp his forged conclusion. where he concludeth the
<hi>Brownistes</hi> hereticks &amp;c, Because they condemne a Church as quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced
&amp; separate from <hi>Christ,</hi> For such imperfections &amp; corruptions in
Gods worship, as are not fundamental, nor destroy the substance; For
that wicked men come with the godly to the publicke exercises of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
For some wantes in calling &amp; ordayning Ministers; And for
some wantes in ecclesiastical discipline. If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. GIF. had taken the wise
mans councel, he should not haue answered a matter before he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
it, much-lesse would he (if he had bene ledd by the spirit of God)
haue blasphemed the truth or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned the innocent without cause.
But as he began his booke without councel, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued it without grace,
and ended it without truth; so hath he herebie but purchased to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
shame, and brought vpon his owne head the iudgments due to an
accuser, a blasphemer, a false witnesse and iudge. What opinion the
<hi>Brownistes</hi> hold of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> their worship, people, minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
gouernment, we neither knowe nor regard, neither is there cause
whie we should be chardged or condemned for their errors &amp; faultes.
For which themselues, and this Church of ENGLAND that receiueth
and nourisheth all sectories, hereticks, wicked and abhominable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whatsoeuer, shall accompt. For vs, whom it pleaseth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. to
terme <hi>Brownistes,</hi> and whome he endeuoreth to confute in this treatise,
we neuer condemned any true Church for anie fault whatsoeuer,
knowing that where true faith is, there is repentance, where true faith
and repentance are, there is remission of all sinnes. Far be it from vs
to condemne anie whom CHRIST iustifieth. 1. And for the Church of
ENGLAND we neither did or doe condemne yt, (as this accuser sugges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
for such imperfections and corruptions in their worship as be not
fundamentall or destroy the substance: but we condemned the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
worship of their Church of ENGLAND presently inioyned, receiued
and vsed, as deuised by men, popish, superstitious, idolatrous, abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
not such as God commandeth, requireth, or accepteth, and
therfore not such as anie faithfull christian may offer vp vnto God, be
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4716:103"/>
compelled, or consent vnto. This wee shewed in the first PRINCIPALL
TRANSGRESSION: this we haue proued in the first part of this treatise.
2. Secondly wee condemne not the Church of <hi>England</hi> as separate from
CHRIST, for that wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come with the godly to the publick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of religion, But rather as neuer rightly gathered to CHRIST, for
that al the prophane and wicked ar receiued and retayned as members
of their Churche. Wee gladlie acknowledge that CHRIST came a
light into the world, to offer saluation vnto all men, to haue built his
Church vpon an hil, there to be lifted vp by the preaching of the word
as a standard to al people and passengers, there to haue made a feast to
al natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and thither to inuite them. Neither were we euer so enuious
of the saluation of others, or of the glorie of God, (as hauing founde
mercie, and being entred our selues) to shut the doore or stop the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of Gods grace against others: yea God is witnesse with what
heartie desire we long after them all, that they, euen our greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
might be partakers of the same saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ioy, comfort, &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
with vs: And howe wee intermit not, much-lesse exclude, anie
meanes thervnto that God putteth in our power (though it were with
the hazarde of our owne lyues) to bring them of the water of the wel
at <hi>Bethelem.</hi> But now though we affirme that al the vnbelieuing &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
not onlie may, but ought to resort to the publick exercises of
religion in the Church, as the most excellent meanes to call them to
the faith; yet do we not therfore belieue or affirme, that the prophane
or vnbelieuing may be receiued or admitted as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Church,
before they haue made voluntarie publick profession of their owne
faith and obedience; Or being entered by such profession, be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
longer to stand or remayne of the Church, then they contynue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlie
to walke in the same faith and obedience. And therfore we bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
these parish assemblies of <hi>England,</hi> as consisting of a confuse mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of al sortes of prophane and wicked people in differentlie: where
they are al receiued, nourished, and retayned, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church,
though they were neuer called &amp; gathered by the power of the worde,
entered &amp; receiued by the profession of their owne faith, neither walke
orderlie in the faith, or in anie duties either publick or priuate: And so
are al guiltie of most high sacriledge &amp; prophanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy things
of God; No such assemblie or communion of Sainctes, as <hi>Christes</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
seruantes ought to repaire or ioyne vnto. This wee shewed in the
second PRINCIPAL TRANSGRESSION. This we haue lardgly proued in
the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part of this treatise. 3. Thirdly we condemne not the Church
of <hi>England</hi> for some wantes in calling and ordayning Ministers; But for
hauing, maintayning, and retayning a false and antichristian ministrie
imposed vpon them, with a false &amp; antichristian calling &amp; ordination
euen the self same that the <hi>Pope</hi> vsed &amp; left in this Realme; which false
offices and ministrie cannot be ioyned vnto, or exercised in the true
Church of CHRIST. This wee shewed in the thirde PRINCIPAL
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4716:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
TRANSGRESSION, this we proued in the third part of this treatise.
And therfore with an euil and corrupt conscience hath Mr. G. sought
to hide this transgression vnder <hi>some vvantes in the calling and ordaining Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and thus boldlie and falselie thervpon to accuse vs. Wee knowe
there may be faultes either of ignorance or negligence in the calling
ordination &amp;c, yet these not to disanul the action, much-lesse the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
so longe as they are not obstinatlie held and persisted in. But
our assertion and controuersie here is not of a faultie ministrie, caling,
ordination &amp;c, but of a false ministrie, caling, ordination &amp;c, which
we haue proued theirs to be, and that no such belongeth vnto, may be
imposed, receiued, or retayned in the Church of CHRIST. 4. Fourthly
in like maner wee reason not of some wantes in the gouernment and
order of their Church, but of a false and antichristian gouernment set
ouer the Church. Neither condemne we the Church of ENGLAND
for some faultes in a true ecclesiasticall gouernment, but for hauing
and standing vnder a false and antichristian gouernment, euen the
self same Hierarchie, Officers, Courtes, Cannons, Customes, Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
Proceedings, that the Pope vsed and left. This wee also haue
shewed in the 4 TRANSGRESSION, and haue nowe in this fourth
parte, and through this booke, fullie proued their present ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
gouernment to be. To which fower principall transgressions a
willfull obstinacie, an open reiecting &amp; resisting the truth &amp; al reprofe,
a violent and most hostile persecution of all such as either refraine,
speake against, or reproue their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, ministrie, worship, gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
being ioyned, We may by all these reasons, seuerally, and haue
by them altogether, proued these Parrish assemblies in this estate not
to be the true established Churches of <hi>Christ,</hi> to which the faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of <hi>Christ</hi> ought to resort and ioyne.</p>
               <p>So then all men maie see how falsly this accuser hath sclandered vs,
and howe far he hath strayed from the present matters and transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in question, both through his whole booke, and in this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his booke, where he chardgeth, pronownceth, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vs as heretickes &amp;c, for condemning a Church for some light
imperfections in their worship, wantes in their discipline &amp;c: wheras
we for their idolatrie, confusion, sacrilege, false and antichristian mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie,
and gouernment, obstinacie in all these sinnes, hatred of the
truth, and persecution of CHRISTES seruants, haue proued the
Church of ENGLAND not to be the true, but the malignant Church.
Therfore wee condemne no true Church as he accuseth, neither for
such causes as he surmiseth. Nor yet do wee, but rather God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
condemne them. Wee but discouer their sinnes, and shew them
their estate by the worde of God, refrayning and witnessing against
their abhominations, as we are comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by that voyce from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

the causes of our separatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their publick assemblies in this
estate; So at their instance we in like maner set downe vnto them our
purpose &amp; intent, what we now indeuored &amp; meant to doe, in certaine
breife Articles. Of those transgressions &amp; chardges, how this Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
hath defended &amp; cleared their Church, by that which hath bene
written now on both sides may appeare. The articles of themselues
are so iust and holie, as no Diuel can impugne or denie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no man of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
conscience, or shame gaynesay or resist anie one of them: yet
hath Mr. GIFFARD (instigated by the spirit of vayne-glorie and envie)
in a singular zeale enterprised to answere and confute them all, as you
may see in his first writing. The cauills and vanitie wherof, as also his
vniust suspitions, calumniations, reproches against vs thervpon being
layd open in our first reply vnto him, so far hath he bene from desis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to sporne against the prikes, to sclander, accuse, and rayle on vs, or
to take a more sober and christian course for the discussing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
these controuersies betwixt him and vs, as he hath burst forth
yet into furder malice and madnes, blaspheming vs in euerie sentence
of this his second answere to these our articles with such store of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious
and odious wordes, as if that corrupt synck of his heart
could neuer be emptied, the malice of his minde and venome of his
tongue neuer satiate or vttered against vs, euen now as fresh as if he
had not rayled enough or all in his writings and booke before. But
seing his reproches want both profe and truth, they deserue neither
refutation nor repetition. Neither can they preiudize our holie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
or vs, or anie way iustifie or excuse him before God or man;
but rather add to his feareful accompt before God, and euidently shew
vnto all men, by what spirit his heart and pen were guided at the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of these contumelious answeres. Wherein yet most strange it is,
how he could take occasion to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

these godly articles &amp; holy duties, especially hauing shewed
withall such iust causes of our separation from their assemblies. But
let vs nowe take a viewe of his reasons wherewith he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
our endeuours in these articles, and see whether they be of
as great validitie, as those wherewith he hath approued their assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
in the transgressions by vs obiected. The articles, answeres, and
our former replie I will not here againe insert, referring to the copies
aboue.</p>
               <p>HIs cauilling &amp; trifling about these wordes [CHRISTES <hi>Kingdome</hi>] in
his former answeare to our first <hi>Article,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Article 1.</note> together with his hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
in seeming to labour for CHRISTES gouernment, were by vs layde
open in our replie: as also his vniust surmize, that we should hold
that CHRISTES Kingdome could not be in anie, except they had that
his outward ecclesiasticall gouernment, was there by vs fullie answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:4716:106"/>
and cleared. He nowe in his second answere as vaynely endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to cleare himself of his former cauilling and hypocrisie, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijing
the necessarie sense of his former wordes; and by propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
two newe questions vnto vs instead of answering our two ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vnto him, which we rather expected. Let the indifferent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
iudge whether to all intendement he made not CHRISTES King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
only inwarde, and his ecclesiasticall gouernment but an help
for the preseruation of his inward kingedome, in the first parte of his
former answeare, howsoeuer afterward he vouchsalfed yt to be a part
of his Kingedome. Vnto his contumelious blasphemous questions
we answere, That when he shall haue dulie conuinced vs of heresies,
or schisme, to haue condemned a true ministrie, to haue falslie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
a true Church, then we will confesse our selues to be more then
ignorant and rash: till then all these reproches shall but followe his
other sinnes into Gods sight to hasten his owne iudgment. Our
questions also whilest they remaine vnanswered, (and as we thinck
vnanswerable,) must still lay open their bad estate and hypocrisie, In
that whilest they remaine antichristian Ministers in the false Church,
And haue so longe continued vnder <hi>Antichristes</hi> yoke and ecclesiasticall
gouernment, they cannot be said either to haue or sincerelie to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for CHRISTS ecclesiasticall gouernment, as he and they then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
And here by the way I must drawe two dangerous positions,
and in the same obserue great contrarietie in Mr. G. vnto himself.
First, in that they and he pretended to laboure, and had so longe sued
to Parliamentes for CHRISTES gouernment or discipline, they confesse
the absence and wante of the same: For a fond thing it were to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and sue for that which alreadie they haue. Then if they wante
and haue not CHRISTES ecclesiasticall gouernment; and receiue an
other ecclesiasticall gouernment ouer their Church and ministrie
which is not his, yt must needes be a false and antichristian gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And so they and their whole Church by their owne confession
stand vnder <hi>Antichristes</hi> yoke and gouernment, and haue not CHRIST
their King to rule ouer them, except they can shew that CHRIST
doth rule in his Church by Antichrists officers and gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which
I thinck will be harde to prooue: and then are they and their Church
in a bad estate. As also Mr. G. herein contrarie to himself, who ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
affirmed this present gouernment of these BB<hi>s.</hi> their hierarchie
and Courtes to be the true ecclesiasticall gouernment of <hi>Christ.</hi> And
that they were not antichristian. Furder he hath obserued &amp; reserued
one special poyncte in our replie. That the kingdome of God may be
in the scattered faithfull, which as yet haue not the ecclesiasticall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.
This we graunt &amp; neuer denied: although Mr. G. whatsoeuer
he now say, then surmized the contrarie of vs, or ells had smale cause so
vehemently to haue refuted this opinion. But we are content that yt
shall now remaine to his vse.</p>

and pleaded for BAAL; Or howe he could approoue our article, and
yet condemne vs of schisme and heresie because we forsake their false,
deuised, idolatrous worship, and seek to worship God according to his
worde. To those he answereth that when we haue proued their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to be idolatrie, and that they prophecie in BAAL, and pleade for
BAAL, then he is content that men take vs for no schismatickes or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.
And this I hope we haue in this treatise donne, hauing shewed
their worship to be deuised by man, idolatrous, abhominable, their
ministrie to be as false, diriued from and exercised vnder their BAALS
these Bishops; And how earnestly Mr. G. hath pleaded for these <hi>Baals</hi>
their throne and all the enormities proceding from the same, these his
owne bookes shall testifie. So that I hope we are now cleared with all
men, and shal hereafter be spared of him, from the odious accusations
of schisme and heresie.</p>

                  </note> 3. 4. and 5. <hi>Articles</hi> (after Mr. G. his diuision) tending to one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and begetting but the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon difficulties, may together
be handled. The chief controuersies about the same are these two.
1. Whether these publicke assemblies of their parishes be antichristian
&amp; Babilonish. 2. Then whether the Church consisting but of priuate
men, may in this estate erect &amp; establish amongst them such offices &amp;
ordinances of CHRIST, as he hath instituted to the ministri &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Church. Of the first, both Mr. G. &amp; I haue now lardgly set
downe our mindes: so that I leaue yt as fitter for iudgment, then anie
furder discussing in this place; The reasons here repeated. 1. How their
Churches are from antient discent within the Couenant. 2. And how
their Church in this estate hath begotten and nourished children vnto
God, as the <hi>Martyres,</hi> haue bene alreadie often propounded and vrged
by him in his book. I hope by that time he hath wel considered of the
heresies, sacrilege, and absurdities of the first, and of the vayne assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and litle consequence of the second, as they are set downe in our
answeres, he shal haue litle cause to vse them so often, or to vrdge them
with such confidence &amp; bitterness. For when Mr. G. shal prooue, that a
Nation so highly apostatate &amp; fallen from the faith, so deiply plunged
into such execrable idolatries, abhominations, &amp; hardnes of heart, as in
the papistical corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, stil continueth in this estate a true established
visible church, within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward Couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, so far as we may &amp;
ought to iudge by his worde, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubtlesse for mie part I wil graunt yt
a sounde <hi>Maior proposition.</hi> And if he shal bring the church of <hi>Rome</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the <hi>Minor,</hi> I must then yeild to his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Because y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> church
at <hi>Rome</hi> was sometimes rightly gathered, established, and within the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.
Yet euen then I suppose yt wil be harde for him to make the
like assured proof, that euer her daughter of <hi>England</hi> was rightly establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4716:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into that christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> order &amp; within the couenant: But I doubt rather, and
by her present estate iudge,<note place="margin">Reu. 17. 2.</note> that she was among the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
fornications,<note place="margin">Deut. 23. 2.</note> and therfore without the Couenant. To the second
reason it will also hardly followe, that because some faithful men haue
bene called to some generall knowledge of God and of <hi>Christ</hi> in this
estate, and because they in their ignorance cotynued in the same estate,
that this should therfore iustifie the outward estate of the Church
which the worde of God condemneth, or prooue yt in this estate the
true established Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> when they haue nothing aright ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Christes</hi> ordinance, as we haue prooued in this treatise, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I refer for a more ful answeare of these reasons, hasting to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
poyncte.</p>
               <p>Wherein I before shewed how God commandeth al his faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes
(of what estate or degree soeuer) to flee out of Babilon the false
Church, and being escaped not to stand still, to remember the Lord a
far off, to let Ierusalem come into their minde, to goe vp to SION, to
seeke out and to repaire vnto the place where God hath put his name.
To seek the Church and the kingdome of CHRIST, to take his yoke
vpon them, to assemble together in his name, with his promise of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and protection; and with his authoritie to establish his offices
and ordinances amongst them, giuen by him to the ministrie and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of his Church vnto the worldes end, there to leade their liues
together in all mutuall duties, in his holie order, faith, and feare. Now
as we shewed all perticular and priuate men whosoeuer, to be called
out of the false Church from confusion, and out of the world from
dispersion, vnto the true Church vnto order. So likewise shewed we,
that all these faithfull persons whosoeuer, were as yet but priuate men
at their first comming out of the false Church and gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
none of them being as yet called to anie ecclesiasticall office
or function in the Church, yt not being as yet established into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Wherevpon we concluded, and still of necessitie enforce, That
seing God calleth all his seruantes out of confusion, and will not
haue them liue in dissipation or disorder, but only in this order which
he hath prescribed in his worde; And hath giuen his Church auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
and commandement, to erect, retaine, and obserue this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
vnto the worldes end; And seeing in this estate the Church
now consisteth but of priuate men; That therfore the faithfull being
as yet but priuate men, ought by the commandement of God to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
&amp; ioyne themselues together in the name &amp; faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
in all mutual dueties orderly to proceede according to the rules of the
worde, to a holy choice &amp; vse of such offices &amp; ordinances as <hi>Christ</hi> hath
ordayned to the seruice &amp; gouernment of his Church. And sure were
not Mr. G. as forgeatful as he is ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the scriptures, he could not
but haue seene by the verie phrase the first proposition confirmed by
many scriptures; The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by many prophecies of this general defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and if not verified in these present tymes, yet he cannot denie but
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4716:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some former not long sithence. Therefore whilest he fighteth with
the conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he but spurneth against the prickes, bewraieth the folly
of his owne heart, and no waye auoydeth or defendeth the daunger
therebie.</p>
               <p>His best answeare to this reason, or rather manie reasons summed
vp, is (as he thinketh) to tourne it away by two questions, and by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
contumelies against our poore persons; or (to say as yt is) by inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
blasphemies against the Church of God: likening the assemblie
of the faithful gathered in the name, and ioyned together in the faith
of <hi>Christ,</hi> proceding to th'establishing and exercise of <hi>Christes</hi> or dinances;
to the rebellious company of <hi>Corath, Dathan,</hi> &amp; <hi>Abyram,</hi> to a rowte of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynous
prentices assembled without leaue of their Prince to chuse a
Lorde Maior &amp;c. His first question is, That if all were priuate at the
first comming out of the false Church, who they were that caled them
together? Or whether their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming together doth make them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then priuate? We answeare, that for anie thing we can see, or may
iudge by the word, they were but priuate men that first caled them out
of the false Church, and that caused them to assemble together, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
peraduenture indued with more excellent giftes, and more rare
graces then other. Furder, that being thus assembled they ceased not
to be priuate men, vntil they were lawfully caled vnto some true eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
office in and by the Church. Yet al this notwithstanding, the
Church in this estate nowe consisting onlie of priuate men, ought to
procede to a right choice of Ministers &amp;c, according to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of God. His next stombling-block or question, is; <hi>VVho should
ordaine these Pastors &amp; Elders. And whether we euer read of any ordained but by Apostles,
Euangelistes, Pastors, Teachers, and Gouernours? And vvhether that power vvas not at the
first deriued from th'extraordinarie Ministers to the Ordinarie.</hi> To this we haue aboue
answered, where wee entreated of the ordination of the Ministers of
<hi>England,</hi> and here againe doe answere. That the Church had alwaies the
power to chuse and ordaine their owne Ministers, wherevnto yt ought
to vse the most fit instruments, whether these Pastors, Teachers, Elders
(if such be to be had) or ells where they be not to be had to vse the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
meanes and instrumentes that God exhibiteth. For this power of
ordination is not (as Mr. G. and the vnruly cleargie of these dayes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
deriued from the Apostles &amp; <hi>Euangelistes</hi> vnto the permanent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie
of <hi>Pastors and Elders,</hi> neither belongeth yt by anie peculiar right to
their offices and persons segregate from the Church. But yt is giuen
by <hi>Christ</hi> and properlie belongeth vnto the Church, wherevnto their
Ministrie and persons also belonge, and are by the Church to be vsed
vnto this worck as occasion is administred. And thus (if a vaile were
not laid ouer Mr. G. his heart at the reading of the scriptures) he might
finde that those cheife builders the <hi>Apostles</hi> &amp; <hi>Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelistes</hi> themselues vsed
this power, not to take yt from the Church, but therein to assist the
Church, As we reade <hi>Act.</hi> 13. Where the Church being assembled vnto
fasting, prayer, and other holy exercises, yt is there said also, that they
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4716:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
layde handes vpon the Apostles, and sent them out, though wee doubt
not the Church did it by some one or moe of the Prophets or <hi>Elders,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 14. 26. 27.</note> and
vnto the Church at their returne the Apostles declared the successe of
their iourney. In which iourney also, the Apostles ordayning or rather
helping the Churches to chose and ordaine Elders,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 23.</note> the word cheirotone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santes
lifting vp handes, whereby the whole action of chusing &amp; ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is expressed, doth clearly giue the propertie and right therof vnto
the Churches, and not vnto the Apostles only. who, as also the <hi>Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes,</hi>
did but instruct, direct, help, and assist the Church herein, and not
pluck away this power from the Churches. Likewise the rules for the
choice and ordination of Ministers in the <hi>Epistles</hi> to <hi>Timothie</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus,</hi> and
other places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture, as <hi>Rom. 12. 1 Cor. 12. Eph.</hi> 4. are not perticularly
directed or committed to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sistorie of Elders, as they cal yt, seques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
&amp; withdrawen from the Church, but vnto the Church consisting
of al the members. which is therevnto to vse (as in all other publicke
&amp; waighty causes) such meet &amp; fit instruments as the Lorde affordeth
and apoyncteth. Neither is this action of approbation, and acception,
or ordination of Ministers so seuered or disioyned from the election as
these men dreame: Or so tyed to the office or persons of the Elders, as
the Church might either not ordeyne, or not ordeyne without Elders.
And aswel might y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Elders take into their hands the elections, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
&amp;c, of the Church, as the ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this maner; Againe
if the ordination were thus of necessitie tyed to the handes &amp; office of
Elders, how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should the Church after this general defection &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
vnder <hi>Antichrist</hi> (where al the starres were fallen to the earth,<note place="margin">Reu. 6. 12. 13. 14.</note> and
the whole shape of the heauen departed away as a booke wrapped vp,
a new &amp; strange ministry brought out of the bottomlesse pit with him,
as wee reade) euer recouer or haue anie true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Reu. 9.</note> Ministrie againe in this
world? where should they haue true Elders to ordaine their Ministers?
In the false and papisticall Church there can be no true Elders or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of <hi>Christ</hi> The true members of <hi>Christ</hi> can not be made the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that <hi>Beaste,</hi> the members of that <hi>Harlot.</hi> The true Ministers of
<hi>Christ</hi> cannot belong vnto, neither can administer in the false Church,
but only belonge vnto and administer in the true stablished Church of
<hi>Christ.</hi> But now in the tyme of this general apostasie and papistical cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
Mr. G. cannot shewe anie where anie true visible established
Church vpon earth, with the true ministrie, gouernment, worship, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,

When they first came out of poperie were they then <hi>Corah</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
an assembly of mutinous prentices? Were they not all priuate
men? Or which of them was otherwise? Ordinary or permanent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
they could not be: because there was no true visible established
Church vpon earth, and for a thowsand reasons that might be drawen
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forgery of their office, administration &amp;c, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popish Church.
Extraordinarie Ministers, Apostles, or Euangelistes the could not be,
because (as we haue aboue proued) they were ceased after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was once laide, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work rightly erect according to the true paterne.
Neither finde we to any one established Church, the offices of Apostles
or Euangelistes perticularly giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, belonging, or erected in anie of them
as a ministri of contynuance. Neither had these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the caling due to
Apostles &amp; Euangelistes. Nor yet did they chalendge or execute anie
such office, as appeareth by their writings and profession, where they
would not haue bene ashamed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministry God had caled them vnto
to haue published themselues such as they were. But if so be they had
donne this, yet their practize being so discrepant from the Apostolike
paterne &amp; worke of the former Euangelistes, we might not at any hand
accept them for such. Thus then at their first comming out of the false.
Church, and gathering together, they were but priuate men. What
then, were they hereticks &amp; schismaticks for departing out of the false
church? were they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenticlers, sectories &amp;c, for assembling together?
were they vsurpers and intruders without caling, mutiners, rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Princes, and abridgers of their power, aud withdrawers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their
obedience &amp; allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for dissuading the people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the false Church,
the yoke of <hi>Antichrist</hi> &amp; al their detestable idolatrys and enormities, for
caling them to the communion of Sainctes, to procede to the choice of
Ministers, and to the practize of <hi>Christes</hi> Testament as the Lorde shoulde
reueale vnto them? Al this they did, or at the least professed &amp; endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

their sepulches, wil not thus say of them, howsoeuer he rayle
on vs that doe and protest to doe no whit more. If they were faithful
Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, such are we: holding the same commune faith with them &amp;
al Sainctes, not (as yet) truly chardged, or duly conuinced of any one er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
contrary to the faith. They left the false Church, so do we. They
assembled &amp; ioyned together in the faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> so do we, or at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least
would doe. They were but priuate men, and so are we. They herein are
not iudged to haue offended God or their Prince, and why should wee
for the same? They herein did more, then to come out of <hi>Babilon,</hi> They
did more then sweepe or repaire the house, for they proceeded to the

ells Mr. G. by his owne reasons must condemne them, the Church, and
al the ministrie of the land, yea of all <hi>Europe,</hi> as wel as vs.</p>
               <p>IF he alleadge that though they left their popish administration, and
to administer in the popish Church, yet they left not that ministerie
they there had; Wee answere (as we haue answered) that they receiued
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4716:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no better ministrie in the false Church, then the false Church could &amp;
did giue them; neither could they bring anie better out, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they there
receiued. But the true ministerie belongeth not to the false Church,
neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the false Church ordaine true Ministers. Againe whoseuer
leaueth the publick administration of his Ministrie, forsaketh his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie:
But they left the publick administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ministrie. The
like argument may be drawen for leauing the Church whereof they
were Ministers. And yet to stop his mouth farder, if the Martyres and
first witnesses had a true ministrie, such also haue sondrie of vs whom
he termeth <hi>Brownistes</hi> &amp;c, yea by so much a better, as he holdeth the
ministrie of the Churche of <hi>England</hi> better then the ministrie of the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Yea if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. his owne ministrie be good, such &amp; the
same haue diuers of vs had, and are as yet vndisgraded, otherwise then
by vnfaigned repentance of so detestable a Ministrie. So that if they
lost not their ministrie by forsaking the Churche they receaued it of,
and exercised it in; why shoulde M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. be so seuere to iudge others,
that may make the same plea? If they saye they left not the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> but the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s therof, what should let vs to alleadge the same
nowe against them, if we would stand vpon those shiftes &amp; doublings,
But we vse no such coloured excuses, neither relye vpon mens persons
and doinges. wee haue the expresse commandement of God for our
warrant of al those thinges we doe, or refuse to doe, and stand to make
proofe &amp; tryal therof by the same word, gladly submitting our selues,
al our actions and whole faith vnto this tryal. Although also we haue
and vse th'examples and practize of these faithful, that first came out
of the popish Churche, and enterprised the erection and practize of
<hi>Christes</hi> Ministrie &amp; ordinances amongst themselues, according to that
measure of knowledge God gaue them. Whose errors though wee
shunne (neither will mainetayne our owne when they shalbe shewed
vs, cleauing onlie to the true paterne of Gods word) yet make we their
preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a bulwark for vs against these cauilling enimies; Who must,
for doing these thinges either condemne them, and so themselues, and
their whole Church and doings with them, Or ells with no shame or
iustice condemne vs of heresie, schisme, sectes, presumption, intrusion,
rebellion &amp;c, for doing the self same thinges they did, or at the least
professed to doe; yea for doing them better &amp; nearer the true paterne
then they did. If they in this doing neither intruded without caling,
nor presumed aboue their caling, Why are we iudged for this doing to
doe both? yea for this saying, to haue put an halter about our neckes?
Doth not this our hange-man &amp; executioner (that with ioye speaketh
of the chaynes and fetters, that these bloodie Bishopps lay vpon the
faithful seruantes of <hi>Christ,</hi> for leauing their antichristian yoke and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Christs</hi> heauenlie gouernment) put with the same hande, and trise
the halter about these godlie Martyres neckes, yea about his owne and
his Lorde Bishops neckes, and al the Ministers neckes of the land? that
haue no other defence for their vngodly ministry and doings, then the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4716:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
erroneous practize of these godly Martyres, who (as hath bene proued)
were but priuate men at their first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of popery &amp; erection of
these Churches, as we now be? Mr. GIFF. had not best shew vs manie
of these trickes of <hi>legier du main,</hi> lest he ensnarrle &amp; choke himself with
the same halter he would cast about our neckes, and kil himself &amp; his
whole Church with that sharpe weapon wherwith he would kill vs at
once in his furious moode. For sure if it be vnlawful for priuate men
to assemble, and in this estate to proceede to the election &amp; ordination
of Ministers, then by the same lawe was it vnlawful for them so to doe.
Then are all these Bishops &amp; Ministers priuate men, vsurpers; no more
true Ministers, then such a one as the mutinous prentices should make
<hi>Maior,</hi> were a true <hi>Maior.</hi> Yea let me goe furder, if the Church consis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of priuate men, may not in this estate erect and ordaine <hi>Christes</hi> true
ministrie amongst them, then is there no true ministri vpon earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
euer can be, vntil God raise vp new Apostles and Euangelistes, and
buildeth a new Church vpon a new foundation, which shalbe when
vve haue a newe <hi>Christ.</hi> And then Mr. G. shal haue his dreame. For he
saith that vvhen God vvill haue his vvorke donne, he vvill raise vp ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
workemen thervnto. But where read Mr. G. this positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
if not amongst the <hi>Anabaptistes?</hi> Sure he neuer founde it in the new Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,
vvhere vve haue the minde of <hi>Christ,</hi> a perfect foundation, an
accompleat ministrie,<note place="margin">Deut. 30. 11 12. 13. 14.</note> vntil <hi>Christes</hi> comming. So that we neede not to
say in our heartes, who shall ascend vp to heauen for vs, or descend
from heauen vnto vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 6. 7. 8.</note> or goe ouer the sea for vs to bring or teach vs the
Commandement of our God, when the worde is so neare vs euen in
our mouthes and in our heartes for to doe yt. Therfore when Mr. G.
shall make his proofe of this assertion, And shew his warrant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
that God will now raise vp to his Church extraordinarie worck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and that til then no priuate men ought to proceede to the choice
and ordination of Ministers, but to tarye and expect this promise of the
Lorde: Then surelie we will acknowledge him no false Prophet, no
Anabaptisticall dreamer, and that we haue presumed ouer far vpon
the Lordes authoritie and commandement giuen to his Church vnto
the worldes end, to chuse and ordaine his ministerie, and to practize
amongst them whatsoeuer he hath commanded. But nowe because
this were to bring <hi>Christ</hi> from aboue, and againe from the deade, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
also we haue Gods direct commandement to goe out of the false
Church; being come out, to assemble and ioyne together; and being
so ioyned, to proceede to the erection of his ministrie and practize of
his ordinances, and haue his aucthoritie &amp; promise of blessing to these
proceedings, because we haue the practize of <hi>Christes</hi> Apostles in plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the primatiue Churches, and now latelie th'examples of such as
endeuored to build this Church they liue in, we dare not by any vayne
hope or threates of this false Prophet be drawen to neglect so great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
to continue either in apostasie or disorder, and to transgresse or
neglect the Lordes commaundement.</p>

                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:4716:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
THe next obiection against vs is drawen from an especiall obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in our first <hi>Article,</hi> where we confessed the vniversal Church and
kingdome of CHRIST to extend to all such as by true faith apprehend
and confesse CHRIST IESVS, howsoeuer they be skattered, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
dispersed vpon the face of the whole earth. Hence Mr. GIFF.
concludeth, that seing the faithfull may be in state of grace and haue
CHRIST their Kinge, though they liue not vnder that gouernment &amp;
order that CHRIST hath established in and to his Church, therfore it
is not necessarie for priuate men to set yt vp. Sure this is a weake ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and not worth half the noting &amp; obseruation he hath made
of yt: we must for all this denie yt: and finde no more consequent,
then if he had therfore concluded that the communion of Sainctes,
the ministrie and ecclesiasticall gouernment of CHRIST are not to be
sought of the faithfull, because some faithfull may be saued that liue
not in an established church, vizt: such as are in captiuitie, sicknes, age,
or in such times &amp; place, as they knowe not where to finde one day of
the Sonne of man.<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 22. &amp;c.</note> He might aswell conclude, that because God is
able &amp; doth saue some in the false Church, Therfore priuate me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought
not to forsake the false Church. God is able to saue some in disperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of the established Church, Therfore priuate men ought not to
seek the established Church.</p>
               <p>THe last &amp; greatest matter is, that we runne before the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
whose dutie it is to reforme Churches. Priuate men
might not so much as sweepe them, much-lesse build them. For this is
to erect a state &amp; gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, because the power of the Church is both
publicke &amp; greate. We haue aboue shewed, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church hath Gods
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement &amp; authoritie alwaies, to erect <hi>Christes</hi> ministri &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongst them. That the Church in this estate consisteth only of
of priuate men, neither are there anie true Ministers anie where to be
found vpon the earth: neither any extraordinarie Ministers to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for, seing they are long since ceased. Therfore the Church in this
estate consisting only of priuate men, ought to erect this ministerie and
gouernment: ells should they also cease and neuer be had againe vpon
the earth: and so should there neuer be any established Church, minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
Sacramentes &amp;c, agayne in this world. yet here must be noted by
the way, that Mr. G. runneth too much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and wresteth too far these
wordes [<hi>priuate men</hi>] when we speake of the Church consisting only of
priuate men. Now vnto his crimination, the Church hauing this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
&amp; aucthoritie giuen of God vnto the worldes end, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shewed him that no Prince might take it away, or without great
wronge hinder them from the performance hereof. yea that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes
of God ought not to be staied from doing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements
of God, vpon anie restrainte or persecution of any mortall man who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.
For this we alleadged the examples and practize of the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
who then had bene guiltie of the same disobedience &amp; rebellion,
if Princes in this busines had bene to be stayed for, or their restrainte
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:4716:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had bene a sufficent let. yea that persecution and the crosse of <hi>Christ</hi>
were vtterly abolished, if the Church and faithfull were not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
in their dueties, vntill Princes giue leaue. We shewed also, that
the obedience and practize of Gods will was no disobedience or prei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
to the Prince. That we attempted nothing beyonde our calling,
neither transgressed in our calling. We medled not with the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of anie publick abuse either in the common wealth or in their
Church, otherwise, then by prayers vnto God, and godly exhortation.
We only according vnto Gods commandement refrained from their
idolatrie and other publicke euils, and assembled together in all holy
and peaceable maner to worship the Lord our God, and to ioyne our
selues together in the faith vnto mutual duties. This we shewed to be
the duetie of euerie priuate man that would be saued, to leaue the false
Church, and to seeke the true Church. And being thus assembled &amp;
ioyned in the faith, we shewed it to be their dutie together to seeke that
ministrie and gouernment which <hi>Christ</hi> hath left vnto his Church, and
for the Church to erect the same.</p>
               <p>VNto the Apostles proceeding without the licence of Princes he
maketh a double answere. One in respect of the persons of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
that they were furnished with a special co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
from CHRIST himself to set vp his kingdome: which commission
and power the Pastors and Teachers successiuely receiued &amp; deliuered
ouer to others, so that priuate men may not haue this power. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in respect of those Princes in the Apostles tyme, which were all
heathen, and therfore it had bene bootlesse to sue to them. But where
there is a christian Prince that holdeth the fundamentall poynctes of
the christian faith (though otherwise this christian Prince doe erre
in some matters of doctrine, or touching the rules of discipline) euerie
godly priuate man is to keepe a good conscience, not breaking the
vnitie and peace of the Church. But not to take publicke authoritie
to reforme.</p>
               <p>THese instances of the persons of the Apostles and Princes as they
are litle to the purpose, so doe they him as litle good. If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of God were sufficient warrant to the Apostles to doe
their worke, though al the Princes of the world resisted; then must
the commandement of the same God be of the same effect to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
instrumentes, whom it pleaseth the Lorde to vse in their callings
to his seruice also, though all the Princes in the world should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and forbid the same. For neither dignitie of the persons that
are vsed, make the commandement of God of more authoritie or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
to be donne: neither yet the greatnes or the goodnes of the
persons that withstand this commandement of God, make yt of lesse
authoritie or necessitie. Onlie let the seruantes of God be sure to
haue the commaundement and calling of their God for that they
doe, and then they neede not feare the Powers that are placed of<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:4716:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God for the praise and not for the punishment of the good. Our
question then is not whether priuate men may doe that which is not
their dutie, to which they haue no commanndement, as this accuser
surmizeth to bring vs into danger and hatred; But whether they may
not doe that which God commanndeth them, within the limites of
their caling. As to for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ake idolatrie and the false Church, to seke the
true worship of God in the true Church, though all the Princes of the
world, whether belieuers or infidels should forbid the same; And this
we affirme to be the duetie of euerie perticular person, whosoeuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.
We say not now that priuate men may reforme the false Church,
abolish publick idolatrie, or depose a false ministrie that the Kinge
setteth vpp. This were to breake the boundess of their calling, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
vpon the Princes office; and great cause had they then to feare,
for he beareth not the sworde in vayne. Againe, our question is not
whether it is the office and dutie of Princes to see abuses reformed
both in the Church and common Wealth (which we thinck no man to

In these abuses and corruptions euerie priuate man is to keepe

Because these Kinges are principal members of the Church &amp;c. What

contrarie this leauened traditionall proposition of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. is to all these

maintenance of the whole truth and the holy practize of the same; and
to cast out in his name and power all, that publicklie and obstinatlie

But if the least error be contrarie to true faith, the least transgression
sinne, and no knowen sinne or error to be committed or continued in:
howe can he persuade the Churche to commit or to contynue in anie
error or transgression? so highly to tempt and prouoke the Lorde?
And now to the poynct. we would know of him whether anie Prince,
much-lesse a christian Prince, may abrogate the commandement of
God, or take away that power and aucthoritie that God hath giuen to
the Church vnto the worldes end. If not, but that the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God remaine alwaies the same, and the Churche hath the
same power vnder a christian magistrate, that vnder a heathen, why
then yt ought not to proceede to the obedience and practize of Gods
worde, whether in correcting and redressing faultes, or in going fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
in the wayes of God as they are reueiled vnto them, as well and
freelie vnder a Christian Prince as vnder an heathen? Is it because a
Christian Princd is the principall and greatest member of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
why by so much the rather ought and the better may the Church doe
it, hauing now such a singular help and rare accomplement of so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
a member. Euerie true member is giuen for the help and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and not for the hindrance and hurt of the body: Wee may then
much better conclude, that the Church vnder a christian Prince may
procede with all freedome in the sincere practize of CHRISTES Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:
because he is a member of CHRIST &amp; of the Church: then vnder
an infidel Prince, that is an enimie to CRHIST and to the Church.</p>
               <p>ANother reason he bringeth, whie the Churche vnder a christian
Prince may not reforme without his licence, or vntill hee will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the office of a christian Prince to reforme the Church, and
therfore the Church in taking such a publicke worke vpon them,
shoulde but vsurpe and encroch vpon his office. Because wee are so
apt to mis-vnderstand one an other, and to take words in too lardge or
straight a sense, it were good wee set downe what is meant by this <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
here spoken of, before we proceede. Wee meane then by <hi>reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
to reduce all thinges and actions to the true antient and primatiue
paterne of Gods worde. This we graun to be the office and duetie of
the Prince to doe aswel in the Church as in the common Wealth. The
Princes eye may suffer no transgression of Gods lawe, he is to ouersee,
and see euerie one to doe their dueties in the office and caling God
hath placed them. Yet is this no preiudize to the Christian libertie
and power of the Church, no impediment to anie member therof,
but rather a singular preseruation of all dueties, and an excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation
of them all to doe the wil of God in their calings. For in all
this here is no power giuen the Prince to restraine anie iore of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
and power of the Church, or to with-hold anie one person from
doing the whole will of God in their caling: Much-lesse is here anie
power giue the Prince to drawe or compel the Church or any member
therof to the least transgression or error: yea when the Prince shall in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4716:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
anie thing be founde contrarie to God, God is then to be obeyed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then man. And this is no disobedience to the Princes soueraigne
and supreame power ouer al persons and causes ecclesiastical or ciuile,
is no preiudize or impediment to the Church, or to anie member
therof, from doing the whole will of God in their calings: So in like
maner are not the proceedings of the Church according to CHRISTES
Testament, any derogation from or enchrochment of, the royal power
and prerogatiue of Princes, as this false Prophet out of the mouth of
<hi>Sathau</hi> woulde perswade: but rather a singular preservation and most
rare illustratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof. Whose reignes are neuer so glorious as when, or
glorious but when, God is worshipped and obeyed according to his
reueiled worde, and those most chearished and fauored, that are most
faithful therin. In the Church of CHRIST are al duties most faithfullie
taught, and no knowen transgression of anie knowen duetie suffred,
either to God or man. Howe then can <hi>Sathan</hi> himself say, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Church, or rather or <hi>Christ</hi> in his Church, are contrarie
to, or derogate from the royall power of Princes? They cannot be of
God that thus set at variance these blessed powers which God hath so
conioyned and contempered for the mutual help each of other, and
the seruice of his glorie. No it is the false Church and this antichris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
hierarchie that are preiudicial vnto, enchroch vpon, and vsurp the
Royall aucthoritie, power, iurisdiction, titles, honors, prerogatiues,
lads, palaces, pompe &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Princes. The true Church both knoweth
howe to obey the Lorde, and their Prince in the Lorde. They vsurpe
not the Princes office when they reforme anie publick fault in the
worship, administration, gouernment ecclesiastical &amp;c, but execute
their owne office. For this is not the Princes office to doe in person,
but to commande the Church to doe it by such instrumentes as God
hath ther vnto ordayned. This commandment of the Prince doth
neither giue the Church more power, or make the action more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
Neither doth the prohibition of anie Prince take away this power
of the Church that God hath giuen, or make the action that God hath
commanded more vnlawful. How then doth the Church more sinne
in doing these duties in reformation and correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of publick faultes,
and proceeding in the practize of Gods will, (which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be donne by his Church) then anie priuate man sinneth,
when he correcteth anie fault in himself or in his family, or beginneth
to doe anie duetie (which he before neglected) without his Princes ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence?
Seing the Princes eye, power, and office extendeth aswell to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
as to ecclesiastical dueties, aswell to priuate as to publick reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
yea the Princes licence in al Christian consideration, extendeth
to al godly duties &amp; honest actions, euen to as many things either to be
donne or to be left vndo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of God extend vnto;
For he is the Minister of God for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praise of them that do wel, and for
the punishment of them that doe euill. when the Prince resisteth or
suffreth not the worde of God to haue free passage, he sinneth &amp; doth
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:4716:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not his duety. But this ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no excuse for vs to cease to doe the wil of
God, or to intermit our duetie. If he drawe the sword and smite vs for
wel doing, that but augmenteth his sinne, and the blessing of God res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vpon vs that suffer for righteousnes sake. wee may not for feare
of persecution, or for the indignation of Princes leaue the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God vndonne. For that were with this false Prophet to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
the lawe of God to the wil of Princes, and vtterly to abolish the
crosse of <hi>Christ</hi> out of the world, For Princes neuer punish me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but for breaking their hestes. Beastly then &amp; hellish is the speach
of this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, That saith, the Church refuseth the peace of their Prince,
and prouoketh him to strike, when they either reforme such faultes as
are in the Church, or proceed to doe such things as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them, though the Prince forbid and wil not giue licence. But
especiallie where the blasphemer is not afraid to say, that the Church
when it procedeth to the establishing and practize of <hi>Christes</hi> ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
erecteth a state &amp; gouernment of their owne. Doe they erect anie
thing of themselues, or that CHRIST himself hath not erected? Is not
this to accuse CHRIST of treason, because he saith he is a Kinge? And
his seruants of sedition, because they set vp his kingdome without the
licence, and against the will of Princes, though it cost them their liues
for the same? Is not this man a faithful seruant of CHRIST, a faithfull
subiect to his Prince that so reprocheth CHRISTS heauenlie kingdom,
reiecteth his ordinances and commandments to make them depend
vpon the wil of Princes, that so seduceth his Prince, and would drawe
her into battell against God almighty and his Church? Yea if to set vp
<hi>Christes</hi> kingdome in a christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> estate without the leaue or licence of the
Prince or state, be rebellion and disobedience, a derogation from their
sacred power, an intrusion into their high office, how then will he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
our Sauiour CHRIST himself? who being borne in the flesh, but in
th' estate of a subiect and a priuate man (hee neither being Minister of
the Temple, nor magistrate in the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Wealth, and that in a godly
state vnder faithful magistrates, as himself acknowledgeth) did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
by al meanes in deuour to set vp his kingdome, preached,
baptized, caled al men vnto him, although the whole state and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
earnestly sorbad and resisted him. Those gouernours were to be
obeyed, and he himself was obedient in al things, as became a true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.
If it be answered that he did it by the especial commission and
commandment of God; Wee readilie graunt that a sufficient warrant
vnto him before God and men: as also vnto all others that haue the
commandement of the same God for that they doe. But what is this
to our question? Whether the Church or such as haue aucthoritie
from God, ought to be stayed from doing the commandment of God,
by the inhibition of a christian Prince or state? Wee graunte it high
sinne and intollerable presumption for anie that haue not aucthoritie
of God, to enterprise to doe anie thing in the Church, whether with or
without their Princes licence. But if yt be vnlawful for the Church, or
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4716:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such as haue aucthoritie of God, without the licence of their christian
Prince or gouernours, Then verilie our Sauiour &amp; his Disciples offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
herein, who stayed not to doe the will of his heauenlie Father for
the threates &amp; laying wayte of the Rulers. Furder, if it be vnlawfull &amp;
derogatorie to a Christian Princes office &amp; aucthoritie, for anie to doe
Gods wil in their callings, and for the Church to proceede in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
of CHRISTES Testament, though against his wil, Then is it also vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
vnder a heathen Prince. For the christian and heathen Princes
haue one and the same aucthoritie, office, duetie, to see all thinges
both in the Church and in the commune Wealth donne according to
the wil of God. There is the same reuerence and obedience (though
I say not the same bowells of loue) due to the heathen, that is due to
the christian Prince in regarde of their office. The heathen Prince
shall answere aswell as the christian for the neglect of their duetie, for
the abuse of their power and place. And thus also if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. doctrines
be sownd, the Apostles likewise sinned against the aucthoritie of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in erecting CHRISTS kingdome, and the Churches in proceeding
to receiue the same, and to doe the wil of God, without their Princes
licence, and notwitstanding their prohibition, Seing that the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
Princes haue the same place, office, and aucthoritie, and ought
to haue the same obediene in respect thereof, that christian Princes
haue, or ought haue. And sure most diuelish and detestable are these
two published and generallie receiued opinions of these contrarie fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our English Cleargie men; The one giuing out, that the forme
of ecclesiasticall gouernment prescribed in CHRISTS Testament, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
by the Apostles and primatiue Churches in the tymes of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
is not nowe necessarie or tollerable vnder a Christian Prince.
The other giuing out, that those ordinances and that gouernment
which they acknowledge CHRIST to haue instituted and prescribed
to his Church vnto the worldes end, may not nowe, vnder a christian
Prince, be put in practize by the Church, if he forbid the same, as
they might, ought, and were vnder heathen Princes by the faithful in
all ages. With the one of these blasphemous positions, the Prelates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their outragious gouernment, and all their antichristian procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
with the other, the tyme-seruers these counterfeite <hi>Reformistes,</hi>
colour and defend their perfidie, not witnessing vnto and practizing
the Gospell of <hi>Christ,</hi> and their seruile subiection to the gouernment of
<hi>Antichrist.</hi> By which positions both sides most impiously abrogate the
heauenlie gouernment and ordinances of <hi>Christ</hi> in his Church, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerably
seduce and abuse that most blessed and comfortable ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the christian Magistracie. Both of them hereby shut vp the
kingdome of heauen against all men, neither entring themselues nor
suffring such as would, but holding the whole land vnder the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
gouernment of <hi>Antichrist</hi> in the wrath of God, whose iudgment
therfore sleepeth not.</p>

out of a certaine answere made by me HENRIE BARROVVE to three
greate Bishops of this land  where being demaunded whether the
Queene may make lawes for the Church which are not contrarie to
the worde of God. I (seeing wherat they aymed: vzt: to maintayne al
these popish reliques, deuises, tromperies &amp;c, wherwith their worship
&amp; Church is pestered) answered (as I remember) to this effect. That
no Prince, neither al the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, not the Church yt self, could
make any lawes for the Church, other then CHRIST hath left in his
worde: But I thought it the dutie of euerie Prince (especially of euerie
christian Prince) to enquire out &amp; renewe the lawes of God, and to stir
vp all their subiects vnto more diligent &amp; careful keeping of the same.
This answere M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. after his accustomed maner pronownceth <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisticall,
de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ijng and cutting off a great part of the power God hath giuen vnto Princes: and
a great part of Discipline.</hi> Proof of these chardges he maketh none, except
we must take these two assertions in way of proofe, vntill he bring bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The first is, that CHRIST hath giuen general lawes or rules for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of circumstance that be indifferent &amp; variable in the perticulars,
and so to be altered and abolished, as the peace and edification of the
Church shall require. And therfore that Princes with the Church are
to ordaine &amp; to establish such orders by those generall rules, as may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
for iust cause be altered. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. his antecedent here is so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
&amp; extendent, his conclusion so doubtful and indefinite, taking such
roome to himself in both to escape &amp; euade, as except he drawe nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
and in his next booke take the paynes to set downe what he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in his proposition by [<hi>general lawes &amp; rules</hi>] and by [<hi>matters of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>]
And in his conclusion, what kinde of orders those [<hi>such orders</hi>] are
the Prince should ordeine &amp; establish, he shalbe so far from distressing
or convincing me, as I shall neuer perceiue where he is, or where about
he goeth. This when he shal doe, then I shall knowe what to answere
him. In the meane tyme I confesse manie thinges of <hi>circumstance</hi> as the
tyme &amp; place of assembling, what scriptures to reade or to interprete,
how longe to continue in prayer or prophecie &amp;c, to be left in libertie
at the discretion of the Church, to be wisely vsed according to their
present occasions, to edification, order, decencie. Of these &amp; sondrie
such like, the Lord in wisedome sawe it not good to set downe positiue
or permanent lawes for all Churches and tymes: because the present
estate and diuers occasions of all Churches, yea of anie one Church,
are so diuers &amp; variable, that prescript definitiue lawes could not be set
of such things in perticular for the space of one moneth, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>veniences &amp; great preiudize to the Church. Of such things
then as the Lord for these wise endes &amp; waighty causes hath left in the
libertie &amp; discreation of the Church to be vsed and ordered according
to the present estate and occations therof &amp;c, may man make no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
positiue lawes in perticular, to enioyne therby this forme, this
tyme &amp;c vpon all or vpon anie one Church, without restrayning that,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:4716:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which God hath left at libertie; yea without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trolling &amp; contrarijng
the wisdome of God (which no doubt is most excellently perfect euen
in the least thinges) and without manie other grieuous inconveniences
&amp; intollerable preiudize to the Church of God. Much better therfore
should the Prince prouide for the Church to see them duly to obserue
the lawes that God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to vse their libertie aright, Or where
they transgresse in either of these, to reprooue or to correct according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then to make and enioyne new lawes of his owne deuising, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the libertie, yea euen to that order &amp; discipline CHRIST hath
giuen: which cannot be ioyned vnto, exercised, or preserued by anie
other lawes then God hath made; as by due examination in perticular
of the least or best thing they thus deuise and enioyne, will appeare.
CHRIST that great Architect of his house hath left vs a most absolute
&amp; exact paterne of all things belonging therevnto. vnto which no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
deuise can more be added or ioyned, then heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth can be
commingled. Wherefore we may by better right esteeme M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G. a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter
of CHRISTS discipline, or rather a fordger of a newe discipline,
for making &amp; bringing in new lawes into the church other then Gods
lawes, Then he may pronownce vs denyers &amp; cutters off of CHRISTES
discipline, for allowing and receiuing no lawes for anie action in the
Church, but Gods lawes.</p>
               <p>HIs other reason is this. Princes ought to establish the whole christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
religion, to punish idolaters, wicked despisers, heretickes, schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
blasphemers  But this ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be donne but by lawes made
&amp; established: Therfore Princes ought to make lawes for the Church.
And I in denijng this, denie a great part of that power, which God hath
giuen vnto Princes. His first proposition is no more then I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
in mine answere. If he vnderstand his second proposition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lawes then God hath made, I then denie yt as most false &amp; vntrue.
whereof vntill he make proofe, he hath not obtayned his purpose, nor
convinced mine answere. And therfore til then must withdrawe his
triumphant conclusions. I hold that Gods true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is only founded
vpon, and established by his owne holie worde &amp; lawes, and not vpon
or by mans lawes: And that the Prince may aswel make a newe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as newe lawes for religion. Furder, as I hold in Gods worde suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
rules &amp; directions for all actions of the Church: So hold I in the
same most iust iudgments &amp; meete punishments to euerie transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
So that the Prince can no way better advance &amp; establish true religion
then by, yea can no way establish by but yt, the promulgation, and due
execution of Gods lawes: calling all men of all degrees to the hearing
&amp; sincere practize thereof in their calings, and dulie punishing al such
as transgresse the same after such order proclamed &amp; established. God
hath incommended &amp; inioyned the booke of his lawe to all Princes,
therbie the gouerne both the Church &amp; common Wealth in al things,
as we plentifullie reade <hi>Deut. 17. 18. 19. &amp; 5. 32. &amp; 29. 9. &amp;c. and 4. 6. Ioshu. 1.
8. 1 Kinges. 2. 3. 1 Chron.</hi> 28. and in sondrie other places. The Kinge is not
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:4716:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made the Lord, but the Minister of Gods lawe, to which he is bownde,
and for the transgression therof shall answere vnto God, as anie other
person. He is placed in the seate of God, and the worde of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vnto him, not to alter or neglect the least part thereof, Not to
make newe lawes, but to keepe &amp; see obserued those lawes which God
hath made. Greate then is their ignorance that thincke not that God
hath giuen sufficient instruction &amp; direction in his holie worde for all
actions of his Church. And greater their wickednes that knowing
this, dare giue mortal men leaue to make lawes for Gods Church. If
they say that the Princes lawe must be consonant to Gods lawe, Then I
answere they haue warrant &amp; groundworke in Gods worde. which if
they haue, then are they Gods &amp; not mans lawe: For Gods lawe exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
as farr as the equitie of his law extendeth. But what lawes soeuer
haue no warrant of groundworke in Gods worde, those cannot be said
to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sonant to Gods wil, because there we haue the whole minde of
CHRIST, and so are to be auoyded as superfluous, burdenous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to Gods word, how necessarie or expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t soeuer they may seeme

weighed, which because he hath taken in hande to perticulate after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
I wil only shew one here wherin we make such a difference, as al

so that their separation was more like the sectes and schismes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monst

and placed in the seate &amp;c. Thus farre I trust it will be granted me his
peeces of cloth are not both of a woll; for the difference, I refer to the
obstinate &amp; heynouse tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgressions wherwith we haue chardged these

their matter being about sinnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in the Church, where there
was lawful office, worship, gouernment as they did not denie; and our

from the Apostasie, from all them that remaine vnder that Apostatical

warrant to separate <hi>Reuel</hi> 18. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>Now to the poinct: These Numidian Bishops taught, that so manie
as would saue their soules, must separate themselues. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. GIFFARD wil
graunt I doubt not, that if there were no true Church, true ministerie,
nor no true sacramentes, it was tyme to come out from amongst them,
and haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with the tables of Diuells, as the Apostle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth

do not so; but we separate according to Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement from the
false Church, false ministerie, worship, and Sacramentes. Proue your
Church therfore a true Church, or our separation is iust and holy, and
the only way to saluation. In the meane tyme let the Papist reason thus
with you: You separate from our Church, therfore you are Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
Donatistes, Heretickes. If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. GIFFARD say no we hold you the
true Church, to haue the seales of the Couenant, to hold many doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines

he say separation from the false Church is a commandement of God,

that make a separation, but the cause must be considered from
whome, for which, in what maner, and to what we separate or ioyne.</p>
            <p>Where he alledgeth that <hi>Augustine</hi> thought it an vnequall thing to
condemne as they did at the first all the world for one mans sinne;
namely, for the sinne of this <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and they therevpon tooke on

            <p>THus we see (saith he) that the <hi>Donatistes</hi> departed disorderly out of
the Church, not condemning yt for anie poincte of doctrine, for
therein they did not disagree. Herein then we cannot be compared,
till you haue prooued your parish assemblies the true Church; and we
holde that you haue poysoned all the fountaines of sincere doctrine,
and peruert the whole Testament, and turne away the practize thereof
by your damnable false expositions, yea that you teach not one poincte
sincerely. Againe, where you say afterward that you will affirme the
worship in the Churches from which the <hi>Donatistes</hi> separated as corrupt

by repentance, which your parish assemblies neuer did. But this (set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

where no separation is made from Idolatrous prophane Atheistes, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes,
tyrannicall persecutors, nor no couenant entred by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnto the obedience and orderly practize of CHRISTES ordinances,

            <p>Now looke saith he vpon the <hi>Donatistes</hi> of England. Antichrist hath

that as they made all their quarrell for <hi>Caecilianus</hi> his vnmeetnes for his

the true apparant Church of God. First we answere, that we take not

the falsly called Fathers of the Sea of ROME, and more generally of
all that exalt themselues aboue the ordinances of CHRIST and his
Church, establishing their owne deuises in place thereof, or giue life
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:4716:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto the image of the Beast; for if the same markes of pride, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
and tyrannie, erection of a strange ministerie, lifting vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
aboue CHRISTS Testament, ordinances, and worship, be sound
emongst your spirituall Lords in England, we see not but Antichrist
spoken of by <hi>Paul</hi> may be also found amongst you. Now if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. GIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FARD
had considered <hi>Caecilianus</hi> his estate (who at the hardest was but
vncapable of that lawfull office, and to that lawfull administration, as
it was on both sides supposed, and concerning the outward order or
maner lawfully ordeyned) there can be no comparison betwene him
and Antichrist. And for Antichristes sitting in the Temple of God,
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. GIFFARD must know, that manie times the Church is called the
Church, not because yt remayneth still vnder the outward couenant,
but because yt sometimes did so: yea and at the first creeping vp of
that man of sinne, while the iniquitie wrought in a mysterie, yt was
the Church out of which he sprang, and in which he sometimes sat.
The holy Ghost giueth vs then hereby to vnderstand, that this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
who should change the holy ordinances, should be an Apostata,
he should be neither Turke nor Pagan, but the bottomlesse pit should
be opened by him in more subtile and strange delusions; out of which
smoke all your ministerie is proceeded. But when he had changed
the ordinances, destroyed euery greene thing, caused all high and
low, rich and poore to receiue his marke in their hande or foreheade,
and suffred none to buye and sell which would not fall downe and
worship him, the sunne now couered with sackcloth, the Moone tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into blood, the starrs fallen from heauen, the true worshippers
murthered if any one stood vp, Gods curses threatned to all that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
the Beast or his image, or receiued his marke in their hand or

Church of God, lest he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne not only the scriptures, but al whome
God commanded to come out of her, calling her the mother of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
the harlot that sitteth vpon many waters, hold of all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
spirits, cage of all vncleane and hatefull birdes, confused <hi>Babell</hi>
&amp;c. So that if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. GIFFARD had anie salt of grace, he would better
pervse the booke of <hi>Reuelations,</hi> which with all the prophesies of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
of CHRIST himself, and of his Apostles, make manifest this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Apostasie and defection vnder Antichrist, and not now tell vs a
tale of <hi>Caecilianus.</hi> Doth he not see in the whole Booke the false Church
&amp; true lyuely described? the one worshipping the Beast, the other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Lambe; the one persecuted, the other persecuting in most
bloody murder of the Sainctes.</p>
            <p>Well (saith he) but Antichrist is disclosed by the glorious light of the
Gospel, his damnable doctrine, cursed idol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>trie, and vsurped tyrannie,
are cast forth of this land, the true doctrine of faith is published &amp;c.
First we must here demaunde, whether these assemblies were then
the true Church when they were ledd by those damnable doctrines,
and lyued in that cursed idolatrie, bowing downe to the Beast, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:4716:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
persecuting the Sainctes. Secondly, as we are not vnthankfull for the
abandoning of the POPES person, supremacie, with much of his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
wares, we demaund of you what you thinke of those persons
which set ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his shoppes againe, keepe his Courtes, and exercise like
vsurped power and tyrannie that was before. But to answere directly,
Antichrist is not discouered in your assemblies, his da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable doctrines,
cursed idolatries, vsurped tyrannie, are not cast forth, the doctrine of
faith is not sincerely published. Againe, what is al this to the prouing
of a true Church, a lawfull ministerie, true worship, and holy gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of CHRIST. Your parish assemblies were receiued from the <hi>Popes</hi>
hand, without anie conuersion by repentance or orderly gathering by
doctrine into any communion, the Popes ministerie set ouer them, the
worship, though a litle changed out of latine into english, some of
theirs left out, but al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> remayneth either take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Portesse or mens
deuises, these assemblies still gouerned by those Courtes, Officers and
Canons, that before. What place hath now <hi>Christes</hi> Testament amongst
you? how is Antichrist discouered, or his damnable wares cast forth? Is
it not made subiect to these Antichristian ordinances, ministerie, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
gouernment? It is not limited, stinted, and aportioned, no further
to be opened then to vphold these execrable orders, idolatries, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges?
yea is not only the bare name therof vsed as a stale, and doctrine
therof peruerted to the deceiuing of the people in this estate? <hi>Moses</hi> law
was read euerie Sabboth day in their Synagogs, when they crucified
CHRIST: But you should haue proued you had such assemblies, such a
ministeri, such a worship, such a gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as the Gospel prescribeth.
Being then the same assemblies, contynuing in false worship vnder the
same ministerie, gouernment, al the Atheistes, Papistes, Hereticks, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
officers &amp;c, in one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mixture that the POPE left, we may wel
affirme you to remaine stil the marcked seruantes of Antichrist, not
speaking here how many Antichristes are here exalted: leauing the
damnable doctrines, cursed idolatrie, false preaching of the Gospell, to
our lardger discourse in due place.</p>
            <p>But now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. GIFFARD beholding these things, that they haue made
no separation, nor drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people vnto the ordinances of the Gospel,
is compelled to runne backe againe to iustifie the Church of ROME,
and to maintaine that these assemblies were the true Churches of <hi>Christ</hi>
in the deepest defection vnder Antichrist: The Apostasie hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
the Church, yt contynued euen then the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God in which
Antichrist did sit, and that the very Idolators were sealed with the seale
of Baptisme, professed CHRIST in some poinctes rightly, their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
from antient discent within the Couenant, the ministeri so far remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as yt was the authentick seale delyuered by them; the <hi>Brownistes</hi>
not vnderstanding the scripture, thus in mad furie lyke blynde hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
condemne &amp;c. Let vs reason a litle more coolely, rage will not
serue to carie the matter. We will here take it granted that your pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
ministerie &amp;c cannot now be proued the Church and ministerie
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:4716:119"/>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> except they were so in the time of poperie. We see further how
wel the Gospel is opened or Antichrist discouered with you, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such
a famous Prophet hath not learned to reade the mysterie writté in that
Womans forehead, which the holy Ghost recordeth to be this [<hi>grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

scripture saith <hi>Cap. 14. If any man worship the Beast &amp; his image, and receiue a marke

wil M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Giffard</hi> make this Woman, if not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> sitting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the people, tongues, and nations that were seduced or are seduced in
this Apostasie. And howe hath he read the scriptures that saith, the
seales of the Couenant belong to open blasphemous Idolators &amp; their
seede? God saith, hee will punish the transgression vnto the third and
fourth generation: He saith nay, though they be the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and contynue in their Fathers steppes, they ought to haue the seals
of the Couenant. Againe, if he say the seale of Baptisme in the false

blasphemous sacrifice and bread God, against which so manie witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
haue gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their lyues, which is plainely denijng of <hi>Christ</hi> to be come

how ignorantly he speaketh of the Couenant, and of a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
made by that ministerie, it were too long to discusse. Wel, in al this he
hath forgotten his comparison betwene the <hi>Donatistes</hi> and vs; they had
no such controuersie with <hi>Caecilianus:</hi> but now pervse one of Mr. <hi>Giffards.</hi>
The Church of papacie in the deepest defectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the visible Temple
of God, hauing the true seales of the Couenant. I then reason thus:
The Church of of <hi>Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eua, Scotland, lowe Contries, France &amp;c.</hi> haue separated from
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which is the apparant Church of God, (for none
haue the true ministerie &amp; the true authentick seales of the Couenant,
but the true Churche) Therefore they are Schismaticks, Donatistes,
Brownists, Hereticks. Againe <hi>Geneua, Scotland &amp;c,</hi> condemne the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> by separating from yt; therefore they do also condemne the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> which approueth of and communicateth with the
Papistes. Moreouer howe wil he answere this: Her Ma<hi rend="sup">•ie</hi>. hath expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Pope, his ministerie, his doctrine, and idolatrous worship; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she hath expelled the ministerie and worship of the true Church:
And what followeth by Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> his collections think you? they that
reiect the ministerie of <hi>Christ,</hi> reiect <hi>Christ</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>But these <hi>Brownis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

No, it is a false sclander: We only put difference betwene the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Magistrates sworde, and the reformation by doctrine; and
he is a false Prophet that either goeth about to set these at variance, or
confoundeth them. The Magistrat suppresseth the euill within the
Church &amp; without the Church in their Dominions by bodily punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
in equitie, and defendeth the godly. The ministerie of the word

proclaime and commaund true worship, orderly assemblies, true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
&amp;c. But the workmanship hereof is spiritual, by doctrine &amp;c,
to be accomplished in due order according to the rule of the word. Stil
wee vrge you therfore to shewe vs this gathering, ordering, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a true Church in these parrish assemblies, by the word of God.
In the meane time you bestowe but your oyle, meale, and your whole

suffice that he sacrificed the Priestes of BAAL vpon the Altar, reduced
the people to the true ministerie and ordinances of the Temple; If the

and to be punashed by his sword. So that these false Prophets, Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
counterfeit time-seruers (which extol her Ma<hi rend="sup">ti•</hi> for hauing gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted
the freedome of the Gospel, true ministerie, true worship, gouernment

shall not only lye open to the Magistrates sworde when God shall
put in their heart to execute his wil, but answere before the Lord for al
this confusion, sacriledge, Idolatrie, and filthines maintained by their
deceitful tongues. I do not pleade to haue them put to death, because
they neuer knew or prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wee are not deceiued then in imagining that you woulde make vs
belieue the Princes did compell them to be a Churche which were no
Church before, without any orderly gathering, guyding, and ordering

you here take my answere, that vve deny these parrish assemblies to be
true Churches, or to haue anie power or aucthoritie to cast our any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

make the controuersie of open sinners in the Church, but as a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

We know that in the true Church are &amp; shalbe ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinners,
yet ther are rules &amp; lawes by due censure to bring them to repentance,
or els to cast them out if they remaine obstinate in anie open grosse
sinne, of which things we wil not enter into discourse with you, denijng
you to haue eyther true Church, or power to redresse abuses in your
parrish assemblies.</p>
               <p>And where he demandeth vvhat order of discipline wee haue obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

               <p>Now after his former discour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, he will from poinct to poinct proue
vs to agree with the <hi>Donatistes.</hi> First (saith he) the <hi>Donatistes</hi> did accuse and
condemne the Churche and ministerie of the Churches most falslie.
And I say (saith he) the <hi>Brownistes</hi> are as false accusers as they, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
as iniustly in all crimes. Here are bold and sore chardges; but
Mr. <hi>Giffards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> bare word wil not stand. The <hi>Donatistes</hi> cause was not about
the orderly gathering of a true Church, but for the casting out of the
vnworthie: not about the office, entrance, or administration of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie,
but about the sinnes of such as were in that office: So that if
Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> would looke againe of the cause, he should finde no cause to
keepe this stirr as vpon a stage to no end or edifijng. Wee haue often
told him in our former writinges, that our matter is not about offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the Church, but about the beeing or not beeing a Church. In
the meane time he handsomly layeth vpon their owne filthines saying
companies and swarmes of drunckardes, gluttons, whoremasters, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
worldlings, greedie vsurers, extortioners, oppressours, bribers,
defrauders, lyers, backbyters and sclanderers, envious hateful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
persons, swearers and cursers are suffred and admitted to the

And many of their ministeri such. Where admit them a Church
in his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit, let him ad now this more which is as true; that they
haue no power to redresse these euils by due censure, for that they thus
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tynue after they haue bene long &amp; ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reproued for this sacriledge,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:4716:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>

a cage of vncleane spirits, as the harlot that receiueth all commers, cast
together into <hi>Iesabels</hi> bed.</p>
               <p>Hee further confesseth that the threatnings of the Prophets against
<hi>Israel</hi> are due vnto them; Whereby hee confesseth these assemblies not
to be the Churches of God: For all the Prophets that prophesied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Israel</hi> in the defection, pronounce her not to be the Churche of
God; reade <hi>Hosea. 1. &amp;. 2. Ieremie. 3. Ezechiell.</hi> 23. But saith he, might not the
<hi>Donatistes</hi> haue pleaded that there were manie wicked people &amp; wicked
Ministers in those Churches from which they separated. We answere,
that is not questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; For first we denie you to haue anie Church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

which they did not: And againe we haue not to reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what they might
haue excepted against those assemblies or ministers, but what they
made the cause of their separation; wherein you trouble but your self,
and with odiouse names deceiue the ignorant, to make anie shewe of
agreement betwene our cause and theirs.</p>
               <p>It wil be demanded (saith he) whither <hi>Cyprian</hi> &amp; the rest of the godly
did worship together with those open sinners in their dayes, ioyning
with them in prayer and in the sacramentes &amp;c. No, the question shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
Mr. <hi>Giffard,</hi> Whether if they did communicate with the open trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
of the lawe in their time, they did wel and lawfully therein, or
no; for I trust you will graunt that the Church hath alwayes power to
cast out the obstinate offenders; reade then the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a litle more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratly, and tel vs whether they faulted not in keeping
in their fellowship the incestious person, and for not purging out the
leauen from amongst them; for what saith the text, <hi>Now I write vnto you
that you companie not together; If anie that is called a brother be a fornicator, or an Idolator,

commixion, if not in that holy banquet and coniunction in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

spiritual things, he might see the outward signes of bread and wyne to
be tokens not only of our vnion with <hi>Christ</hi> and benefit of his death, but
also of our communion vvith the members of his bodye spiritually; as
the holy Ghost reasoneth saijng, <hi>The cup of blessing vvich vvee blesse, is yt not
the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the blood of CHRIST, and the bread vvhich vve breake, is it not the comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

are partakers of one bread:</hi> For vs then to come together in this banquet and
spiritual reioycing with the members of CHRIST (to our iudgment) we
haue true comfort one with another: But with the open prophane or
obstinate open knowen transgressor ther ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no good reioycing, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,

delyuering the signe of Gods Couenant with his people in CHRIST,
to the treaders vnder their feete of his body and blood; so the whole
Congregation, and euery one that participateth with those open wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
transgresse (in not admonishing &amp; casting out the leauen) against
so manie rules as command admonition &amp; excommunication by due
order, and partake with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked against God by their reioycing with
them as bretheren. But (as I haue stil pleaded with you) we know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
order then blinde separation in pride, for the sinnes committed in
the Church; denijng to reason with you what is to be done in the
Church, till you haue proued your Church to be a true Church esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
guyded by the officers and lawes of CHRIST; so that all your
matter is but the fighting with your owne shadowe, and flying the
question in hand.</p>
               <p>But my purpose is not to follow your gameplay either to iustifie the
<hi>Donatistes,</hi> or those learned Pastors, neither to reiect the truthes, nor
maintaine the errors of either of both sides; we haue a better foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to buyld vpon, and a surer word to trust vnto; it is because you
haue no furniture on your self that you set forth this shew, and fight
vnder other mens names; Your sauour is lost if euer you had salt:
Looke on one of your Arguments how well it wil prooue your matter.
The <hi>Brownistes</hi> vse 5. or 6. places of scripture which the <hi>Donatistes</hi> vsed;
therfore the <hi>Brownistes</hi> be <hi>Donatistes.</hi> Let the <hi>Brownistes</hi> answere for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
but sure I must deny both Proposition and Consequence: For
neither do we agree in the application of these, with them; neither do
we aledge all the same places because we alledge some which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of the open knowen obstinat wicked in the
Church, or separation from the false Church. Neither doth it follow
that because we alledge some places they did, that therfore we are <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natistes.</hi>
If you allow anie separation from <hi>Turke</hi> or <hi>Pope,</hi> you must agree
with <hi>Donatistes</hi> in some of these scriptures. <hi>Esaias 52. 2 Corixth.</hi> 6. And in
this your exquisit search you haue had one place alledged yet now,
which if you had well looked vpon, you would haue bene ashamed to

where your mother Church of ROME with all her Daughters is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed
no longer to be rested in, or communicated with. If your as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies

               <p>Where in consideration that you would conningly turne away all
places that commaund a separation, by other mens expositions, and
haue not managed your cause in your owne name, I will brieflie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
whither you wil maintaine these doctrines or no: For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
whereof I shall either refer you to our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling of the 4. trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
or els gyne you answere when you deale perticularly in your

Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, that the Minister being a swearer, drunkerd, couetous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
&amp;c, he continuing obstinate in his sinne, in that estate may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
to administer, and the godly may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with him in sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes

               <p>Thirdly, that it is lawful for the Minister to delyuer, the parties to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,

               <p>Fourthly, that open sinne may be tollerated in the assemblie.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that when open sinners be common, and such persons manie,
it were no safe to vse the censures of the Church.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that ther may be a separating in heart, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out from

               <p>That ther is no polution, participation, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating with other
mens sinnes, but either by doing the same euill, or consenting in heart
to the euill; and though they remaine in their open filthines vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
our communicating with them in the sacrament or prayer, or the
priestes delyuerie of the Sacrament vnto them, is no reioycing with
them in their sinne, no communicating with other mens sinnes, no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
or consenting or approuing of them in euill, nor no sinne or
transgression in vs.</p>
               <p>That they which are the Temple of the lyuing God, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of a crooked &amp; peruerse nation, apearing as lightes in the world,
hauing the word of life, nothing can infect them which they tollerat
for vnities sake, neither are they put vp in anie straight, because God
dwelleth in them and walketh amongst them.</p>
               <p>That to separat from such a peruerse and crooked generation were
dangerous, lest we should separat in spiritual separatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the good,
such separation were seditious.</p>

               <p>That when he which for some notorious crime is reprehended hath

but to tollerat.</p>
               <p>That the cause &amp; person of the tares being vnderstood of the open

               <p>The causes &amp; person of the chaffe, bad fishes, goates, vessells of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour

Church, admonition, excommunication &amp;c, but the vse of the magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trats
sword not only needlesse, but vtterly vnlawfull to be exercised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
anie transgression. Let Mr. GIFFARD see how he is plunged in
Anabaptistrie, Athisme, and blasphemous contradiction of the whole
reueiled will of God for the cutting downe of sinne. But let Mr. GIF.
or his Ordinarie in their owne name subscribe these foresaid Positions,
and he shal heare our answere: We wil not confute them in the persons
of dead men.</p>
               <p>We then conclude this point thus; that Mr. GIFFARD hath igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
skambled about the sinnes arising in the Church, and the order
of reprehension, when all our question is of a separation from a false
Church, consisting of the world, of Athiestes, Papistes, heretickes, and
all sortes of prophane not gathered vnto CHRIST: So that he hath but
fought with his owne shadow in comparing vs to the <hi>Donatistes</hi> in this
poinct. Againe, al <hi>Augustines</hi> reasons are against separtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church,
without discreet and orderly vsing of the power of CHRISTs by the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of excommunication; wheras you all confesse you haue no disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
to execute, neither belong CHRISTS ordinances to your Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
ministerie &amp; Babilonish assemblies, which we denie to hold
the head CHRIST in this their subiection to Antichristes ministerie, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
worship. It is but then your ignorance to make comparison
betwene the <hi>Donatistes</hi> and vs.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>To the Worship.</head>
               <p>THat the <hi>Donatistes</hi> did separat themselues from as corrupted a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
as the <hi>Brownistes</hi> doe, Mr. GIFFARD wil stand to affirme. Saith
he there were prayers &amp; oblations for the dead, then significatiue cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
superstitious signing of themselues with the signe of the
Crosse &amp;c. To which we answere, that Mr. GIFFARD affirmed in the
6. <hi>page</hi> of his booke, that the <hi>Donatistes</hi> departed disorderly out of the
Church condemning yt not for any poinct of doctrine, for therein the
other Churches &amp; they did agree. Now here he would make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
betwene them &amp; vs, in disalowing the worship. But it seemeth
Mr. GIFFARD holdeth not anie doctrine to be contayned in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which indeed ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine nothing els, and sure it is a strang
worship that is not grounded vpon doctrine.</p>
               <p>The second thing in this place we will note, is, the time of these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
in the worship: namely as he reckoneth within two hundreth
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:4716:123"/>
yeares after CHRIST. If their worship were then as corrupted as ours is
now,
we merueil how you will defend the platforme of your Church
gouernment from that tyme that was so corrupt, calling yt the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church. Your fellow Priests Argumentes from the primatiue
Church (as thy falslie call those times) will be of small weight, if you
make their worship as corrupt as this deriued from Antichrist. In the
44 <hi>page</hi> he graunteth as much of the gouernment, that it was then thus
corrupt, when our tyme-seruers will only cleaue to that paterne, and
neither he nor they to the Testament of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he hath forgotten his scope &amp; Argument: He should by his
promise haue prooued that the <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>tistes</hi> &amp; we were of one iudgment in
this poinct; and that they made the false worship one principal cause
of their separation, as we do: so that he hath forgotten himself in this
place, as a man not knowing where to make shew of somthing.</p>
               <p>Next, where Mr. GIFFARD grantes that in those assemblies where the
worship is idolatrous it is lawfull to separat a mans self, he (contrary to
those expositions of the 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6. and other places to that effect) now
granteth a separation in body and minde both. I will not rebuke him
nor charge him of inconstancie, because I perceiue him to contradict
his holy Pastors of these tymes where he seeth them to erre.</p>
               <p>But he by and by returneth to his vomit againe thus: Ther are many
&amp; great corruptions in the worship before it come to that: where cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
fundamental poincts of doctrine are holden, the worship cannot
be idolatrous; but in the deepest defection in poperie ther were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
fundamentall poincts holden (as he faith in an other place) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they were stil in the Church and vnder the Conenant, therfore ther
is no idolatrous or blasphemous worship that may in the Papistes
Church be separated from. Mr. GIFFARD may be a good subiect, but
sure his groundes of doctrine are popish and pernitious. We here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
of Mr. GIF. whither such corruptions &amp; errours as he speaketh
of, might be of the godly that knew them such be offered vp by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
or communicated with in the Church.</p>
               <p>And Mr. GIF. must giue vs leaue to say it cannot be their worship was
so corrupt as yours, consisting of so manie patched deuises of your
learned Popes so long hatched, and by so manie heades as haue out of
that fordge of Sathans minting howse contriued yt, euen out of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christes
treasurie of deceites. As for errours that haue no good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
we may shew him twentie for one. Hitherto then Mr. GIFFARD
&amp; his bretheren that haue separated from the Church of ROME as they
would pretend, yet retayning still that worship, are bretheren with the
<hi>Donatistes,</hi> as he pleaseth to deride that holy name of bretheren.</p>

            <div type="subpart">
               <head>To the Ministerie.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Donatistes</hi> cried out that the Churches from which they separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
had no true Ministers, but that they were all false Prophets, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dasses,
persecutors of the iust, generations of vipers, because they said
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:4716:123"/>
they had their ordination from them that were such. The <hi>Brownistes</hi> lift
vp their voyces with all their might &amp; call vs <hi>Baalls</hi> Priestes, the marked
seruantes of Antichrist, false Prophets, seducers and such lyke, because
(as they say) we are ordeyned by Antichristian Bishops, therfore we be
<hi>Donatistes.</hi> Mr. GIFF. his Argument is denyed. <hi>Ieremie,</hi> our Sauiour <hi>Christ,</hi>
and diuers of the Prophets against <hi>Israell</hi> did in this maner pull off the
visardes of the false Prophets, disclosing their wickednes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people;
were they therfore, <hi>Donatistes</hi> or Schismatickes? <hi>Calvine</hi> &amp; all of you cry
out against the Popes ministerie at ROME, are you therfore <hi>Donatistes</hi> and
Schismatickes? The matter then must be considered for which they
so called them. The <hi>Donatistes</hi> for no other cause, then for that some of
them were ordeyned by Iudasses and traytours: the <hi>Brownistes,</hi> for that
these are ordeyned by Antichristian Bishopps which exercise an other
spirituall gouernment then CHRISTS. Wherein if you had eyes to see,
there is no comparison betwene their cause &amp; ours. First the person
that did ordeine sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in a lawful office as the <hi>Donatistes</hi> supposed; did also
ordeine (as they thought) in maner according to the rule of the word;
the partie that was ordeined, meete for the ministerie; the office to
which he was called, lawfull; the administration wherein he was to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister,
holy and good for anie thing they sawe. The contrarie of all
which we finde in your ministerie, and the thing wherein you would
haue vs likened together was neuer our reason, which is the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the mans person that doth of his sole authoritie ordeine for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
Churches, which we neither approoue in the <hi>Donatistes</hi> or you: Our
exceptions in this case I say hath neuer bene against the person of your
Ordinarie, although we might iustly. Take next time your matter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and looke whose kingdome you administer in, what calling,
office, Leitourgie, flock, and be ashamed of your comparison, by so
much as your ministeri is more wicked. Again, you here put the cause
of our casting of the Bishops &amp; their traine into the lake, to be, for that
they exercise an other discipline then CHRISTES, as though this were
some small matter, which if you put the word gouernment of the
Church, you shall finde it the denial of CHRIST to reigne in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
a suppression of at his lawes &amp; ordinances, euen the whole Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,
and erection and practising of an other. Let him that readeth
consider what state all stand in that remaine in this kingdome erected
against <hi>Christ,</hi> and what ministerie the seducers in this foraigne priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
exercise of God or of the Deuill, for CHRIST hath but one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie,
one Gospell, one gouernment ouer his Church.</p>
               <p>Now seeing ther is no comparison betwene the <hi>Donatistes</hi> cause &amp; ours,
I would (if he would forbeare to conclude me a <hi>Donatist</hi> for this poinct)
demaund this question in their cause if their accusation had bene true,
Namely, whether one that hath professed the faith, and after so foully
apostatat as to accuse his bretheren, denie the faith, persecute the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he sometimes professed, may without repentance be receiued into the
Church againe. Then whether though he repent and be receiued, he
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:4716:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be euer capable of the ministerie or no. Then whether he alone may
ordaine an other Minister or no; if hee do, whether the other be a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Minister or no. But in such cases in the Churche I could like well
to here some man to perswade to repentance, or to cast out the obstinat
by due order; and neither <hi>Augustine</hi> nor Angell from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to plead for
a tolleration of open transgression; which pleading for sinne maketh
vs suspect the matter verie deeply, iustifijng neither.</p>
               <p>Their similitudes, the riuer from the fountaine, the members, the
head, the stock and the plant in their application wee approue not, but
hold the doctrine erronious that they thought anie thing could be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
from the person of the man in that sort. But your discent from
Antichrist and pedegree in that kingedome is an other thing, if you
would please to conceiue it; namely, that your office, names, liuinges,
entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, administration &amp;c, is of the Pope &amp; of Satan, and that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his
kingdome shalbe abolished, your office, name, entrance, Vicarage, lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourgie
and all shalbe cast with the great milstone vpon them with all
such trafique into the bottome of the sea. Herevpon it is we say your
discent is from the Pope within few degrees, being the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these
Antichristian Bishops, which are the creatures of the Pope, who is the
eldest sonne of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and his vicar generall vpon earth, whose image,
marke, power and life you beare, and together with him lyue, reigne,
stand and fall as the branches with the tree; for when the power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
gouernment, offices, worship &amp;c, of Antichrist is gone, all your
ministerie is vanished for euer. The Lorde therfore put in her Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>.
heart to extirpate the same, and to adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce CHRISTS lawes, ordinances,
ministerie, worship &amp;c, as he is worthie, that euery knee may bowe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> affirmeth we shal not be able to proue our accusation
of their Ministerie, that yt is by discent from Antichrist; his reason is,
ther is no Minister in <hi>England</hi> by the Pope &amp;c. We shal not here need to
seek out a Pope in <hi>England:</hi> If hee will learne to distinguish betwene the
Popes person, and his decrees, Canons &amp; orders after the Popes orders
of priesthood, he must be driuen to confesse their whole ministerie, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
entrance &amp;c, to be drawen by discent, and wee thinck Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> will
not hang the life and vertue of holy thinges vpon mens persons, but
vpon the ordinances of God, lest he be a <hi>Donatist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee further affirmeth the ministerie of publishing the Gospel, dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the sacramentes, is not the deuise of man but <hi>Christs</hi> ordinance.
Do you thinke Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> can begg the question to affirme a Ministerie
whose office, entrance &amp;c, is of Antichrist, doth publish the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Againe, that they receiue yt as <hi>Christs</hi> Ministery, when it is from point to
point wholly found to be after the orders of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>And when no shift wil help him out, he is faine to affirme valiantly,
that the ministery was not vtterly destroyed in popery, for there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Sacrament of Baptisme. See here how he hath plunged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the sea of poperie, and ouertumbled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrines of his learned
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:4716:124"/>
Fathers. T. Co. saith from <hi>Malachie,</hi> that the ministerie is not tyed to the
succession of mens persons, but to the law &amp; ordinances; and what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
the Popes is, reade <hi>Reuel. 9. &amp;c.</hi> You charge her Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. verie far, to
haue cast out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true ministeri out of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for putting our Pope, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,

could not be a true Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t without a lawful Minister, then your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
being vnlawful, ther is no seale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> promise, no true church &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Seeing then the holy Ghost hath described that Church to be the
Harlot sitting vpon many waters, the mother of fornications, confused
<hi>Babel,</hi> murderesse of the Saintes, an holde of vncleane spirits, and a cage
of euerie vncleane and hatefull birde, neither ministerie, Sacramentes,
worship, or anie thing remayneth there according to Gods ordinance;
and at the best you make your self &amp; this whole land Scismaticks from
the true Church, Ministeri, Sacramentes, if it so stand with the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; ministeri therof, and of necessitie you are al <hi>Donatistes</hi> by your
reasoning, though my purpose is not to defend and proue in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
but to call a fewe notes to your memorie: I will conclude this
point, that you are driuen to the Popes ministerie for your orders, now
desiring you to satisfie vs next time concerning the Popes damnable
masse or Sacrament of the Altar; if they be true Ministers, whether the
Church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue one Sacrament good and in other euil, one with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
the other damnable, blasphemous, and accursed; for I take it they
cannot be true Ministers at the Font, and sacriledgious massmongers
at the Altar. Weigh these things more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratly, before you publish
such doctrines in <hi>England</hi> againe.</p>

But the <hi>Brownistes</hi> are not of that minde. To this obiection hee verie

The <hi>Donatistes</hi> held, that if he which did administer were an open sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he was no Minister, and so no Sacrament. We do not hold that
euery ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinne maketh the Minister no Minister, seing the high Priest
manie times sinned vnder the law, yet his office still retained: but we
hold that the Minister ought to repent his sinne before he administer,
and the Church to admonish him of his knowen sinne before they
suffer him to administer, and not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat with him if he be obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.
If the Church neglect their dutie, he and they transgresse, yet do
we not say that it is no Sacrament that he deliuereth, or that his minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
is disanulled. But we must put Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> in minde how far he is
gone from our cause in this comparison. We neuer disalowed their
Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as being administred by a lawful Minister in a lawful office,
yet the man a sinner. But of such counterfeites as haue neither lawfull
office, entrance &amp;c, but stand enchanters in Antichristes kingdome:
so that these are not the personal sinnes of a Minister in the Church;
wherin Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> wickednes appeareth to make the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mans
person or his sinne, when it is the ministery, office, entrance, administa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
al which wee hold to be Antichristian, and to haue nothing to do
with the seales of Gods Couenant in this estate: not here to speake of
the altering of the institution in the maner of administring yt, vvhich
the <hi>Donatistes</hi> neuer either had cause or made question of, as it seemeth.</p>
               <p>And whether anie promise is made to the elementes abused in the
false, yea whether to the elementes or to the keeping of the lawes and
ordinances in the true Church, let Mr. <hi>Giffard.</hi> make answere.</p>
               <p>Further, when we affirme the Sacramentes of the false Church to be
no true seales of the Couenant, because they are Idolatours and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
the Lordes ordinances prophaned and lawes wholly violated,
wee do not therby conclude it to bee no Baptisme concerning the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
washing; for wee can put difference betwene a false and none,
a false Sacrament or counterfeit signe, and none, for the false Church
is saide to haue her peace offringes. And although wee holde them
highly to tempt God to their owne condemnation (if they repent not)
that wittingly prophane or of wilfull ignorance transgresse those high
ordinances, as in the false Church to be superstitious of the element
where the lawe and Couenant is broken, yet do wee not therevpon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
wee neede anie reiterating of the outward signe, as the <hi>Donatistes;</hi>
but hold this false signe nowe a true signe, sufficient to vs concerning
the outward washing. Circumcision in the Apostasie of <hi>Israel</hi> which
was without promise to the receiuers in that estate, and nothing but
sinne in yt, yet stood for a sufficient outward cutting whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anie of them
returned to the Church and ate of the Passouer, wherof it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for any vncircumcised to eate: how the signe might haue bene rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
if need had so required, we may see by that of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.
for gathering againe their circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if it might be gathered againe,
then secondly cut.</p>
               <p>Where Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> then in stead of performing his comparison saith,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:4716:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the <hi>Donatistes</hi> in rebaptising did better of both, because he that is
not baptised ought to be baptised  he bewrayeth his ignorance,
that cannot put difference betwene a false Sacrament and none, a false
signe and none: The grossnes also he supposeth to haue bene in vs, is
found in himself, that lest he should make the false and counterfeit
washing in the false church to be none, runneth to iustifie the Church,
ministerie, sacramentes &amp;c at ROME, and so must conclude himself of
necessitie a Schismaticke or a popish Priest, which he will.</p>
               <p>And where he demandeth whether he that knoweth he was neuer
baptised can be saued if he seek not to be baptised when he may haue
yt. We demande againe how euer true baptisme should be restored,
if the false signe of baptisme which was then without promise in the
false Church, should not now be sufficient concerning the outward
signe.</p>

               <p>IN the principle of principles, that I say not the verie summe of all

betwene the <hi>Donatistes</hi> and vs; for the confesseth he hath not

ioyntly and seuerally to be instructed in their duties, and see what a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma</hi>
you are come vnto, this being gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that herein ther is no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

ought to gouerne and guyde his Church.</p>
               <p>But here according to your accustomed maner you goe about to say
there were faultes to be found in their gouernment then, yea as well as
in their worship &amp;c, which you affirmed to be as corrupt as yours is
now; wherein (if ante regard were to be had of your words) you would
not only make those Bishopps in as euill state as these, that Church as
yours now; but haue cast into the fire al the platformes that your lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Reformistes</hi> haue pleaded for, from that falsly so called Primatiue
Church. Well, I haue told you the question is not whether they had
the true gouernment or no, whether in that gouernment there were
corruptions, defaultes or negligences, but whether the <hi>Donatistes</hi> separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
therfore or no; they had the same offices officers, lawes, censures
that the other, so that you speak not only false in saying they might
haue had as iust cause in this respect of separation as we, but also bring
the Argument to confound your self with your whole Church wherin
you stand a Priest. Thus you are separated from the Church of ROME,
but retaine still the same hierarchie, worship, gouernment that they
vsed and haue, as the <hi>Do.</hi> of the Churches from which they separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:4716:126"/>
therfore you in this as in the rest of your Argumentes conclude
your selues <hi>Donatistes,</hi> Heretickes, and Schismatickes from the Church
of ROME.</p>
               <p>But Mr. GIFFARD will denie that the <hi>Donatistes</hi> had as great cause to
separate from those Churches fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they separated, as those Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Priestes from their Graundfather the Pope, for it was not so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
The same we answere to you for your gouernment, how then
shall we end this matter? I take it, thus; that the Priestes of England
despise the Popes person, and yet keepe the same orders, lawes, officers,
offices that he erected: So the <hi>Donatistes</hi> kept stil the orders of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that the Churches they separated from. Now if we can cleare
our selues that we retaine not the same gouernment amongst vs that
the Church doth we separat from (which I thinke cannot be denyed)
then Mr. GIF. hath in a chief principle put himself and this whole laud
into the number of <hi>Donatistes.</hi> The Argument is now this. The Church
of England separateth from the Church of ROME, and yet keepe their
gouernment &amp; worship, therfore the Church of England are <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes</hi> and <hi>Donatistes;</hi> and an other poinct, that ther can be no true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes,

               <p>HE granting that we herein differ from the <hi>Donatistes,</hi> in that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
all Churches in the world we do not, will needes notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
haue vs <hi>Donatistes</hi> in this poinct also: For (saith he) though they
shoote not their arrowes at them, yet their arrowes strike them, their
Argumentes vpon consequence will reach so far, yea runne thorough
the sides of all Churches. This we answere: you must first cleare your
selues of those thinges wherwith you are chardged and pressed, and
trouble not your self with other mens matters, seing you make this but
a cloke for your wickendnes to shrowde your self vnder other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
with whome we haue not to deale. We vtterly refuse to enter into
this controuersie of the estate of other Contries: we know the word
of God is neere vs (thankes be to God) by which if your cause be good,
suffer it to be tryed. As for the consequence of our Argumentes they
are but your owne collections to passe ouer your owne sinnes, and sett
the strife betwene vs and other Churches, which we wil not be drawen
vnto. And all men may here behold this sower of wordes and strife
maker will counterfeit not only consequence, but Argumentes of his
owne head, to raise quarrell: In all which he hath forgotten his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to compare our writinges and theirs together; and flyeth to his
owne collection.</p>
               <p>In this part of his stage-play he beginneth thus. The Church of
ENGLAND is esteemed &amp; reuerenced emongst the Churches as a sister,
and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated with, yet they all know what her faultes be in her
assemblies, in her worship, in her ministerie &amp; gouernment, in asmuch
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:4716:126"/>
as they are apparant. Vnto the first we suppose your worship, ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
Church gouernment, are not so apparant vnto them as you gyue
out. Secondly we doubt, yea I may say it is vntrue, that they iustifie
your ministerie, worship, or gouernment. Thirdly admit they
should thus sinne either of ignorance, negligence, or infirmitie, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
otherwise orderly gathered to the practize of CHRISTES ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they are not for this sinne (till after due convincement and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
they remaine obstinat) to be presently iudged no Churches: But
what I thinke of their estate, you shall here pardon me, I wil not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle
till I be called.</p>
               <p>As for your harmonie of Confessions, if it be not the harmonie of
the Prophets, CHRIST and his Apostles, it skilleth nothing vs what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you make. Againe, it is not an accord in certeine general Articles
that can satisfie this matter, when in the perticulars you discent to the
ouerthrow of al: Such an harmonie you may very wel make with your
mother Church of ROME, and a great deale more large: Neither do
their Confessions agree with you in the estate of the ministeri, Church
gouernment, nor worship: <hi>Scotland, Geneua, France</hi> &amp;c, haue an other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie,
offices, choise, ordination and ministration, an other gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
worship  but it were too large to discusse: And now hold to
your Argument, and see what wil follow. The Church of ROME haue
the same confession of faith, which you call your Apostolick Crede,
that you haue, yea the Lordes prayer, (as you cal it) <hi>Athanasius</hi> Crede &amp;c,
therfore they and you agreeing in this harmonie of confession, are one
body one Church. Againe these Churches you say hold you the
Church of God, and you hold the Church of ROME to be the Church
of God, therfore you are one body al, and then you &amp; al the Churches
Schismatickes from your mother Church.</p>
               <p>If the Church of ENGLAND be Antichristian &amp; idolatrous, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Beast &amp;c, then the Churches which perfectly know the same
and yet acknowledg her a sister, are partakers of her sinne, and so to be
condemned with her. The same Argument we thus returne you.</p>
               <p>If the Church of ROME be Antichristian &amp; idolatrous &amp; worship the
Beast, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church of ENGLAND which perfectly knoweth the same
&amp; yet acknowledgeth her a sister (as Mr. GIFFARD doth say) is partaker

               <p>Al those Churches saith he which know the Church of ENGLAND in

speaketh of do not approue the church of ENGLAND in this estate, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
condempne vs in the thinges we withstand therein, and receiue it
againe thus: At the first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of papacie all the Churches in the
world did approue the Church of ROME, and condempne those as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Schismatickes which caled it Antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; separated from yt:
Let Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> put to what conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wil. I take it Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> must now
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:4716:127"/>
leaue the bare title of Church, ministerie &amp;c, and flee to the proofe of
their profession &amp; orderly walking, by the word of God; which if he
do not, yet do we buyld therevpon as vpon a most sure foundation.</p>
               <p>As to Mr. CALVINE, we refer you to his confession of faith printed in
the latter end of his owne Catechisme, and if he be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to himself
in his other writinges, look you vnto it; we do not for the holynes of
the man iustifie anie of his errours (as no man is without) neither for
his errors reiect any truth he held; knowing of the one God hath had
mercy as we hope, and for the other Gods word approueth it: so that
we beleiue not any thing because such a man said so, but because by
the word &amp; Spirit we heare CHRIST himself speak. And you do greatly
abuse his writinges, in vsing them after your owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ense in his name
contrarie to his minde and purpose, and by your leaue wrasting them
to your owne iudgment, deceiuing others therby. In his confession he
affirmeth ther is no true Sacrament with promise (as I do remember)
but where the Minister hath a lawfull office and outward calling to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister;
so that all his Argumentes must be vnderstood of such a
Church as haue a lawful ministerie in office, entrance, and administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and cannot be applyed to yours. Moreouer he reasoned against
the Anabaptistes and such as held an integritie and perfection in the
Church, and separated for euerie sinne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, without due seeking
of redresse. And if he erred in these or anie other doctrines, we do not
therfore hold them presently to be no Church in which he was Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or which did in like ignorance receiue the said doctrines; it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie
in error that only deserueth casting off, and that by due order.
As for most of your places expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by his mouth &amp; now receiued by
you to maintaine open sinne &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with the open knowne
transgressours, they are so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon &amp; stale, that euery infant in the faith
can shew you your vanitie, if in your owne name you durst propound
them. Your learned bretheren haue gyuen them ouer as sclender col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
you will now reuiue them; put them in your owne name, ells
we haue nothing to say, the man being dead, whose steppes God giue
you grace to follow in that which is good. But this is a simple course
to iustifie your owne wayes by mens names and writinges, when Gods
word convinceth you of sinne and wickednes. For that place of the

the wrath of God the Minister that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth sacriledge, and vs in that

our selues and so eat, therfore I must examine my self also with
whome, what, and howe I do come to receiue. But what haue wee
to do to reason what is to be done in the Church to the preuenting of
Gods wrath and reprofe of sinne, when our question is of the vtter
forsaking of the false Church with all her wares and stolen waters. So
that wee conclude al Mr. <hi>Calvines</hi> Argumentes must be enforced against
such as separate themselues from the true Churche, otherwise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and you all shall be found Schismaticks from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> after this <hi>Ismalitish</hi> derision of our persecution, proceedeth
to accuse vs of some doctrines derogatorie to the Princes aucthoritie.
As first; that Princes may not make lawes. 2. that wee should hold the
Prince ought not to reforme the Church by their authoritie. 3. That
none of the godlye Kinges of <hi>Iuda</hi> did compel anie to the Couenant.
4. That the people of CHRISTES kingdome be <hi>spoutanei</hi> &amp;c. In al which,
besides that ther is no comparison betwene the <hi>Donatistes</hi> and vs in these
poinctes, hee doth but followe the steppes of that olde peruerter of the
truth. We wil the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> first shew briefly how we hold this doctrine, and how
far we are from that hee would insinuate into the Magistrates eares, as
though we sought to diminish their lawful iurisdiction, power, or rule.
For lawes making we hold, that Princes are limited by the law of God
(as he himself in an other place confesseth) &amp; ought not to proclame
any law that hath not warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from Gods law either in expresse words or
necessary collection from general rules, stil keeping within the equitie.
For reforming we hold, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince ought to supresse all transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Gods law, and punish al persons without partialitie according to the

OF Mr. GIFFARDS LAST CAVILLS ABOVT
stinted read prayers, and deuised Leitourgies.</head>
            <p>HAving heretofore written an answere to Mr. <hi>George Giffards</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
defence of stinted read praiers &amp; deuised Leitourgies, and
since receiued an emptie replie, wherin he doth nothing lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeild
to any sound reason alledged, but vngodlily cauilleth at and peruersly
wrasteth the sence of so much as he toucheth, I seeing no cause of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strife (his former convinced) to intermedle againe with perticular
handling of his chaffe &amp; smoke, his reasons in effect the same before
answered, haue only thought it my dutie to illustrate vnto the Readers,
some few brief poincts abused by him, that they may the better be able
to iudge of the former writings, wherevnto with these few helpes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
I refer the trial.</p>
            <p>WHERAS I alledged out of the 8. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> and out of the
4. to the <hi>Galath.</hi> that in the verie time &amp; action of our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ng
to God, the spirit of God was the only instructor and
the only help, no other help mentioned or that can be collected in the
Scriptures, Mr. GIFFARD hauing granted that reading prayer is not
praying, doth now answere, that how soeuer the Scripture doth extol &amp;
magnifie outward helpes &amp; meanes, yet when they are compared with
God which worketh all in all by them, or when the scripture will set
forth the efficacie &amp; worke to be his alone, they are either not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or els if they be mentioned, so cast downe, as if they were nothing.
God buyldeth his Church (saith he) by the ministerie of men, <hi>yet Paul</hi>
is said to plant, <hi>Apollos</hi> to water, but God to gyue the encrease 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.
and therfore to gather from those places <hi>Rom. 8. Galat.</hi> 4. that there neede
or may be no outward help or meanes in the verie action and instant of
praying, is far awrye. In which answere it euidently appeareth he is so
bent to turne away all truth &amp; raise new strife, as ther can be no expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of agreement: There is no sequence, neither doth the Scripture
alledged proue his owne reason, so that nothing hangs togeather. No
man doubteth but that sometimes and in some places of Scripture the
outward meanes of begetting and encreasing faith is only recited, and
sometimes the secret work of Gods spirit only, sometimes both, when
yet they are not diuided but goe together, and all of God both inward
worke &amp; outward meanes, though in way of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison I neuer so read,
but rather the one repeated for both: For shal I say, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word
of God &amp; preaching therof is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hewed to be the power of God vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
that the inward worke of the Spirit is therfore not mentioned,
because the other is of God? the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both inward &amp; outward meanes being
of God &amp; Gods owne worke, though the one by instrument, that there
is silencing of the one in way of comparison, is not true. But all this is
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:4716:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing to our matter: He should plainly haue affirmed, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these
places <hi>Rom. 8. &amp; Gal.</hi> 4. it cannot be proued, that in the very instant tyme
&amp; action of owre praying to God, the spirit only instructeth, without
outward helpes of instruction; and he should haue seene I could proue
(as then I did) the contrarie vnto him <hi>Rom. 8. 26. The Spirit doth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the the Spirit yt self maketh request for vs vvith sighes and grones vnvtterable.</hi> In
the action of praying the Spirit is here set downe in this place to be
the meanes and help of instruction, teaching vs to aske aright, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes or helpes of instruction in that instant time and action of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jng mentioned in this or any other place of scripture: Therfore in
the time of our praying and laying our hearts open to God, the Spirit
only doth instruct and openeth our mouth. In this place let the word
synantilambanetai be wel considered. Againe <hi>Galath.</hi> 4. 6. it is said <hi>because yee
are sonnes, God sent the Spirit of his Sonne into your hearts crying, Abba, Father.</hi> The
Argument here is the same that before: this word [<hi>crying</hi>] sheweth the
worcke of his Spirit or rather office, in our continuall occasions of
prayer to direct vs to vnburden &amp; vnfold the heart, so that in the insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
action we see no other. And where I shewed him that reading in the
action of praying could not be caled an help of instruction at that time
when we were powring forth our hearts vnto God, the eyes and hands
lyft vp to heauen, our meditation fixed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our knowen occasions, and
heart &amp; mouth vnfolding them, my reason this, That the minde &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
could not be intent vpon two diuerse distinct &amp; seueral exercises &amp;
duties of minde &amp; bodie at one time &amp; insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he inverteth my words,
and stealeth them as a new shift to help himself (as he supposeth) retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them thus in way of question, demanding whether fasting, lyfting
vp our eyes &amp; ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, prostrating the bodie &amp; kneeling be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

Euery simple man wil laugh at him (saith he) if he make them prayer yt
self; and if they be helpes, then I haue brought the former proofes not
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an idle, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an vnsound brayne. Leaue scorning &amp; reproch, and

wil he call fasting, kneeling &amp;c, instructions of the minde what to
pray? then be must needs plead for his Image &amp; al poperye, if these bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
actions &amp; gestures be instruction of the minde, which are but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
to make the body seruiceable &amp; apt to &amp; in this dutie. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
how learnedly he disputeth to make reading one of these bodily

these bodily exercises and spirituall exercises, so he sheweth
himself ignorant &amp; vnable to discerne spiritual gyftes &amp; exercises one
from an other, with the distinct vse of them; demanding whither the
voyce of an other that prayeth, be an outward help or prayer yt self, an
outward meanes to make our prayer more fervent. He thinketh I will
be laught at, if I say it be prayer yt self. Sure if in anie assemblie, or

heare pray not as wel as he y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> according to Gods ordinance speaketh,
our publique prayers are not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayers of the Church, but of him that
speaketh only. But now God hath otherwise taught 1 <hi>Cor. 14. &amp;c. Acts.</hi> 4.
yt must needs be, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. GIF. is in great error to thinke none but he
that speaketh prayeth. I take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such hearing of an others voyce, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and this to be a foule error to publish the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie; but that prayer
both edifieth him that speaketh and him that heareth, and together in
heart prayeth, I make no doubt. Yet herevpon to affirme, that there are
other meanes of instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vsed in the insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of praying then

instructed to pray aright, and that reading is a blessed meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.
So that you see whiles you of purpose will oppose, you runne
your self vpon the rocke; in stead of iustifijng your accusation of two
heresies to be found in my first reason, you haue published this follye,
which you must retract, if you wil obey the truth.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIFFARD the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> granting, that reading is but to help to prayer &amp; not
praying, and now being shewed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it can be no help in that insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t action
of praijng, let vs proceede to pervse an other of his mistakings &amp; wilful
peruertings. I affirming, that the holy Ghost neuer enioyned vs to any

that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord did by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bynde them to those verie words sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jng
ouer, when they prayed or blessed in those formes which are there
prescribed. For my reasons in disprouing this popish carnal conceipt, I
refer the Reader to my former answere to his published pretended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of reading for praijng. One reason was drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the words of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
text <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 32. where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hebrew words <hi>Coh Tebaracu,</hi> thus shal you blesse,
do not import a tying them to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verie words of this forme in blessing,
but to the rules &amp; instructions there taught them concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
yt self for their directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which I collected by this word <hi>Cob,</hi> which is
an adverb of similitude, signifijng with vs as much as [after this maner]
and therfore cannot be to say the same words, but according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same
instructions. Where first he reprocheth me for that <hi>Tebaracu</hi> was false
printed, therevpon chardging me I cannot reade two words right of
hebrue, which were no great ignominie in their priesthood: But shall
we say Mr. GIF. cannot reade two words in latine rightly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because in the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:4716:131"/>
28. <hi>page</hi> of his booke he repeateth out of <hi>Augustine, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>poli sui,</hi> for <hi>populi sui?</hi>
This I mention as sory to see the defendor of this false Hieratchie so
emptie, to leau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sounde doctrine, and thus to trifle; if he had bene at
the print, it should haue bene ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it seemeth. Now to the doctrine
gathered of this word <hi>Coh,</hi> Mr. GIF. would invert the words in his owne
sense, thus; that where I said, the Lord did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand to say the same
words but the like, that is, according to those directions of doctrine, he
gathereth, that I should affirme yt vnlawfull to vse those words at all,
yea that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y might not vse all or anie of these words at anie tyme.
Whether this be a Christian interpretation of my words or no, I leaue
not only to all mens, but chieflie to his owne conscience to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.
Yet he still couertly persisting in his error, produceth a place
of Scripture, where the word <hi>Coh</hi> (as he thinketh) is vsed for the saying
of the verie words. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. The Lord said to <hi>Moses, Thus shalt thou say vnto the
children of Israel EHEIE hath sent me vnto yee; moreouer God said vnto Moses, thus shalt
thou say vnto them, The God of your Fathers &amp;c.</hi> According to Mr. <hi>Grenewo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
(saith he) <hi>Moses</hi> is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to say those words, but the
like. True, he is not here bound to this certeine number of words, or
the same words. If then they should say, vvhat is his name that hath
sent thee, he may not say <hi>EHEIE</hi> hath sent me, because God said <hi>Coh</hi> &amp;c.
Now Mr. GIF. sheweth himself a shifter: I did neuer hold it vnlawfull
to vse anie wordes of the scripture as need required, it is your sclander:
vvhere you haue in all your bookes affirmed we hold it vnlawfull to
say <hi>thy kingdome come,</hi> or vse anie phrase of scripture to right vse; your
vvoeful vvrasting of the tongue for vntruthes, vvil tourne to your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
iudgment. I proued only by the word <hi>Coh,</hi> which signifieth [after
this maner] that God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded not the very certaine number of words
to be said. And vvhere I sayd the word <hi>Coh</hi> was so vsed in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
(when they say, <hi>Thus saith the Lord</hi>) to this end, that neither the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost had registred al their verie wordes they spake, nor that they
were tyed to the prescript number of words, he would haue it thought
I should hold those words which are recorded, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t to be the words of
God; which vvrasting of my vvords, is but his emptie quarreling to
turne away this firme doctrine: namely, that God did in those formes
of prayer mentioned by him, prescribe the somme of their blessings &amp;
petitions, vvhervnto they ought according to their seuerall occasions
vvithin the limits of these doctrines, frame their suites and desires, and
did not tye them to a certaine number of words. Now he finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
pressed, in that all his proofes are at once brought to be vveapons
against him rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvarrant, It being prooued vnto him that those
formes are repeated in other words in other places, and that the Priests
vsed other in blessing the people, as <hi>Eli</hi> blessed <hi>Hanna:</hi> also that the
Apostles vsed other vvords in prayer, and neuer that verie forme
and number of vvords, he playnly denyeth that our question vvas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the bynding &amp; limiting to the verie vvords by commandement,
and saith our question vvas, vvhither it vvere idolatrie to vse those
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:4716:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prescript phrases or no. Thus the man is fled, not only contradicting
all his writinges, making voide his proofes, but granting as much as I
affirmed vpon the word <hi>COH,</hi> hath gyuen mee the whole cause against
his wil: For if these places wil serue to proue an apportioning by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and stint vpon commandement, then Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> hath no profe for his
Collects, no though these had bene so, yet his patched broken mass-booke
shoulde haue bene far from comming in place of true prayer.
But that this is a popish dreame to think in prayer they were bound to
some certeine number of words saying ouer, it was also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced vnto
him by the Greeke word houtos, where <hi>Christ</hi> commandith his Disciples,
saying, <hi>VVhen you pray, pray thus, Our Father &amp;c.</hi> Which word [thus] <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 9.
singnifieth, [after this maner] or according to this forme, rules, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions;
for if the commandement shoulde goe to bynde vs to the
very words, then this word [<hi>when</hi> you pray] would bynd vs neuer to vse
other words, for the text saith, <hi>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you pray, say thus.</hi> To this he answereth,
that respecting the rules for matters, <hi>when</hi> is as much as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer you
pray, because we may not depart from those matters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in those
general petitious: But in words it is not so there, We must consider to
distinguish &amp;c. Wel, hath he not lost himself, and still against his will
yeilded the matter; namely, that wee are not in these formes of prayer
bound to the verie words saying ouer, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghost did neuer
by commandement stint or limit vs to anie words in praying, which in
deed is common with inchanters: And I take it he will easily yeild me
this point, for if he remember <hi>Augustine</hi> to teach, that then we pray that
prayer which <hi>Christ</hi> taught his Disciples, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our prayers are grounded
vpon those doctrines and instructions, or to that effect: And <hi>Calvine</hi> to
to say; the Sonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would not prescribe vs vvhat vvords vve must
vse in prayer, he should haue put vs to lesse trouble: So that besids his
mass-booke vvas neuer prescribed by the Lord himself or vvarrant of
his word, he seeth it vnlawful to apportion, limit &amp; stint as by measure
and vvaight certeine members of vvordes, sentences &amp;c, in prayer. As
for his examples of the Psalmes, I refer to my former answere, namely,
that praying is one thing, and singing a psalme an other.</p>
            <p>Now then vve haue heard that reading is not praying or any help to
pray in the instant action of praying, vvhen we should powre forth our
owne hearts to God: Also that it is vnlawful to bynde man to numbers
of vvords of sentences in praying. Let vs come to the first generall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
vvhich is this. No Apochripha must be brought into the
publick assemblies; for there only Gods word and the lyuely voyce of
his owne graces must be heard in the publick assemblies: But mens
vvrytings &amp; the reading them ouer for prayer are Apochripha: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may not be brought into the publick assemblies, eyther for lawes
or vvorship. Here hee finds fault vvith the vvorde Apochripha (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it hath bene an antie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vvord in this sense, and now published in
their Bibles to distinguish other vvrytings from the authentick scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
vvilling mee to goe to the matter yt self, drawing by firme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:4716:132"/>
that nothing is to be allowed any place in the Church, which is
not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfect rule yt self in writing or without errour vttered in speach,
and he wil yeild. This I did proue vnto him by an Argument hee was
not able to answere, and did leaue out the word <hi>Apochripha,</hi> thus. Only
the Canonical scriptures &amp; lyuely voice of Gods owne graces are to be
brought into the publick assemblies for doctrine &amp; prayer: But mens
writings or Collections are neither Canonical scripture, nor the lyuely
voice of Gods graces in such as he hath appointed to speak in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
assemblies. Therfore no mans writing may be brought into nor
imposed vpon the publick assemblies for doctrine and prayer.</p>
            <p>Now where he cauilleth about the perfectnes of the rule &amp; absolute
perfectnes of the graces, it doth not help him: For the word of God
being of necessitie by the lawe and ordinance of God, to be read in our
owne language, I trust he will not denye yt to be the written word of
God for the vnperfectnes of the translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being (to the best search the
Church can make) skanned by the original tongue and stil amended;
or at least the Church no further bound to yt, then yt shal be found to
be the perfect rule: so likewise the lyuely voice of Gods graces are not
for the imperfectnes to be excluded, being Gods appointed ordinance;
neither is anie fault in the translation to be allowed, and errour in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
or prayer are presently to be admonished &amp; repented of. Mr. <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fard</hi>
then must denye the Bible translated into our owne language to be
the Canonicall Scriptures, and denye the lyuely voice of Gods lawfull
officers, and such as are therevnto called, in doctrine and prayer, to be
the manifestations of the spirit and vtterance of Gods graces for the
assemblie, or els grant the proposition firme: And if hee can put dead
mens writinges into the place of either of these, I will yeild. In the
meane time I hold such translations to be the worde of God, and by
Gods ordinance put into our owne language, to all our knowledges
retayning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of God, which word &amp; the lyuely vse of Gods owne
graces in the mouth of such as he therevnto appointeth, are only to be
brought into the publicke assemblies for prayer and doctrine; for God
hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded these vnto vs as his owne ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces in his assemblies,
and no other means wherby either God speaketh vnto vs, or his people
vnto him, in the Congregation. To this all the scriptures beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
the word is always firme, confirmed with miracles from heauen,
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to vs by <hi>Christ,</hi> the Prophetts &amp; Apostles, to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
Canon, light, lanterne &amp;c, the graces of the Spirit gyuen for the
interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, prayer, doctrine &amp;c. CHRIST is asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vp into heauen,
and hath giuen giftes vnto men to serue their tyme &amp; minister in their
place in this house. These graces stil renewed, not only in those called
of God in this seruice for their dayly administration, but newe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
thrust forth into this haruest, as the Lord of the house disposeth:
which graces of his Spirit are compared to two oliue branches, which
emptie out of themselues thorow two golden pipes <hi>Zacharie</hi> 4. 12. And
to seuen thunders which vtter their voices that cannot be written.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:4716:132"/>
Away therfore vvith your patched mass-booke, yt may neither stande
for a foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Gods house, nor for the lyuely voyces of these thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
you make yt a monstrous Idoll by putting yt in either of these
vses, yet you will make yt serue for both. Wee haue nothing to do
with your matters of order, as you vnderstand that order for tyme,
place  wee reason of the spirituall action yt self, when wee entreat
of y<hi rend="sub">e</hi> meanes whereby God speaketh to vs, and appointeth vs to speake
vnto him. Wee can cast out the errours in the translation or doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
or prayer, and yet retaine Gods vvorde in our owne language,
and the liuely voice of his graces in the assemblie: When you can do
so with your deuises and newe hatched Leitourgies wee will giue eare
vnto you and them; till then wee thinck of your counterfeit playes
and pleas for your Idolls and detestable sacriledge and high propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Gods ordinances with <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> to resist the truth.
Paraphrases wee hold to be mens writinges and expositions, and not
the word of God, nor the liuely voice of Gods grace of interpretation
or prayer, therefore to be excluded this place of seruice vnto God.
Thus you see the further you wrastle, the further you make your
wares, the best of them, odious to euerie godly conscience. You say I
deceiue the simple by gyuing them one crabbe amongst many apples;
but you may behold your best apples such as the holy Ghost hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
vs <hi>Reuelations.</hi> 18. to be entisements to euil: It is well you will grant
my Propositions so sound; and I would wish (if such be Gods wil) they
might be better favoured.</p>
            <p>Nowe because I wil not stand either repeating or contending about
Syllogismes, I will take this much yeilded of your owne conclusions,
which is as much in effect as I haue affirmed, where you teach me thus
to reason. No mans writings are the vndoubted truth of God, but
haue errours and imperfections: therfore men cannot further ground
vpon them, then they be consonant to the Canonicall scriptures. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
The Church is builded vpon the foundation of the Apostles &amp;
Prophets: therfore our faith is not to rest vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mens writings. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
doth necessarily follow, that if mens writings may not be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon nor rested vpon, howe should you dreame it lawfull to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them for lawes vpon the publick assemblies, or to haue them
there read to beare rule as the wordes of God? And this you confessed
in an other of your writings, that God spake vnto vs out of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
worde, or by his owne word. If then God speake not vnto vs
by mens writinges that be of priuate interpretation, in the assemblie,
nor that they can be made groundwork to buyld our faith vpon, or to
rest assured vpon, yt will be granted I hope that they are not to be
imposed vpon the publick assemblies as lawes and rules, but left to
euerie mans priuate vse in their libertie, as they wil answere for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
what vse they put them to, and whither they doe not prefer
them before the booke of God, or preiudice themselues by them.
This first poinct is then plaine, That only Gods vndoubted worde is
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:4716:133"/>
to be imposed, brought in, and maintayned in the publick assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
as lawes and rules, no other vvritings being authentick or Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.
But here Mr. GIFF. doth in effect affirme, that the word of God
yt self is not authentick or Canonical, except in the Hebrew or Greeke
Copie: Wherein he goeth a litle beyond the Papists, that wil yet allow
the vvorde of God in latine: And if it shoulde be defended, that the
vvorde of God vvere not the vvorde yt self that vvee haue in our owne
language, it wil follow that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could haue assurance of faith, except
he vnderstoode both Hebrew and Greeke, yea be able soundly to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the scriptures in both. If the translations be so far mens vvritings
that yt ceaseth generally to be the vvord of God that is not vvritten in
Hebrew or Greek, and mens vvritinges not to be grounded or rested
vpon, vvhere shall our assurance stand? And might not Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> as vvel
say, the Hebrew and Greek Copie are but paper and ynck, many faults
and errours by the print in vowells, accents, letters; and so conclud vve
had not Authentick or canonical scriptures at al, except me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s erronious
vvritings might be of equall authoritie in the assemblie that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
must he not beare vvith mee in accompting him an Atheist or
Libertine in thus reasoning? Hence then vve see vvhiles you go about
to abase the Canonicall scriptures, and extol your patched Leitourgie,
you fall into manie blasphemies, as I haue before told you. Wee hold
yt the vvord of God in vvhat language soeuer, stil reiecting the errours
in the print, in the translations  as they are knowne vnto vs, and
not to the vvord yt self for the imperfections or errours in the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and print. Now vvhen you can so reiect the errours in mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
as you can make that vvhich remayneth the vndoubted vvorde
of God, not agreeable only, but an Authentick approued Canonicall
scripture, authorised from God to be the verie eternall foundation and
rules, limitts and lawes giuen by himself vnto his people, you may lift
vp your stumped Dagon into this place, if there be some truth in their
vvritings (as vvhat mens vvritings haue not some, and the holy name
of God verie much) yet is that truth in the Scripture yt self &amp; here so
mingled vvith chaffe, that it vvere not only vnprofitable &amp; a hindera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of the true vse of Gods vvorde, but an abolishing and defacing of the
vvord yt self; the maiestie vvhere of ought to terrifie you from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
And vvhere you say that you decide not controuersies by
anie translation, but by the Authentick Copies of the Hebrew and
Greke, I trust you speak only of such as are able by the interpretation
therof so to decide controversies, and holde it not vnlawfull for anie
such as haue not that help, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vince errour by the powre of the vvord
and conferring one place vvith an other in anie translation, according
to the analogie of faith, though I grant vve ought to vse y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> best appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
But if this vvere not lawfull, surely no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might prophesie in the
Church, vvhich hath not the gift of interpretion of the tongue, neither
might any affirme any scripture to be true, but they vvich haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of tongues: How blasphemous is this geare, vvhiles you are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4716:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the powre, wisdome and agreement of the word and spirit, and
diuersitie of giftes giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto men; the Word &amp; the Spirit approue ech
other, and beare witnesse ech of other, in what language soeuer God
giueth yt, to our vnderstanding. Prophesie &amp; knowledg of tongues are
two seueral giftes, not alwayes giuen to one member, but distributed as
God in his wisdome hath appointed. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and prophesie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded
for the more excellent <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. But this is sufficient in this place, that the
word of God is the word of God in what language soeuer, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
yt being verbatim translated, or at least so far fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rth faithfully
translated, mans writing, were blasphemie: but mens writings can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be so holden the authentick scriptures of God, how agreable to the
word soeuer they be. My Argument is then firme, and thus left vpon
you: Those writings which be not the word of God being imperfect, &amp;
neuer without error, may not be imponed as lawes &amp; Canons vpon the
publick assemblies, or there be read or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>erpreted, or offred vp in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
But such are almens writings that be not the authentick word or
God yt self. The publick assemblies are only bound to the reading &amp;
interpretation of the Scriptures, which God hath ordeined to be read
in a knowne language, and for prayer &amp; prophesie hath ordeined the
liuely voice of his owne graces in the mouth of such as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be the mouth of the Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him, and his mouth
vnto them. So y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> your pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ched Leitourgie, paraphrases, songes in rime,
homelies, and al your dead mens writings, are cast forth of the publick
assemblies, and manifest to be Idols whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are thrust into that place.</p>
            <p>Now where I alledged that the binding of the publick assemblie, yea
of all assemblies, to certaine writings of men euerie day &amp; yeare their
number &amp; portion of words, daylie, monthly &amp; yearely in al assemblies
the same matter an words reiterated, in stead of powring forth their
hearts vnto God according to their present needs and occasions, was a
setting of themselues in Gods seate and taking the office of his Spirit,
which only knoweth the wantes of the seueral assemblies according to
their diuerse occasions, he runneth away from the matter, as one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing

whether euerie one should vtter their owne perticular wantes in the

               </gap> Lord wil one day cast in your

estate of our owne soule, which cannot be done by reading an other
mans writings, alwayes singing one song, customably repeating in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
certaine words, our hearts neuer ripped vp, examined, nor the
diseases therof layd open vnto God, seeking due cure: So the man that
is the mouth of the whole assemblie prayeth, as the mouth of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
for al their open publick present wantes &amp; occasions: Which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
considering the persons &amp; actions, are diuerse &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for one assemblie before hand, muchlesse for all assemblies in a whole
kingdome, neither by man nor Angel. See then the mock erye of your
seruice booke, and what Idolatrie is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by yt, to the abandoning
true prayer according to the present wantes &amp; occasion.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, is, about making of lawes in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God. Where he would persuade vs that their whole Leitourgie
conteining al their publick worship, gouernment, offices &amp; ordinances
of their Church, be but matters of order &amp; conveniencie. Then the
compelling &amp; teaching the publick assemblie to reade ouer mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
both as Canons &amp; lawes in the Church, and publickly &amp; priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to offer them vp in stead of true prayer &amp; holy invocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is a matter
of comelines &amp; conveniencie. In the meane time it must be a turning
away of the whole order &amp; ordinances of God: For what is the whole
Testament of <hi>Christ</hi> but an order for euerie office, person, action in the
Church, if he wil haue it taxis, and then must confesse their Leitourgie
an other order of publick administration, and so as I haue said an other
Gospel, an other Testament, a setting vp an other worship. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
I trust I may cal al this an adding to the word of God; yea I wil go
a litle further, an abolishing &amp; disabling &amp; dishonoring of the word yt
self &amp; graces of his spirit. And whither all this smoke of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
pyt may not be reproued with these scriptures, not only <hi>Prouerb. 30
verse. 5. 6. Deut. 4. verse</hi> 32. but also <hi>Reu. 22. verse.</hi> 18. 19. let the godly ponder
and search: and let the fearefulnes of the threats deterre all flesh from
presuming to alter the ordinances, lawes &amp; worship of the most high
God. And that the verie reading of an other mans writing for my owne
praier, or the prayer of the Church, in stead of powring foorth our
owne hearts, is a changing of the whole worship into the making
mens writing an Idoll, which is by these places condemned as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
sinne, let the most hard text (as he in carnall wonder exclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth)
be looked into <hi>Reuel. 22. verse</hi> 18. 19. The words are plaine: <hi>If anie
man put or add any thing vnto these, or if anie man take away from these words,</hi> he shalbe
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:4716:134"/>
iudged as followeth. Now if the adding an other whole Worship, and
suppressing of that God hath apointed, be not an adding to these things
writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, gyue sentence as you wil answere. O (saith he) but it is said God
wil add vnto such al the plagues written in this booke; and there is in
this booke mentioned the lake of fire: As though the lake of fire is not
due for euery sinne, and yet not euery one that committeth sinne to be
condemned; what sinne is it that deserueth not the eternall wrath of
God? yet not euery one that sinneth giuen ouer to that iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yt may be of ignorance, or of negligence, and washed away by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
in the blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> or it may be repented of &amp; left whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee
see yt. Mr. GIFFARD hath read wel the curses of the law &amp; all the curses
due for sinne, that seeth not how many curses the law &amp; the Prophets
pronounced vpon sinne, to call the persons themselues to repentance;
shewing together the equitie of Gods law, &amp; yet withal the free mercye
of God to al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> truly repent their euil wayes. Al that receiue the Beastes
marke in their hand or forehead, are thretned to be cast with the Beast

I encourage anie to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in such fearful estate, to harde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hearts
against the threatnings of God, but that I would haue Mr. GIFF. to put
difference betwene the curse layd to the sinne, and the condemnation
of the person sinning: And seeing he taketh that lake a perticular se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
threat to the Apostasie vnder Antichrist, I would he had the grace
to consider how it lyeth vpon him, whiles he speaketh out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth
of the Beast, if he repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not to turne from his euil wayes. Let it further
be weighed how ignorantly he chargeth me to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne al Churches,
for this smale examplifying of this Egiption darknes, Idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and exalting mens writings into this defacing of Gods word and
true worship, they neither being guylty of such a sacrilegious Leitour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
as this Egiptian Calf hatched at ROME, neither are to be presently
iudged no Church for others sinne, till they ioyne obstinacie to their

before God, I wil not make lesse the sinne, or the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t due to sinne,
for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s persons, no not of whole Churches, if they shal be guilty ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
My desire is by discouerie of the sinne, to bring men to repentance,
and vnto the awe of God in his worship: who are guyltie besides your
selues in such sacriledge, as to abrogate the Leitourgy of <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; set vp
an other, or to restraine Gods true worship, &amp; to giue life to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of
the Beast, it skilleth me not; let sinne be sinne, and God righteous, and
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> examine your selues, if they or you be cleare I reioyce, neither do I
think or ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charge them with such Idolatrie as is here erected: I take it
you wil be found y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derer of other Churches, to hide your owne fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines.
But saith Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> those scriptures are against the adding of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
preceptes &amp; lawes to be kept as partes of Gods worship to bind

or merit by them, or if they be against such rules of gouernment as
God hath set to be perpetuall, if the additions or constitutions be such
as anie of these, then such lawes and constitutions are against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> would goe a note further; namely, that in the seruice of God

that except the constitutions ecclesiasticall be such, as righteousnes be
commanded to be fought in the doing them, and forgiuenes of sinnes
and merit by them, all is wel. Then, besides the other abuses granted,
he must be demanded whither those traditions of the Fathers, which
our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> and his Disciples refused to obserue, were imposed
as meritorious? whervnto wee answere, No: For in the superstitious
washings of cuppes, of beddes, with al such trincketts, wee see to be no

the sinne was; namelie, to do and obserue such things of vaine glorie,
superstition, or custome, as God had not inioyned them, and to leaue
vndone the lawes and commandements of God; which sinne is your
transgression at this day: Reade therfore the 7. of <hi>Marke</hi> &amp; 15. of <hi>Mathew</hi>

We reade not that the law of God yt self was eyther commanded, or so

traditions of the Fathers at the Pharisies commandement, and so must
confesse it lawful and a dutie of vs to refuse to obserue your Iewish ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonies

Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> will proue that there is no adding or diminishing to or from

against such rules of his gouernment as bee perpetuall, though I take
all your orders, lawes, vvorship in this compasse; yet howe you can

add, superordeine, innovate or diminish or take anie thing from the
lawes of God already prescribed for his vvorship, were to abrogate his
lawe, to laye further burdens then hee hath layde, to make his lawe
vnperfect, and set our selues in his seate; yea vvhatsoeuer wee put to
vvhich hee hath not commanded, or whatsoeuer wee inhibit that hee
hath commanded, is here forbidden: For this saith the Lorde, <hi>Ye shall
put nothing vnto the vvord vvhich I command you, neither shall you take ought therefrom
that you may keepe the preceptes of the Lorde your God vvhich I commande you Deut.</hi> 4. 2.
And that this was as well in the outwarde ordinances of the Temple

so absolutely and generaly against al addition or detraction to or from
his ordinances, Mr. <hi>Giff.</hi> ouershooteth himself of his bare word to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
and limit so expresse commandementes; for these scriptures
(saith hee) are against adding of humane preceptes and lawes to bee
kept as partes of Gods vvrship, to bynde the conscience to seeke righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,
forgeuenes of sinne, merit in them, or against such rules of
gouernment as God hath set to be perpetuall. This is true, but this is
not all, for the lawe is generall against all inventions, traditions, consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
vvhatsoeuer God hath not commanded, as the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
doth also teach. <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self </hi> so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God hath
left nothing to be layde vpon his Church by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, which he

3.</hi> 15. must be better pervsed: <hi>If it be but a mans Testament vvhen yt is confirmed no
man doth abrogate yt or superordeine anie thing to yt:</hi> CHRISTS Testament then
being much more perfect, his vvhole minde for the ordering of his
house manifested therin, it is wicked presumption to alter the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
thereof, or to holde them vnmeete or vnsufficient for anie age
or estate. Well, Mr. GIFF. coulde nowe bee content thus far to limit
the povver of the Church; namelie, to haue her subiect and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to his voice; but that he supposeth there may be lawes ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
made, of things in themselues indifferent; that where the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath commanded such things to be vsed at our libertie for order,
for comelynes, edification and glorye of God, as matters of place,
time, and such circumstance. But hee here mistaketh his text, for the
Lorde commandeth by the Apostle in that place 1 <hi>Corint.</hi> 14. that those
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:4716:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
publique busines and exercises of the assemblies, shoulde be done in
order, in comlynes, to edifijng; and doth not leaue somthing to bee
commanded, vvhich the maister buylders hath not prescribed: For to
binde those thinges by lawe vvhich God hath not bound in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
wee are to add new traditious to bring vs into bondage of the
creatures, vvhich the same Apostle denyeth euer to bee brought into
bondage vnto 1 <hi>Corint.</hi> 6. 12. in his owne person teaching vs so to walke:
the Lord see in his wisdome cause to leaue them in our libertie, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there vvoulde bee no end of such perticular lawes, especially if he
had left it to mans wyt to make and vnmake lawes therin: For the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
you speake of then, meaning circumstances of time, place, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
sitting, standing &amp;c, there can be no further lawes of them, then
the Apostle hath set, and (as the Minister of CHRIST prescribed) that al
be donne to edifying in comlynes, order &amp;c. Of theis to set perticular
lawes, vvere to break these general lawes of God, whereby he teacheth
vs the true vse of them, and leaueth them in the Churches libertie as
need requireth to vse them or not vse them: Neither can all assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
bee bound in these thinges to the same in perticular, that being
needfull and decent in one, that is not in an other. And in that you
woulde haue them no further commanded, then they bee needfull,
convenient, decent &amp;c, you condiscend that there can bee no setled
lawe in perticular layde vpon the Church in them: For to vse them so
far as they bee convenient, necessarie, and to edifijng, is the lawe and
commandement of God; and to vse them further at anie mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
were both a breach of Gods lawe, and making the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
stumbling blockes, Idolles, bondages, and euerie way sinnefull.
And when the Church commandeth them so far to be vsed as they are
commanded of God, the Churche doth but ratifye and see Gods lawe
executed; so that you haue lost your selfe, whiles you shoulde haue
proued your bold assertion: That the Church hath power to ordeyne
lawes, for to create or make lawes, which you see the folly of, being
nowe driuen to another shift; that in the perticular thinges vvhereof
God hath giuen generall lawes, wee may make setled lawes, and yet
but for the tyme they be convenient; Wheras in deed Gods lawe is the
same and nothing ells. But because they bee necessarye in one place,
that bee not in another, at one tyme, that bee not at another, of some
persons, that bee not to other, ther can bee no lawe sett in the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
one daye for all assemblies in such thinges. Neither shall anye
disagreement bee such amongst the seueral Churches, as need anye
contention for them, vvhiles euerie assemblye doe that vvich is to
themselues most meet, most convenient and necessary in such things,
for the present tyme. The Pastor and Elders vvere of small discretion
if they might not haue these thinges in their libertie; and euen these
doctrines and examples are in this point against your selfe, vvhich you
haue alledged from other Churches. But my purpose is not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

it is said the Apostles, Elders, and brethren at Ierusalem met about the
question of Circumcision and other Ceremonies of <hi>Moses</hi> lawe, which
some would haue burdened the Gentiles with, we see there (saith he)
that the Apostles themselues did decree some thing for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time, which

here no question, it being by the moral lawe alwayes forbiden: For the
other Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> would thus reason. The Apostles themselues did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
them for the tyme, therfore the Church hath power to make and
ordeyne lawes in things of themselues indifferent, about the worship
of God and publick exercises. For our answere, wee vvould haue Mr.
<hi>Giff.</hi> first learne, that he, in saying y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles themselues did this by the
direction of the holy Ghost, hath ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe; for these were
the Maister builders, appointed of God to be law makers for the whole
Leitourgie and vvorship of CHRIST to all posterities, euen all the lawes
and ordinances of the newe Testament, confirmed by miracles from
heauen, deliuered by their ministery vnto vs: It vvill not follow then,
if the Apostles had made and ordeyned some lawe here, that therefore
euerie Synode or anie Synode may impose lawes &amp; commandements
by themselues ordeyned, till they shew they haue that power giuen
them the Apostles had, and an other Leitourgie to be made, vvhich
they shall neuer be able to doe, vvithout a newe <hi>Christ.</hi> Wee haue a sure
foundation alreadie layd, vvherevpon all Synods and Counsells must
build, and suffer their actions to be tryed therby; they haue not power
to inioyne one title, vvhich is not by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> word of God inioyned vs. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
vvhat did the Apostles here that they had not vvarrant for; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vvould they lay anie yoke or burthen. And as for these thinges,
they doe as much binde vs nowe if ther be like cause, namelie, not in
Idolothyts, blood, or that vvhich is strangled to offend our vveak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
if the Iues should be now againe called, neither to offend anie in

otherwise it had bene to build againe the thinges destroied; onlye
they thus counselled and adonished the Gentiles to vse their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in these thinges, as they might gyue noe offence to theyr
weake brethren of the Iues, the more to drawe them on in the
wayes of CHRIST; for they doe not inioyne yt as a lawe, but tell
them they shall doe well if they obserue these thinges, by no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitye
inforced. But wee doe not nowe obserue these thinges,
the occasions being remoued. True, therfore I trust you wil grant,
that no man shall bee furder bounde to anye constitution in such
thinges indifferent, then there shall bee cause, neyther need wee
publicke order to retract; so that you leaue the matter to me, that
wee can bee no further bounde in such thinges, then by those rules
of edifijng, order, comlines, occasion shall require, so that wee
neither need nor can haue setled lawes herein: howe much more
bondage and burden is imposed vnder this Antichristian yoke,
the thinges being of themselues most lothsome and detestable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
abrogating and making voide all the true ordinances lawes

your meaning that the regenerate man may of presumption and

of frailty: And I answere furder, hee coulde vnderstand the worde

thus; that God suffereth of his elect to fall into such sinne, yet hee is
able to reduce them by repentance, and hath made promise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
them if they retourne; and not haue cauilled in this maner in
such thinges, the horrour in the verye naming of which sinnes sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the flesh and bones of the godlye to heare or behold; so that
his drift is but to cast in a litle wormewood, to deface the truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered:
Therefore I will onlye prooue the generall doctrine before

bee restored by repentance, I thus prooue. Manie of Gods children

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4716:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all presumptuous sinne is not sinne against the holy Ghost, wee shall
see by the discription of that sinne <hi>Hebr. 6. &amp;</hi> 10. where there is dispy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the spirit, accompting the blood of IESVS an vnholy thinge,
persecuting the light they haue sometimes tasted of, and such like
notes, which are degrees further then presumption; for there is
presumption of ignorance, of rashnes, of hope of mercy, and many
times do the Prophets charge the people with rebellion against God;
so that all presumption cannot haue the curse maranatha pronounced
vpon it, or the persons not to bee prayed for. But sure I grant, that
presumption is neere to that sinne, and there cannot bee that high
sinne without presumption. But now if all sinne but sinne of frayltie
were vnpardonable, your Clergie were in a wofull case, that thus
maynely resist the truth, and persecute Gods seruants.</p>
            <p>Neither is this doctrine anye way contrarye to that I delyuered,
namelye, that the regenerat man cannot bee sayd to stande in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to sinne after regeneration, and the seruant of God at the same
time by outwarde profession; for none are in bondage to sinne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their calling to the faith, (to our iudgment) but suche as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynue
obstinate in their open knowne sinne after due admonition:
that such stande not by outwarde profession the seruants of CHRIST
but of sinne, and are to bee excommunicate, hee willingly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth;
and herevpon merueileth how I shoulde gather, that obstinat
grosse sinners shoulde not bee excommunicat, which hee might
playnlye perceiue if hee had eyes; for if al the regenerat bee in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to sinne, and so the seruants of sinne and of Satan, howe should
they cast out an other for bondage out of their fellowship by the
power of CHRIST? If Mr. GIFF. say, because the obstinate is in
greater bondage then the other; this proueth not that the bond can
cast out the bond by the power of CHRIST. Againe, if all bee in
bondage, then none can bee holden without for being in bondage
to sinne; so that none shoulde bee excommunicat, none without,
the worlde and the Church, light and darknes, CHRIST and <hi>Beliall</hi>
should bee mingled together. To all which hee hath made no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
but demandeth certeine questions, and maketh such a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
conclusion, as if all were in bondage vnto sinne. His questions
I grant al affirmatiuely, yet denye his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequence. Let him plainely
proue therfore by euidence of scripture, that all that do sinne are
bondslaues of sinne; and when hee hath so done, I shall therevpon
conclude him a flat <hi>Anabaptist</hi> in the cheif ground of their profession.
Verye gladlye therefore vvoulde hee leaue out the worde [bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage],
and falslye accuseth and sclandereth mee, in saying I holde
that men can not outwardly appeare sinners, and stand the seruants
of CHRIST both at a time, vvhich is an open vntruth: Yt is hee,
that cannot put differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene sinning, and bondage vnto sinne;
so that in one vvorde all his questions are answered: If anie bee in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:4716:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bondage to sinne, hee standeth a seruant thereof. Now for the 7. to
the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the Apostle setting forth the strift betwene the flesh and
the Spirit, speaketh somtimes in the person of the one (if I may so
speake) and somtimes of the other; somtimes of the newe man or
regenerat part, or of himself so far as hee is regenerat; somtimes of
the olde man, which is not wholly slaine, but full of rebellion stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
for maisterie. Nowe I must demand of him, whether of these
two haue the preheminence, dominion and rule in the regenerat,
the graces of the spirit, or the rebellions of the flesh? The same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
saith the spirit, and that part of the man renewed therewith,
which wee call the inner ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> In the 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> hee maketh it playne, <hi>The
lawe of the spirit of life in CHRIST hath freed mee from the lawe of sinne and of death.</hi>
What is the lawe of the Spirit but the powre, rule, and dominion
of the Spirit of God in vs? And what is the lawe of sinne, but the
powre of sinne, and bondage, wherewith wee were somtimes led
headlong by Satan at his pleasure, but are nowe freed, that it no
more doth reigne or beare rule in vs vnto condemnation. Againe,
whosoeuer are ledd by the Spirit of God, are the sonnes of God;
and in the 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. and 6. <hi>Cap. 16. knowe you not that to vvhome you ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

your selues seruants vnto obedience, his seruants you are to vvhome you giue your
selues obedient?</hi> DAVID feeling the great assaultes of sinne in his flesh,
and his inhabilitie to keepe the Lawe of God, earnestlye prayeth
vnto the Lorde <hi>Direct my steppes in thy vvorde</hi> (saith hee) <hi>and let none iniquitie
haue dominion over mee.</hi> After the stronge man is cast out, CHRIST bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the rule ouer vs and in vs, by his Spirit. So the scripture eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
where pronounceth vs Saincts by calling, Kinges, and Priestes,
a people set free; not that wee sinne not in thought word and deede
howrely and daylye, but that sinne hath not dominion ouer vs: If
then wee were in bondage to sinne, wee are the servantes of sinne
and of death, which God forbid. Where Mr. GIFF. therfore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth
thus; the regeneration is imperfect, therefore the freedome
is imperfect, therefore there is some bondage, yt is blasphemie: For
first our freedome is perfect in CHRIST, ells his death is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
Then though our sanctification bee not perfect, yet is there
no bondage, but a rebellion of sinne; which if yt shoulde reigne,
wee were not the seruantes of CHRIST: And while it seemeth for
a time to reigne, and wee obstinatly to cleaue vnto yt, wee are iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(soe far as men can iudge) the seruantes of yt, and so gyuen ouer
from CHRIST vnto Satan, till the grace of the Spirit againe to our
iudgement againe appeare to beare rule. As for DAVID in the
whole yeare after hee had commytted adulterye and murther, hee
neuer pleaded for his sinne when hee was reproued, nor did no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
cleaue vnto yt. Soe likewise though wee fall and sinne, and bee

wee obstinatly and wilfully giue our selues vnto yt from CHRIST,

is false, to saye, the Apostle stoode in some spirituall bondage; and
my Argument still firme, that these Ministers and people which
