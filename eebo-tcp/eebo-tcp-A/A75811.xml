         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Perſecution for Religion condemned, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN the precedent part of this diſcourſe, I have demonſtrated (according to
that light which the Lord Chriſt hath infuſed into my Soul) how much Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercency
in Religion is repugnant to the Law of Nature, and, by many evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and unanſwerable Texts of Scripture, ſhewed, how diſpleaſing it is
to God, how improper to advance the power of godlineſſe, and how extremly
diſaggreeable to the ſweet Spirit, which guided our Lord Jeſus in the propagation
of his Goſpel. And after in the ſame little Treatiſe I proceed to prove (by the
expreſſe words of the Parliaments and Armies Declarations) that the great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
wherein we glory, and which we have ſo long fought to eſtabliſh, is a perfect
Goſpel-freedom, and abſolute deliverance of the Conſcience from all Tyranny
and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Which diſcourſe as I compoſed in all humbleneſs of ſpirit, and afterwards offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the gracious Redeemer of our Souls, who gave me ſtrength and power to
finiſh it to his glory: So I finde not onely my ſelf (for which I humbly thank the
bounty of my God) confirmed in my former judgement, but others in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
convinced in theirs, of the unreaſonablenes and ſin of Conſcience-Perſecution.</p>
            <p>Concerning which pious and modeſt temper of mutuall forbearance, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
add to what I have mentioned in the former part, this plain and familiar Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
That as the ſureſt mark of a tender conſcience in our ſelves, is a tender
ſpirit to others, ſo the moſt infallible ſign of a hard and ſtony heart in our breſts,
is when we ſlit in pieces and ſhipwrack the Conſciences of all that touch upon us:
But praiſed for ever be the Name of our God, who ſtill proceeds to guide and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate
his choſen, graciouſly diſpoſing them neither to preſume upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for their knowledge, nor be cruell againſt others for their ignorance, but
humbly adore and wait upon the Divine Providence in the diſpoſure of all things:
which fils my ſoul with exceeding joy, when I conſider it to be the general ſenſe
of all the truly godly and well-affected in this Nation, that no quiet and peaceable
Chriſtian be deprived of the chief content and comfort of this life, which certainly
conſiſts in a real &amp; impartial, yet unoffenſive liberty, to ſerve his God according to
his conſcience. Many Petitions I could here cite in affirmance of this Truth, from
ſeverall Provinces of this Land; but I ſhall trouble the Reader only with theſe
two, the firſt was preſented to the Parliament upon the ſix and twentieth of
<hi>March</hi> 1649. from the county of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> wherein, though I were none of the
Subſcribers; yet I did, both by my ſelf and friends, promote it what I could, as
conceiving the requeſts of it, both juſt and reaſonable; it bore this Title,</p>
            <q>The humble Petition of divers well affected of the County of Leiceſter, in
behalf of themſelves and the Nation,</q>
            <p>
               <hi>ANd the ſeventh. Article or branch of the Petition was this.</hi> 7. That every one
may enjoy the juſt freedoms to worſhip God according to his word, without any
Coercive or restrictive courſes to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Petition being read, the Gentlemen that preſented it were called in, and
Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> by Order of the Houſe, gave them hearty thanks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on the 2 of <hi>April</hi> following, a like Petition was preſented, entituled, <hi>The
humble Petition and Repreſentation of ſeverall Churches of God in London, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
though falſly, called Anabaptists,</hi> which was alſo graciouſly accepted by
the Houſe, according to the Merit of ſo conſcientious a ſuit, and the juſtice of ſo
glorious a Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:135760:3"/>
At which time we happily began to ſhake off that intollerable burthen of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char,</hi>
the Presbyterian government, which has bin ſince in a good meaſure effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
through the bleſſing of the Lord Chriſt, and pious care of his inſtruments,
the Governours of this Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>In ſo much as no perſons of what ſociety or perſwaſion ſoever in this Nation,
are at preſent perſecuted for their Conſcience onely; or difference in outward
worſhip, but the Papiſt, whom I am therefore (according to that Principle of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which abſolutely commands my ſpirit,) obliged to make the chief ſubject of
this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In order to which performance, I have ſince the writing my former ſheets) often
waited upon God in humility of ſpirit, and endeavour to inform my ſelf, as much
as I could of the truth, and particular manner of their ſufferings, and to that end
have ſomtimes purpoſely attended at Haberdaſhers hall, to hear their Caſes
pleaded, where though I ſuffered ſome perſecution from the croud and noiſe
of that place, yet far more was the grief of my minde to behold ſo many diſtreſſed
ſuiters, whoſe countenances were made ſad by the fear of a fatall Order for
their impoveriſhment. But before I proceed to any of thoſe particulars,
I muſt (at leaſt in my own judgement) clear the Papiſts obſtinacy and
non ſubmiſſion to the preſent government, wherewith they were by ſome
accus'd, as a ſufficient ground of all their puniſhment; from which imputation I
ſhall eaſily deliver them by tranſcribing a copy of their Petition, which they have
with much diligence and humble importunity, addreſſed to very many Members
of Parliament, profeſſing to wait onely the happines of an opportunity to preſent
it to the Houſe, and being a Paper at leaſt 5 or 6 moneths old, and delivered to
ſo many perſons, with whom I have the honour to be acquainted, it fell by chance
into my hands, having I confeſſe of late entertained a particular delight and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
to paſſe ſome part of my time in ſuch curioſities.</p>

that it can no wayes be interpreted misbecoming the duty of good and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſubjects; and for the matter of the Petition, it ſeems to my eye ſo reaſonable,
that I cannot believe, but after a little patience, till other more generall affairs
afford the Parliament leiſure, it will certainly receive a ſatisfactory and relieving
Anſwer; Eſpecially ſince not onely ſuch Papiſts, whoſe moderate delinquency
leaves them ſome hope of mercy, nor ſuch who for preſervation of their lives,

Religion, yet all freely and humbly ſubmit in this Petition to the abſolute plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Parliament for Rules of Compoſition, and this (as to the ſingle Papiſt)
for an offence, which in no other ſociety of Chriſtians in this Nation is accounted
any crime at all, being meerly their different judgement in Religion; a proceeding,
wherein certainly we ſhall uſe too much ſeverity, and partiality, if we make it not
onely unpardonable, but unredeemable.</p>
            <p>In the cloſe of their Petition they humbly beg the favour of an opportunity to
ſatisfy the Parliament in the point of conſiſtency with <hi>Civil Government,</hi> which

            <p>THeſe expreſſions concerning four of the moſt offenſive points, wherein
the Papiſts differ from us, have I confeſſe given me a great and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſatisfaction; And though I remain in the ſame mind as to the erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of many of their Tenets, yet I ſee we may eaſily be too paſſionate in the
degree of deteſting any different opinion, ſince every error is not preſently to be
cenſured, as an unſufferable abomination; and too ſevere in the degree of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the diſſenters from our own judgements, as if they were unworthy to
breath the ſame air with our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Certainly, many Proteſtants, who quietly enjoy a juſt and unmoleſted free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
approach very near to the firſt aſſertion of the Papiſts, whilſt ſome both
writers and diſcourſers, profeſſe to ſubmit their private judgements unappeala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to a truly-free Generall Councell, that ſhe might once have an end of all
ſtrife and contention about matters of Religion; others refer themſelves without
further inſtance to a Provinciall Aſſembly of Divines, and very few but will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the judgement of the Supreme authority of this Nation, before their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſenſe, readily conforming to that Declaration which the Parliament ſhall
hold forth to be the true meaning of the Scripture: So that almoſt every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in the acknowledgement of an external authority to decide ſuch Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,
as ariſe out of the different interpretation of their faith upon the
Churches ſleeve, and yield a blind obedience (that is without appealing any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
to her determination.</p>
            <p>And for the ſecond Branch, I am ſure many Proteſtants continue ſtill thoſe
old cuſtomes of baring their heads when they come into a Church, nay of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the name of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> Practices that ly open to the greateſt part of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
which our more godly and conſcientious penns make againſt the Papiſts,
in the queſtion of Pictures; yet I hope there will never be the leaſt thought en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
of impoſing penalties upon the private and unſcandalous uſe of any ſuch
Ceremonies: Rather let us apply our endeavours to open their eys with a mild and
gentle hand, than beat them out with the club-fiſt of the Law.</p>
            <p>But when I reflect upon the third concluſion in the Recuſants Paper, I am,
aſtoniſhed to conſider how Education with a little mixture of Paſſion or intereſt
makes every ſlight diſtemper amongſt Chriſtians (which of it ſelf were eaſily
curable) ſo deſperate, that it often becomes irrecoverable, and endangers both
the health and life of Chriſtianity. Surely in many things we ſtrangely miſtake
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135760:5"/>
one another. I profeſſe ſincerely, I ſhould be ſo far from ſeiſing on the Eſtate of
a Papiſt, for refuſing that part of the Oath of Abjuration, wherein he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to renounce the Doctrine of merits, that I am reſolved to ſuffer a thouſand
deaths, rather then abjure ſo great and manifeſt a truth, according to the ſenſe
wherein they explain themſelves, or affirm ſo great and manifeſt an Errour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſenſe wherein we explain our ſelves. For when we cenſure the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Merits, we underſtand by that word our deſerts, as they exclude the
merits of Chriſt, and abſtracting from the Covenant God hath been pleaſed to
make with us in his Son, and in that ſenſe we juſtly condemne all opinions of
Merit, even of the beſt works, as preſumptuous and Luciferian; But I now ſee
when the Papiſts affirm that good works are meritorious, they include both the
promiſe of God and the merits of Chriſt Jeſus, and in effect when all is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
up, it amounts only to this, That God hath graciouſly promiſed, and will
faithfully keep his word, to reward all thoſe with eternall life that believe in
him, and obey his Commandements, In this ſenſe the Papiſts hold mercifulnes
to be meritorious, or available to ſalvation, becauſe the Scripture ſayes, <hi>Bleſſed
are the mercifull for they ſhall obtain mercy.</hi> Matth. 5. 7. In this ſenſe the Papiſts
hold patience in affliction to be meritorious or available to Salvation, becauſe
the Scripture ſayes, <hi>Bleſſed are they who are perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake, for
theirs is the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> Mat. 5. 10. And this (as I am informed by
very underſtanding men amongſt them) is the reall truth of their Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
good works, which in my judgement differs nothing from ours, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the unſavoury and proud-ſounding word merit.</p>
            <p>The laſt Cauſe of the Papiſts Note, which <hi>I</hi> have tranſcribed, is ſo full and
ſatisfactory, that if they will be as good as their words, <hi>I</hi> ſhall neither fear to
have ſuch neighbours, nor need any Magiſtrate fear to have ſuch Subjects.</p>
            <p>And to prove their truſtineſſe and fidelity, in the obſervance of their oaths, <hi>I</hi>
cannot imagin a more evident demonſtration, then that they make a conſcience
of what oaths they take. He that ſwears any thing without diſtinction, may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be ſuſpected to be as falſe to men, as he is fearleſſe of God, whereas no clearer
argument can be alledged in the behalf of any, that they intend to keep all the
oaths they take, then this, that they will not take all the oaths you offer; ſurely if
the Pope or their own conſciences could give them this extravagant priviledge, to
be bound by no oath, they might without difficulty take any, and if they were
allowed by their Religion to ſwear any thing, certainly they are all worſe then
mad, if they do not immediately poſt away to <hi>Haberdaſhers hall,</hi> call for the
oath of abjuration, ſwallow it down quickly without any chewing, and ſo ſave
at leaſt 50000 l a year in a morning.</p>
            <p>In the late Kings dayes, many Papiſts were ſmartly puniſhed for not taking
the oath of allegeance, none for obſerving it, nay <hi>I</hi> have heard ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt-Delinquents
argue for themſelves, that the utter ruine, which now endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
their whole eſtates, proceeds ſolely from their performing to the late King
that ſervice which he called alleagiance, and this is yet a higher proof of their
fidelity in their promiſes, ſince they adventured with ſo much hazard to keep
that oath in ſubgance, which they refuſed with almoſt as much hazard to take, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
againſt their conſcience in ſome circumſtance.</p>
            <p>And now let any one judge indifferently, whether they that firmly believe all
the holy Scriptures of the old and New Teſtament, worſhip and adore onely
one God, rely upon <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> for their ſole Mediator, and profeſſe it their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to obſerve the commandements of the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> may not reaſonably be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135760:6"/>
ſuffered to live in their native countrey with the peaceable enjoyment of their
conſciences in their private houſes, eſpecially thoſe who will quietly ſubmit to
cautions and reſtrictions, as the common-wealth ſhall require for prevention of
ſcandall, or diſturbance of the publick peace.</p>
            <p>Beſides <hi>I</hi> am perſwaded a far leſſe liberty will <hi>oblige</hi> the Papiſts than <hi>content</hi>
any other, becauſe hitherto all liberty has been wholly denyed to them, and
wholly allowed to every one elſe, ſo that they will gladly receive as a mercy and
favour, what others challenge as a right, and their affections being once purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
at ſo cheap a price, as a little private exerciſe of their conſcience, free from
the fright and ſmart of penalties, I am confident they will neither be ſuch fools
as to forfeit their liberty, nor ſo ungratefull as to forget them that gave it; ſince
out of all our hiſtories not one example can be aſſigned, that they ever offered to
move the leaſt ſedition, in a time when they enjoyed but half the liberties of free-born
Engliſh men.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall cloſe my thoughts upon this Paper, with a ſhort and free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
which I conceive abridges in few words the whole difficulty betwixt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and Superior; The Magiſtrate that protects any ſort of people in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
may juſtly require their ſervice, and ſafely rely upon their obedience
but if he perſecute them, whether Proteſtants or Papiſts, he will ſoon find, that
as he may violently force their complyance, he can never prudently reſt upon
their affections.</p>
            <p>But I muſt here beg leave to be diſpenſed with in my promiſe of ending this
period, till <hi>I</hi> have added this obſervation, How many Modern Authors of good
account amongſt us, have poſitively held forth to the people (as an unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
truth) that the Papiſts by their Principles, <hi>are not obliged to keep faith with
Hereticks?</hi> and <hi>I</hi> muſt acknowledge <hi>I</hi> was once of the ſame opinion concerning
them, principally relying upon the credit of Mr. <hi>Iames Howell,</hi> an ingenious
traveller in moſt of the Popiſh countries, which makes me the more wonder, that
he ſhould take ſuch an erroneous opinion upon truſt, and aſſert it in Print near the
end of the firſt part of <hi>Dodona's Grove,</hi> where he ſayes, <hi>That one of the Canons
of the laſt great Councell,</hi> (which muſt needs be the Councel of <hi>Trent) was that,
Haereticis non eſt tenenda fides,</hi> The eſteem <hi>I</hi> had entertain'd of that Authors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
permitted me not to <hi>acquieſſe</hi> to ſome Recuſants verball deniall of this,
aſſertion; but (for more aſſured ſatisfaction in ſo important a point) <hi>I</hi> took the
pains to peruſe ſome of their beſt writers, and found them unamimouſly agree,
<hi>that faith is not onely to be kept with Hereticks, but even with Turks, Iews and
Infidels, and that indiſpenſably:</hi> neither could <hi>I</hi> find one tittle to that purpoſe, in
any Canon or Seſſion of that laſt great Councel, (as he calls it) but to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
For both in the fifteenth and eighteenth Seſſion, the Councell ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
<hi>that whoſoever ſhall violate the leaſt point of the publick faith, given for
the ſecurity of all Proteſtants, that ſhould repair to that Councell, ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to thoſe penalties, quas jure divino &amp; humano aut conſuetudine hujuſmodi
ſalvorum conductuum violatores incurrere poſſunt, abſque omni excuſatione, aut
quavis in hac parte contradictione.</hi> By which it evidently appears that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
ſuppoſed, as a thing known and certain, that whoſoever ſhould violate his <hi>faith</hi>
promiſed to Hereticks, was not onely puniſhable by humane Laws, but even by
the divine Law it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And certainly if it had been my unhappineſſe to have done any ſort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ſo much wrong in publick, my conſcience (coming afterward to be better
inform'd would oblige me to a publick reparation; for though we uſe no ſuch <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:135760:6"/>
as the Papiſts practiſe, yet the Law of naturall reaſon binds us to as punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
an obſervance of reſtitution, as any Papiſt whatſoever, and that even to Papiſts
themſelves, when we do them any injury.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for a finall diſpatch of this point concerning the Papiſts indiſpenſable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of performing their promiſes, it was my fortune to light upon a book of
one</hi> Paul Layman <hi>a German Jeſuit, and an Author of great eſteem amongſt the</hi>
Caſuiſts (<hi>who treating of diſpenſations</hi> lib. 2. tract. 3. cap. 12.) <hi>ſets down theſe
words,</hi> Dico quartò, Si Catholici cum Haereticis publicum faedus ineant, non poteſt

contract with Hereticks, it cannot be diſſolv'd or diſpenſed with by the Popes
power. <hi>And ſome few lines after proceeding upon the ſame queſtion, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
down-right,</hi> Abſolutè negari debet id (viz remiſſionem foederis) à ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
Pontifice fieri poſſe; it ought abſolutely to be denyed, that it is in the power
of the Pope to abſolve from ſuch contracts. <hi>And again,</hi> Fides publica haereticis
data inviolabiliter &amp; ſine ullo diſpenſationis remedio ſervanda eſt, quamdiu ipſi
ſervare parati ſunt: Publick ſaith given to Hereticks ought inviolably and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſpenſation to be obſerved, ſo long as they are ready to perform their part. <hi>And
concludes that even</hi> Ieſuites <hi>as well as other</hi> Doctors <hi>hold the Popes power to be
limitable, and not ſo almighty as the world uſually believes concerning them. The
ſame doctrine is repeated in the abridgement of</hi> Laymans <hi>book entituled</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium
Moralis Theologiae Pauli Layman folio 265.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts have given ſo much ſatisfaction by their Petition and other Papers,
but much more by their ſubmiſſion to, and peaceable demeanour in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
as it is now eſtabliſht; <hi>I</hi> muſt appeal not onely to the Parliament,
and that great inſtrument of our freedome my <hi>Lord Generall Cromwell,</hi> but to
all conſcientious men, whether theſe Papiſts may not reaſonably hope ſo
much mercy, as not to be by penalties debard the private exerciſe of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,

ſhall be pleaſed to ordain for regulation of Soul freedome; ſince it is evident
that Chriſtian liberty may be lawfully governed, though it be alſo as evident
that it cannot lawfully be taken away, ſo that every peaceable ſpirit have liberty
enough, and yet the licentious Liver not have too much.</p>
            <p>Such moderate &amp; orderly freedom might charitably be allowed to the quiet Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts

(not being priſoners of war or ſouldiers of fortune in Commiſſion) who ſhall in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of the ſaid Declaration live peaceably, and yield obedience to the Parliament
of the Common-wealth of England exerciſed in Scotland, ſhall not onely be freed
and diſcharged from all forfeitures and confiſcations of their Estates for any thing
formerly done by them in reference to the wars, but he received into the protection of
the Parliament, and enjoy ſuch Liberties and immunities, as alſo ſuch Leaſes and
grants of confiſcated and forfeited Lands, as upon conſideration of their reſpective
qualities and deſerts ſhall be thought fit, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Branch of this Declaration ſuch a Conſcience ſecurity is held forth
as (according to my ſoul) ought not by the Lawes of Chriſt be denyed to any
peaceable Chriſtian, and I extremely rejoyce in the Spirit of our Governors for
ſo noble and charitable a proceeding, yet I plainly ſee, that they to whom this
favour is allowed, are both different from us in the Principles of their Religion
and oppoſite to us in their Nationall affection; whereas a far leſſer mercy is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to our own kindred and allies, to our own conntrey men born to the ſam free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
with our ſelves, who have in a much leſſe meaſure offended in matters of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility,
nay divers of them not at all, who yet would be content and thankfull for
a ſmall part of that favour which the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſo bountifully beſtowes upon
ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>By the ſecond Branch very many of that Nation, who have been in actuall
arms againſt us, and perhaps wounded or flain our friends in open battells, will
receive an immunity (for 500 l. Sterling is a great eſtate in Scotland;) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
many of our own Countrey, who never lifted up hand againſt us, have two
parts of their eſtates with rigor ſequeſtred, and that without ſo charitable a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as to free the poorer ſort, whoſe eſtates are of leſſe value then 500 l. For
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135760:7"/>
our mercileſſe Sequeſtrators have tripartited even the day labourers goods and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
houſe-holdſtuff, and taken away two Cowes, where the whole ſtock was but
three.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Paſſages obſerved upon Caſes depending at Haberdaſhers Hall.</head>
               <p>I Muſt confeſſe, I had not ſo much time to ſpare, as I could have wiſh'd, yet
for ſome weeks I attended at <hi>Haberdaſhers Hall</hi> for better ſatisfaction: but to
make a full diſcovery of all the proceedings there, is beyond the level of my
diſcourſe: I will only promiſe in what I ſay, not to exceed the bounds of truth
and modeſty. The preſent Commiſſioners, who are ſeven in number, for ought I
could diſcern are civil perſons, and moſt of them apprehenſive of others ſufferings,
but ſeem to ſay in many hard caſes, that either their Inſtructions or Commiſſion
binds them up from being able to give relief, or the obligation to the Oath they
take will not permit them. To ſhew the tenderneſſe and compaſſion, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
(I am perſwaded) their conſciences would carry them forth to practiſe, ſince
moſt of the Suitors that come before them appear ſo miſerably ruined, that the
very diſtreſſednes of their condition is motive enough to incite the mercy of their
Judges, eſpecially, their crime being only the refuſall of an Oath, which they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
profeſſe is againſt their conſciences, and I am ſure is againſt our Laws;
And truly as often as I reflect upon the ſtrange ſeverity of that Oath, my ſoul goes
forth in pitty towards them that are concern'd in it; ſince even their thoughts are
not free, but an abſolute force laid upon the moſt inward cogitations of their
hearts, and themſelves compelled to condemn themſelves by accuſations wreſted
out of their own mouthes.</p>
               <p>Upon the ceaſing of the former Committees authority, theſe 7. (which now ſit
Judges of Delinquency and ſequeſtrations) were impowered about 25. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1649,
ſince which time they &amp; their ſubcommiſſioners in the ſeveral Counties have made
many diſcoveries both of delinquents and Papiſts eſtates, either not before ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
or not compounded for at the full value, but I obſerved that they who were
ſequeſtred or had their rents or goods unduly taken from them, in the time of the
former Committees for Sequeſtrations, how unjuſtly ſoever, could not be relieved
by theſe Commiſſioners, nor any other power, but by the Parliament it ſelf.</p>
               <p>It was the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Robert Knightley</hi> a Recuſant only, a great part of whoſe
Manſion houſe in <hi>Eſſex</hi> was puld down to repair the Fort at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> for which he
petitioned at <hi>Haberdaſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs hall</hi> in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1651, to have ſatisfaction out of the 2
ſequeſtred parts of his own lands there. But in regard it appeared to be done before
<hi>Ian.</hi> 1649, the preſent Commiſſioners anſwer was, <hi>they had no power to relieve him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in all other Caſes upon Appeals, where it appears, that rents have been
unduly received to the States uſe for 7 or 8 years laſt paſt, in wrong to the true
owner of the lands; Theſe Commiſſioners in ſuch caſe make reſtitution onely
from <hi>Jan.</hi> 1649; And for money, goods, or perſonall eſtate unduely ſeized or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred
before that time, they make no reſtitution at all.</p>
               <p>This ſeemed ſtrange to me; for by the ſame rule, if the preſent Commiſſioners
ſhould ſequeſter half the lands and goods in England right or wrong, and then
be diſplaced and new Commiſſioners eſtabliſhed, who have no power to review and
conſider the acts of their predeceſſors, in time we may all come to be ſequeſtred,
and yet be without appeal, except to the Parliament, who have too many publique
obligations to ſpend their thoughts in particular buſineſſes.</p>
               <p>On the 11th of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1651, there was heard the caſe of one Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Morleys</hi> only ſon, about 14 years of age, he petitioned for maintenance out of his
fathers ſequeſtred eſtate, but becauſe it was ſuſpected the childe might encline to
his fathers Religion, who is a Papiſt, it was denyed him, unleſſe he might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135760:8"/>
both from Father and Mother, and committed to the government of a meer
ſtranger, which was ordered accordingly, and the poor pittance of 100 l. <hi>per ann.</hi>
only allowed him, out of his own and fathers eſtate.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Feb.</hi> 1651. Mr. <hi>James Hanham</hi> of the Weſt Petitions the Commiſſioners
at <hi>Haberdaſhers Hall</hi> to this effect, that he had never acted any thing againſt
the Parliament yet two parts of his eſtate were ſequeſtered with ſuch rigor for
his Recuſancy, that he could not poſſibly ſubſiſt with neceſſaries by the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thirds, when Taxes and other charges were deducted: That he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſtrained to borrow 50 l. upon Bond, and having disburſed 15 l. of the
money, it ſeems the <hi>Sequeſtrators</hi> got notice that the Petitioner had ſomewhat in
his houſe worth a new Sequeſtration or review, as they call it, thereupon they
ſearch his trunks, finding the remaining 35 l. pull out the guilty bag, and two
parts of it they ſequeſter into their own pockets, to the uſe of the Common-wealth,
and for relief therein Mr. <hi>Hanham</hi> appealed, but found no redreſs at
preſent, more then Order for the ſub-Commiſſioners in the Countrey to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the buſineſſe and certifie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At the return of whoſe Certificate, I leave
the Petitioner to expect his doom.</p>
               <p>On the 31 of <hi>March,</hi> 1652. the Petition of one <hi>Hamond</hi> or <hi>Ammot</hi> was read,
to this effect, That the Petitioner did never bear Arms nor aſſiſt the Enemies of
the Parliament, yet his eſtate had lyen under ſequeſtration ever ſince the year
1645. and not one penny allowed him for his maintenance. That the Petitioner,
being a Recuſant, did in the time of the late war continue at his own houſe, as
long as he could without apparent danger of his life, but conſidering how obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
even the moſt peaceable of his religion were to be affronted and ruined, by
the daily miſchiefs they received from ſome diſorderly Souldiers, and eſpecially
ſeeing one of his neighbours (a Recuſant) ſlain at his own door, the Petitioner
did then and not before, fly for protection to a Gariſon of the late Kings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
acting any thing in the leaſt kind againſt the Parliament. And therefore
humbly prayed he might have a fifth of his eſtate and the arrears allowed him to
buy bread. But it not appearing to the Commiſſioners that he had wife or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
their anſwer was, <hi>they had not power to grant him any relief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do I believe this mans Caſe to be ſingular; for I am well ſatisfied, that a
great part of thoſe Papiſts, who are ſequeſtred as abſolute Delinquents, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in actuall arms againſt the Parliament, but onely fled to the Enemies Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for ſhelter, yet no qualification or difference in puniſhment is hitherto allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, which would be to my underſtanding very juſt and reaſonable; ſince
who ever did obſerve the fury and rage of moſt of our Common Souldiers (at the
beginning of the late troubles) againſt many of that party, will eaſily conclude
the Papiſts had reaſon to diſtruſt their own perſonall ſecurity amongſt them. And
for inſtance <hi>I</hi> remember an Officer of my acquaintance under the Earl of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>
told me, that at their taking of <hi>Lincola</hi> from the <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> in the year
1644. he was an eye witneſſe of this Tragedy. The next day after the Town was
taken, ſome of our common Souldiers in cold blood (meeting with Mr. <hi>Price</hi>
of <hi>Waſhingley</hi> in <hi>Huntington</hi> ſhire a Papiſt) asked him, <hi>Art thou</hi> Price <hi>the Papiſt?
I am</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Price the Roman Catholick,</hi> whereupon one of them immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhot him dead.</p>
               <p>In the ſame moneth of <hi>March</hi> there happened at this Hall a very hard caſe,
which was of a maid ſervant (whoſe name <hi>I</hi> do not remember) but her Petition
was to this effect. That her Father and mother both died when ſhe was but ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of age, and being very poor, they left the Petitioner only ſome old
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135760:8"/>
clothes and a little houſhold-ſtuff, in all not worth above five or ſix pounds, after
whoſe death the Petitioner, being an Orphan betook her ſelf to ſervice, and having
ſerved ſeventeen years for the annuall wages of ſeven nobles, the Petitioner had
by her frugality increaſed her ſmall patrimony to twenty pounds, which being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the hands of <hi>A. B,</hi> and of late diſcovered to be the Petitioners money, and
the Petitioner a Recuſant, ſhe pray'd that they would take the ſad and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
condition of a poor orphan into their charitable conſideration, whereby the
extremity of the Law might be qualified to ſo mercifull a temper that ſhe might
not be utterly ruined, by loſing in a moment for her conſcience, what ſhe had been
ſo long in gathering by the ſweat of her brows. But the Commiſſioners (though
perhaps otherwiſe willing) concluded they had not power to give her any relief
more then the bare thirds, unleſſe ſhe would take the oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> a thing
as far at leaſt above her underſtanding, as it can be againſt her Conſcience.</p>
               <p>If it be unreaſonable, (as many well affected ſeem to urge) that the Miniſters
who do or at leaſt ſhould perform ſome ſpirituall office for the good of the Soul)
ſhould tithe a tenth part of the Husbandmans labour: How much more unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
is it, that a poor ſilly maid ſervant ſhould thus meerly upon the account of
Conſcience, be ſequeſtered of two thirds of that, which by many years labour, ſhe
had gained and reſerved as a ſupport againſt the neceſſities of old age.</p>
               <p>On the 16 of <hi>April</hi> 1652. The Caſe of Miſtris <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> a Recuſant,
was heard, whoſe Petition ſpake to this effect, That her late husband in his life
time ſetled a Leaſe of <hi>Muck-hall</hi> (or ſuch like name) in <hi>Eſſex</hi> of conſiderable
value upon her in lieu of Joincture, for divers years yet in being, and was held
of the late Dean and Chapter of <hi>Pauls</hi> that Alderman <hi>Andrews</hi> or Mr. <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
his ſon, had bought the Reverſion of thoſe Lands at <hi>Gurney</hi> houſe, and ſince
taken a Leaſe for ſeven years of the Commiſſioners for ſequeſtration in <hi>Eſſex</hi> of
the whole preſent poſſeſſion, without the Petitioners conſent or knowledge, and
without any regard to her thirds; and that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Andrews</hi> having now
poſſeſſion of the whole eſtate, had demoliſhed the Petitioners Manſion houſe,
and did refuſe to pay the Petitioner her thirds, whereby ſhe was driven to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of wanting bread, being a diſtreſſed and friendleſſe widow of almoſt 80
years of age, ſhe therefore prayd her thirds, and the arrears, and that the ſaid
Leaſe might be annulled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt was charitably granted, but as to the Leaſe and what her thirds ſhould
be, ſhe was left to the mercy of Mr.</hi> Andrews, <hi>who I fear does forget what the
Father of mercies ſayes in</hi> Jeremy 22. 3. Execute judgement and righteouſneſſe,
and deliver the ſpoiled out of the hands of the oppreſſor, and do no wrong,
doe no violence to the ſtranger, and fatherleſſe, and widow, &amp;c, <hi>And in</hi>
Matth. 23. 14. Wo unto you Scribes, and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye devour wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
houſes, and for a pretence make long prayer; therefore ye ſhall receive the
greater damnation.</p>
               <p>That which in this Caſe did moſt exact my obſervation, was, That Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi>
(a perſon of quality) ſhould make uſe of his power againſt a poor wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and ſhould be preſent, and openly avow the taking of her eſtate over her
head; with ſo little regard to the thirds, which is allowed her by the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and ſo much to his own benefit, without which, 'tis like he would not
have taken it, and with which the Petitioner muſt needs ſuffer.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Haberdaſhers Hall</hi> give me leave to make a ſtep into <hi>Moorefields</hi> where
on the 19 of <hi>May</hi> 1650 being the Lords day, <hi>Rich. Ledſam</hi> and one <hi>Led bealer,</hi>
two Purſivants apprehended <hi>Robert Segar,</hi> a poor old decrepit man, upon a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135760:9"/>
(and 'twas but a ſuſpition) that he had been at the Spaniſh <hi>Embaſſadors</hi>
at <hi>Maſſe,</hi> upon this bare ſurmiſe the poor man was ſearched, and in his pockets
they found an old prayer book, whereupon he was carried before a Juſtice of
Peace, and committed to the <hi>Gatehouſe</hi> at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> where he lay in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Goale till the Quarter Seſſions in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1951. being full 20 moneths, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any charge or proceedings againſt him, and that Seſſions was acquitted by
Proclamation, through the mercy of Juſtice <hi>Scobell,</hi> but he is ſtill detained pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
(this being now <hi>April</hi> 1652,) by Mr. <hi>weeks</hi> the keeper of the Priſon,
for the rent of his lodging, for which the keeper demands 14 pence a week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
Fees, and yet (as I am credibly inform'd) the old man lay on the boords in
the common Goale, and had no other pillow for his head, but a hard ſtone, for
which he muſt now pay more then he is worth, or continne in Priſon, being 86
years of age.</p>
               <p>And now I am at the <hi>Gatehouſe</hi> I ſhall give you the ſupplement of a like ſad ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mentioned in the 21 page of the firſt part of this <hi>Moderator,</hi> concerning a
great bellied Gentle-woman, committed to Priſon on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1651. her
name upon enquiry <hi>I</hi> find was <hi>Delavall,</hi> an Engliſhwoman, but her Husband a
Frenchman; ſhe was committed alſo to the <hi>Gatehouſe,</hi> and with much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
got leave by Petition to go out upon bail till ſhe was brought to bed, but was
an actuall Priſoner full 7 Moneths of the 12; which is preſcribed by the Statute,
and a fine of 100 Marks ſtood charg'd upon her, till ſhe was relieved by the late
gracious Act of <hi>Generall Pardon</hi> and <hi>Oblivion,</hi> (An Act that no leſſe obliges
all the People of this Nation to forget their private injuries, then to remember
the publick mercy of the Parliament) and all this poor womans ſufferings meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grounded upon a bare ſuppoſition, that ſhe had been at the then French A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
in Long acre at Maſs, without ſo much as one witneſſe, that there was any
Maſſe ſaid there at all, it being the truth of the Caſe (if <hi>I</hi> may believe their
moſt ſerious Proteſtations) that they were onely at their other private devotions.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Haberdaſhers Hall. I</hi> perceived in my obſervations there, that
beſides the caſes before recited, it was a familiar thing to ſee Papiſts <hi>I</hi> mean ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Papiſts, without the adjunct of Delinquency) outed of the poſſeſſion of the
two ſequeſtered thirds of their eſtates, by any ſtranger, that would offer in the
box but 12 pence more then the owner; which hath made divers owners ſtrain
themſelves to give more rent to the State, than they could poſſibly make of the
two parts, rather than be outed of the poſſeſſion of their ancient patrimonies,
and ſome of them have aſſured me, that it happens very often, that neighbours
either thorow covetouſneſſe or revenge (for who can live ſo innocently as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
no enemy, at leaſt ſo happily as to have none,) ſet themſelves to outvy the
owners, and then recompence the loſſe they have in the great rent they pay, by
miſuſing the Lands they hire in deſpite of the owner. Beſides many times when
the proprietors have with much charge and long attendance obtained Leaſes of
the two parts for ſeven years in the Countrey in purſuance of the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
after improvement of their eſtates by good husbandry, they are again out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and their Leaſes made void at this Hall, under pretence of the want of ſome
formality of <hi>Surveyng, poſting, boxing</hi> or the like, which it ſeems the <hi>instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
from theſe Commiſſioners do hold forth to thoſe below, yet thoſe <hi>instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are not made publick, whereby the parties intereſſed might be adviſed how
to proceed regularly and certainly in a buſineſſe that ſo much concerns their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
               <p>Nor are the Recuſants permitted to ſell any of their Lands by Fining for the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135760:9"/>
two parts, though for payment of their juſt debts, nay though they ſhould be
willing to tranſport themſelves beyond the Seas; by which diſablement to ſell or
Morgage the leaſt pile of graſſe they poſſeſſe, many well affected ſuffer much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
by non-payment of their true and ancient Debts, but divers of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
are thereby driven to ſuch extreme neceſſities, that they have expos'd their
bare Thirds to Sale; though I perceive few Purchaſers will meddle therewith,
unleſſe upon very diſadvantagious terms to the Seller, becauſe the Purchaſers ſay,
they are ſure to contract a charge and trouble to themſelves by their attendance at
this Hall: For in ſuch Caſe, if the Papiſt can gain the favour to have his Thirds
partitioned from the other two; yet (as I heard it argued) the State might, when
he had ſold ſuch divided part, or by good husbandry improved it, evict it from
him, and aſſign him another Thirds of the ſame Lands, that perhaps has been
waſted by ill Tenants; For I found this much complained of among the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
that the <hi>Sequeſtrators</hi> or ſuch ſtrangers to whom the two parts are often
demiſed, rarely or never beſtow any money on repair of the two thirds, but take
the Rents as long as the houſe or Land will yield any; which is one reaſon why
ſuch Cuſtomers many times out-bids the owners for the renting of thoſe two
Thirds; the owners being alwayes carefull to keep up the houſes, and direct
their Husbandry to the beſt advantage, and embetterment of the Lands.</p>
               <p>Others I obſerved to complain much of the long attendance, and great charge
they were at in gaining their Thirds, and an allowance of their Manſion houſes,
and of the many and malicious falſe accuſations, that Informers were permitted
to bring in againſt them: As (if I miſtake not) I over-heard ſome of the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citors
ſay, that the Lady <hi>Saint Johns,</hi> or her Husband Mr. <hi>Arundell,</hi> had been
accuſed for Delinquency five or ſix ſeverall times, and ſtill cleared it. Witneſſes
have been often ſuborned to falſe accuſations, and yet when the Party injured
(after long attendance and expence) has cleared himſelf of the calumny and
conſequently proved the malice of the informer, no reparation would be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for ſo dangerous a ſlander; inſomuch that upon the whole matter I have heard
a Recuſant (with tears in his eyes) profeſſe ſeriouſly, that ſo much attendance
and charge was required in getting their Thirds, and ſuch continuall fears and
vexations attended their condition, that if he could by manufacture or any other
honeſt calling get a livelyhood, he ſhould eaſily reſolve to let his third part go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the other two.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners themſelves (ſitting in a treble capacity, Firſt for <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
with Delinquents,</hi> Secondly for <hi>Advance of money</hi> upon the fifth and
twentieth parts, and thirdly <hi>for Sequeſtrations</hi>) can onely ſpare Wedneſday mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
for hearing Petitions upon <hi>Sequeſtrations,</hi> and commonly there is not a
Committee which muſt be at leaſt four of the ſeven Commiſſioners) till after
ten of the Clock, by which means they can ſcarce afford two hours in a week for
the diſpatch of that employment. So that whenſoever a ſuitor delivers in his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
it is uſually a full moneth, if not ſix weeks before it comes to be heard in
courſe, and a great part of this time he muſt attend, and perhaps retain Councel
ſeverall dayes before his buſineſſe will be heard.</p>
               <p>Theſe complaints, (for ought I could poſſibly be informed) are not onely true
but far ſhort of what this ſort of people ſuffers; which ſo much the more afflicts
my Soul, by how much I conſider the ſufferers to be Chriſtians and Natives of
<hi>England,</hi> and the entire cauſe of all their ſufferings to be onely their unſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in certain points of Religion; a thing that is altogether out of their own
power, and abſolutely depends upon the good pleaſure of Gods holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:135760:10"/>
I omit to ſpeak of the <hi>ſub-Commiſſioners</hi> for Sequeſtrations in the ſeverall
Counties of this Common-wealth, as having hitherto had little means to inform
my ſelf of their ſeverall proceedings, and conſidering them obliged to purſue
the <hi>Inſtructions</hi> they receive from thoſe above; onely this I can ſay of ſome of
them, whom I have converſed with, that they ſeem to grant, that Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Papiſts Eſtates, upon the ſole account of Religion, is not in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
warranted by Gods Word, but rather the contrary; And yet theſe
men continue their employments, which I fear will expoſe them to the
cenſure of worldly-minded and avaritious ſelfe-ſeekers: And I pray God
that whilſt they charge others with Idolatry, they be not found guilty of it
themſelves,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 5.</note> ſince the Scripture ſayes expreſly, <hi>That a Covetous man is an
Idolater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it being apparent that the</hi> Oath of Abjuration <hi>is the wrack which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſo many Conſciences, I did therefore in the former part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
propound ſome</hi> Quaeries <hi>upon that Oath, And ſhall now humbly add,
(as not improper for this ſubject) what the before mentioned Sir</hi> Alexander Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>lately ſaid, in anſwer to Maſter</hi> John Rue, <hi>Moderatour of the Presbytery
of</hi> Aberdeen, <hi>concerning conſtraint of conſcience, and enforcing Oaths: his
very words are theſe.</hi> I doe acknowledge that which you ſay concerning Oaths,
that God is honoured by them; yet that must receive ſome limitations, or elſe it
would prove very falſe, they muſt be taken in Judgment, in truth, and upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity:
Now I appeal to your own Conſciences, whether ye have obſerved theſe
Conditions in your urging ſo many dreadfull Oathes upon this miſerable Nation
theſe years by-paſt, not onely in the Covenant, but in your ſolemn League with
your Presbyterian brethren of <hi>England,</hi> whereby ye enforced all men to ſwear to
eſtabliſh by Armes, that Tyranny there, as ye had done here: how many have ye
enforced (by threatning and Execution of your Kirk cenſure, and the ſeverity of
the Civill Law, following upon them, depriving men of their Eſtates) to ſwear
and ſubſcribe to all ye injoyned or could invent, albeit ye know them to be of far
contrary Judgments, wherein ye did imitate that feigned and falſe Mother, who
before <hi>Solomon</hi> was contented to have the Child divided, whereby her Hypocriſie
was found out by that brave Prince: by which means ye have made this Nation
guilty of perjury, beſides many other heinous ſinnes: I wiſh to God you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
or would yet remember, how much you cryed out againſt the Tyranny of
Biſhops, (when they were urging ſome of your number, who were refractory to
Epiſcopacy) that there ſhould be had ſome regard to tender Conſciences, which were
of another Judgment, But ſo ſoon as ye had got the power into your hands, neither
Miniſter nor Laird, Man, Woman, or Child, was spared, nor any regard had unto
them, whatſoever quality or condition they were of, all were forced not onely to
obey you, but (which is the greateſt tyranny over mens Conſciences) they were made
to ſwear, that they thought, as ye would have them, albeit to your own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
many thought the contrary, &amp;c. <hi>The whole Anſwer, which bears dare,</hi>
20 Jan. 1651. <hi>is worth the reading, and is Printed in the</hi> Diurnall, Numb.
118. <hi>I pray Chriſt a great part of the ſame arguments may not be turned againſt
us, for enforcing this Oath of</hi> Abjuration <hi>ſo poſitively againſt mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſince we all ſay, that we abhor to violence and force any ones Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
farther then to ſecure the publick peace, and that only as neceſſity ſhall real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear, and not upon any Voluntary or Counterfeit pretence, I cannot ſee
how the taking of this Oath avails to make a man, either a better Neighbour, or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135760:10"/>
a better Subject. I cannot ſee that the Parliament confides any more in thoſe
whom they have frighted to take it, nor any places of truſt committed to them in
reward of their conformity, and indeed there is leſſe reaſon, in my opinion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon ſuch as are involuntarily drawn to an outward complyance, then even
thoſe that ſtand out their Sequeſtrations, as being more exaſperated againſt us
by our ſevere proceedings, ſince there can be no greater cauſe of reſentment and
hatred then the remembrance to have been compelled by us publiquely to ſwear
againſt their Conſciences, unleſſe their Judgements be really changed, and then
all penalties to enforce them are ſuperfluous, which leads me the direct way to
this clear concluſion that ſuch Oathes are alwayes either abſolutely pernicious or
altogether unneceſſary, if againſt the inward Judgement, damnable; if according
to it, uſeleſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since then the receiving ſuch an Oath againſt the Conſcience is the higheſt
degree of perjury and ſpirituall murther of the ſoul, let us ſadly conſider, how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious
to the work of the Lord, and ſcandalous to the eyes of men it wil be,
for us to fill up our Congregations with ſuch unſanctified Members: The ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  </gap>us, (Numb. 99. page 1554.) <hi>hath an admirable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
upon this Subject.</hi> If we ſeriouſly reflect (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) upon the deſigne of God,
in bringing Chriſt into the world, we ſhall find it was to ſet an end to that pompous
administration of the Jewiſh form, that as his Church and people were formerly
confined within the Narrow Pale of a particular Nation, ſo now the Pale ſhould
be broken down, and all Nations taken into the Church. Not <hi>all Nations</hi> in a
lump: nor any <hi>whole Nations,</hi> or <hi>Nationall Bodies</hi> to be formed into Churches:
For his Church or people now under the Goſpel, are not to be a body <hi>Politicall,</hi> but
<hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Myſticall:</hi> not a promiſcuous confuſion of perſons taken in at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
but an orderly collection, a picking and chooſing of ſuch as are <hi>called and
Sanctified, &amp;c.</hi> Not a company of men forced in by commands and conſtitutions of
worldly power and prudence, but of ſuch as are brought in by the power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Chriſts Word and Spirit. For he himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>My Kingdome is not from
hence; My Kingdome is not of this World, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore that hand which
hath hitherto preſumed in moſt Nations, to erect a power called <hi>Ecccleſiaſtick,</hi> in
equipage to the <hi>Civill,</hi> to bear ſway, and bind mens Conſciences to certain Notions
ordained for Orthodox upon civill penalties, under colour of prudence, good order,
diſcipline preventing of hereſie, and advancing of Chriſts Kingdome; and to this
end hath twisted <hi>the ſpirituall power</hi> (as they call it) with the worldly and ſecular
<hi>Intereſt of State;</hi> this (I ſay) hath been the very <hi>right hand of Antichriſt,</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Chriſt in his way, whoſe Kingdome, being not of this world, depends not upon
the helps and deviſes of worldly wiſdom. <hi>Thus that excellent Pen. And a quick-ſighted
&amp; judicious member of Parliament, in my hearing, being made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(as with a ſuppoſed gratefull news) that ſome indifferent Chriſtians, (who
profeſſe amongſt their old acquaintance no reall ſatisfaction of Conſcience, but
onely a deſigne to ſave their Eſtates) had taken the Oath of Abjuration and
conformed, ſaid;</hi> Truly our purchaſe therein is very little, and the Papiſts loſſe,
much leſſe.</p>
               <p>In confirmation of this aſſertion, I may here cite the caſe of Mr. <hi>Anthony Roan,</hi>
who was executed at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sk</hi> in <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſheire on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1650, for poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
his Wife; This Gent the very hour be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore his execution, made a publique
confeſſion to this purpoſe; That he had been bred a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> from his
infancy, and continued in that Religion till ſome two or three years before his
death, when, being overcome by an unhappy neceſſity of preſerving his family
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:135760:11"/>
from beggery, he forſook the Belief of his own Soul, and went to Church to ſave
his Eſtate; after which, (the Devil taking advantage upon him in this diſturbance
and anxiety of Spirit) he confeſſed that he had faln into many great Sins, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
the guilt of that horrid crime of poiſoning his wife, for which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to die; delivering further with a kind of confidence, that if he had had
the grace to have continued conſtant in his Religion, he believed he had never ſo
highly tranſgreſſed the Commandments of his God, nor come to ſo unhappy an
end. And openly declared (with much ſeeming repentance) that he dyed in his
old Religion.</p>
               <p>Certainly this is a ſad conſequence of wreſting the inward perſwaſion of poor
Souls from that Belief, which their own Conſcience tells them is truth, thereby
making them leſſe carefull of their ſalvation, and their honeſty and credit of leſſe
repute, even with thoſe, who force them to this change, For the heart of man is ſo
frail and deceitful, that it ſeldom is drawn by violence from thoſe principles,
which it has long been uſed to eſteem and practiſe, but becomes ſlack and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in what concerns the other World, and by degrees very often wholly inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of any thing, but ſenſuality.</p>
               <p>UPon the news not long ſince, of ſome Papiſts taking the Oath of <hi>Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and frequenting the publique places of meeting, I conceived my
ſelf ſufficiently furniſht to anſwer a certain old ſaying, which a Recuſant
of my acquaintance uſed often to repeat in my hearing, that <hi>SANGUIS MARTY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUM
EST SEMEN ECCLESIAE:</hi> This upon all occaſions he applyed the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of Papiſts, both here in <hi>England,</hi> and ten thouſand miles off in <hi>Japan,</hi> in
which two Iſlands have of late been ſharper perſecutions, (ſaid he) for matter of
Religion, then in any other place of the world; This he continually inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as a Soveraign remedy for all his ſorrows, nor could we ever beat him from
his laſt hold, wherein he fortified himſelf, <hi>SANGUIS MARTYRUM, &amp;c.</hi> nay
more, he ſometimes ventured to affirm with ſtrange aſſurance, this aſſertion, that
this Church encreaſed and proſpered ſtill, even whilſt it was actually under the
greateſt preſſures, that his Church was, as the Palme tree, the heavier weights
are laid on, the more it flouriſheth.</p>
               <p>I having gotten this advantage by the late coming in of ſome Papiſts to our
Religion, went preſently on purpoſe to my Recuſant to put him to the queſtion,
and as it were a little triumphing, demanded what he thought now of his old
Latine Proverb (in which he had formerly ſeemed to place ſo much confidence)
and whither the Palm tree did not ſometimes break a twigg by laying on ſo many
weights; To which he replyed with a little ſuddenneſſe and Choller, That ſome
dead, or Canker-eaten Branches, as they can bear no weight, ſo they can bear no
fruit, even whilſt united to the Stock and much leſſe after their diviſion: But
ſoon recovering himſelf to his uſuall temper, he calmly, yet earneſtly undertook,
that as there have been at leaſt twenty Prieſts put to death in <hi>England</hi> ſince the
beginning of this Parliament, meerly upon the account of their Religion or
function, ſo he could name a farre greater number of perſons of quality, who
have in this ſame ſpace of time reconciled themſelves to the Catholique Union.
When I urged him to the proof of this aſſertion, he immediately delivered
me a liſt of twenty Prieſts, who during theſe late revolutions had been hang'd,
drawn and quartered either for taking orders beyond Seas, or exerciſing
them on this ſide the Seas, and with all promiſed (upon the allowance of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time for recollection) to furniſh me with a Roll of ſome names, who have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:135760:11"/>
lately declared themſelves <hi>Catholiques,</hi> undertaking, if he was deceived in
any name, to recompence ſuch Errour, with the intereſt of two for one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he might be diſpenſed with upon the inconveniency of diſcovering thoſe,
who can no longer live unruined for their Religion, then they are unknown to
profeſſe it.</p>

certain the late <hi>Converts</hi> he ſo much gloried in, I merrily threatned him, that if

               <p>He firſt ſeriouſly redeemed his word by delivering me this following <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>

of Chriſtians: And am very confident, that were they treated more mercifully
and invited to come to our ſpirituall conferences, (which my Recuſant told me
he would not at any time refuſe, were it onely to diſcourſe in an amicable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135760:12"/>
way the points in difference between us) we ſhould gain more of them to us
or at leaſt hinder the growth of their Religion more, then any <hi>tortures</hi> of body
or <hi>Sequestrations</hi> of their Eſtates are like to do.</p>
               <p>Nor is it reaſonable to exact from ſuch as diſſent from us any other kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
at our exerciſes, then to propoſe their difficulties in a modeſt and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way, and pariently to hear our anſwers, without expecting they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
joyn with the Congregation; for that were to oblige them, to profeſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are ſatisfied, and practice before they know what it is they do; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Scripture commands us firſt <hi>to try all things, and then hold faſt that which
is beſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some, who have not onely the form but the power of Godlineſſe in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have of late in order to the advancement of Chriſts Kingdome) been indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to move and endeavour a re-admittance of the <hi>Iews</hi> amongſt us, in hope to
be happy inſtruments in their converſion, which the Scripture holds forth in the
II to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And why ſhall we not alſo (upon like grounds of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Charity) endevour the converſion of all other people of different perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in point of Chriſtianity, by <hi>being mercifull</hi> unto them, <hi>as our heavenly Father
is mercifull. Luke</hi> 6. 36.</p>
               <p>But nothing ſo afflicts my Spirit, as to conſider the cruell gripes we give the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> in reſpect of the light hand, which the <hi>Turk</hi> himſelf bears over his
Chriſtians; To which purpoſe I ſhall here humbly offer an exact Parallel of
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſufferings in <hi>England,</hi> to the condition of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Turky.</hi> Firſt
clearing one eaſie objection, whereat ſome godly people ſeem to ſcruple; They
think the Papiſts here ſuffer for ſome other fault, and not onely for difference of
judgement in Religion, which is an evident miſtake; for if their burthens be
not laid on for their different judgements, why are they taken off, when they
conform and become indifferent in their judgement? why ſhould their receiving
the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Abjuration</hi> deliver them from all penalties and <hi>Sequeſtrations,</hi> if
thoſe penalties and <hi>Sequestrations</hi> be not inflicted upon them, meerly for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome opinions, which that <hi>Oath</hi> obliges them to renounce. Others even of the
beſt affected have often in my hearing affirmed, that certainly that <hi>Oath</hi> was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended as a means of diſcovery, for the Magiſtrate to know, in whom he
may confide; But why then is it uſed ſo much beſide their ſuppoſed intention? or
what need of annexing any penalty, which ſure is the greateſt hinderance of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;
For were there no danger in being a known refuſer of that <hi>Oath,</hi> few
would be ſo diligent in concealing themſelves, leſt they ſhould be known to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
it. Nor indeed is this <hi>Oath</hi> ever offered to any upon the ſingle ground of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in their affections to the preſent Government, but onely to ſuch as are
ſuſpected of Popery.</p>
               <p>But to return to the compariſon I began to mention between the ſtate of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> and of <hi>Christians</hi> in the <hi>Turks Dominions,</hi> I find by the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
I can gather, the great Turks manner of bearing himſelf to his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Subjects to be ſtrangely more temperate and leſſe accuſable of cruelty or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe,
then we Chriſtians uſe to one another; for as our travellers una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
relate the whole annuall fine that any Chriſtian payes the <hi>Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour</hi>
upon the ſcore of Religion, comes to no more then a <hi>Zecheen,</hi> which is leſſe
then our <hi>Angell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet what ever we can object againſt our <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> may with at
leaſt as much reaſon charge upon his <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> Some Anceſtors of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
heretofore have taken up arms, and conſpired with Forraigners about the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135760:13"/>
Government of their Countrey; and yet the <hi>Mahometan</hi> (whom we ſo
much abominate as tyrannicall and barbarous) can forgive the poſterity of ſuch
undeſerving Parents, and let them live quietly under ſo ſmall an annuall tribute
for their Religion. Whereas our ſelves (whom we ſo highly commend for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
meekneſſe and charity) can never forget the Crimes of a few Papiſts, never
give over puniſhing the Children for the faults of the fathers.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians under the Turk, cannot certainly be free from ſuſpition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſaffected to their Magiſtrate, both upon former practices, and the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of their Religion; yet reſts he ſatisfied with diſarming them, and excluding
them from all Offices of Truſt, and places of Importance, to the Intereſt of
Government. Whereas we are ſo far from contenting our ſelves with ſuch pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
cautions for our ſecurity, that we proceed to ſeize upon the beſt part of their
eſtates, which in a ſhort time muſt of neceſſity reduce them to abſolute ruine and
deſperation: And yet there is one conſiderable ground of ſuſpicion altogether
unapplyable to the <hi>Papists</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which is, that the <hi>Turk</hi> came from a
ſtrange Country, to invade at once both the Empire and Religion of the
<hi>Grecians;</hi> whereas the Papiſts are all Natives of this Land, born with the ſame
title to the common Liberties, that our ſelves have, and for <hi>Religion</hi> they onely
ſtand peremptory in their old way, profeſſing to be altogether unſatisfied concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Reformation we hold forth unto them: In which Caſe it is certainly a
more <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and pious method to ſettle a way of <hi>inſtruction</hi> for them to ſave
their ſouls, then to labour ſo much in drawing up new <hi>inſtructions</hi> for our Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators
to ruine their eſtates.</p>
               <p>Nor do the <hi>Turks</hi> inſiſt upon that common objection, That <hi>Chriſtians</hi> no where
ſuffer <hi>Turks,</hi> and therefore no reaſon they ſhould tollerate the Chriſtians, as
taſting more of womaniſh ſpite and revenge, then manly nobleneſſe and gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
How would theſe unhappy miſled ſouls exceed us Chriſtians in moderation
towards ſuch as are otherwiſe minded, if they had read that Golden Rule of our
<hi>Saviour;</hi> that we ſhould <hi>render good for evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the inhumane practice of the <hi>Turk</hi> in taking away ſo many Children from
the Chriſtian Parents is extremely cruel and deteſtable, though as Sir <hi>Henry
Blount</hi> (a perſon both compleatly learned, and perfectly civill) obſerves in his
voyage to the <hi>Levant,</hi> when that Cuſtome was firſt introduced, many politick
reaſons might be alleged to excuſe (not juſtly) ſo wicked tyrannicall an inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if he could have ſo much as excuſed his wicked and tyrannicall uſurpation;
The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> being very numerous, and by a barbarous ſtranger newly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the Dominion of their Country; All which circumſtances naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
and heighten the ſuſpition of an Uſurper, whoſe ſight was certainly far
leſſe ſharp then his ſword, if he did not clearly ſee that his new conquered Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
might perhaps for a time want an opportunity, but neither will, reaſon nor
ſtrength to attempt, by his expulſion the juſt Recovery of their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
               <p>But ſince the affairs of Turky are ſo eſtabliſhed that the <hi>Muſſelman</hi> hath no
longer any jealouſie of the Chriſtians thoſe unnaturall cruelties of plundering
the Parent of his Child are altogether laid aſide, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> permitted to
purchaſe with a ſmall Fine a diſpenſation, and every one now enjoys this comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
liberty, as they give their Children birth, ſo to guide their education.</p>
               <p>Not one of theſe conſiderations, but argues in favour of the preſent Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us; Not one of theſe exceptions are they obnoxious to, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
being ſmall and inconſiderable, their poſture naked and diſarmed, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:135760:13"/>
the door long ſince by other powers ſhut againſt them, to all advantages in the
Nation: by which means they have neither ſo much diſobligation to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Government, nor any poſſibility to work the leaſt diſturbance of its
peace.</p>
               <p>And therefore, however upon the firſt <hi>Reformation</hi> it was neceſſary to take a
ſharp and reſolute courſe for diminution of the Papiſts power, yet ſince they
are reduced to ſo low and weak a condition, that we cannot handſomely even
feign a danger from them, it is become now unneceſſary, and conſequently (by our
own maximes) unlawful to continue the ſame penalties upon them: No other
cauſe being truly ſufficient to juſtifie our puniſhing others, but a true neceſſity of
preſerving our ſelves.</p>
               <p>And theſe I conceive may be by the reaſons, why the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have of late made
their addreſſes to theſe <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that are appointed by Parliament <hi>for regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lawes,</hi> building their hope upon this ground, that as the cauſes of ſo
great ſeverity againſt them are ceaſed, the ſad and ruinous effects may no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
be continued; And certainly they could not have choſen a more proper way
to obtain relief, than the applying of themſelves to the <hi>Committee,</hi> it being
compounded of perſons, whoſe abilities bear an excellent proportion to the
greatneſſe of the work they have undertaken, having in one half year ſeen further
into the defects of our Law, and the exceſſes of its practice, than many ages
formerly have been <hi>able</hi> to diſcover, and whoſe integrity is ſo remarkable, that
in the ſhort ſpace of a few months, they have deſign'd a perfect reform of more
Errours, than many Ages formerly have been <hi>willing</hi> to ſearch into. So that as
their Charity hath already provided a favourable courſe of mercy for the poor,
their extreme induſtry and ſincerity promiſes a ſpeedy ſettlement of an equall
and impartiall courſe of juſtice for all others. To this Committee the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants

                           <p>As for the truth and power of Religion, it being a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal
between God and the Soul, and the matters of faith in

ſhall beg the Readers permiſſion to ſet down a particular conceit, which I have
often obſerved to be very well reliſht by all that have examined it. That doubtles
there is no way more ſuitable to the firſt Principles of all Reformed Churches, no
way ſo probable to ſatisfie all Conſciences, as not to impoſe any other obligation
for proof of conformity, than this profeſſion <hi>to believe the holy Scriptures of the
Old and New Teſtament to be the Word of God, and to live according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
plainly contained therein,</hi> this acknowledgement to be expreſt in generall
termes without deſcending minutely to particular queſtions, which hath certainly
been the chief cauſe of ſo many Controverſies and Diviſions in the World.</p>
               <p>And now I humbly appeal to the honourable and religious <hi>Committee for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of the Goſpel,</hi> Whether the ſweet Spirit of the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> (who gave his
Apoſtles no further power, than to relinquiſh ſuch as refuſed to hear them) be
reconcileable to the former practices of the high Commiſſioners, or the preſent
practices of our Sequeſtrators;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 24.</note> Whether, when the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preſcribes
the <hi>ſervants of the Lord to forbear, and in meekneſſe inſtruct thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
minded,</hi> he ſhould be thus croſ-interpreted, that the Eſtates of thoſe who are
contrary minded, be firſt ſecured or <hi>forborn,</hi> and then after a time quite taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<hi>to inſtruct them in meekneſſe,</hi> or how to bear patiently the loſſe of the vain
and tranſitory riches of this world.</p>
               <p>And now I humbly appeal to the honorable and learned <hi>Committee for Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Law,</hi> whether (ſince all thoſe penalties which the rigorous humours
of former ages have, under pretence of zeal, impoſed upon the Conſcience, are
either by diſuſe forgotten, or by expreſſe Act of Parliament revoked) the Papiſts
alone ſhould ſtill be continued under the ſame ſeverities, nay their burthens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:135760:17"/>
by the ſtrange method of the new proceedings towards them, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
being not only puniſhable to the Common way of indictment, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable
even to accuſe themſelves by the new Presbyterian Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi>
againſt the known Principles of the ancient and reverend Lawes of this Land.</p>
               <p>And now with an humble confidence, I appeal to the renowned Parliament of
the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> whether in this generall <hi>Goal-delivery</hi> of the
Conſcience from the tyranny and oppreſſion of the Prelates, the conſciences of
Papiſts alone, ought ſtill to be kept in priſon? Whether, when all the fetters,
which the Rigid Kirkeſmen had bought up in <hi>Scotland,</hi> are broken in pieces juſt
as they were locking them faſt about our Conſciences in <hi>England,</hi> the Conſciences
of Papiſts alone ought ſtill to be continued in chains? Whether, when all the
Societies profeſſing <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> and living obediently to the Magiſtrate, and
peaceably one with another, are protected in the quiet and unoffenſive exerciſe of
their Conſciences, the Papiſts alone ſhould be forced under the penalty of ſo
great a ruine, not only to profeſſe, but ſwear againſt their Conſciences? A courſe
that in a ſhort time will unavoidably bring them either to abſolute beggery, or,
which is worſe, to hypocriſie, or, which is worſt of all, to perjury.</p>
               <p>All the people of this Nation look upon you as their common father, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
themſelves liberty and protection under your government, (though ſome
may juſtly be excluded from ſharing in the Government.) Were there in my
family one child that profeſt to find ſatisfaction in the way of the Papiſts, and
lived dutifully to me, and lovingly with with his brethren, I ſhould account it a
great unnaturalneſſe to deprive him altogether of his portion, much more of that
which he has received from the bounty of any collateral kinſman, or acquired by
his own particular diligence and improvement; And though ſome Papiſts have
heretofore been truly chargeable with heinous crimes againſt their Country, yet
why ſhould our juſtice over-reach to condemn all, for the offences of a few? if
they have formerly abetted competitors to the Crown, why ſhould the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſo long out-live the fault? certainly the Offendours being dead, their tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſes
ſhould rather be buried in their graves, and not like Ghoſts walk to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
and pinch their children.</p>
               <p>It is time we ſhould now mix a little mercy to allay the fumes of ſo much ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
which otherwiſe will not aſcend to the Almighty's Throne in the odour of
ſweetneſſe.</p>
               <p>It is time we ſhould begin to imitate the pattern, which our merciful God has
ſet before us in his own practice, when he commanded the <hi>deſtroying Angel to
ſheath his ſword,</hi> with this compaſſionate Motto, <hi>It is enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is time we ſhould begin to anſwer the bounty of our God, who has ſo freely
given us the bleſſings of 10 <hi>thouſand Talents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 23. 1 Kings 19. 11, 12.</note> by freely forgiving our <hi>Fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
the ſmall ſum of 100 pence.</hi> Let us invade, or ſtorme the Conſciences of
our brethren; <hi>For the Lord was not in the great and ſtrong wind that rent the
Mountains, and brake in pieces the Rocks:</hi> Let us not ſhake the inward peace of
any quiet and unoffenſive Chriſtian; For <hi>the Lord was not in the Earth-quake:</hi>
Let us not kindle in our hearts a devouring flame of uncharitable zeal; <hi>for the
Lord was not in the fire:</hi> but let us compoſe our affections to the ſoft and gentle
key of love, and mutuall forbearance; <hi>for the Lord was in the ſtill ſmall voice.</hi>
Let us alwayes attend to this <hi>ſtill voice of the Lord,</hi> ſpeaking with us, <hi>do as you as
you would be done unto;</hi> let us alwayes attend to this <hi>ſmall,</hi> but ſweet <hi>voice of the
Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 44.</note> calling upon us, <hi>love your enemies, bleſſe them that curſe you, doe good to
them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully uſe you, and perſecute you,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:135760:18"/>
that you may be the children of your father which is in Heaven; for he maketh his
ſun to riſe on the evill, and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt, and on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt;
for if you love them which love you, what reward have you? do not even
the Publicans the ſame? and if you ſalute your brethren onely, what do you more
than others? do not even the Publicans ſo? be you therefore perfect, as your father
which is in Heaven, is perfect.</hi>
