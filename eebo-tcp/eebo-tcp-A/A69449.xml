            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>The occaſion of this</hi> TREATISE.</head>
               <p>HItherto I have given the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of the Soul-ſaving <hi>Second Birth;</hi> but ſome there are whoſe hearts are ſo ſteely, that all this cannot work upon them: If any ſuch deſire yet any more (and deſire they muſt, or there is no remedy for them) I have, for their help in the <hi>practice,</hi> brought a <hi>Practitioner</hi> afore them. It was <hi>Ceſars</hi> great praiſe, that he bade his Soldiers ſtill, <hi>Come;</hi> and if men had but many <hi>Ceſars</hi> or leaders in theſe practical points, I ſuppoſe there would be more followers. A plain <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> may win ſome, and a particular <hi>Direction</hi> may win more, but a good <hi>Example</hi> wins moſt. Howſoever then, concerning the <hi>New Birth,</hi> I have delivered the <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the <hi>Sermons,</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> in the <hi>Appendix;</hi> yet one thing is wanting, which may help more then either, to wit, the <hi>Practice</hi> of ſome Saint in this <hi>one neceſſary thing:</hi> And what Saint? what man that hath writ more on this ſubject, then <hi>T. H?</hi> it was ſaid of bleſſed Mr. <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Boltons</hi> funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon by Mr. <hi>Eſtwick.</hi>

                  <hi>Bolton,</hi> That <hi>for himſelf, he could profeſs to his comfort on his Deaths-bed, That he never taught any godly point, but he firſt wrought it on his own heart;</hi> the ſame, do I more then probably think, was the <hi>practice</hi> of this man. Now therefore I thought

fit, not onely to contract his Books in this Appendix (which ſome without his privity have unskilfully put out) but alſo, and that more eſpecially, to ſet afore you (whoſoever you are) thoſe prime, powerful, pathetical expreſſions of his Soul-pangs in the <hi>New Birth,</hi> as matter for your imitation: Theſe expreſſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are they I moſt eſpecially aym at, which if you obſerve, are always delivered in the firſt perſon <hi>[I]</hi> and I verily believe they were not fained, but feeling from his own heart and ſoul. What needs more? if either <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the firſt part, or <hi>Direction</hi> in the ſecond part, or <hi>Practice</hi> in the third part of the Book (which conſiſts moſt of <hi>Practice)</hi> can work on your ſouls, I hope ſome of theſe, or all of theſe, will help you on in the way from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to Chriſtianity, and from the ſtate of Nature into the Kingdom of Grace.</p>

of this Preparation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Matter:</hi> The ſoul of a ſinner muſt be prepared for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> before he can entertain him. When Kings go to any place, they ſend (to make readineſs) their Harbengers afore them; if <hi>Chriſt</hi> (the King of Saints) come into a Soul, there muſt be a <hi>Preparation</hi> before he enter; and good Reaſon, he is not a meer man, an ordinary perſon, but a King, a King of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>David</hi> in this caſe could call upon his Soul (ſo we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his Gates and Doors) <hi>Lift up your heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlaſting Doors, and the King of Glory ſhall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 24. 7.</note>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:39862:3"/>
                  <hi>come in;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, Be enlarged <hi>Love, Joy, Hope;</hi> ſet open, give way, for the Lord is coming: <hi>But who is the Lord? it is the Lord of Hoſts, the Lord ſtrong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battel:</hi> And with that he knocks again, <hi>Lift up your heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlaſting Doors, and the King of Glory ſhall come in;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, What, ſhall the Lord knock? ſhall the King of Glory ſtand? open ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and make all <hi>preparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Maner</hi> of this <hi>Preparation</hi> conſiſts in theſe three paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages: Firſt, the Soul breaks that League which formerly it hath had with Corruptions, and reſerves it ſelf for Chriſt: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Soul is moſt willing to give way to Chriſt Jeſus, and to let him overthrow whatſoever ſhall oppoſe him: Thirdly, the Soul is content that God ſhould rule all, not onely the eye, or hand, or tongue, or heart, but the whole man; it opens all the <hi>Gates,</hi> and deſires Chriſt to come, and take all the <hi>Keys</hi> of the houſe upon him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Means</hi> of this <hi>Preparation</hi> is the powerful Miniſtery, which God hath appointed for this work; and it is diſcovered in three particulars: Firſt, in a particular Application of the Truth to the Souls of men with courage: Secondly, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Truth by ſoundneſs of Argument, and plain evidence of Scriptures: Thirdly, in a kinde of Spiritual heat in the heart and affections of the Miniſter, anſwerable to that which he communicates to the people. And this powerful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery works on the ſoul, 1. By diſcovering what is in a mans heart, ſo that the ſoul ſeeth that it never ſaw before, and ſo is driven to a ſtand. 2. By driving the ſoul into an awe of ſin, ſo that it dares not now meddle with ſin, as formerly it hath done.</p>
               <p>If any ſoul that hath enjoyed theſe <hi>Means</hi> any while, is not yet fitted and <hi>prepared,</hi> it is a fearful ſuſpition, that God will <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> never confer any good to that ſoul: Go home then (if there be any ſuch) and reaſon with your own ſouls, and plead with your own hearts, ſaying, <hi>Lord, why not yet am I humbled and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared? will Exhortations never prevail with me? will Terrors and Reproofs never break my heart into pieces? I have heard Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that would have ſhaken the very ſtones I trod on, that would have moved the very ſeat I ſate on; the very fire of Hell hath</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:39862:4"/>
                  <hi>flaſhed in my face; I have ſeen even the plagues of Hell, and if any thing can do me any good, why not then thoſe. Exhortations, Inſtructions, Admonitions and Reproofs that I have often had? I have had as powerful means as may be, which never yet did me good.</hi> The Lord be merciful to ſuch a poor ſoul; the Lord turn the heart of ſuch a poor ſinner, that he may lay hold of mercy in due time.</p>

                  <p>The firſt general circumſtance of the ſouls <hi>Preparation,</hi> is on Gods part; wherein is <hi>The offer of Chriſt Jeſus, The condition of this offer,</hi> and <hi>The eaſineſs of this condition;</hi> we may have all in this one Compariſon: As with a Malefactor convicted of High Treaſon, for plotting ſome wicked practice againſt his Prince, if (after the diſcovery of all paſſages) the King make a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That upon the ſurceaſing of his Enterpriſes, he ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; nay, if the King ſhall continue to ſend Meſſage after Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſecretly to tell him, that would he yet lay down his arms and take a pardon, he ſhall freely be remitted, and graciouſly accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into favor again: if this Traytor now ſhould rather fling away his Pardon then his Weapons, then ſhould the King raiſe an Army and overcome him, and take him, and execute him without any

pity or mercy, I appeal to your own Conſciences, is he not juſtly rewarded? What will the world ſay? he had a fair offer of Pardon, and the King ſent Meſſenger after Meſſenger unto him; ſeeing therefore he refuſed and neglected ſuch offers, it is pity but condemnation ſhould befal him: thus would all ſay. Why, this is the condition of every poor ſoul under heaven, we are all Rebels and Traytors; by our Oathes and Blaſphemies, we ſet our mouth againſt heaven; and yet after all our pride and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs, and looſneſs and prophaneneſs, and contempt of Gods Word and Ordinances, the Lord is pleaſed to proclaim Mercy ſtill to every one that will receive it: <hi>All you that have diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored my Name, All you that have prophaned my Sabbaths, and contemned my Ordinances, All you curſed wretches, Come; Come who will, and take Pardon;</hi> therein is the <hi>Offer:</hi> onely let them lay aſide all their weapons; therein is the <hi>Condition:</hi> and then have Chriſt for the taking; therein is the <hi>Eaſineſs</hi> of the condition.</p>

                     <hi>Bleſſed God</hi> (may every Soul ſay) <hi>if I will not do this for Chriſt, I will do nothing; had the Lord required a great matter of me to have attained ſalvation; had he required Thouſands of Rams, and Ten thouſand Rivers of Oyl; had he required the firſt-born of my body for the ſins of my ſoul; had he required me to have kneeled and prayed until mine eyes had failed, until my hands had been wearied, until my tongue had been hoarſe, and until my heart had fainted, one drop of mercy at the laſt gaſp would have quit all this coſt: But what goodneſs is this that the Lord ſhould require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of me, but to lay down my weapons, and to receive Chriſt offered?</hi> Lo the Lord this day hath ſent from heaven, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Salvation unto you Sons of men; the Lord Jeſus is become a ſuitor to you, and I am Chriſts ſpokeſman, to ſpeak a good word for him: O that we may have our errand from you! <hi>O that there were ſuch an heart in my people</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>to fear</hi>

               <p>But becauſe theſe two are made up by one action and motion, we ſhall therefore handle them together; and the ſum is this, That <hi>God by an holy kinde of violence (which is called Drawing,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 6. 44.</note> Joh. 6. 44.) <hi>doth pluck the ſoul from thoſe ſins that harbor in it unto himſelf:</hi> wherein we may conſider two things;

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, for the <hi>nature</hi> of this <hi>drawing,</hi> it is of a double kinde: 1. There is a <hi>Moral drawing,</hi> when by Reaſons propounded, and good things offered to the Underſtanding and Will, a man comes thereby to have his minde illightened, and his will moved to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace things offered: Thus was it with <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by Lydia to abide in her houſe,</hi> Acts 16. 15. 2. There is <note place="margin">Acts 16. 15.</note> a <hi>Phyſical drawing,</hi> when the Lord is pleaſed to put a new power into the ſoul of a ſinner, and withal to carry the will to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject propounded, that it may embrace it; when the Lord not onely offers good things to the ſoul, but enables the ſoul to lay hold upon the things offered: And thus the Lord <hi>draws</hi> a ſinner from ſin unto himſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the <hi>means</hi> whereby he draws, they are theſe four:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:39862:7"/>
Firſt, the Lord lets in a light into the ſoul of a poor ſinner, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Means.</hi>
                  </note> and diſcovers unto him that he is in a wrong way: This the ſoul marvels at, becauſe uſually it comes on a ſudden, the ſinner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving nothing leſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 1. <note place="margin">Iſa. 66. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, though a man would defeat the power of this light, yet God ſtill follows it with forcible Arguments, and draws <note place="margin">2 <hi>Means.</hi>
                  </note> with the cord of his Mercy; <hi>I taught Ephraim to go</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>taking them by the arms; I drew them by the cords of love, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hoſea 11. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>with the bonds of a man.</hi> This mercy conſiſts in theſe bonds, or this love is made up of four cords:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord reveals himſelf to be <hi>ready</hi> to <hi>receive,</hi> and <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> and <hi>eaſie</hi> to entertain poor ſinners when they come unto him: <hi>Let the wicked</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>forſake his way, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and be will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon;</hi> the word in the Original is, <hi>He will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply pardons:</hi> Haſt thou <hi>multiplied rebellions?</hi> the Lord will alſo <hi>multiply pardons:</hi> The bowels of compaſſion are ſtill open, and the arms of mercy are ſtill ſpread abroad; he pardoned <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo will he thee, his <hi>pardons</hi> are <hi>multiplied,</hi> there is yet mercy for thee alſo, and for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord is not onely <hi>ready</hi> to forgive when men come to to him, but that they may come, he alſo <hi>calls</hi> and <hi>commands</hi> them: <hi>O but may I</hi> (ſaith a poor ſinner) <hi>ſhall I, dare I go unto the Lord God for mercy? may I be ſo bold to preſs in for favor at the hands of the Lord? I have been a grievous ſinner, and have heaped abomination upon abomination, I am afraid therefore to approach near unto the Lords preſence.</hi> Is it ſo? hear what the Lord ſaith, <hi>Come unto me, ye rebellious people, and I will heal</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 3. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>your rebellions. You that never prayed, never came to hear, all Rebels, come unto me:</hi> and then the people anſwer, <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art our God.</hi> This is great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a poor ſinner, he begins now to wonder, and ſay, <hi>Lord, ſhall all my ſins be pardoned? ſhall all my oathes and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be forgiven? I that ſlighted ſo many mercies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo many follies, ſhall I be entertained? Yes</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>come unto me, and thou ſhalt be forgiven; come, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you come.</hi>

3. The Lord doth not onely <hi>command</hi> a poor ſinner to come in, but when he is nice in this caſe, ſaying, <hi>There is mercy with God, but not for me;</hi> the Lord then followeth him ſtill, and ſends another <hi>cord</hi> after him, that if it be poſſible he may <hi>win</hi> him, and <hi>woo</hi> him to receive mercy of him: If <hi>command</hi> therefore prevail not, he <hi>intreats</hi> and <hi>beſeeches</hi> him to come and receive mercy, and this (me thinks) ſhould move the hardeſt heart under heaven. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are embaſſadors for Chriſt, as</hi>

                  <hi>though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be reconciled unto God:</hi> rather then you ſhould go away from Chriſt, even <hi>Mercy</hi> it ſelf will come and kneel down before you, and <hi>beſeech</hi> you, and <hi>intreat</hi> you, <hi>for the Lord Jeſus ſake to pity your poor ſouls, and to receive pardon for your ſins:</hi> A ſinner is not able to comprehend this, but he begins to be at a ſtand, and at amazement, <hi>What, that the Lord ſhould beſeech him! O that thou wouldst receive pardon for thy ſins, and be bleſſed for ever! Good Lord</hi> (ſaith the Soul) <hi>is this poſſible, that the great King of Heaven ſhould come and beſeech ſuch a Traytor, ſuch a Rebel as I am, to take pardon? That a King on Earth ſhould proclaim a pardon to ſome notorious Traytor, this were much; but that the King of Heaven ſhould lay down his Crown, and come creeping to me, and beſeech me (on his knee as it were) to take mercy; this is a thing beyond all expectation: What, ſhall Heaven ſtoop to earth? ſhall Majeſty ſtoop to miſery? ſhall the great God of Heaven and Earth, that might have condemned my ſoul, and if I had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and been damned, might have took glory by my deſtruction—Is it poſſible, is it credible, that this God ſhould not onely entertain me when I come, and command me for to come, but intreat and beſeech me to come and receive mercy from him? O the depth of the incomprehenſible love of God!</hi> Imagine you ſaw God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intreating you, and God the Son beſeeching you, as he doth this day, <hi>Come now, and forſake your ſins, and take mercy, which is prepared for you, and ſhall be beſtowed upon you:</hi> Would not this make a ſoul think thus with it ſelf, <hi>What, for a Rebel? not onely to have mercy offered, but to be intreated to receive mercy, it were pity (if I will not take it) but I ſhould go to Hell and be damned for ever.</hi> The Lord he complains, <hi>Why will ye dye? as</hi>

when will it once be?

of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Propoſition, <hi>Conſcience</hi> gives the ſinner a <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to come from ſin, upon pain of the heavieſt Judgement that can be inflicted.

But now when wicked perſons ſee their companion is gone, they make after him amain, and then <hi>Conſcience</hi> plucks one way, and they pluck another way; at laſt, by carnal company, and curſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, the ſoul is drawn back again to his former wicked courſes, and ſo perhaps this twiſt is broken, and the ſinner is gone.</p>

Thus <hi>Conſcience</hi> brings the ſoul of a ſinner on the Rack (as Traytors are uſed, that will not confeſs other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) and makes him to confeſs his ſins, and then he cryes, <hi>O the abominations I have committed which the Sun never ſaw; in ſuch a place, at ſuch a time, O then I railed on Gods ſervants, &amp; blasphemed Gods Name, I prophaned Gods Sabbaths, and contemned his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances:</hi> what then? <hi>Conſcience</hi> will make him confeſs more yet, to the Rack again with him; and then he cryes and roars for anguiſh of ſpirit, then he confeſſes all, and reſolves to amend, then he will pray, and hear, and ſanctifie Gods Sabbaths, and lead a new life. Thus <hi>Conſcience</hi> receives ſome ſatisfaction, and begins to be quiet; and now having got ſome quiet, his curſed Companions ſet upon him again, <hi>Refreſh</hi> (ſay they) <hi>your ſoul with ſome of your ancient dalliance,</hi> &amp;c. To this and the like Temptations of Satan, he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39862:9"/>
liſtens again, and then he begins to follow his old ſins, perhaps with more violence and eagerneſs then ever he did before; and now is another twiſt broken likewiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If ſo, then <hi>Conſcience</hi> that was a <hi>Monitor</hi> and <hi>Accuſer,</hi> now turns <hi>Executioner.</hi> The firſt Propoſition admoniſhed, the ſecond accuſed, if neither of theſe prevail, then <hi>Conſcience</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>Thou muſt to execution, thou ſhalt periſh everlaſtingly.</hi> And now <hi>Conſcience</hi> cryes, <hi>Monitions or Accuſations could not prevail with this man; Come, come ye damned ghoſts, and take away this Drunkard, this Blasphemer, this Adulterer, and throw him headlong into the pit of Hell; he would not be amended, let him be condemned, he would not be humbled, therefore let him be damned.</hi> The man hearing this, then he is amazed, and thinks himſelf paſt hope, paſt help, paſt cure: Did you ever ſee or hear a tormented Conſcience in theſe pangs? Now he calls, then he cryes, <hi>Lo where Devils ſtand, the Heavens frown, God is incenſed, Hell-mouth is open:</hi> And now a Miniſter is ſent for, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays to this deſpairing ſoul, the Mercy and Grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus; <hi>O</hi> (replies he) <hi>this is my bane, my damnation, if I had never heard of Mercy, if I had never lived under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and the means of Salvation, then had I been an happy man: Alas! it is Mercy I have neglected, it is Salvation I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, how then ſhould I be ſaved? O the perſwaſions of the Lord that I have had! the Lord hath even wept over me, as he did over</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>O that thou hadst known the things belonging to thy peace! yet all theſe perſwaſions have I contemned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly to Hell I muſt go.</hi> The Miniſter replyes, Truth it is, you have done thus, but would you do ſo ſtill? is it good now to be drunk, or to blaſpheme, or to rail on Gods Saints, or contemn Gods Ordinances? <hi>O no, no</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I now finde what the end of thoſe wicked courſes will be: Gods Word could not prevail with me, the Miniſter could not perſwade me; O the good Sermons that I have heard, the very flames of Hell have even flaſhed in my face, the Miniſter hath ſpent his pains, and would have ſpent his blood for the good of my poor ſoul! But alas, I despiſed the Word, and mocked the Miniſter: Wo, wo unto me for ever; now my Conſcience gnaws, and tears, and terrifies my ſoul here, and I ſhall to Hell hereafter, and periſh for ever and ever.</hi> The Miniſter replyes again, The truth is, you have done
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39862:10"/>
thus, but would you do ſo now? would you ſtill blaſpheme, and curſe, and be drunk, and riotous? or rather would you not now part with all theſe, and take mercy in ſtead of them? Then the poor ſoul cryes out, <hi>Now the Lord for his mercies ſake remove theſe ſins from me: O I had never ſo much delight in my ſins heretofore, as now I have wo, miſery and vexation for them; but (alas) it is not in my power to help my ſoul; if the Lord would do this, let him do what he will with it.</hi> What (ſaith the Miniſter) you are then willing and content to part with your ſins: <hi>O yes,</hi> (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>I would rather offend all the world then God; I had rather go to hell, then to the committing of a ſin; if it would pleaſe God to help me, I would forſake my ſins with all my heart.</hi> Why, now the poor ſoul is <hi>coming</hi> again, and God is <hi>drawing</hi> him again from his corruptions and ſinful diſtempers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when the ſoul is thus looſened, the Lord then fully <note place="margin">4 <hi>Means.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>NOw are we to obſerve the diſpoſition of the ſoul on mans part, which God works on the hearts of whom he <hi>draws.</hi> It is known in two works:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Contrition,</hi> whereby the ſoul is cut off from ſin.</item>
                     <item>

                  </list>
                  <p>For ſo it is, that either the ſoul ſeeth no need to depart from ſin, or elſe it thinks it can help it ſelf out of ſin; the firſt is called <hi>Security,</hi> when the ſoul being blinde, takes reſt, and ſeeing no need to be better, deſires it not therefore: Againſt this the Lord ſends <hi>Contrition,</hi> cauſing men thereby to know the miſery of ſin, and to ſee need of a change: The ſecond is <hi>Carnal Confidence,</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:39862:10"/>
when a ſinner begins to ſeek ſuccor, and to ſcramble for his own comfort in his ſelf-ſufficiency; againſt this the Lord works <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,</hi> cauſing the ſoul hereby to ſee the weakneſs and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its <hi>Duties,</hi> and that there is enough in its beſt ſervices to condemn him for ever. Before we ſpeak of the <hi>works,</hi> it is not amiſs to begin with the <hi>lets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Security:</hi> When the ſoul is taken up with a ſecure courſe, and reſts it ſelf well apaid in his own practiſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it never ſeeth any need of a change, nor ever goes out for a change: Now while a man lives thus, and bleſſeth himſelf in his ſin, it is impoſſible that ever he ſhould receive faith, or by the power of faith repair unto Chriſt: where faith comes, it ever works a change, <hi>Old things are done away, and then all things are become new;</hi> the Lord therefore to remove this let, he burthens the ſoul extremely, and ſays, <hi>You will live in drunkenneſs, in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; you will have your ſins, then take your ſins, and get you down to hell with them.</hi> At this voyce the Sinner begins to ſee where he is: <hi>Is this true?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>then I am the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable creature under heaven;</hi> therefore as they ſaid, <hi>Men and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>brethren, what ſhall we do? We have been thus and thus, but if we reſt here, it will be our ruine for ever, O what ſhall we do?</hi> So the ſoul comes to a reſtleſs diſlike of it ſelf, and ſaith, <hi>I muſt either be otherwiſe, or elſe I am but a damned man for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the ſoul is thus reſolved that it muſt of neceſſity change, when it ſeeth his wound and his ſin ready before him to condemn him, and it hath (as it were) a little peep-hole into hell; the ſoul in this diſtreſs ſends over to <hi>Prayer, and Hearing, and holy ſervices,</hi> and thinks by his wits and <hi>Duties,</hi> or ſome ſuch like matters, to ſuccor it ſelf; and it begins to ſay, <hi>My hearing and my prayer, will not theſe ſave me?</hi> Thus the ſoul in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion reſts on <hi>Duties:</hi> I will not ſay but theſe <hi>Duties</hi> are all good, honorable and comfortable, yet they are not Gods, but the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> of God. It is the nature of a ſinful heart, to make the <hi>means,</hi> as meritorious to Salvation: A man that ſeeth his Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs and his baſe contempt of God, O then he voweth and promiſeth to take up a new courſe, and he begins to approve himſelf in reformation of his ways, then he cryes, <hi>Now I will have no more drunkenneſs, now no more ſcoffing and ſcorning at thoſe that go to hear the Word: and then he thinks, What can I do</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:39862:11"/>
                     <hi>more? to heaven I muſt go.</hi> All this is but a <hi>mans ſelf:</hi> Why ſo? Chriſt (who is the Subſtance of all) and the pith of a Promiſe is forgotten; a Chriſt in hearing, a Chriſt in praying is not regarded, and therefore the poor ſoul famiſheth with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Miſtake not, I pray you, theſe <hi>Duties</hi> muſt be had and uſed, but ſtill a man muſt not ſtay here: Prayer ſaith, <hi>There is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in me;</hi> and the Sacraments and Faſting ſay, <hi>There is no Salvation in us:</hi> all theſe are ſubſervient helps, no abſolute cauſes of Salvation. A man will uſe his bucket, but he expects water from the well; theſe <hi>Means</hi> are the <hi>buckets,</hi> but all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and all our life and grace is onely in Chriſt: if you ſay, your <hi>bucket</hi> ſhall help you, you may ſtarve for Chriſt, if you let it not down into the well for water: So though you boaſt of <hi>Praying, and Hearing, and Faſting, and of your Alms, and building of Hoſpitals,</hi> and of your good deeds, if none of theſe bring you to a Chriſt, or ſettle you on a Chriſt, you ſhall dye for Chriſt, though your works were as the works of an Angel. As it is with a graft therefore, firſt it muſt be cut off from the old ſtock; ſecondly, it muſt be pared, and made fit for implantation into another: ſo the ſoul by <hi>Contrition</hi> being cut off from ſin, then <hi>Humiliation</hi> pares it (pares away all a mans priviledges) and makes it fit for the ingraffing into Chriſt Jeſus. Thus much of the <hi>lets,</hi> and of the works of <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Humiliation</hi> in general.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Clearly:</hi> It is not a general ſight, and confuſed ſight of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:39862:11"/>
Sin that will ſerve the turn; it is not enough to ſay, <hi>It is my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and I cannot amend it, we are all ſinners:</hi> no, this is the ground why we miſtake our evils, and reform not our ways; a man muſt ſearch narrowly, and prove his ways, as the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith doth his gold in the fire: <hi>I conſidered my ways,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid)</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies;</hi> in the Original, <hi>I turned my ſins upſide down,</hi> he looked all over his ways. And this <hi>clear</hi> ſight of Sin appears in two particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A man muſt ſee his Sin nakedly in its own proper colours, we muſt not look on Sin through the <hi>Mediums</hi> of profits, and pleaſures, and contentments of this world, for ſo we miſtake Sin: but the ſoul of a true Chriſtian that would ſee Sin <hi>clearly,</hi> he muſt ſtrip it of all content and quiet that ever the heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in it; as the Adulterer muſt not look upon Sin in regard of the ſweetneſs of it, nor the Covetous man on his Sin in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the profit of it: you that are ſuch, the time will come when you muſt dye, and then conſider what good theſe ſinful courſes will do you: How will you judge of Sin then, when it ſhall leave a blot on your Souls, and a guilt on your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man muſt look on Sin in the venom of it; and that you may do partly, if you compare it with other things, and partly, if you look at it in regard of it ſelf. 1. Compare Sin with thoſe things that are moſt fearful and horrible; as ſuppoſe any ſoul here preſent were to behold the damned in Hell, if the Lord ſhould give any one of you a little peep-hole into Hell, that you ſaw the horror of the damned, then propound this to your heart, What are thoſe pains which the damned endure, and your heart will ſhake and quake at it; yet the leaſt Sin that ever you did commit, is a greater evil (in its own nature) then the greateſt pains of the damned in Hell. 2. Look at Sin ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as it is in it ſelf, what is it, but <hi>a profeſt oppoſing of God himſelf?</hi> A ſinful creature joyns ſide with the Devil, and comes in battel Array againſt the Lord, and flies in the face of the Lord God of Hoſts. I pray you in cold blood conſider this, and ſay, <hi>Good Lord, what a ſinful wretch am I? that a poor damned wretch of the earth, ſhould ſtand in defiance againſt God! that I ſhould ſubmit my ſelf to the Devil, and oppoſe the Lord God of Hoſts!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:39862:12"/>
Secondly, <hi>Convictingly,</hi> that Sin may be ſo to us, as it is in it ſelf; and that diſcovers it ſelf in theſe two particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When we have a particular apprehenſion in our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that whatſoever Sin is in general, we confeſs it the ſame in our own ſouls: It is the curſed diſtemper of our hearts, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we hold the Truth in general, yet when we come to our own Sins, to deny the particulars. The Adulterer confeſſeth the danger and filthineſs of that Sin in groſs, but he will not apply it to himſelf: The Rule therefore is, <hi>Arreſt thy ſoul (whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art) of thoſe ſins particularly whereof thou ſtandeſt guilty;</hi> To this purpoſe, ſay, <hi>Is Murther, and Pride, and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs ſuch horrible ſins? O Lord, it was my Heart that was proud, and vain; it was my Tongue that did ſpeak filthily, and blaſphemouſly; my Hand that wrought wickedneſs; my Eye that was wanton, and my Heart that was unclean and filthy; Lord, here they are:</hi> Thus bring thy Heart before God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the ſoul ſits down with the audience of Truth, and ſeeks no ſhift to oppoſe Truth revealed: when the Lord comes to make racks in the hearts of ſuch as he means to do good to, the Text ſaith, <hi>He will reprove the world of ſin;</hi> that is, <hi>He will</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 16. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>convince the world of wickedneſs:</hi> he will ſet the ſoul in ſuch a ſtand, that it ſhall have nothing to ſay for it ſelf, he cannot ſhift it off. The Miniſter ſaith, God hates ſuch and ſuch a ſinner; <hi>And the Lord hates me too</hi> (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>for I am guilty of that ſin.</hi> Thus many time, when a ſinner comes into the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (if the Lord pleaſe to work on him) the minde is illightned, and the Miniſter meets with his corruptions, as if he were in his boſom, and he anſwers all his cavils, and takes away all his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections: with that the ſoul begins to be in a maze, and ſaith, <hi>If this be ſo (as it is for ought I know) and if all be true that the Miniſter ſaith, then the Lord be merciful unto my ſoul, I am the moſt miſerable ſinner that ever was born.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Lord purſues the ſoul, and diſcharges that evil upon him which was formerly feared; and now his Conſcience is all on a flame, and he ſaith to himſelf, <hi>O I have ſinned, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended a juſt God, and therefore I muſt be damned, and to Hell I muſt go:</hi> Now the ſoul ſhakes, and is driven beyond it ſelf, and would utterly faint, but that the Lord upholds it with one hand, as he beats it down with the other; he thinks every thing is againſt him, he thinks the fire burns to conſume him, and that the ayr will poyſon him, and that Hell-mouth gapes under him, and that Gods wrath hangs over him, and if now the Lord ſhould but take away his life, that he ſhould tumble down headlong into the bottomleſs Hell: Should any man, or Miniſter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the ſoul in this caſe to go to Heaven for Mercy, it replies in this maner, <hi>Shall I repair to God?

                  <p>THe next ſtep is <hi>Sorrow for Sin;</hi> concerning which, are two queſtions: 1. Whether it be a work of ſaving grace? 2. Whether God work it in all alike?</p>
                  <p>To the firſt, I anſwer, There is a double <hi>Sorrow,</hi> one in <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> the other in <hi>Sanctification:</hi> They differ thus; <hi>Sorrow in Preparation,</hi> is when the word of God leaves an impreſſion upon the heart of a man, ſo that the heart of it ſelf is as it were a Patient, and onely bears the blow of the Spirit; and hence come all thoſe phraſes of Scripture, as <hi>wounded, pierced, pricked,</hi> in the paſſive voyce: So that this <hi>Sorrow</hi> is rather a <hi>Sorrow</hi> wrought on me, then any work coming from any Spiritual ability in me: But <hi>Sorrow</hi> in Sanctification flows from a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual principle of Grace, and from that power which the heart hath formerly received from Gods Spirit; ſo that in this a man is a free worker: Now both theſe are <hi>ſaving Sorrows,</hi> but they differ marvellouſly; many think, that every ſaving work, is a ſanctifying work, which is falſe, <hi>Thoſe whom he calleth</hi> (ſaith the <note place="margin">Rom 8. 30.</note> Apoſtle) <hi>them he alſo juſtifies, and whom he juſtifies, he glorifies:</hi> You may obſerve, That <hi>Glorification</hi> in this place implyes Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication here, and glory hereafter; now before <hi>Glorification,</hi> you ſee there is <hi>Juſtification and Vocation,</hi> and both theſe are ſaving.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond, I anſwer, Howſoever this work is the ſame in all for ſubſtance, yet in a different maner it is wrought in moſt: Two men are pricked, the one with a pin, the other with a ſpear; two men are cut, the one with a pen-knife, the other with a ſword: ſo the Lord deals kindely and gently with one ſoul, and roughly with another: There is the melting of a thing, and the breaking of it with hammers; ſo there is a difference in perſons: for inſtance, if the perſon be a ſcandalous liver, and an oppoſer of God and his Grace: Secondly, if a man have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39862:14"/>
harbored a filthy heart, and continues long in Sin. Thirdly, if a man have been confident in a formal civil courſe. Fourthly, if God purpoſe by ſome man to do ſome extraordinary great work: In all theſe four caſes he lays an heavy blow on the heart, the Lord will bruiſe them, and rend the kall of their hearts, and make them ſeek to a faithful Miniſter for direction, and to a poor Chriſtian for counſel, whom before they deſpiſed. But if the ſoul be trained up among godly Parents, and live under a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaving Miniſtery, the Lord may reform this man, and cut him off from his corruptions kindely, and break his heart ſecretly, in the apprehenſion of his Sins, and yet the world never ſee it. In both theſe we have an example in <hi>Lydia</hi> and the <hi>Jaylor: Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> was a ſinful woman, and God opened her eyes, and melted her heart kindely, and brought her to a taſte of his goodneſs here, and glory hereafter: But the <hi>Jaylor</hi> was an outragious, rebellious wretch, for when the Apoſtles were committed to priſon, he laid them up in ſtocks, and whipped them ſore; now there was much work to bring this man home: when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were ſinging Pſalms, there came an Earthquake, which made the priſon doors flie open, and the priſoners fetters to fall off, but yet the Jaylors heart would not ſhake: at laſt the Lord did ſhake his heart too, and he came trembling, and was ready to lay violent hands upon himſelf, becauſe he thought the priſoners had been fled; but the Apoſtles cryed to him, <hi>Do thy ſelf no</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 16. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>harm, for we are all here:</hi> with that he fell down before them, and ſaid, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> For Concluſion, give me a Chriſtian that God doth pleaſe to work upon in this extraordinary maner, and to break his heart ſoundly, and to throw him down to purpoſe, though it coſt him full dear, this man walks ordinarily with more care and conſcience, and hath more comfort coming to himſelf, and gives more glory unto God.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that the ſoul of a man is thus pierced to the quick, and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. of Inſtruction</note> run through by the wrath of the Almighty? then let this teach all how to carry themſelves towards ſuch as God hath thus dealt withal: Are they pierced men? O pity them! let our ſouls, O let the bowels of commiſeration and compaſſion be let out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them! let us never ceaſe to do good to them, to the very uttermoſt of our powers! And to the performance of this,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39862:14"/>
Reaſon and Religion, and pity (me-thinks) ſhould move us: Hear the cry, <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith the poor ſoul) <hi>will theſe and theſe ſins never be pardoned? Will this proud heart never be humbled?</hi> Thus the ſoul ſighs and mourns, and ſays, <hi>O Lord, I ſee this ſin, and feel the burthen of it, and yet I have not an heart to be humbled for it, nor to be freed from it: O when will it once be?</hi> Did you but know this, it would make your hearts bleed to hear him: Oh! the ſword of the Almighty hath pierced through his heart, and he is breathing out his <hi>ſorrow,</hi> as though he were going down to hell, and he ſaith, <hi>If there be any mercy, any love, any fellowſhip of the Spirit, have mercy upon me a poor creature, that am under the burthen of the Almighty!</hi> O pray, and pity theſe wounds and vexations of Spirit, which no man findes nor feels, but he that hath been thus wounded. It is a ſign of a ſoul wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to deſtruction, that hath a deſperate diſdain againſt poor wounded creatures: Is it poſſible there ſhould harbor ſuch a Spirit in any man? if the Devil himſelf were incarnate, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive what he could do worſe.</p>

                  <p>HItherto of <hi>Contrition;</hi> the next work is <hi>Humiliation,</hi> which differs from the other, not in ſubſtance, but circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39862:15"/>
For <hi>Humiliation</hi> (as I take it) is onely the extent of <hi>Sorrow for Sin,</hi> of which we have ſpoken; and it contains theſe two Duties:
<list>
                        <item>1. Submiſſion,</item>
                        <item>2. Contentedneſs,</item>
                     </list>
to be at the Lords diſpoſal.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> is <hi>Submiſſion,</hi> which is wrought thus: The ſinner having now had a <hi>Sight of his Sins,</hi> and a <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> in ſome meaſure for Sin, he ſeeks far and wide, improves all means, and takes up all <hi>Duties,</hi> that (if it were poſſible) he might heal his wounded ſoul: Thus ſeeking, and ſeeking, but finding no ſuccor in what he hath or doth, he is forced at laſt (in his deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition) to make tryal of the Lord: It is true, for the preſent he apprehends God to be juſt, and to be incenſed againſt him, he hath no experience of Gods favor for the while no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty how he ſhall ſpeed, if he go to the Lord; yet becauſe he ſees he cannot be worſe then he is, and that none can help him but God, if it would pleaſe him: therefore he falls at the footſtool of Mercy, and he lies grovelling at the gate of Grace, and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi> himſelf to the Lord, to do with him as pleaſeth himſelf, or <hi>as it ſeemeth good in his eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the <hi>Ninevites</hi> caſe, when <hi>Jonah</hi> had denounced that heavy Judgement, and (as it were) thrown wilde fire about the ſtreets, ſaying, <hi>Within forty days Niniveh ſhall be deſtroyed:</hi> See what they reſolved upon, <hi>They faſted, and prayed, and put on</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ionah 3. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>ſackcloth and aſhes; who can tell</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>but God may turn, and repent him of his fierce wrath, that we periſh not?</hi> as if they had ſaid, We know not what God will do, but this we know, that we cannot oppoſe his Judgements, nor ſuccor our ſelves: Thus it is with a ſinner, when he ſeeth hell fire to flaſh in his face, and that he cannot ſuccor himſelf, then he ſaith, <hi>This I know, that all the means in the world cannot ſave me, yet who can tell, but the Lord may have mercy on me, and cure his tdiſtreſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and heal all theſe wounds that ſin hath made in my ſoul?</hi> This is the lively picture of the ſoul in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Or for a further light, this <hi>Subjection</hi> diſcovers it ſelf in four particulars:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he ſeeth and confeſſeth that the Lord (for ought he knows) will proceed in Juſtice againſt him, and execute upon him thoſe Plagues that God hath threatned, and his Sins have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:39862:15"/>
he ſeeth that Juſtice is not yet ſatisfied, and thoſe rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings between God and him are not yet made up, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot apprehend, but that God will take vengeance on him: What elſe? when he hath done all he can, he is unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtill; Juſtice remains unſatisfied, and ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt ſinned, and I am wronged, and therefore thou ſhalt dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he conceives, that what God will do, that he will do, and he cannot avoid it; if the Lord will come, and require the glory of his Juſtice againſt him, there is no way to avoid it, nor to bear it: and this cruſheth the heart, and makes the ſoul to be beyond all ſhifts and evaſions, whereby it may ſeem to avoid the dint of the Lords blow.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he caſts away his weapons, and falls down before the Lord, and reſigns himſelf into the ſoveraign power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God. Thus <hi>David,</hi> when the Lord caſt him out of his Kingdom, he ſaid to <hi>Zadock, Carry back the Ark of God into the City, if I ſhall finde favor in the eyes of the Lord, he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 25, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>will bring me back again, and ſhew me both it and his Habitation: But if he thus ſay to me, I have no delight in thee; behold, here I am, let him do with me as ſeemeth good in his eyes.</hi> This is the frame of a poor ſoul; when a poor ſinner will ſtand upon his priviledges, the Lord ſaith, <hi>Bear my Juſtice, and defend thy ſelf by all thou haſt or canſt do:</hi> and the ſoul anſwereth, <hi>I am thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Lord, do what is good in thine eyes, I cannot ſuccor my ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the ſoul freely acknowledgeth, That it is in Gods power to do with him, and diſpoſe of him as he will; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he lies and licks the duſt, and cryes, <hi>Mercy, mercy, Lord:</hi> he thinks not to purchaſe Mercy at the Lords hands, but onely ſaith, <hi>It is in Gods good pleaſure to do with him as he will, onely he looks for favor, and cryes, Mercy, Lord, mercy to this poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ſoul of mine:</hi> O (replies the Lord) doſt thou need mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? Cannot thy <hi>Hearing, and Praying, and Faſting,</hi> carry thee to heaven without hazard? Gird up now thy loyns, and make thy ferventeſt Prayers, and let them meet my Juſtice, and ſee if they can bear my Wrath, or purchaſe any Mercy: <hi>No, no</hi> (ſaith the ſinner) <hi>I know it by lamentable experience, that all my prayers and performances will never procure peace to my ſoul. nor give my ſatisfaction to thy Juſtice, I onely pray for Mercy, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi>

                     </gap>itly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble this poor ſinner, when the Famine was great in <hi>Samaria; There were four leprous men ſate in the gate of the City, and they ſaid, Why ſit we here until we dye? if we enter into the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 King. 7. 3, 4</note> 
                     <hi>City, the famine is there, and if we ſit here, we dye alſo; now therefore let us fall into the hands of our enemies, and if they ſave us alive, we ſhall live, and if they kill us, we ſhall but dye:</hi> They had but one means to ſuccor themſelves withal, and that was to go into the Camp of the enemies, and there, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they were relieved. Thus is the lively picture of a poor ſinner in this deſpairing condition, when he ſeeth the wrath of God purſuing him, and that the Lord hath beſet him on every ſide; at laſt he reſolves thus with himſelf, <hi>If I go and reſt on my priviledges, there is nothing but emptineſs; and if I reſt in my natural condition, I periſh there alſo: let me therefore fall into the hands of the Lord of Hoſts. I confeſs he hath been provoked by me, and for ought I ſee he is mine enemy; I am now a damned man, and if the Lord caſt me out of his preſence, I can be but damned.</hi> And then he comes to the Lord, and he falls down before the footſtool of a conſuming God, and ſaith, as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>What ſhall I ſay unto thee, O thou Preſerver of men? I have no reaſon to plead for my ſelf, and I have no power to ſuccor my ſelf, my accuſations are my beſt excuſe, all the priviledges in the world cannot juſtific me, and all my Duties cannot ſave me; if there be any mercy left, O ſuccor a poor diſtreſſed ſinner in the very gall of bitterneſs.</hi> This is the behavior of the ſoul in this work of <hi>Subjection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> is, <hi>Contentedneſs to be at the Lords dispoſal;</hi> and this point is of an higher pitch then the former: For example, Take a debtor who hath uſed all means to avoid the creditor, in the end he ſeeth he cannot avoid the Suit, and to bear it he is not able, therefore the onely way is to come in, and to yield himſelf into his creditors hands; but ſuppoſe the creditor ſhould exact the utmoſt, and throw him into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>to be content</hi> now to undergo the hardeſt dealing, it is an hard matter, and a further degree. So when the ſoul hath
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:39862:16"/>
offered himſelf, and he ſeeth that Gods Writs are out againſt him, and he is not able (whenſoever the Judgement comes) to avoid it, nor to bear it, therefore he <hi>ſubmits</hi> himſelf, and ſaith, <hi>Lord, whether ſhall I go? thy anger is heavy and unavoidable;</hi> nay, whatſoever God requires, the ſoul lays his hand on his mouth, and goes away <hi>contented,</hi> and well ſatisfied, and hath nothing at all to ſay againſt the Lord. This is the nature of <hi>Contentedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or for a further light, this <hi>Contentedneſs</hi> diſcovers it ſelf in theſe three following particulars:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Soul reflects on Gods <hi>Mercy,</hi> which though he begg'd when he <hi>ſubmitted,</hi> yet now he ſeeth ſo much corruption and unworthineſs in himſelf, that he acknowledgeth himſelf unfit for Mercy: <hi>O Mercy, mercy Lord!</hi> What (ſaith the Lord) I had thought your own Duties would have purchaſed mercy: <hi>O no</hi> (ſaith the Soul) <hi>it is onely Mercy that muſt relieve, and ſuccor me; but ſuch is my vileneſs, that I am not fit for the leaſt mercy and favor; and ſuch is the wickedneſs of this wretched heart of mine, that whatſoever are the greateſt plagues, I am worthy of them all, though never ſo inſupportable: All the Judgements that God hath threatned, and prepared for the Devil and his Angels, they are all due to my wretched ſoul. O</hi> (ſaith the Soul) <hi>had the Devils the like hopes, and means, and patience that I have enjoyed, for ought I know they would have been better then I am:</hi> It is that which ſhames the Soul in all his ſorrows, and makes him ſay, <hi>Had they the like Mercy? O thoſe ſweet Comforts, and thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes that I have had! How many heavy journeys hath the Lord Jeſus made to me? How often hath he knock'd at my heart, and ſaid, Come to me, ye rebellious children; turn ye, turn ye, why will ye dye? O that Mercy that hath followed me from my houſe to my walk, and from thence to my cloſet; here Mercy hath conferred with me, and there Mercy hath wooed me; yea, in my night-thoughts when I awaked, Mercy kneeled down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and beſought me to renounce my bad courſes, yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Mercy, and would needs have mine own will; had the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil but ſuch hopes, and ſuch offers of Mercy, they that tremble now for want of Mercy, they would (for ought I know) have given entertainment to it; and what, do I ſeek for Mercy? ſhall I talk of Mercy? What, I Mercy? the leaſt of Gods Mercies are</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:39862:17"/>
                     <hi>too good for me, and the heavieſt of Gods Plagues are too little for me; I ſuppoſe (for ſo is my opinion) that God cannot do more againſt me then I have juſtly deſerved, but be ſure, God will not lay more upon me then I am juſtly worthy of:</hi> Nay, ſure it is, the Soul cannot bear nor ſuffer ſo much as he hath deſerved, if God ſhould proceed in rigor with him; therefore it reaſons thus: <hi>I onely for one ſin deſerve eternal condemnation, for the wages of all ſin is death, being committed againſt Divine Juſtice, and againſt an Infinite Majeſty; and then what do all theſe my ſins deſerve, committed and continued in, againſt all checks of Conſcience, and Corrections, and the light of Gods Word? Hell is too good, and ten thouſand hells too little to torment ſuch a wretch as I am: What, I mercy? I am aſhamed to expect it; With what heart (I pray you) can I beg this Mercy, which I have trodden under my feet? The Lord hath often wooed me, and when his wounds were bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his ſide gored, and his hideous cryes coming into mine ears, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? then, even then this Chriſt have I ſlighted, and made nothing of his Blood; and can this blood of Chriſt do me now any ſervice? Indeed I crave grace, but how do I think to receive any? All the Pillars of the Church can teſtifie, how often Grace and Mercy have been offered and offered, but I have ever refuſed; How then can I beg any grace? O this ſtubbornneſs and villany, and this wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mine! What, I mercy? it is more then I can expect, I am not worthy of any; Oh no, I am onely worthy to be caſt out for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Soul reflects on <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and now it acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the Equity of Gods dealings, be they never ſo harſh; he confeſſeth that he is as clay in the hands of the Potter, and the Lord may deal with him as he will: yea, the Soul is driven to an amazement at the Lords patience, and that he hath been pleaſed to reprieve him ſo long, that God hath not caſt him out of his preſence, and ſent him down to hell long ago: It is the frame of the Spirit which the poor lamenting Church had, <hi>It is the Lords mercy that we are not confounded, becauſe his compaſſions</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>fail not.</hi> When the Lord hath humbled the heart of a Drunkard or Adulterer, he begins thus to think with himſelf, <hi>The Lord ſaw all the evils I committed;</hi> and what then? O then the Soul ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires that ever Gods Juſtice was able to bear with ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39862:17"/>
and that God did not confound him in his drunkenneſs or burning luſts, and caſt him down into hell. <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is becauſe his mercies fail not, that my life and all have not failed long ago.</hi> Hence it is that the Soul will not maintain any kinde of murmuring, or heart-riſing againſt the Lords dealings; or if Nature and Corruption will be ſtriving ſometimes, and ſay, <hi>Why are not my prayers anſwered? I know ſuch a ſoul humbled, and I ſee ſuch a foul comforted, and why not I as well as he?</hi> then the Soul ſtifles, and cruſheth, and choaks theſe wretched diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and doth alſo abaſe it ſelf before the Lord, ſaying, <hi>What if God will not hear my prayers? What if God will not pacifie my Conſcience, doth the Lord do me any wrong? Vile Hell-hound that I am, I have my ſin and my ſhame; Wrath is my portion, and Hell is my place, thither may I go when I will, it is mercy that God thus deals with me.</hi> And now the Soul clears God in his Juſtice, and ſaith, <hi>It is juſt with God that all the prayers which comes from this filthy heart of mine, ſhould be abhorred, and that all my labors in holy Duties ſhould never be bleſſed; It is I that have ſinned againſt checks of Conſcience, againſt Knowledge, againſt Heaven, and therefore it is juſt that I ſhould carry this horror of heart with me to the Grave; it is I that have abuſed Mercy, and therefore it is juſt that I ſhould go with a tormenting Conſcience down into hell: And O that (if I be in hell) I might have a spirit to glorifie and juſtifie thy Name there; and ſay, Now I am come down to hell amongst you damned creatures, but the Lord is righteous and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever in all his doings and dealings, and I am juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence the Soul comes to be quiet and frameable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heavy hand of God in that helpleſs condition wherein he is, it takes the blow, and lies under the burthen, and goes away quietly and patiently: O this is an heart worth gold! <hi>O</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is fit that God ſhould glorifie himſelf, though I be damned for ever, for I deſerve the worſt: Whatſoever I have, it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of my own works, and the end of my own ways: if I be damned, I may thank my pride, and my ſtubbornneſs, and my pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs of spirit: What, ſhall I repine againſt the Lord, becauſe his wrath and his displeaſure lies heavy upon me? Oh no! let me repine againſt my ſin, the cauſe of all; let me grudge againſt my baſe heart that hath nouriſhed theſe Adders in my boſom, but let</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:39862:18"/>
                     <hi>me bleſs the Lord, and not ſpeak one word againſt him.</hi> Thus <hi>David, I held my tongue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſpake nothing, becauſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal 39. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>thou Lord haſt done it:</hi> So the Soul, when the Sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is even ſeizing upon him, and God ſeems to caſt him out of his favor, then he cryes, <hi>I confeſs God is juſt, and therefore I bleſs his Name, and yield unto him; but ſin, ſin is the worker of all this miſery on me. Jeremiah</hi> pleading the caſe of the Church, now going to Captivity, <hi>Wo is me for my hurt</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">Ier. 10. 19.</note> he) <hi>my wound is grievous; but I ſaid, Truly this is my grief, and I muſt bear it.</hi> Such is the frame of an heart truly humbled, it is content to take all to it ſelf, and ſo to be quiet, ſaying, <hi>This is my wound, and I muſt bear it; this is my ſorrow, and I will ſuffer it.</hi> Thus you ſee what is the behavior of the Soul in this <hi>Contentedneſs to be at the Lords diſpoſal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may object, <hi>Muſt the ſoul, or ought the ſoul to be thus</hi> content <hi>to be left in this damnable condition?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> For anſwer, This <hi>Contentedneſs</hi> implyes two things: Firſt, a carnal ſecurity, and a regardleſneſs of a mans eſtate, and and this is a moſt curſed ſin. Secondly, a calmneſs of Soul, not murmuring againſt the Lords diſpenſation towards him; and this <hi>Contentedneſs</hi> is ever accompanyed with the <hi>Sight of a mans ſin,</hi> and <hi>Suing for Mercy:</hi> It ever improves all means and helps that may bring him nearer to God; but if Mercy ſhall deny it, the Soul is ſatisfied, and reſts well apaid. And this, <hi>Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (oppoſed againſt quarrelling with the Almighty) every humbled Soul doth attain to, although in every one it is not ſo plainly ſeen. To give it in a Compariſon: A Thief taken for Robbery, on whom the Sentence of Death hath paſſed, he ſhould not neglect the <hi>means</hi> to get a Pardon; and yet if he cannot procure it, he muſt not murmure againſt the Judge for condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to death, becauſe he hath done nothing but Law: So we ſhould not be careleſs in uſing all <hi>means</hi> for our good, but ſtill ſeek to God for <hi>Mercy:</hi> yet thus we muſt be, and thus we ought to be contented with whatſoever <hi>Mercy</hi> ſhall deny, becauſe we are not worthy of any favor. The Soul in a depth of Humiliation, it firſt ſtoops to the condition that the Lord will appoint, he dares not fly away from God, nor repine againſt the Lord, but he lies down meekly. 2. As he is content with the hardeſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo he is content with the longeſt time, he will ſtay for mercy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39862:18"/>
be it never ſo long: <hi>I will wait upon the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah) that hath hid his face from Jacob; and I will look for him:</hi> ſo the humbled ſinner, <hi>Although the Lord hide his face, and turn away his loving countenance from me, yet I will look towards Heaven, ſo long as I have an eye to ſee, and a hand to lift up; the Lord may take his own time, it is maners for me to wait:</hi> nay, the poor broken heart reſolves thus, <hi>If I lie and lick, the duſt all my days, and cry for mercy all my life long, if my laſt words might be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, mercy, it were well I might get mercy at my laſt gaſp.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he is content to ſtay the longeſt time, ſo is he content with the leaſt pittance of mercy; <hi>Let my condition be never ſo hard</hi> (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>do Lord what thou wilt for me, let the fire of thy wrath conſume me here, onely recover me hereafter; if I finde mercy at the laſt I am content, and whatſoever thou giveſt I bleſs thy name for it;</hi> he quarrels not, ſaying, <hi>Why are not my graces increaſed, and why am I not thus and thus comforted?</hi> No, he looks for mercy, and if he have but a crum of mercy he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and quieted for ever: And now (you may ſuppoſe) the heart is brought very low.</p>
                  <p>Hence we collect, 1. That they which have the greateſt parts, <note place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In fierceſt Temptations;</hi> when Satan begins to beſiege the heart of a poor ſinner, and lays battery againſt him, ſee how the humbled heart runs him out of breath at his own weapons: Doſt thou think (ſays Satan) to get mercy from the Lord, when thy own conſcience dogs thee? nay, go to the place where thou liveſt, &amp; to the chamber where thou lieſt, and conſider thy fearful abominations, ſure God will not reſpect the prayers of any ſuch vile ſinners. <hi>True</hi> (ſaith the poor ſoul) <hi>I have often denyed the Lord when he called upon me, and therefore he may juſtly deny me all the prayers I make; yet thus he hath commanded, that ſeek to him for mercy I muſt, and if the Lord will caſt me away, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject my prayers, I am contented therewith; What then Satan?</hi> What then, ſaith the Devil? I thought this would have made thee to diſpair; but this is not all, for God will give thee over, and leave thee to thy ſelf, to thy luſts and corruptions, and thy lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end ſhall be worſe then thy beginning; thou mayeſt call and cry, and when thou haſt done be overthrown; God will leave thee to thy ſelf, and ſuffer thy corruptions to prevail againſt thee, and thou ſhalt fall fearfully, to the wounding of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to the grieving of Gods people, to the ſcandal of the Goſpel, to the reproach of thy own perſon. To this anſwers the humbled ſoul, <hi>If the Lord will give me up to my baſe luſts, which I have given my ſelf ſo much liberty in, and if the Lord will leave me to my ſins, becauſe I have left his gracious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and if I ſhall fall one day, and be diſgraced and diſhonored, yet let the Lord be honored, and let not God loſe the praiſe of his</hi>

                     <hi>Power and Juſtice, and I am contented therewith; what then Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan?</hi> What then, ſaith the Devil? I ſure thought now thou wouldſt have deſpaired; but this is not all, for when God hath left thee to thy ſins, then will he break out in vengeance againſt thee, and make thee an example of his heavy vengeance to all ages to come; and therefore it is beſt for thee to prevent this untimely Judgement by ſome untimely death. To this replies the Soul, <hi>Whatſoever God can do or will do, I know not, yet ſo great are my ſins, that he cannot, or (at least) will not do ſo much againſt me as I have juſtly deſerved: Come what will come, I am contented ſtill to be at the Lords dispoſal; what then Satan?</hi> and thus he runs Satan out of breath.</p>
                  <p>The want of this <hi>Humiliation</hi> many times brings a man to deſperate ſtands, and ſometimes to untimely deaths: Alas, why will you not bear the wrath of the Lord? it is true indeed, your ſins are great, and the wrath of God is heavy, yet God will do you good by it, and therefore be quiet. In time of war, when the great Canons fly off, the onely way to avoid them, is to lie down in a furrow, and ſo the bullets fly over: So in all Temptations of Satan, lie low, and be <hi>contented to be at Gods dispoſing,</hi> and all theſe fiery Temptations ſhall not be able to hurt you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In heavieſt oppoſitions:</hi> when Satan is gone, then come Troubles and Oppoſitions of the world, in all which <hi>Humiliation</hi> will quiet the Soul. A man is ſometimes Sea-ſick, not becauſe of the Tempeſt, but becauſe of his full ſtomack, and therefore when he hath emptied his ſtomack he is well again: So it is with his <hi>Humiliation</hi> of heart, if the heart were emptied truly, though a man were in a ſea of oppoſitions, if he have no more trouble in his ſtomack, and in his proud heart, then in the oppoſitions of the world, he might be very well quieted. Caſt diſgrace upon the humble heart cauſleſly, and he cures it thus, He thinks worſe of himſelf then any man elſe can do, and if they would make him vile and loathſom, he is more vile in his own eyes then they can make him: O that I could bring your hearts to be in love with this bleſſed grace of God!</p>
                  <p>Is there any Soul here that hath been vexed with the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, oppoſitions of men, or with his own diſtempers? and would he now arm and fence himſelf, that nothing ſhould
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:39862:20"/>
diſquiet him, or trouble him, but in all, to be above all, and to rejoyce in all? O then be <hi>humbled,</hi> and then be above all the Devils in hell: Certainly they ſhall not ſo diſquiet you, as to cauſe you to be miſled, or uncomforted, if you would but be humbled.</p>
                  <p>What remains then? Be exhorted (as you deſire mercy and favor at Gods hands) to this <hi>Humiliation.</hi> And for Motives, <note place="margin">

with the ſtock: Theſe two things are anſwerable in the Soul, and when it is brought into this, then a ſinner comes to be partaker of all ſpiritual benefits.</p>
               <p>The firſt part is, The putting in of the Soul: when the Soul is brought out of the world of ſin, to lie upon, and to cloſe with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and this hath two particular paſſages:

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Call on Gods part</hi> is this, When the Lord by the <hi>Call</hi> of his Goſpel, and work of his Spirit, doth ſo clearly reveal the fulneſs of Mercy, that the Soul humbled <hi>returns Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>

                     <item>Cauſe</item>
                  </list>
whereby God doth <hi>Call.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Means</hi> is onely the Miniſtery of the Goſpel; the ſum whereof is this, That <hi>There is fulneſs of Mercy, and Grace, and Salvation brought unto us through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Hence the phraſe of Scripture calls this <hi>Gospel,</hi> or this mercy, <hi>A treaſury; All the treaſures of wiſdom and holineſs are in Chriſt:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2. 3.</note> not One treaſure, but All treaſures; not Some treaſures, but All treaſures: where the Goſpel comes, there is joy for the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, peace for the troubled, ſtrength for the weak, relief ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <note place="margin">Iſa. 61.</note> and ſuitable to all wants, miſeries and neceſſities, both preſent and future.</p>
               <p>If then ſorrow aſſail thee (when thou art come thus far) look not on thy ſins, to pore upon them; neither look into thy own <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> ſufficiency, to procure any good there. It is true, thou muſt <hi>ſee thy ſins, and ſorrow</hi> for them, but this is for the lower Form, and thou muſt get this leſſon before-hand; and when thou haſt got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this leſſon of <hi>Contrition and Humiliation,</hi> look then onely to <hi>Gods Mercy,</hi> and the riches of his Grace in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Cauſe:</hi> The Lord doth not onely appoint the <hi>Means,</hi> but by the work of the Spirit, he doth bring all the riches of his grace into the ſoul truly humbled: if you ask, How? Firſt, with ſtrength of evidence; the Spirit preſents to the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-hearted ſinner, the right of the freeneſs of Gods grace to the ſoul: And ſecondly, the Spirit doth forcibly ſoak in the relliſh of that grace, and by an over-piercing work, doth leave ſome dint of ſupernatural and ſpiritual vertue on the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:39862:21"/>
Now the word of the Goſpel, and the work of the Spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways go together, not that God is tyed to any means, but that he tyeth himſelf to the means: Hence the Goſpel is called, <hi>The power of God to Salvation,</hi> becauſe the power of God ordinarily, <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note> and in common courſe appears therein: The waters of life and ſalvation run onely in the channel of the Goſpel; there are golden mines of grace, but they are onely to be found in the Climates of the Goſpel: nay, obſerve this, when all arguments prevail not with corruption, to perſwade the heart to go to God, one Text of Scripture will ſtand a man in ſtead above all humane learning and inventions, becauſe the Spirit goes forth in this and none elſe.</p>
               <p>This may teach us the worth of the Goſpel above all other <note place="margin">
                     <hi>

What if a man had all the wealth and policy in the world, and wanted this? he were a fool: What if one were able to dive deep into the ſecrets of Nature, to know the motions of the Stars, to ſpeak with the tongues of men and Angels, and yet know nothing belonging to his peace, what avails it? Why do we value a Mine, but becauſe of the gold in it? or a Cabinet, but becauſe of the Pearl in it? O this is that <hi>pearl we ſell all for.</hi>

you think that you have oppoſed the Spirit: What, reſiſt the Spirit? me-thinks it is enough to ſink any ſoul under heaven: Hereafter therefore think this with thy ſelf, <hi>Were he but a man that ſpeaks, yet would I not despiſe him; but that is not all, there goeth Gods Spirit with the Word, and ſhall I despiſe it? There is but one ſtep between this and that unpardonable ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, onely adding Malice to my Rage: I oppoſe the Father, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Son mediates for me; I despiſe the Son, perhaps the holy Ghoſt pleads for me; but if I oppoſe the Spirit, none can ſuccor me.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>BUt for a further diſcovery of theſe works of the ſoul, we ſhall now enter into particulars: And for their order, Firſt, the Lord lets a light into <hi>the minde,</hi> for what the eye never ſeeth, the <hi>heart</hi> never <hi>deſireth, hope</hi> never expecteth, the ſoul never imbraceth: If the ſoul then ſeems to hang afar off, and dares not believe that Chriſt will have mercy on him, in this caſe the Spirit lets in <hi>a light</hi> into his heart, and diſcovers unto him, that God will deal graciouſly with him. It is with a ſinner, as with a man that ſits in darkneſs, haply he ſeeth a light in the ſtreet out of a window, but he ſits ſtill in darkneſs, and is in the dungeon all the while, and he thinks, <hi>How good were it, if a man might enjoy that light?</hi> So, many a poor humble-hearted broken ſinner ſeeth, and hath an inckling of Gods mercies, he heareth the Saints ſpeak of Gods love, and his goodneſs, and compaſſion; <hi>Ah</hi> (thinks he) <hi>how happy are they, bleſſed are they, what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent condition are they in? but I am in darkneſs ſtill, and never had a drop of mercy vouchſafed unto me:</hi> At laſt, the Lord ſets a light in his houſe, and puts the candle into his own hand, and makes him ſee by particular evidence, <hi>Thou ſhalt be pardoned, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The maner how <hi>the Spirit</hi> works this, is diſcovered in three paſſages:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Spirit of the Lord meeting with an humble, broken, lowly, ſelf-denying ſinner (he that is a proud ſtout-hearted wretch knows nothing of this matter) it opens the eye, and now the humbled ſinner begins to ſee (like the man in the Goſpel) ſome light and glimmering about his underſtanding, that he can look into, and diſcern the ſpiritual things of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then the Lord ſays before him all the riches of the treaſure of his grace; no ſooner hath he given him an eye, but then he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:39862:23"/>
lays colours before him <hi>(the unſearchable riches of Chriſt)</hi> that he may ſee and look, and fall in love with thoſe ſweet treaſures; <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 9.</note> and then ſaith the ſoul, <hi>O that mercy, and grace, and pardon were mine! O that my ſins were done away!</hi> the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh them that are heavy laden;</hi> then ſaith the ſoul, <hi>O that I had that refreſhing! you ſhall have reſt,</hi> ſaith God; <hi>O that I had reſt too, ſaith the ſoul!</hi> And now the ſoul begins to look after the mercy and compaſſion which is laid afore it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Spirit of the Lord doth witneſs or certifie throughly and effectually to the ſoul, that this mercy in Chriſt belongs unto him; and without this, the ſoul of an humble broken-hearted ſinner hath no ground to go unto Chriſt: what good doth it an hungry ſtomack to hear that there is a great deal of cheer and dainties provided for ſuch and ſuch men, and he have no part therein? Take a Beggar that hath a thouſand pounds told before him (he may apprehend the ſum of ſo much gold and ſo much ſilver) <hi>but what is all that to me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if in the mean time I dye and ſtarve?</hi> It falls out in this caſe with a broken-hearted ſinner, as with a prodigal childe: The Prodigal he hath ſpent his means, and abuſed his Father, and now is there a Famine in the Land, and poverty is befallen him; he knows indeed there is meat and cloaths enough in his Fathers Houſe, but (alas) what can he expect thence but his Fathers heavy diſpleaſure? if a man ſhould ſay, Go to your Father, he will give you a portion again; would he (think you) believe this? <hi>No</hi> (would he ſay) <hi>it is my Father I have offended, and will he now receive me?</hi> yet ſhould a man come and tell him, that he heard his Father ſay ſo, and then ſhew him a Certificate under his Fathers hand that it was ſo, this would ſure draw him into ſome hope that his Father meant well towards him: So it is with a ſinner when he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of all his rebellions; if a man ſhould tell ſuch a ſoul, Go to God, and he will give you abundance of mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; the ſoul cannot believe it, but thinks, <hi>What, I mercy? no, no: Bleſſed are they that walk humbly before God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their lives to his word, let them take it; but for me, it is mercy I have oppoſed, it is grace I have rejected; no mercy, no grace for me:</hi> But now if God ſend a Meſſenger from Heaven, or if it come under the hand of his Spirit, that he will accept of him, and paſs by all his ſins, this makes the ſoul grow into ſome
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:39862:23"/>
hopes, and upon this ground it goes unto the Lord: But here obſerve me, that none either in heaven or in earth, but onely Gods Spirit can make this Certificate; when it is night, all the candles in the world cannot take away the darkneſs; ſo all the means of grace and ſalvation, all the candle-light of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, they are all good helps, but the darkneſs of the night will not be gone, before <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> ariſe in our hearts. Hence it is that it proves ſo difficult a matter to comfort a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ſoul; <hi>I ſhall one day periſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I ſhall one day go down to hell:</hi> ſaith the ſoul, Let all the Miniſters under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven cry, <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye:</hi> ſtill he replyes, <hi>I mercy? and I comfort? will the Lord pardon me? It is mercy I have deſpiſed and trampled under my feet, and I mercy? no, no:</hi> Thus we Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters obſerve by experience, Some that in their own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions are gone to the bottom of hell, we make known to them Reaſons, and Arguments, and Promiſes, but nothing takes place; whats the Reaſon? O none but Gods Spirit can do it, he muſt either come from Heaven, and ſay, <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, or it will never prevail:</hi> let me ſpeak there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to you that are Miniſters, you do well to labor to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to a poor fainting ſoul, but always ſay, <hi>Comfort Lord, O Lord, ſay unto this poor ſoul, that thou art his ſalvation.</hi>

                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:39862:24"/>
                     <hi>Thou ſayeſt mercy is prepared, thou ſayeſt mercy is approaching;</hi> the ſoul ſtandeth a tip-toe, <hi>O when will it come Lord!</hi> here is the voyce of <hi>Hope; This ſinful ſoul of mine, it may through Gods mercy be ſanctified; this troubled perplexed ſoul of mine, it may through Gods mercy be pacified; this evil and corruption which harbors in me, and hath taken poſſeſſion of me, it may through Gods mercy be removed; and when will it be, Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The maner how Gods Spirit works this, is diſcerned in three particulars: 1. The Lord doth ſweetly ſtay the heart, and fully perſwade the ſoul, that a mans ſins are pardonable, and that all his ſins may be pardoned, and that all the good things he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, they may be beſtowed; this is a great ſuſtainer of the ſoul: when a poor ſinner ſeeth his ſins in their number, nature; when he ſeeth no reſt in the creature, nor in himſelf, though all means, all help, all men, all Angels, ſhould joyn together, yet they cannot pardon one ſin of his; then the Lord lifteth up his voyce, and ſaith from Heaven, <hi>Thy ſins are pardonable in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord doth ſweetly perſwade the ſoul that all his ſins ſhall be pardoned; the Lord makes this appear, and perſwades his heart that he intendeth mercy, that Chriſt hath procured par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the ſoul of a broken-hearted ſinner in ſpecial, and that he cannot but come unto it; by this means <hi>Hope</hi> comes to be aſſured, and certainly perſwaded to look out, knowing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhall be at the laſt accompliſhed: the former onely ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heart, and provoked it to look for mercy, but this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts the ſoul, that undoubtedly it ſhall have mercy: <hi>The Lord Jeſus came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt:</hi> now ſaith the broken and humble ſinner, <hi>I am loſt; Did Chriſt come to ſave ſinners? Chriſt muſt fail of his end, or I of my comfort:</hi> God ſaith, <hi>Come unto me, all you that are weary and heavy laden: I am weary, and unleſs the Lord intend good unto me, why ſhould he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite me and bid me come? ſurely he means to ſhew me mercy, nay he promiſeth to relieve me, when I come therefore he will do good unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord lets in ſome reliſh and taſte of the ſweetneſs of his love, ſome ſcent and ſavor of it, ſo that the ſoul is deeply affected with it, and carryed mightily unto it, that it cannot be ſevered; it is the letting in the riches of his love, that turneth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:39862:24"/>
the expectation of the ſoul another way, yea it turneth the whole ſtream of the ſoul thitherward.</p>

                     <hi>the day time:</hi> This is a phraſe taken from Kings and Princes, and great Commanders in the field, whoſe words of Command ſtand for Laws; ſo the Lord ſends out his <hi>loving kindeneſs,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Go out, my everlaſting love and kindeneſs, take a Commiſſion from me, and to go that humble, thirſty and hunger-bitten ſinner, and go and prosper, and prevail, and ſettle my love effectually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and faſten my mercy upon him; I command my loving kindeneſs to do it.</hi> Thus the Lord doth put a Commiſſion into the hands of his <hi>loving kindeneſs,</hi> that it ſhall do good to the poor ſoul, yea though it withdraw it ſelf, ſaying, <hi>What, I mercy? will Chriſt Jeſus accept of me? No, no; there is no hope of mercy for me: indeed if I could pray thus, hear thus, and perform Duties with that enlargement, and had thoſe parts and abilities, then there were ſome comfort, but now there is no hope of mercy for me.</hi> We demand, Is this your caſe? is it thus and thus? are you thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled? and have you thus longed for the riches of his Mercy in Chriſt? Lo then, the Lord hath put a Commiſſion into the hands of his <hi>loving kindeneſs,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Go to that poor ſoul, and break open the doors upon that weary weltering heart, and break off all thoſe bolts, and rend off that veil of ignorance and carnal Reaſon, and all thoſe Arguments: Go</hi> (I ſay) <hi>to that ſoul, and chear it, and warm it, and tell it from me, That his ſins are pardoned, and his ſoul ſhall be ſaved, and his ſighs and prayers are heard in heaven; and I charge you do the work before you come again.</hi>

                  <p>Here is the ground of <hi>Love,</hi> Gods <hi>love</hi> affecting the heart and ſetled upon it, it breeds a <hi>love</hi> to God again; <hi>We love him, becauſe</hi>

                     <hi>he loved us firſt:</hi> The burning-glaſs muſt receive heat of the beams of the Sun, before it burn any thing; ſo there muſt be a beam of Gods <hi>love</hi> to fall upon the ſoul, before it can <hi>love</hi> God again: <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man, even with the bands of love;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hoſea 11. 4.</note> God lets in the cords of <hi>love</hi> into the ſoul, and that draws <hi>love</hi> again to God: <hi>He brought me into the banqueting-houſe, and his banner over me was love; ſtay me with flaggons, comfort me</hi>

                     <hi>with apples, for I am ſick of love.</hi> When the banner of Chriſts <hi>love</hi> is ſpread over the ſoul, the ſoul comes to be ſick in <hi>love</hi> with Chriſt.</p>

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:39862:28"/>
Now this <hi>love</hi> of God doth beget our <hi>love</hi> in three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a ſweetneſs and a relliſh which Gods <hi>love</hi> lets into the ſoul, and warms the heart with; you ſhall ſee how the fire is kindled by and by: As when a man is fainting, we give him <hi>Aqua-vitae;</hi> ſo a fainting ſinner is cold at the heart, and therefore the Lord lets in a drop of his <hi>loving kindeneſs,</hi> and this warms the heart, and the ſoul is even filled with the happineſs of the mercy of God; <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles) for his love is better then wine:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 1.</note> The kiſſes of his mouth, are the comforts of his Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the ſoul ſaith, <hi>O let the Lord refreſh me with the kiſſes of his mouth, let the Lord ſpeak comfort to my heart,</hi> and this is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then wine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as that ſweetneſs warms the heart, ſo the freeneſs of the <hi>love</hi> of God let in and intimated, begins even to kindle this <hi>love</hi> in the ſoul, that it ſparkles again: God ſetteth out his <hi>love</hi> towards us, <hi>ſeeing that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us.</hi> This commends the <hi>love</hi> of God, the Lord ſends to <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8.</note> poor and miſerable, ſinful broken-hearted ſinners, and ſaith, <hi>Commend my mercy to ſuch a one, and tell him, That though he hath been an enemy to me, yet I am a friend to him, and though he hath been rebellious againſt me, yet I am a God and Father to him:</hi> When the poor ſinner conſiders this with himſelf, he ſaith, <hi>Is the Lord ſo merciful to me? I that loved my ſins, and continued in them, had it not been juſt that I ſhould have periſhed in them? but will the Lord not onely ſpare his enemy, but give his Son for him? O let my ſoul for ever rejoyce in this unconceiveable goodneſs of God!</hi> Be thy heart never ſo hard, if it have but the ſenſe of this, it cannot but ſtir thee to Humiliation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the greatneſs of the freeneſs of this mercy of God, being ſetled upon the heart, enflames it, the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> warms the heart, this <hi>freeneſs</hi> kindles the fire, and when the greatneſs of the ſweetneſs comes to be valued, this ſets the heart all on a flame; the Apoſtle deſires, that the <hi>Epheſians being rooted and grounded</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>in love, might be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth and height of the love of God in Chriſt;</hi> as if he had ſaid, The unmeaſureablenes of Gods mercy will blow up the ſoul, and enflame the heart with admirable love of God again, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:39862:29"/>
will make the ſoul ſay, <hi>What, I that have done all that I could againſt this good God? O it breaks my heart to think of it! there was no Name under heaven that I did blaspheme and tear in pieces, more then this Name; no Command under heaven I ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiſed, as the Command of God and of Chriſt; no Spirit that I grieved, ſo much as the good Spirit of God; and therefore had the Lord onely given me a look, or ſpoken a word to me, it had been an infinite Mercy, but to ſend a Son to ſave me, it is incomparable: I could not conceive to do so much evil againſt him, as he hath done good to me: O the breadth of that Mercy beyond all limits! O the length of that Mercy beyond all time! O the depth of that Mercy below a mans miſery! O the height of that Mercy above the height of my underſtanding! If my hands were all love, that I could work nothing but love, &amp; if mine eyes were able to ſee nothing but love, and my minde to think of nothing but love, and if I had a thouſand bodies, they were all too little to love that God that hath thus unmeaſureably loved me a poor ſinful Hell-hound: I will love the Lord dearly</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) O Lord my ſtrength. Have</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>I gotten the Lord Jeſus to be my comfort, my buckler and my ſhield? if I have any good, he begins it; if I have any comfort, he bleſſeth it: Therefore I will love thee dearly, O Lord my ſtrength, O how ſhould I but love thee!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Me thinks there is a poor ſincere ſoul that ſaith, <hi>My under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are not ſo deep as others, my tongue runs not ſo glib as</hi>

                     <hi>ſuch and ſuch; I cannot talk ſo freely of the things of grace and ſalvation, I have meaner parts, and cannot inlarge my ſelf in holy Duties and holy Services; I cannot dispute for a Savior, or perform ſuch Duties as others can do:</hi> yet, ſweet ſoul, canſt thou love Chriſt Jeſus, and rejoyce in him? <hi>O yes! I bleſs the Name of the Lord, that all I have, all my friends, and parts, and means, and abilities, are but as dung and droſs in compariſon of Chriſt Jeſus; it were the comfort of my ſoul, if I might be ever with him.</hi> Say you ſo? Go thy way, and the God of heaven go with thee: This is a work of God that will never leave thee, it is a badge and proper livery that the Lord Jeſus gives onely to his Saints; never a meer Profeſſor under heaven ever wore it, never any Hypocrite under heaven to whom God did intend it, but onely to thoſe whom he hath effectually called, and whom he will ſave; therefore though thou wantſt all, thou haſt this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:39862:29"/>
to comfort thee in the want of all; and thou mayeſt ſay, <hi>I can ſay little for Chriſt, my tongue faulters, and my memory is weak, yet the Lord knows I love the Lord Jeſus.</hi> This is enough, <hi>David</hi> deſired no more, but what God was wont to do to his children that loved his name, <hi>Do to me</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>as thou uſeſt to do</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 132.</note> 
                     <hi>unto thoſe that love thy name; I know thou loveſt them that love thee, and wilt ſave and glorifie them in the end, I deſire no more but this, do as thou uſeſt to do to thoſe that love thy name.</hi> And doth <hi>David,</hi> a King, deſire no more? ſure then if thou (poor ſoul) haſt ſo much as he had, it is enough, be quiet with thy childes part, <hi>Thy lot is faln into a marvellous fair ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some may ſay, this is all the difficult, How may I know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Object.</note> my <hi>love</hi> be a true love, or a falſe <hi>love?</hi> How may I know, that my <hi>love</hi> is of the right ſtamp.</p>
                  <p>Let every man put his <hi>love</hi> upon the trial, and examine thus, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether doeſt thou welcome Chriſt and grace, according to the worth of them?</hi> if thou doeſt, it will appear in theſe particulars: 1. Obſerve the root and riſe from whence thy love came, canſt thou ſay, <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath loved me? then thy love is of the right mettle, and know it for ever, that that God which cannot but love himſelf, he cannot but like that love which came from himſelf: is thy ſoul affected and enlarged in love to the Lord, becauſe thou haſt felt and retained the reliſh and ſweetneſs of his grace?</hi> canſt thou ſay, <hi>The Lord hath let in a glimpſe of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor? and the Lord hath ſaid in his truth, he looks to him that trembles at his word, the Miniſter ſaid it, and the Spirit ſaith it, that my mercy is regiſtred in heaven: Oh how ſhould I love the Lord! my ſins are many, which I have bewailed, my ſighs and ſobs I have put up to heaven, and at the laſt the Lord hath given me a gracious anſwer: Oh how ſhould I love the Lord my ſtrength dearly?</hi> If it be thus with thee, thy <hi>love</hi> is ſound, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou entertain thy Savior, as it beſeems him, thou muſt entertain him as a King, and that is thus; give up all to him, and entertain none with him upon terms of honor, but ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to him, or be attendants upon him; love all in Chriſt, and for Chriſt, but expreſs thy love and joy to Chriſt above all: He is as a King, and all the reſt are but as retainers; he that loves any thing equal with a Chriſt, it is certain he did never love
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:39862:30"/>
Chriſt; to ſet up any thing <hi>cheek by jole</hi> with Chriſt, it is all one as if a man did put a ſlave into the ſame Chamber with the King, which is upon the point to drive him away.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſoul that rightly entertains Chriſt, and ſtudies wholly to give him contentment, he is marvellous wary and watchful, that he may not ſad that good Spirit of God to grieve him, and cauſe him to go away as diſpleaſed: See this <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 4, 5. the Spouſe ſought long for her beloved, and at laſt brought him <note place="margin">Cant 3. 4, 5.</note> home, and when ſhe had welcomed him, ſhe gives a charge to all the houſe, <hi>not to ſtir nor awaken her love, till he pleaſe.</hi> When a Prince comes unto the houſe of a great man, what charge is there given to make no noiſe in the night, leſt ſuch and ſuch a man be awakened before his time? the ſoul when it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, doth thus; he gives a peremptory charge to keep watch and ward, and gives a charge to <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>deſire,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and the <hi>minde,</hi> and <hi>all,</hi> not to grieve and moleſt the good Spirit of God, <hi>Let there be no motion but to entertain it, no adviſe but to receive it, and do nothing that may work the leaſt kinde of diſlike unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. He that truly entertains Chriſt, rejoyceth in the good and glory of Chriſt: When <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> had been wrongfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to <hi>David,</hi> and when <hi>David</hi> who had taken away all the inheritance from him, was returned in ſafety; Then ſaid <hi>David</hi> to comfort him, <hi>Thou and Ziba divide the land:</hi> nay, ſaid <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth,</hi>

                     <hi>Let him take all, foraſmuch as my Lord the King is come again in peace, it matters not for inheritance, and for my ſelf and my life, I paſs not, ſith the King is returned in peace; it is enough that I enjoy thy preſence, which is better to me then goods, life or liberty:</hi> So it is with a kinde loving heart, which cannot endure to ſee Chriſts honor and glory layed in the duſt, but if his praiſe be advanced, then is he glad, <hi>Lord, I have enough</hi> (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>that Chriſt is mine, and that his honor and glory is mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, whatſoever becomes of me it matters not; let the world take all, if I may have Chriſt, and ſee him praiſed and magnified:</hi> Let this try any mans ſpirit under heaven, and labor to bring the ſoul to this pitch: A Miniſter in his place, and a Maſter in his place, and every Chriſtian in his place; let it be our care to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor God, not our ſelves; and let it be our comfort, if God may be better honored by others, then by our ſelves: This is our

baſeneſs of ſpirit, we can be content to lift up Chriſt upon our ſhoulders, that we may lift up our ſelves by it; but we ſhould be content to lie in the duſt, that the Lord may be praiſed; and if any of Gods people thrive and proſper more then thou, let that be thy joy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He that welcomes Chriſt truly, covets a neerer union with Chriſt: <hi>Love</hi> is of a linking and gluing nature, and will carry the ſoul with ſome kinde of ſtrength and earneſtneſs, to enjoy full poſſeſſion and fellowſhip of the thing that is loved; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have enough of it: <hi>Nothing</hi> (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>but Chriſt, ſtill I deſire more of that mercy, and holineſs, and grace, and love in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> As it is with parties that have lived long together in one houſe, and their affections are linkt together in way of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, they will ever deſire to be talking together, and to be drawing on the marriage; ſo the ſoul that loves Chriſt Jeſus, and hath his holy affection kindled, and his ſpirit enlarged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; when the Lord hath let in ſome glimpſe of his love, he thinks the hour ſweet when he prayed to the Lord Chriſt, he thinks the Lords-day ſweet, wherein God revealed, by the power of his holy Ordinances, any of that rich grace and mercy of his: it is admirable to ſee how the heart will be delighted to recover the time and place, and means, when and where the Lord did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it; <hi>Oh this is good</hi> (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>Oh that I might ever be thus cleared and refreſhed!</hi> Or as the ſpouſe contracted, thinks every day a year, till ſhe enjoy her beloved, and take ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her ſoul in him: So the ſoul that hath been truly humbled, and enlightened, and is now contracted to Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Oh when will that day be</hi> (ſaith it) <hi>that I ſhall ever be with my Jeſus!</hi> he takes hold of every word he hears, every promiſe that reveals any thing of Chriſt, <hi>But oh! when will that day be, that I ſhall</hi>

If all things be agreed between parties to be married, and there wants nothing but mutual affection; the only way to fix their affections upon one another, is to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany together, ſo as they meet wiſely and holily: So let the ſoul daily keep company with the promiſe, and this is the firſt way.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt deſerves our love, in regard of benefits to us; be man never ſo worthy in himſelf, yet if he have wronged, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt the part of an Enemy, a woman ſaith, <hi>I will not have him though he had all the world,</hi> this takes off the affections; it is not ſo with the Lord Jeſus: as he is worthy of all love in himſelf, ſo he hath dealt mercifully and graciouſly with you: In your ſickneſs, who helped you? in wants, who ſupplied you? in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

                  </head>
                  <p>VVE are now come to the work of the <hi>Will,</hi> which is the great wheel and Commander of the ſoul. The former affections were but as hand-maids to uſher in Chriſt and the Promiſes; the <hi>minde</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen Chriſt: Hope</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have waited: Deſire</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have longed: Love</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</hi> then ſaith the <hi>Will, I will have Chriſt, it ſhall be ſo:</hi> and this makes up the match, the ſpawn and ſeeds of faith went before, now faith is come to ſome perfection, now the ſoul repoſeth it ſelf upon the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>And this repoſing or reſting it ſelf, diſcovers a five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold act:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it implyes <hi>A going out of the ſoul to Chriſt:</hi> When the ſoul ſeeth this, that the Lord Jeſus is his ayd, and muſt eaſe him and pardon his ſins, then <hi>let us go to that Chriſt, ſaith he,</hi> it is the Lords call, <hi>Come to me all ye that are weary:</hi> now this voyce coming home to the heart, and the prevailing ſweetneſs of the call over-powering the heart, the ſoul goes out, and falls, and flings it ſelf upon the riches of Gods grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It lays faſt hold upon Chriſt:</hi> when the Lord ſaith, <hi>Come my Love, my Dove, O come away! Behold, I come</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 16.</note> ſhe) and when ſhe is come, ſhe <hi>faſteneth upon Chriſt,</hi> ſaying, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his:</hi> Faith lays hold on the Lord, and will not let Mercy go, but cleaves unto it, though it conflict with the Lord; <hi>Should he ſlay me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) yet will I truſt in him:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iob 13. 15.</note> The caſe is like <hi>Benhadads,</hi> who being overcome by <hi>Ahab,</hi> his Servants thus adviſe him: <hi>We have heard that the Kings of Iſrael</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 20. 31, 32, 33.</note> 
                     <hi>are merciful Kings, we pray thee let us put ropes about our necks,</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:39862:32"/>
                     <hi>and ſackcloth on our loyns, and go out to the King, peradventure he will ſave thy life:</hi> Thus the Servants go, and coming to <hi>Ahab,</hi> they deliver the Meſſage; <hi>Thy Servant Benhadad ſaith, I pray thee let me live:</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Is he yet alive? he is my brother: Now the men diligently obſerved whether any thing would come from him, and did haſtily catch at it, and they ſaid, Thy brother Benhadad, and they went away rejoycing:</hi> This is the lively Picture of a broken-hearted ſinner, after he hath taken up arms againſt the Almighty, and that the Lord hath let in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and he ſeeth (or hath ſeen) the anger of God bent againſt him; then the ſoul reaſons thus, <hi>I have heard, though I am a rebellious ſinner, that none but ſinners are pardoned, and God is a gracious God, and therefore unto him let me go:</hi> with this he falls down at the footſtool of the Lord, and cryes, <hi>O what ſhall I do! what ſhall I ſay unto thee? O thou preſerver of men! O let me live, I pray thee, in the ſight of my Lord!</hi> The ſoul thus humbled, the Lord then lets in his ſweet voyce of mercy, and ſaith, <hi>Thou art my Son, my Love, and thy ſins are pardoned:</hi> Theſe words no ſooner uttered, but he catcheth thereat, ſaying, <hi>Mercy Lord? and a Son Lord? and love Lord? and a pardon Lord?</hi> The heart holds it ſelf here, and will never away.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>it flings the weight of all its occaſions and troubles (guilt and corruptions) upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: He that walks in darkneſs, and hath no light, let him truſt in the name</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſaiah 50. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God;</hi> that is, if a man be in extremity, hopeleſs in miſery, and walks in deſperate diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, yea and hath no light of comfort, <hi>Let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God:</hi> As when a man cannot go of himſelf, he lays all the weight of his body upon another, ſo the ſoul goes to a Chriſt, and lays all the weight of it ſelf upon Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>I have no comfort, O Lord, all my diſcomforts I lay upon Chriſt, and I relye upon the Lord for comfort and conſolation: Who is this,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 8. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>that cometh up from the wilderneſs, leaning upon her beloved,</hi> Cant. 8. 5. The party coming is the Church, the wilderneſs is the troubles and vexations the Church meets withal, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; now the Church leans her ſelf all upon her Husband, ſhe walked along with him, but he bare all the burthen: <hi>Caſt all your care upon him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) for he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 7.</note>

                     <hi>careth for you,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. the Original is, <hi>Hurl your care upon the Lord:</hi> The Lord will not thank you for carrying your cares and troubles about you, he requires that you <hi>Hurl them upon him, for he careth for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it draws vertue, and derives power from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for ſuccor and ſupplies, and here is the eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial life of Faith, it goes for mercy, and grace, and comfort in Chriſt, he knows 'tis to be had from him, and therefore he fetcheth all from him; <hi>With joy ſhall ye draw water out of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 12. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>wells of ſalvation,</hi> Iſa. 12. 3. The fountain of Salvation is Chriſt, and all the waters of life, of grace and mercy, are in Chriſt Jeſus: Now it is not enough to let down the bucket into the well, but it muſt be drawn out alſo; it is not enough to come to Chriſt, but we muſt draw the water of grace from Chriſt to our ſelves; <hi>They ſhall ſuck and be ſatisfied</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah) with the breaſts of her conſolations, that they may milk out, and be delighted with</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 66. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>the abundance of her glory:</hi> The Church is compared to a childe, and the breaſts are the Promiſes of the Goſpel; now the Elect muſt ſuck out, and be ſatisfied with it; the word in the Original is, <hi>Exact upon the Promiſe, and oppreſs the Promiſe:</hi> as the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor grindes the face of a poor man, ſo with an holy kinde of oppreſſion, you ſhould exact from the Promiſe, and get what good you may from it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Faith leaves the ſoul with the Promiſe;</hi> yea, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all delays, denyals, diſcouragements from God, faith brings on the heart ſtill, it will be ſure to lie at the gate, and keep the ſoul with the promiſe, whatever befalls it. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent is that paſſage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 26. when the Lord and <hi>Jacob</hi> were wreſtling, <hi>Let me go, ſaith the Lord, I will leave thee to thy ſelf,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>I care not what becomes of thee;</hi> No, <hi>I will not let thee go, until thou haſt bleſſed me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob:</hi> So the faithful ſoul lays hold upon the Lord for Mercy, Pardon, Power and Grace, and though the Lord ſeem to give him up to the torment of Sin and Corruption, yet the ſoul ſaith, <hi>Though my ſoul go down to hell, I will hold here for Mercy, till the Lord comfort and pardon, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due graciouſly theſe curſed corruptions, which I am not able to maſter my ſelf.</hi> As it is with a Sun-dyal, the needle is ever moving, and a man may jog it this way and that way, yet it will never ſtand ſtill, till it come to the North-point: So when the Lord leaves
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:39862:33"/>
off a believing heart with frowns, and with the expreſſion of diſpleaſure, and the ſoul turns to the Lord Chriſt, and will never leave till it go God-ward, and Chriſt-ward, and Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſaith, <hi>Let the Lord do what he pleaſe, I will go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till he be pleaſed to ſhew Mercy.</hi> Thus the ſoul once come to Chriſt, it will never away, but ever cleaves to the Promiſe, and is towards God and Chriſt, whatſoever befalls it.</p>
                  <p>But (poor ſoul) art thou yet ſhut up in Unbelief? do then as the Priſoners in <hi>New-gate,</hi> what lamentable cryes do they utter <note place="margin">

                     <hi>ſighing of priſoners come up before thee;</hi> that indeed was meant of bodily impriſonment, yet the argument prevails much in regard of the Spiritual: <hi>Good Lord, let the ſighing of priſoners come up before thee; let the ſighing of poor diſtruſtful ſouls come up before thy Majeſty: O ſend help from heaven, and deliver the ſoul of thy ſervant from theſe wretched diſtempers of heart.</hi> Is there no cauſe thus to pray? <hi>He that believeth not</hi> (ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior) <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>is condemned already:</hi> He is caſt in heaven and earth, by the Law and Goſpel, there is no relief for him abiding in this condition; lay this under thy pillow, and ſay, <hi>How can I ſleep, and be a condemned man? What if God ſhould take away my life this night? Alas! I never knew what it was to be illightned, or wounded for ſin; I can commit ſin, and play with ſin, but I never knew what it was to be wounded for ſin; I never knew what it was to be zealous in a good cauſe; O I confeſs I have no faith at all!</hi> Beloved! would you yield this, then were there ſome hopes that you might get out of this condition and ſtate, to have a ſenſe of its want, to go to the Lord by prayer, and to ask hearty counſel of ſome faithful Miniſter, are the firſt ſteps to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. And to help a poor wretch in this caſe, O you that are gracious, go your ways home, and pray for him: Brethren, let us leave preaching and hearing, and all of us fall to praying and mourning: In truth, I condemn my own ſoul, becauſe I have not an heart to mourn for him; we reprove his ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him of his ſin; and we muſt do ſo: but where are the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:39862:34"/>
heart-blood petitions that we put up for ſuch a one? Where are <hi>the tears that we make for the ſlain of our people?</hi> You tender-hearted Mothers and you tender-hearted Wives, if your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or husbands be in this woful caſe. O mourn for them, let your hearts break over them, and ſay, <hi>O wo is me for my children, O wo is me for that poor husband of mine!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or ſecondly, haſt thou gotten faith? then labor to husband this grace well, and to improve it for thy beſt good. It is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous <note place="margin">
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. of Inſtruction.</note> ſhame, to ſee thoſe that are born to fair means (I mean the poor Saints of God) that have a Right and Title to Grace and Chriſt, and yet to live at ſuch an under-rate: I would have you to live above the world, for the Lord doth not grudge his people of comfort, but would have them live chearfully, and have ſtrong conſolations, and mighty aſſurance of Gods love: Is there not cauſe? why, faith (if it be right) will make the life of a Chriſtian moſt eaſie, moſt comfortable. Unfaithful ſouls ſink in their ſorrows upon every occaſion; but faith gives eaſe to a man in all his converſation: 1. Becauſe faith hath a skill, and a kinde of flight to put over all cares to another: We take up the Croſs, but faith hurls all the care on Chriſt; an eaſie matter it is to lie under the burthen, when another bears all the weight of it. Look how it is with two Ferry-men, the one hales his Boat about the ſhore, and cannot get off, but tugs and pulls, and never puts her forth to the Tide; the other puts his Boat upon the ſtream, and ſets up his ſail, and then he may ſit ſtill in his Boat, and the wind will carry him whither he is to go: Juſt thus it is with a faithful ſoul, and an unbeliever; all the care of the faithful ſoul, is to put himſelf upon the ſtream of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and to ſet up the ſail of Faith, and to take the gale of Gods Mercy and Providence, and ſo he goes on chearfully, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not he that carries him, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: whereas every unfaithful ſoul tugs and pulls at the buſineſs, and can finde neither eaſe nor ſucceſs; Alas! he thinks by his own wits and power to do what he would. 2. Becauſe faith ſweetens all other afflictions, even thoſe that are moſt hard and full of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs; and howſoever it apprehends all troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet withal it apprehends the faithfulneſs of God, ordering all for our good: and that's the reaſon why all our troubles are digeſted comfortably, without any harſhneſs at all: When the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:39862:34"/>
Patient takes better Pills, if they be well ſugered they go down the eaſier, and the bitterneſs never troubles him: So it is with Faith, it takes away the harſhneſs of all inconveniencies, which are bitter Pills in themſelves, but they are ſweetned and ſugered over by the faithfulneſs of God, for the good of the ſoul; and therefore it goes on cheerfully.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, if faith bring ſuch eaſe, how may a man that hath faith, improve it to have ſuch comfort by it? I anſwer, the rules are four:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Labor to gain ſome evidence to thy own ſoul, that thou <note place="margin">1 <hi>Rule.</hi>
                     </note> haſt a title to the promiſe: The reaſon why poor Chriſtians go drooping, and are overwhelmed with their ſins and miſeries, is becauſe they ſee not their title to mercy, nor their evidence of Gods love, <hi>To the word, and to the Teſtimonies:</hi> Take one evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <note place="margin">Eſay 8. 20.</note> from the word, 'tis as good as a thouſand, if thou haſt but one promiſe for thee, thou haſt all in truth, though all be not ſo fully and cleerly perceived.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Labor to ſet an high price on the promiſes of God: One <note place="margin">2 <hi>Rule.</hi>
                     </note> promiſe, and the ſweetneſs of Gods mercy in Chriſt, is better then all the honors or riches in the world; Prize theſe at this rate, and thou canſt not chooſe but finde eaſe, and be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Labor to keep thy promiſes ever at hand: what is it to me <note place="margin">3 <hi>Rule.</hi>
                     </note> if I have a thing in the houſe, if I have it not at my need? If a man ready to ſound and dye, ſay, <hi>I have as good cordial water as any in the world, but I know not where it is;</hi> he may ſound and dye before he can finde it: So when miſery comes, and thy heart is ſurcharged, <hi>O then ſome promiſe, ſome comfort to bear up a poor fainting, drooping ſoul, my troubles are many, and I cannot bear them:</hi> Why, now Chriſt and a promiſe would have done it; but thou haſt thrown them in a corner, and they are not to be found: Now for the Lords ſake let me intreat thee be wiſe, for thy poor ſoul; there is many a fainting and aguiſh fit and qualm comes over the heart of many a poor Chriſtian; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions without, and ſorrows and corruptions within, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keep thy cordials about thee, and be ſure that thou haſt them within reach, take one, and bring another, and be refreſhed by another, and go ſinging to thy grave, and to heaven for ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Labor to drink in hearty draught of the promiſe; beſtow

                     <hi>friends, and drink ye abundantly O welbeloved:</hi> The Original is, <hi>in drinking drink;</hi> ye cannot be drunken with the Spirit, as you may with wine, <hi>drink abundantly,</hi> were dainties prepared: If an hunger-ſtarved man comes in, and takes onely a bit and away, he muſt needs go away an hungred: Think of it ſadly, you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Saints of God; you may come now and then, and take a ſnatch of the promiſe, and then comes fear, and temptation, and perſecution, and all quiet is gone again, it is your own fault brethren, you come thirſty, and go away thirſty, you come diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted, and ſo you go away. Many times it thus befals us Miniſters; when we preach of conſolation, and when we pray, and confer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we think we are beyond all trouble; but by and by we are full of fears, and troubles, and ſorrows, becauſe we take not full contentment in the promiſe, we drink not a deep draught of it: of this take heed too; 1.

Of attending to the parlies of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations; if we liſten to this chat, he will make us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all our comfort.</p>

Now this growing together is accompliſhed by two means:</p>

                     <label>1.</label> By an union of the ſoul with Chriſt.</item>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, Every believer is joyned unto Chriſt, and ſo joyned or knit, that he becomes one ſpirit. 1. He is joyned; as a friend to a friend; as a father to a childe; as an husband to a wife; as a graft to a tree; as the ſoul to a body: So is Chriſt to a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:39862:35"/>
                  <hi>I live, not I, but the Lord Jeſus liveth in me:</hi> Hence the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10. 1 Cor. 12. 12.</note> of the faithful is called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 12. 2. So joyned, that the believer comes to be <hi>one ſpirit</hi> with Chriſt; this myſtery is great, and beyond the reach of that little light I injoy: Onely I ſhall communicate what I conceive, in theſe three following Concluſions: 1. That the Spirit of God (the third perſon in the Trinity) doth really accompany the whole Word, but more eſpecially the precious promiſes of the Goſpel: 2. The Spirit (accompanying the promiſe of grace and ſalvation) it doth therein, and thereby leave a ſupernatural dint and power, a ſpiritual, and over-powering vertue upon the ſoul, and thereby carries it, and brings it unto Chriſt: it is not ſo much any thing in the ſoul, as a ſpiritual aſſiſting, and moving, and working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul, by vertue whereof it is moved and carried to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 3. The Spirit of grace in the promiſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus upon the heart, it cauſeth the heart to cloſe with the promiſe, and with it ſelf in the promiſe; and this is to be <hi>one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> As it is with the Moon (the Philoſopher obſerves, That the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing of the Sea, is by vertue of the Moon) ſhe flings her beams into the ſea, and not being able to exhale as the Sun doth, ſhe leaves them there, and goes away, and that draws them, and when they grow wet, they return back again; Now the ſea ebbs and flows, not from any principle in it ſelf, but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Moon: ſo the heart of a poor creature is like the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unable to move towards heaven, but the Spirit of the Lord doth bring in its beams, and leaves a ſupernatural vertue by them upon the ſoul, and thereby draws it to it ſelf.</p>

I confeſs a godly heart wil have his fits and excurſions now and then, but all this while this is poyſon, and the ſoul of a godly man ſees this and is weary of it, and is marvellouſly burthened with it, and ſaith, <hi>O vile wretch that I am, what would I have! and what is he, that I cannot love him? Is it becauſe the good Spirit of the Lord is there? ſhall I reſiſt the good spirit of the Lord? and ſo commit the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt? away thou vile wretched heart, I will love him:</hi> Thus the ſoul labors and ſtrives for that exactneſs, and would fain have that goodneſs which he ſees in another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as there is <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt,</hi> ſo there is <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of all ſpiritual grace from Chriſt, to all thoſe that believe in him:</hi> If you would know the Tenure of this Covenant, and how Chriſt conveyeth theſe ſpiritual graces unto us, it diſcovers it ſelf in theſe Particulars: 1. There is fully enough in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for every faithful ſoul. 2. As there is enough in Chriſt, ſo Chriſt doth ſupply or communicate whatſoever is moſt fit. 3. As the Lord doth communicate what is <hi>fit,</hi> ſo he doth preſerve what he doth beſtow and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. 4. As the Lord doth preſerve what he communicates, ſo he quickens the grace that he now doth preſerve. 5. As the Lord quickens what he preſerves, ſo he never leaves till he perfects what he quickens. 6. As the Lord perfects what he quickens, ſo in the end he crowns all the grrace he hath perfected: And now may I read your Feoffment to you, You poor Saints of God, you live beggarly and baſely here: Oh! if you have a Savior you are made for ever; it is that which will maintain you, not onely Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly, but Triumphantly; what you want, Chriſt hath, and what is fit, Chriſt will beſtow; if you cannot keep it, he will preſerve it for you; if you be ſluggiſh, he will quicken it in you; what would you have more? he will perfect what he quickens; and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39862:36"/>
laſtly, he will crown that he perfects, he will give you an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Crown of Glory for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Hence we ſee whether the Saints of God ſhould go to fetch <note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 31.</note> (ſaith <hi>David) and in thy light we ſhall onely ſee light:</hi> it is not with us, but with thee; it is not in our heads, or hearts, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, 'tis onely in Chriſt to be found, onely from Chriſt to be fetched: I deny not but we ſhould improve all means, and uſe all helps, but in the uſe of all, ſeek onely to a Chriſt, with him <hi>is the well of life;</hi> away to Chriſt, wiſdom, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, &amp;c. all is in him, and there we muſt have them.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, What are the <hi>means</hi> to obtain theſe graces from Chriſt? I anſwer: Firſt, eye the Promiſe daily, and keep it within view. Secondly, yield thy ſelf, and give way to the ſtroak of the Promiſe, and to the power of the Spirit; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Imagine thy heart begins to be peſtered with vain thoughts, or with a proud haughty ſpirit, or ſome baſe luſts and privy haunts of heart, how would you be rid of theſe? you muſt not quarrel, and contend, and be diſcouraged; No, but eye the promiſe, and hold faſt thereupon, and ſay, <hi>Lord, Thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed all grace unto thy Servants, take therefore this heart, and this minde, and theſe affections, and let thy spirit frame them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right according to thine own good will; by that ſpirit of wiſdom (Lord) inform me, by that ſpirit of Sanctification (Lord) cleanſe me from all my corruptions; by that spirit of grace (Lord) quicken and inable me to the diſcharge of every holy ſervice:</hi> Thus carry thy ſelf, and convey thy ſoul by the power of the Spirit of the Lord, and thou ſhalt finde thy heart ſtrengthned and ſuccoured by the vertue thereof upon all occaſions.</p>
