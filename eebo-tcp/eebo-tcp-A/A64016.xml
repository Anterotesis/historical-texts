         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>es,</hi> with 80 or 90 Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeres more; they have fitted themselves with armour of proofe, and all other accoutrements of warre, they have beene very merry, and have drunke many healths to their good voyage, and in their cups have made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidents of the Parliament mens lands; they are very jocund, and were all aboard yesterday morning, the wind being then faire, but held but a little space, and now blowes very hard; so that God hath now stayed them. The Providence that lyes at Brill, is to take in divers of them; shee hath taken in much of their lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadge, with two great Gunnes, each 12 foot long, and shoot a bullet of 44 pounds. Also the Lyon at Helleford sluce hath taken in much luggadge, there are 3 Boyes or Hoyes lying at Tassell, laden with arms and 38 Cases of armour shipped in <hi>Richard Lyndall</hi> of Hull, bound for London, I heare they be all mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; and there are in that ship 700 Corslets, besides
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65576:4"/>
this, I was tould by one whose sonne sits in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomehouse, all these shipped here by a warrant which they had obtained for 700 Cases which a Merchant in this Towne saw and tould, hee besides one of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomehouse did confesse it true. They give out diverse reports of staying of armes, and of their declining their voyage. But wee knowing their endeavour to worke with all deceivablenesse, think them only tricks to confound our intelligence; for wee see such as are laden here, are not stayed. Indeed for certaine the States Generall have given out a warrant of stay for armes; But so they did when all the armes provided against the Scots were transported; the Officers are corrupted. There is a Boyer lying within a mile of this Towne to bee fraughted with horse for P. <hi>Robert,</hi> a Merchant of this Towne saw the Shippers Charter party, which is, that he carry them to what part shall be appointed by him betweene Dover and Newcastle; The Prince undertakes his safe-convoy out, and home, and <hi>Isaack Light</hi> a Merchant of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny here, hath bought 600 pound worth of pouder, and much match, where it is shipped, we cannor yet heare,; they worke with much privacy. Monday last, there came a jewell from the Hage valewed at 40000 Guilders by the Jewellers, they were offered 10000 Guilders upon it, but would not, and so it was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe. We cannot heare of any further pawning of the jewels, nor where they be, Master <hi>Webster</hi> went with Sir <hi>William Boswell</hi> to the Queene Monday last.
