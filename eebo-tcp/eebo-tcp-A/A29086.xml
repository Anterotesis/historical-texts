            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Wisedome of Gods Counsels is far above the prudence of men, who are altogether void of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his grace. One sort, who know neither God, nor his providence, look upon all the events of humane life, as if they happened by chance. They imagine that that which we call good luck, or ill luck, hath no other cause than hazard, and that which every mans prudence or imprudence brings to the conduct of his life. Others, who acknowledge a Divine providence, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102273:3"/>
onely after the manner that God hath manifested it to the world by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions and judgements of his Law, think that all the goods, which heap prosperities upon them, are the effects and testimonies of the favour where with God cherisheth those that are his; And that the Ils, that oppress mans life with miseries, are arguments of the anger and hatred of God upon those he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles after that manner. But Christians, to whom God hath revealed by the Gospel the counsel of his mercy in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, know, that in his Cross, on which for satisfying the Justice of of the Law, he hath bore the pain of our sinnes, he hath changed, for those he calls to his Communion, the use of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. And that he imployes them first to humble them, and acknowledge their sin, that they may desire delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to the end they may come by this way to the Faith of his grace, which doth deliver them. And when they are entred into Communion with him by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102273:3"/>
faith, and that the exercise of the same afflictions accomplisheth in them the work of his grace, in giving them, by his consolation, in their patience, the hope of the glorious happiness which he hath promis'd them, and which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over all their affections to the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him. Those therefore that have this faith and this hope, are of a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment far differing from the opinion of men of the world, upon the event of Goods and Evils which accompany mans life.</p>
                  <p>Considering, Sir, the present fortune of your serene Majestie, far removed from the Majestick condition of your Birth, I humble my self with you in the sight of the powerful hand of God, who is the onely Judge, and onely Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Monarchs, to ascend by the steps, whereto the Gospel addresses us, even into the counsel of his infinite mercy. And I find there, that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster of this great calamity, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons you, is a work of the wisdome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102273:4"/>
of the King of Kings, who will shew in you, whom he hath honoured with his Unction, and his Image, an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effect of his grace and of his power. I say, Sir, that under the Cloak of so many sad adventures, which try you by revolutions so strange, that all the <hi>Universe</hi> doth tremble, the King of Heaven, and of the Earth, who hath humbled himself for you, infinitely more low than you are, draweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self near unto you. He comes to take you by the hand, not onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

It is very easy for me, Sir, to give you a reason of this judgement I make of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> of God upon your sacred Person, and to explicate unto you, not onely the causes and effects of the ill which is come upon you, but also the way, the use, and the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102273:4"/>
success of the remedy, which the hand of God will give you, to accomplish in you this work of his mercy. If we seek the Cause for which we behold that the hand of God hath made it self so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously heavy upon the sacred head of the King your Father, and which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues yet after him your Royal Person with so many sinister accidents, which hath caused this great desolation to come upon all your Kingdomes, this confusion, and this subversion of their peace and former prosperity, this change into which they are so blindly precipitated, to part with the form of Government that God had establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst them, under which they had lived so happily for so many Ages past, to become slaves of the yoke which the armed hand of a Tyrant hath put upon their head under the false name of Liberty, it will be very easy for us to find the Cause, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it by the Effects.</p>
                  <p>You are not ignorant, Sir, and all the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102273:5"/>
world knows it with you, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for which this Paricidal Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath so cruelly persecuted the King your Father, hath been the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Government, of which they desired to change the form, by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing Episcopacy, and suppressing the Liturgie, and the Ceremonies, by which the Protestants of your Kingdome had yet retained some image of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. Those, which they call Puritans and Presbyterians, who would live under the form of the Genevian Discipline, could not endure the form of that Antient Order, which the Royal Authority had retained as instituted by Divine Authority, and for this very thing necessary for its conformity, to preserve in Christian Estates the form of a Monarchical Government. From thence it is come, that the Puritan and Presbyterian Faction hath conceiv'd, and alwaies kept in its breast an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable hatred against Monarchical Government, by reason of their aversion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102273:5"/>
from the Episcopal. That which the prudence of King <hi>James,</hi> your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Grandfather, Sir, having judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously taken notice of, did as wisely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his posterity, by an express Book, to take heed of it. And this King knowing Church, as well as State mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, foreseeing the inconvenience that might arise, expressing from his mouth that which touched him at the heart, had this familiar speech, <hi>No Bishop, no King;</hi> which is become a lamentable Prophesie under his Successour. But, O good God! what Successour? Such an one certainly, that had neither cause nor pretext capable to stir up the hatred of Subjects against a King so merciful, so just, and so loyal, so amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his People, so venerable to his Neighbours, that upon this onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judication, wherein the Puritan Faction had instructed them, in making them believe, that under that Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Antient Service, the King and the Bishops had an intention
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102273:6"/>
to re-establish in the Realm the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion. This is the poyson, which the Puritan Faction hath blown into the hearts of the People, to fill them with hatred against a King so love-worthy.</p>
                  <p>And this Republican Parliament, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to erect it self in a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Authority, by annihilating that of the King, hath not thought any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion more favourable to their design, than to act the Puritan, that they might come to the execution of their desires: which they have done at last by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Paricide of their Archbishop and of their King. This was, Sir, the grand work of mans malice, and the Devils stratagem, which caused the ils which are fallen upon your Crown and Person, by the pitiful fate of that succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which ought to have befallen you. But the Justice and Wisdome of God in this conjuncture, hath other ends. Every one knows that this Archbishop, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ourished in the Schism from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102273:6"/>
Church, had no other thought no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> inclination, than to re-unite in one body the People divided into Sects among themselves, as well as from the Church, and to make himself Chief Head of this Schismatical Body.</p>
                  <p>And we see God hath permitted, that his own People, divided against it self, hath caused his Head to be cut off.</p>
                  <p>The King otherwise accomplished in all royal and moral virtues, did use in the Schism, by the Law of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours, the Authority which God had given him in temporal matters, for governing of spiritual, and called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Head. It is for that reason, that God chastizing in his person the fault of his Predecessours, would let us know by the tragical spectacle of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Death, in a King no less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent than lawful, that so strange an effect of his anger hath had no other cause than to instruct all other Princes that are in the Schism, with what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102273:7"/>
God will revenge his glory, for their injuring the Unity and Authority of his Church.</p>
                  <p>But if such is the Effect of Divine Justice and Wisdome in the cause of your misfortune, Sir, his Mercy goes far before it; and this is the effect that concerns you. For God makes it here plainly appear unto your Majestie, that the Reformation, which the Authors of the Schism in this latter age have pretended to make, hath been (under the pretext of so good an outside) no othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> thing in effect than the entire ruine as well of the Faith, and form of the Church, as of the Order it self instituted by God for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men. This is the Lesson which God sets before your eyes, in the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of this sad Revolution, which hath given you a wound, the feeling whereof is to be your instruction. You shall see, Sir, through all the circumstances of these tragical effects which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the trouble, and changed the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102273:7"/>
form of your Estates, and which have ravished from you the Crown: That the new Religion which your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours embraced after the Schism, is the onely efficient cause, by the very maxims, and foundations of the design, which its Authors have called the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Their new opinions did very easily sside themselves under this apparent co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, through the clefts of the Schism into the spirit of the Bishops, who made themselves culpable. But neither they themselves that received this novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor the Kings that authorized them, did think, they should charge themselves with <hi>Uria</hi>'s packet, which would abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish both the authority of the Bis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ops, and the Sovereignty of Kings. For men are alwaies blind in the works of Darkness, which they do by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of the Devil, who goes disguizing himself into an Angel of Light, that he may induce them for to commit them. And their passions which do blind them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102273:8"/>
do insensibly draw them into precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of mis-haps, whereof neither the extraordinary steepness nor depth is by them discerned.</p>
                  <p>Certainly whosoever should have demanded of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> himself, and <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> who carried <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Reformation into <hi>England,</hi> if they went to bring in the Brownists opinions, who by maxims receiv'd from their hands, did a little after think upon a more exact purity, by the motions which they suppose the Holy Ghost suggests unto them, from whence it is that they esteem themselves more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Puritans? Whosoever like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise should have enquired of them, if they came to tell them they might be of what Religion they pleas'd, and for the extinction of all Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, of all rule and form of a common Faith, according to the opinion of the Independents?

The Bishops that receiv'd this Reformation saw not that of it would be bred the Sect of the Presbyterians, Enemies to the Hierarchy of the Church, and all the Order of its institutions, as well for the Service as for the Government, and

This Religion, for which the Bishops, the Kings, and the People have forsook the Church, hath destroyed the Bishops, and the Kings, and reduced the People to live without Bishops, without Kings, without a Form of Government, and without Discipline in Religion, under the Tyrannie of a Monster, who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being either King or Bishop, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to himself all Authority both in State and in Religion. This which I declare unto your Majestie, Sir, is, to make you understand, that this terrible work of the hand of God, which afflicts you after this manner, is nevertheless a judgement of his mercy for you: For you may see he sends you not this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that you may perceive the sin,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102273:11"/>
whereof it is the off-spring, that you may draw your self from the one and from the other, by the knowledge which he gives you of the horrour you should have for the Cause, by the grief you resent by its Effect. You shall see it, Sir, clearly enough by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of the Maxims upon which the Authors of the Reformation which your Fathers embraced, have laid their Foundations.</p>
                  <p>The Foundations of the Reformation of <hi>Calvin</hi> are laid upon these two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims, which he, and all those which have forsook the Church, as himself, hath delivered as indubitable to the People which have followed him: The first is, <hi>That the Church was fallen into ruine and desolation, by Errour in its Faith, by Idolatry in its Service, and by Tyrannie in its Government.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>That to reform and re-establish it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For they could not deny the Church from which they separated, the Title of the True Church, but in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing of it, as they have done, of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, Idolatry, and of Tyrannie. And if we suppose this accusation for true, they could not bring in the necessity of a Separation, to make their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in excluding the Authority of Tradition, and the Judgement of the Church, and by reducing the rule of the Reformation to the Scripture it self, interpreted by every mans Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Your Majestie, Sir, shall now see, that of those Maxims which the Bishops of your Realm (already become Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks) receiv'd for the causes of the Reformation which they admitted, there was first of all Formed the Sect of Puritan-Presbyterians, against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant-Episcopalians, who could not subsist against them, upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of these Maxims. And that at length the Brownists, the more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Puritans, did raise themselves upon the same Foundations, who have since begot the Independents for the ruine of the Presbyterians, by the same reasons by which the others had ruined the Protestants and Episcopacy, and with Episcopacy Royalty it self: In such sort, that all this dreadful disorder, which makes your Kingdoms to be a <hi>Chaos</hi> of lamentable disorder, in which your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority finds it self put out, comes from these Principles of Reformation, which are the natural source thereof.</p>
                  <p>That this is so, your Majestie, Sir
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102273:12"/>
may clearly perceive it. When the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops consented to these Principles of Reformation, they abandoned by them the Faith of the Catholick Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sacrifice of the Mass; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Transubstantiation in the holy Eucharist; concerning the number and vertue of the seven Sacraments; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Justification real and inherent in the faithful, and of their Merits, and the Invocation of Saints; concerning Prayer for the Dead, and of Purgatory; concerning the Authority of the Pope, and of the adhering of all the Faithful to the See of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> But they retain, nevertheless, the Episcopal Dignity and Authority, with a part of the Liturgie, and Ceremonies of the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>But the Puritan-Presbyterians have cast away all Form of Hierarchy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the Liturgie and Ceremonies with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as pernicious remainders of the Papal Tyrannie and Idolatry, as they call them. That they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102273:13"/>
might oppose both Parties, according to the first Maxim of their Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they brought in a Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment altogether novel, and composed a Form of Service altogether new. Upon which they have had so much advantage against the Protestants in combating them with the reasons of their common Principles, and in stirring up the People heated with the zeal of Reformation, that it was impossible for them to subsist if the Puritans could but once be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, by the Authority of Parliament, against the Authority of the King, who onely did support the Protestant Cause, not by arguing, but by command. For Controversy, by their Principles, was all for the Puritans against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</p>
                  <p>Could they, without Tradition, and by the holy Scripture alone, interpreted by the judgement of every one, find Episcopal Dignity, and its Authority, with distinction, and superiority of power above the other Pastors and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters?
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102273:13"/>
They could certainly, without doubt, by the Authority of the holy Scripture, assisted by Tradition, which declares the lawful sense. But in doing this, the victory which it gives them, obligeth them to consent likewise to the Authority, and Primacy of the Pope, for the Government of the Universal Church, as founded in the Primacy St. <hi>Peter</hi> receiv'd in the College of the Apostles, as well for the Form of the Government of the Universal Church, as of every particular Church, from whence every Bishop derives his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Then thus it must be, either that the Protestants abandon Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy as a seed of Tyrannie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Presbyterians; or, in retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, to enter again into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Pope, and Bishops who adhere to him. Though there be no need to speak here, that their sole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision makes it impossible for them to subsist, by the reason which the great Bishop and Martyr, St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102273:14"/>
to all Bishops, in declaring the obligation they have strongly to retain the Unity of the Church, by the not to be divided Unity of Episcopacy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of every one doth solidly possess his share. Upon which he admonisheth them, that if any one goes to separate himself, it shall happen unto him, as to a Beam drawn from the body of the Sun, which shall have no more part, through its division, in the unity of the light which continues in the body. As to a Bough broken from the Tree, which shall spring no more, having no more share in the sap which remains in the body and in the root of the Tree. Even like a Rivolet, cut off from the Fountain, which will dry up, having no more to do with the course of the water which runs from the Spring. This is that also, Sir, which your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops cannot avoyd. It must be, that being separated from the Mother-Church, they should be extinguished, and should vanish away, as its come to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102273:14"/>
pass. It must be, that their very pain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>hier errour. That their Reformation made them lose their Form.</p>
                  <p>But if the Puritans have had this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon the Protestants, by the Common Principles of their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that which the same Principles have given the Brownists, to withdraw themselves from the Puritans of the Genevian Discipline, in the more exact purity, which their spirit, Interpreter of the sense of the Scripture, suggests unto them, is yet more great. Behold how they combat the one party against the other, and the victory of the last. The Puritans of the Genevian Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline have determined of Articles of Faith, and have form'd their Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to which they oblige all those that receive their Communion. But this Law, which prescribes by Authority a common belief among all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, cannot agree with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>at every Believer can and ought
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102273:15"/>
to make of the sense of the Scriptures, by the assistance of the Holy Ghost, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the second common Maxim of their Reformation. For if one sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses it true, no other Authority can bear rule over the Conscience, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it any thing beyond the sense that the Spirit suggests to it in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting of the Scripture. Upon which the Brownists also set upon the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians by all the same Authorities, upon which they have founded theirs, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themselves from the Church, and abandon its determinations. They maintain, That to oblige the Faith of faithful men to a formular confession, which can have no other than an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority, is to bring them forthwith under the Papal Tyrannie, from which the Holy Ghost hath freed them. Against this the Calvinists have no reply, which doth not wound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with their own hands, and which is not their condemnation pronounced by themselves. For they can answer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102273:15"/>
pertinently, if they do not borrow the reasons the Church hath against them. So God, perpetual Protector of his Church, causes her Enemies to pronounce her Victory with their own mouths: whilst that they issued from the teeth and the mouth of the Serpent, to make war with her, do wage it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, and kill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>From these Brownists, as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, Sir, knows much better, are come the Independents, which are not risen, but since the advantage the Puritan-Presbyterians had upon the Protestants, by the Authority of the Parliamentiers. It is those that have produced this false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prophet of blood and slaughter, to end this last Act of Infernal Reformation, that he himself preaches to his Musul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, with his Sword in his hand, after he hath broke the Cross, and changed the Episcopal <hi>Crosier</hi> into a Murtherer's <hi>Axe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this same spirit of the Brownists,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102273:16"/>
in which he hath been originally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, by using Disputes he deduces Fundamental Maxims of the common Reformation among them, he wars against the Presbyterians with much more advantage than he did against the Protestants. From whence he promises himself to make them all submit to his opinion, which is an indifference of all opinion of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Which shall fall out without doubt according to his own mind, if they will follow the Consequences of their own Maxims: For the reason of which, he gives liberty to every man to believe and prophesie that which they think the Spirit suggests to them. But he thinks in making these People, separated from the Church, taste the Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, he shall rally all their different Sects into one Body, to set them against the Body of the Catholick Church, to the end he may destroy the Pope, and the Bishops that conduct her, and may exterminate the Kings that defend her.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102273:16"/>
He calls that, the great work of God. He assures the success to all them that follow him, by the revelations which he makes them believe he had at his Fasts, his Prayers, and his reading the holy Scriptures. But it is no marvel he can assemble such a number of Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by the arguing of their Maxims: For since they had already produced these different bodies of reform'd Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions, and reforming, even to infinity, Protestants, Presbyterians, and Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, who in a perpetual war cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree among themselves; He comes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as more fit to serve himself of their Maxims, to put them to the <hi>Ho there,</hi> by the indifference, and by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing all Lawes that rule upon the Conscience, and leaving every mans thoughts free, and the liberty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie and interpret the Scriptures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sense his spirit dictates to him. For, as to the remainder, he trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles not himself to see by this spirit, the prodigious number of Sects and Insects

Sir, Had your Majestie taken notice of the imposture and deceit which the Father of Lyes hath hidden under these Baits, that they themselves, whom he made the first Instruments and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the division of the Church, did not perceive, for they would have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred it had they known it would have been such? This is then truly the great work of God, whereof this false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet understands not the reason, when he speaks thus: God hath certainly done this work: And God hath raised him up himself, to put this confusion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them which have forsaken the Unity of the Church, in dividing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a thousand Sects, of which they acknowledge at present, that no

one can call himself the Church. For the Sect of the Protestants cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, since she her self subsists no more: but that every one sees her just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perished, by the same Maxims that separated her from the Church; and that the Presbyterians, which seduced them, have now destroyed them. Nor the Sect of the Presbyterians, which is under the yoke of the Independents, who cut their throats with the same Swords wherewith they warred against the Church: For they brought them, by their own Maxims, to renounce all Discipline, all Government, all Law, and all Rule of Unity, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence all Form of the Church.

                  <p>That which you have singular in this cause, is, by being the greatest King of the party divided from the Church, and that your Kingdomes are the greatest and most flourishing Estate that hath receiv'd this novelty of Religion, where she hath found the most powerful San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and where she hath planted her seat the most eminent, and most assured; This is likewise a reason why God hath put her into this confusion, in destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her by the different Sects which she her self hath ingendred, that all the world may know the spirit of errour, from whence she hath taken her Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
                  <p>For all the world at present sees what this spirit is, and its nature, if it is the

There's no more need of Disputes, or Arguments to convince it: She is convinc'd by her self, according to the character the Spirit of God hath stamp'd upon the Heretical man, by the Pen of the Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who commands us to depart for these reasons: There is, saith he, a perverted spirit, that is condemned by it self.

                     </gap> that all the world doth see at present in this Reformation, and its Genius.</p>
                  <p>But there rests now one thing to do
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102273:21"/>
which is, to apply this remedy of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the Conscience of the People seduced by the errour. There is no more to do than to anoint the wound the Scorpion hath made with the oyl where it hath been bruised. For the way to heal them is now very easy, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son their Reformation hath receiv'd such a miserable success. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more easy than to make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple know thereupon by the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Pastors, upon the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and Maxims of their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they have neither Church nor Faith: But then when they supposed (contrary to the promise of Jesus Christ) the Church was fallen into ruine, for pretext of reforming it, they have not been able to form an other, which hath the conditions of the true Church, but an infinity of different and contrary Sects among them, none of which can be the Church; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the authority of Tradition for interpreting the Scripture, and the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102273:22"/>
judgement of the Church for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of her Faith, They have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned the Unity of the Faith, that every one might abound in his own sense, by the different opinions they have conceived. That which of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity must cast them, as it is come to pass, into the Independence of all rule, and the indifference of all opinion in Religion.</p>
                  <p>And as modesty to accuse the Church of Errour in all the Ages, hath been the beginning to make the Authors of this Reformation agree, that the Church remained pure in Faith during the time of the four first general Councils; they have afforded us a way by this to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuse the People, they do abuse, when they accuse the Church at this day of Errour in the heads of her Faith, which they have rejected. For they can no longer avoyd falling into a manifest contradiction of the sense which they impute to the antient Fathers in points of Faith, which are in controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102273:22"/>
us. They cannot brand the Church at this day for having a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinion in Faith from the Antient Church, without cutting their throats with their own proper contradictions, upon the opinion they attribute to the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>So that there is nothing more to do for the informing the People, separated from the Church, of the truth, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging them to enter again into her, than to make them understand the cheat wherewith they have been surprized under the name of Reformation, by convincing, in their presence, their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, of an evident contradiction of themselves, by the consequences of the Fundamental Maxims of their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.

                  <p>Your Majestie, Sir, may easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the King your good Brother and Friend, that they be called, by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to come (with all those of their Communion wherewith they would be assisted) and appear in presence of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur the Archbishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur his Coadjutor, and the Catholick Doctors, which he shall please to bring with him. And there, Sir, you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie being present, to speak and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer with all security and liberty, that

which their spirit and conscience doth suggest to them upon the evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions of the principles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of their Reformation, that, in all their different Sects which have for saken the Church under this pretext, there is neither Church nor Faith. And that, upon the Points of Faith, where they have accused the Church of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and have taken the opportunity to separate themselves from her, they are likewise separated from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of all Ages. So that they cannot any waies accuse us of diversity of opinion with the Antient Church, but that they again fall into an evident contradiction of themselves, as well as of the Antient Fathers, and of us.</p>
                  <p>These Ministers, Sir, will deny nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the desire of your Majestie, nor the Commandment of the King your good Brother, to render the duty both to their charge and to their conscience, unless they'll wirness, by their denial,

                  <p>But they'll love rather (as I think) ingenuously to present themselves, to yield to the truth, which they cannot contradict, than to incurr the blame of being acknowledged formal enemies of the peace and re-union of the Church, through the perversness of an obstinate Faith. I know not what to think, that they should rather love to fling themselves headlong, with their people, into the confusion and disorder of Independency, and indifference of all opinion in Religion, than to avouch the errour and blindness of those who were the first Egressors from the Church by these Maxims, which have cast, by their consequenc s, their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers into this abyss of irreligion, whereinto we see them at this present fallen.</p>
                  <p>And when the Ministers would let

themselves be carried away to so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky a thought, I do no waies believe that in <hi>France</hi> the People would follow them, and adhere to their opinions.</p>
                  <p>This is wherefore, Sir, I dare hope that the Ministers which are in <hi>Paris,</hi> being obliged by the desire of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, and the will of their Sovereign, to submit to this Law, which their own Conscience imposes on them for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of their own People (for the People will have no less affection, and will be no less desirous to see the success of the appearance of their Ministers, and the answer they shall make) will yield to it, and will rather choose to walk in the way of honour, and a good conscience, than basely to appear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors, at one and the same time, both of their Cause, and good Faith.</p>

                  <p>And being not able to deny, that the whole Antient Church did solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer the Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ to God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to his institution, in the holy Eucharist, they also cloak their difference in this subject, from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church, and from us, with this, That the Antient Church did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (as they presume) Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation with us, nor by consequence the Sacrifice, as we do, saying, That to this subject, as they reject in our belief Transubstantiation, so they have for the same reason likewise abolished the Sacrifice, which the Church celebrates at this present. I have made it evident, Sir, that the Faith of the Church at this day is conformable to the Antient upon this change, in a Book which I have published against the defences
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102273:28"/>
brought by Minister <hi>Aubertin</hi> upon the passages of the holy Fathers, in his Book of the Eucharist.</p>
                  <p>I have reduced the demonstration of the Truth to this point, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the holy Fathers have believed, that by the change, which interposes it self in this Sacrament, there is rendred, the same Flesh, and the same Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, received by the mouths of Believers, whereof Jesus Christ speaks in St. <hi>John,</hi> where he commands us to eat and drink them, that we may have eternal life. The Minister hath not been able to contradict this truth, but in formally contradicting the sense which the Authors of his opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, have attributed to the Fathers, as conformable to them, and in making the sense of the Fathers formally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of Jesus Christ, and that which he attributes to them formally contrary to the true sense which they have and do declare in clear and express
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102273:28"/>
words. I have convinced him by the proof of an evident demonstration in this little Treatise. And if he be called to answer upon this conviction, the Truth will be found to be victorious, either by his good or his evil Faith. And as their Consciences tell them, and bite them for having introduced, by their Reformation, all Opinions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually contrary to the Faith of the Church of all Ages. When they see themselves reduced to this extremity, they cast themselves into the retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Fundamental Maxims, which is to admit of no rule of Faith, but that of the Scripture, interpreted by every mans reason. Upon that I have convinced them by a Demonstration without Reply, that by the design of their Reformation, founded upon the use of this rule, they have lost both the Church and Faith. Which they must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch if they be called to answer there, or that the Truth shall conserve its
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102273:29"/>
advantage by the refusal they shall make.</p>
                  <p>I most humbly intreat your Majestie, Sir, that you will be pleased to let this little work have the glory to appear to the World under your Royal Name, for a prop which will be able to serve your Faith, as an Instrument of the Truth, the Victory whereof ought hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to gain you to the Church: And by gaining you, to bring with you her Peace, and re-union of all the Parties that are divided from her. For assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly this grace of Heaven is not far from us, if we our selves do not draw our selves back.</p>
                  <p>And I am certain, that if it please the prudence of the Bishops, which the Holy Ghost hath established for the conduct of the Church (as I hope they will be pleased) to serve themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the People that have abandoned their <hi>Crosier,</hi> of the way that I propose and present to your Majestie, they shall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102273:29"/>
see, without much pain, and in a little time, the strayed Sheep returning to them, by the very hand of those which keep them withdrawn from their Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds. For in effect, when the evidence of this demonstrated Truth shall once have taken its place (by the sweetness of the amiable conferences, where she ought to be treated with all sincerity and liberty) in the spirit of all our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Brethren, as well Ministers as People, they will consent with joy to re-enter into the Catholick Church. So much the more willingly, that by the reasons of the truth of her Faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged conformable to the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all Ages, they shall so acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge her in all her parts, to be the True Seed from which the Holy Spirit hath caused Piety and Charity to spring, flourish and fructifie in Believers.</p>
                  <p>From whence it follows by the same reason, that the true and lawful Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which all good men of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102273:30"/>
Church desire in the Church, doth depend no otherwise than upon the understanding and practice of these same Truths, by the duty to which they address all Believers, in the different vocations whereto God calls them. In all which, the end which is proposed them, is no other than to live united among them, and with Jesus Christ, by the grace of the Holy Ghost, to serve God under the obedience of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which he hath put into the hands of the Bishops, which feed the Flock with an unanimous consent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Authority of the espe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ial Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> established at <hi>Rome</hi> by two Principals of the Apostles, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> from which whosoever separates himself, is a Schismatick, and out of the Communion of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, Sir, I am imboldened to speak for this last time to your Majestie, that as you may if you will, by the way which I propose to you, lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102273:30"/>
of this work, by your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and entrance into the Catholick Church: You will find also, that the success shall be, in the hand of God, the indubitable way of re-establishing you in your Throne. Certainly all will agree with me, that this work is upon such conditions, that if it had receiv'd its accomplishment in <hi>Paris,</hi> with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and People separated from the Church, there's no place in all <hi>France</hi> wherein they would refuse to do the like.</p>
                  <p>And if once the love of the Peace, and re-union of the Church, had thus gained the heart of our separated Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which are in this Kingdome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging in this manner, that the onely safe and necessary Reformation ought to be this, which, by the truth of the definitions of the Faith of the Church, in her Doctrine, in her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and in her Government, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish a Christian life among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102273:31"/>
the other People and Pastors (and the Pastors for the love, and by the very motion of the People) which are in the same Communion in other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> will without doubt do the same thing.</p>
                  <p>Think you, Sir, that if your Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and those which are in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> faithful and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate to your Crown and Person, seeing the success of this project hapned in <hi>France,</hi> to which your Conversion shall have given the beginning and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they will resist the call of the same grace, and that they can be able to find in their hearts, in their mouths, and in their hands, either reason, or means, for to hinder themselves to follow that, which all those of their Communion shall have done here? And after this will you doubt, that the blessing of God, who is never wanting to his promises, will not accomplish in you fully that which he hath promised to those that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102273:31"/>
believe in him, by the mouth of his own Son, when he tels them, <hi>Search the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and his righteousness, and all things shall be added unto you?</hi> Will you doubt, that in thus searching of his Kingdome, you shall not find also your own? And that Heaven will not likewise render unto you, upon the Earth, this temporal recompence, for a token of that you shall have sought, and which you shall receive in Heaven for eternity?</p>
                  <p>Yes, Sir, the Word of God deceives no man; it is more firm and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable than the Heaven and the Earth; for the one and the other shall vanish away, but one sole Iota of the Word uttered from the mouth of the Son of God, shall not pass away. When I tell you these things, founded upon the Truth which he hath spoken unto us, believe that this is he himself that addresses them to you by my mouth. It is he himself that calls you. It is he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102273:32"/>
himself that stretcheth forth his hand towards you. It is he himself, that by his hand hath conducted you, for this end, to the place where you are. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect again your self upon all the thoughts of your heart, since the time your Majestie parted from hence, to the time your Majestie returned back.</p>
                  <p>Think upon all that you have been willing to do, and upon all that which it hath pleased God to do with you: For he hath done all the things, both what you see and what you suffer, upon your Person and upon your Estate.</p>
                  <p>He hath put you into the Estate you are, to make you understand his voyce, and for to oblige you to say to him, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou that I do?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have thought to be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ascend upon your Throne, by the means of those of your Subjects, who appear'd to retain for you, and for your Crown, that fidelity to which a more antient Bond held them obliged more straitly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102273:32"/>
than all others. God would not have it so. They had a design to bind your Conscience to the Lawes of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, by an oath to observe the conditions of their Covenant, and by abjuring your opinions, that drew more near the Catholick Religion.</p>
                  <p>They hoped by this means, that in conserving upon your head some Form, at least apparent, of the Royal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under which they had so happily obeyed your Fathers for so many Ages, they should avoyd the falling under the slavage of the Tyrannie which is called <hi>Cromwel's Commonwealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that they should defend by this way the factiousness of their Religion from giving place to his Independency, What is it come to? God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all their Counsels. He hath routed all their Armies by the Arm of this False-prophet, by whose mouth he convinces, and confounds in the face of their Ministers, by mouth and by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102273:33"/>
the rules of their Covenant, by the proper Maxims of their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God hath delivered them into his hands, and imposed upon them the yoke of his absolute domination. They must now submit to the Lawes of his Independency, and of his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the name whereof serves for a Masque to his Tyrannie.</p>
                  <p>But God hath delivered you, Sir, and by a conduct of his Providence, full of trembling and admiration, he hath withdrawn your Sacred Person from a thousand dangers, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it from the fury and cruelty of this Monster, who spared neither the force of Iron, nor the value of Gold, to find the means of violently taking away your life. You have seen, Sir, the anger of God to descend upon your head, who according to the terms of the Scripture, hath loosned the Belts of Kings, and bound their Reins with Cords.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:102273:33"/>
You have seen his Arm armed with his rage, to defeat your Armies. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating at their head you have done bravely, with your hand, and with your courage, all that the generosity of a valiant and magnanimous Prince could do, to associate Victory to the justice of your Arms. You have there shed your Blood, and seen that of your faithful Subjects to stream through the fields covered with their bodies.</p>
                  <p>Your valour, and their unfearful hearts, had for a time gotten the advantage of the great number of your Enemies, who saw themselves ready to turn their backs: But the chance of Arms turning in an instant for them, this ill hap, fatal to your Crown ravishd from you in this last Conflict, according to humane appearance, both the way, and hope of recovering it. But God hath waies unknown to men; and his waies are not our waies. It is in our weakness that he magnifies his strength,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102273:34"/>
and in our lowliness that he makes his height to be seen.</p>
                  <p>Then when you were thus deprived of your Forces, and all humane means of safety taken from you, he came to you under another visage, and armed you with a sense of hardiness, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which was above the spirit of a man, for the Party which you made choyce of for your security. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd with your self to seek it, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing your sole Person in the solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness of waies, and in the desert of Forrests, to the hazard of a thousand sad Accidents; after you had hidden all the Marks of that Majestie which is born with you, under a form borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the most base condition, that the eyes of the People, which owe you after God the second homage, might not know what you truly were. You have passed after this manner, without astonishment, and without fear, across a thousand objects, which the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102273:34"/>
at every step presented to you. It is there, where you acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God had incamped his Angels about you, for your guard, and for your defence. It is there, where he made a simple Peasant, and an infirm Woman, the very Angels of his assistance, for to be your guide: giving to the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the one, and to the frailty of the other, prudence and resolution ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to conduct you, with as much judgement as sincere loyalty, and to bring you, as a stranger and unknown person, both the object of every mans scorn and disdain, into the Capital City of your Ancestors Inheritance. It is there, where before fearing (by reason of the Orders set forth against your life, and for discovering you) the meeting so many faces that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard yours, the hand of God hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn the eyes of all those who had a heart to hurt you. And he hath opened them to him alone, for to acknowledge
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102273:35"/>
you, who without being prevented, either by a fore-sight, or expectation of you, became the Angel of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, for your crossing the Seas, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending upon our Banks, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, rendring you to the eyes of the Queen your dear Mother, to whom your presence hath caused a greater ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of grief, and rendred a greater joy, than you did at your Birth.</p>
                  <p>God hath then after this manner, Sir, made you to return hither into the Bosome, wherein your Majestie hath begun to live, to the end he may give you a new one, by your being born again into the spiritual Bosome of your eternal Mother. You may see the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and counsel of God, who calls you to him by a call so marvelous, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard the prayers and vows, the sighs and tears of this Catholique Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, to give her the joy to see you rendred a partaker of the greatest gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces she hath received from God, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102273:35"/>
which she hath implored for you ever since your Birth, without ceasing.</p>
                  <p>Since she is the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> the Glory of most Christian Kings, she implores of God for you the inheritance of that grace he received from his hand, which set him at one and the same time time both in the Church, and upon the Throne. Her faith implores it, her patience hopes it, and her piety shall obtain it. This is the consolation she sighs after, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing her from so many bitter affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which she hath suckt in at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and that the hand of God hath poured upon her, in his Sons Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, by which he proves the constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of those who love him.</p>
                  <p>To the tears of this desolate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, I adde, Sir, the Innocent Blood shed before God by the King your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom I think I may be able without fear to stile happy. For if we look upon the cause of his death, he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102273:36"/>
hath been persecuted and cruelly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ain, being able to avoyd the one and the other from the hands of his Enemies, if he would have submitted his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to their Covenant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the abolishing of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>
                  <p>But he hath loved rather to glorifie God by the confession of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and for supporting a Dignity which he hath believed to have been instituted by God, according to the opinion of the Catholique Faith. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we ought to believe, that it is to this Faith, which he hath preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the greatest things in the world, which we must rehears, &amp; acknowledge for the fruits, Piety, Humility, Patience, Constancy, Resignation to the will of God, submission even to that of men, for the love of God, which we have seen in him, and which his persecution, suffering, prison, unworthy intreatings, criminal proceeding, degradation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102273:36"/>
the horrour and cruelty of his punishment, like to which the Sun did never yet see an example on the Earth, have rendred him more illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and more bright shining than the light of the Sun it self. We may say, that that firmness of this faith hath been in his heart a secret work of God, for reuniting him, in this trial of the last moments of his life, to his Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And we ought to believe, that this Crown, which he hath gained by the constancy of his faith, hath been woven for him by the hands of Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, hearing the prayer and intercession of the most happy Queen his Grandmother, who hath in the same manner shed he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

punishment, with a faith and constancy not to be imitated, for the Catholique Faith, which was the very cause of the hatred and persecution she received from her people, and most near Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, from whom the succession of the Crown belonged to her. For the prayers of the most happy Martyrs in Heaven, tends to obtain continually of God, by Jesus Christ, the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the same grace they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived here below, imploring it for those that have need, to the end that their Faith may be also consummated by a perfect Charity. This is the grace, Sir, you shall make trial of, when your Majestie shall attain this Faith, by your reunion with the Church.

                  <p>Neither wil it avail them any thing at all, that the Fathers have sometimes used such expressions of <hi>seeing Christ,</hi> of <hi>touching Christ</hi> in the Sacrament, of <hi>fastening our teeth in his Flesh,</hi> and <hi>making our toungsred in his Blood.</hi> There is a great difference between a Sermon to the people, and a solemn Retractation before a Judge.

The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers never meant by these forms of speech to determine the manner of the presence, (which was not dreamt of in their daies) but to raise the Devotion of their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Readers; to advertise the people of God, that they should not rest in the externall symbols, or signes, but principally be intent upon the invisible

Grace, which was both lawfull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for them to do. Leave us their primitive liberty, and we will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from the like expressions.</p>
                  <p>I urge this to shew that the new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Transubstantiation is so farre from being an old Article of Faith, that it was not well digested, nor rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, in any tollerable measure, by the greatest Clerks, and most concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, above a thousand years after Christ.</p>

change, or a change of the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, both matter and form; and if it were a Conversion of the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, then whether it was by way of Production, or by Adduction, or by Conservation, each of which greater Squadrons are subdivided into several lesser Parties, speaking as different lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as the builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> pestering and perplexing one another with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable difficulties.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be a new Production (saith one) because the Body of Christ, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the Elements are supposed to be converted, did pre-exist before the change; neither can that Body which is made of Bread, be the same body with that which was born of a Virgin.</p>
                  <p>If it be not by Production (say o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) but only by Adduction, then it is not a Transubstantiation, but a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ubiation, not a change of Natures, but a local succession. Then the Priest is not the Maker of his Maker, (as they use to brag) but only puts him into a new po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siture or presence, under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine.</p>

None at all; no, though the adduction of the Serpent had been the means of the expulsion and destruction of the Rod. It is so farr from Transubstantiation, that it is no Conversion at all. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Elements is not converted, for that is supposed to be destroyed; The Accidents are not converted, but remain the same they were. It is no Adduction at all, when the Body of Christ (which is the thing supposed to be adduced) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains still in Heaven, where it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

It cannot be a Conservative Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, say others; for the same individual thing cannot be Conserved by two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal distinct Conservations: but if this were a Conservative conversion, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ should be conserved by two total distinct Conservations, the one in Heaven, the other in Earth; Yea by ten thousand distinct total Conservations upon Earth, even as many as there are consecrated Hosts; <hi>Which seems to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and without any necessity admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>

                  <p>There was yet one cause more of this cruel persecution, which I cannot conceal from you, because it concerns some of your old acquaintance.

                  <p>Comparisons are odious, therefore I will not say, that the true English Protestant standing to his own grounds, is the best subject in the world: But I do say, that he is as good a subject as any in the wortd, and our principles as Innocent, and as auxiliary to civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as the maxims of any Church under Heaven; And more than yours, where the clashing of two Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, and the exemption of your numerous Clergy from the Coercive power of the Prince, and some other novelties, which I forbear to mention, do alway threaten a storm.</p>

first principles. Are your Houses of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which are Reformed, therefore the less Religious? Why then did all the Princes and Common-wealths in <hi>Europe,</hi> Yea the Fathers themselves in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> cry out so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, so earnestly, for a Reformation? yet were forced to content themselves with a vain shadow for the substance, as <hi>Ixion</hi> embraced a Cloud for <hi>Juno,</hi> or Children are often stilled with an empty bottle.</p>
                  <p>But Reformation is not agreable to all persons. <hi>Judas</hi> loved not an Audit, <note place="margin">Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>

No mervail they are afraid to have their Oranges squeesed to their hands; if they were infallible as they pretend, there was no need of a Reformation; we wish they were, but we see they are not.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed <note place="margin">There is danger in Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>

that Reformation, when it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable, or inordinate, or excessive, may do more hurt than good; when Reformers want just Authority, or due information, or have sinister ends, or where the remedy may be of worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence than the abuse, or where men run out of one extreme into another; therefore it is a rule in prudence, <hi>Not to remove an ill custom, when it is well set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> unless it bring great prejudices, and then it is better to give one account why we have taken it away, than to be alwaies making excuses why we do it not. Needless alteration doth diminish the venerable esteem of Religion, and lessen the credit of antient truths. Break Ice in one place, and it will crack in more.

Thirdly, we never said, we never thought, that the Occumenical Church of Christ was guilty of Tyranny.

                  <p>But supposing that (which we can never grant) the Catholick Church <note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church it self not absolutely faln to ruin.</note> and Roman Church were Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibles, yet still you do us wrong. First we do not maintain, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church it self is faln <hi>to ruin and desolation,</hi> we grant to it a true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical being, though not a true moral being; we hope their errors are rather in superstructures, than in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102273:70"/>
we do not say that the Plants of saving truth (which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to you and us) are plucked up by the roots in the Roman Church, but we say that they are over-grown with weeds, and in danger to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
                  <p>Next for Idolatry, whether, and why, and how far, we accuse your <note place="margin">Whether the Roman Church be guilty of Idolatry.</note> Church of it, deserves further Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. First you agree with us. That God alone is the Object of Religion, and consequently that all Religious worship is due terminatively only to him; that God alone is to be invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated absolutely or ultimately, that is, so as to grant our requests and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil our desires by himself, and that the Saints are not the <hi>objects of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> but joynt petitioners with us, and intercessors for us to the throne of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we profess as well as you, that there is a proportionab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e degree of honour, and respect, due to every creature in Heaven and Earth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dignity of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more honour due to a glorified Spirit, than to a mortal man: But withall we adde, that this honour,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102273:71"/>
is not <hi>servitutis</hi> but <hi>charitatis,</hi> not of service as to our Lords and Masters, but of love and charity as to our friends and fellow-servants, of the same kind and nature with that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which we give to holy men on Earth. And herein we are confident that we shall have your consent.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we agree in this also, that abundant love and duty doth extend an honourable respect from the person of a dear friend, or noble benefactor, to his posterity, to his memory, to his Monument, to his Image, to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, to every thing that he loved, or that pertained to him, even to the Earth which he did tread upon, for his sake. Put a <hi>Liefhebber,</hi> or <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a company of rare pictures, and he will pick out the best pieces for their proper value. But a friend or child will more esteem the Picture of a Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, or Ancestor, for its relation. The respect of the one is terminated in the Picture, that of the other is radicated in the exemplar. Yet still an Image is but an Image, and the kinds of respect must not be confounded. The respect given to an Image, must be respect proper for an Im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ge, not Courtship, not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, not Adoration. More respect is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102273:71"/>
due to the person of the meanest beggar, than to all the Images of Christ and his Apostles, and a 1000. Primitive Saints or Progenitors. Hitherto there is either no difference nor peril either of Idolatry, or Superstition.</p>
                  <p>Wherein then did consist this guilt of Idolatry contracted by the Roman Church? I am willing for the present to pass by the private abuses of particular persons, which seem to me no otherwise chargeable upon the whole Church, than for Connivence. As the making Images to counterfeit tears, and words, and gestures, and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for advantage, to induce silly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to believe that there was something of divinity in them; and the multitude of fictitious Relicks, and supposititious Saints, which credulity first introduced, and since covetousness hath nourished. I take no notice now of those remote suspitions or suppositions of the possibility of want of intention, either in the Priest that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrates the Sacrament, or in him that Baptized, or in the Bishop that ordained him, or in any one through the whole line of succession; in all which cases (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your own principles) you give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship to corporeal Elements, which is at least material Idolatry.</p>

                  <p>Neither do I urge how you have distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the Patronage of particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the Cure of several Diseases, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of all distinct professions of men, and all kinds of Creatures, among the Saints, just as the Heathen did among their Tutelary Gods; nor how little war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you have for this practice from experience; nor lastly, how you build more Churches, erect more Altars, offer more presents, pour out more prayers, make more vows, perform more offices to the Mother than to the Son. Yet though we should hold our peace, methinks you should ponder these things seriously, and either for your own satisfaction, or ours, take away such unnecessary occasions of scandal and dis-union.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot omit, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is not contented to enjoyn the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102273:72"/>
Adoration of Christ in the Sacrament, (which we never deny) but of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it self (that is, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon current of your Schoolmen, the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And that we may not deal like blunderers, or deceitful persons, to wrap up or involve our selves on purpose in confused Generalities, I will set down our sense distinctly, When you understand it, I hope you will repent of your rash censuring of us, of whom you had so little knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Three things offer themselves to be considered: First, concerning the Rule of <note place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> rule of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural truths.</note> Scripture; Secondly, the proper Expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof; and Thirdly, the manner of Exposition.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Scripture we believe, That it was impossible for humane reason, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of divine Revelation, to find out those supernatural truths which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation. 2. That to supply this defect of natural reason, God out of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102273:75"/>
his abundant goodness hath given us the holy Scriptures, which have not their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the writing which is humane, but from the Revelation which is divine, from the Holy Ghost. Thirdly, that this being the purpose of the Holy Ghost, it is blasphemy to say he would not, or could not attain unto it. And that therefore the holy Scriptures do comprehend all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary supernatural truths; So much is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that <hi>All things which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 4. <hi>de verbo Dei, cap.</hi> 11.</note> 
                     <hi>are necessary to be believed, and to be done by all Christians, were preached to all by the Apostles, and were all written.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Scripture is more properly to be called a Rule of supernatural truths than a Judge, or if it be sometimes called a Judge, it is no otherwise than the Law is called a Judge of civil Controversies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, that is, the rule of judging what is right, and what is wrong. That which sheweth what is strait, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth likewise what is crooked.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, concerning the proper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders <note place="margin">Who are the proper expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how far.</note> of Scripture, we do believe that the Gospel doth not consist in the words, but in the sense, <hi>non in superficie, sed in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullâ;</hi> And therefore that though this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule be given for the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all, yet every one is not an able or
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102273:75"/>
fit Artist to make application of this Rule, in all particular cases. To preserve the common right, and yet prevent particular abuses, we distinguish Judgement into three kinds.</p>
                  <p>Judgement of Discretion, Judgement of Direction, and Judgement of Jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>As in the former Instance of the Law, (the ignorance whereof exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>seth no man) every Subject hath Judgement of Discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to apply it particularly to the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himself, his estate and interest; The Advocates, and those who are skilful in the Law, have moreover a Judgement of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to advise others of less knowledge and experience; But those who are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by the Sovereign power, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine emergent difficulties, and differences, and to distribute and administer Justice to the whole body of a Province or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, have moreover a Judgement of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, which is not onely discretionary, or directive, but authoritative, to impose an Obligation of obedience unto those who are under their charge. If these last shall transgress the rule of the Law, they are not accountable to their Inferiours, but to him or them that have the Sovereign power of Legislative Judicature; <hi>Ejus est legem interpretari, cujus est condere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:102273:76"/>
To apply this to the case in question concerning the exposition of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Every Christian keeping himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of due obedience, and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to his lawful Superiours, hath a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Discretion; Prove all things, hold fast that which is good.</hi> He may apply the <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 21.</note> Rule of holy Scripture for his own private instruction, comfort, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>dification and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and for the framing of his life and belief aceordingly. The Pastors of the Church (who are placed over Gods people as watchmen and guides) have more than this, a judgement of <hi>Direction,</hi> to expound and interpret the holy Scriptures to others, and out of them to instruct the ignorant, to reduce them who wander out of the right way, to confute errours, to foretell dangers, and to draw sinners to repentance. The chief Pastors, to whose care the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church is committed in a more special manner, have yet an higher degree of judgement, a Judgement of <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> to prescribe, to enjoyn, to constitute, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, to censure, to condemn, to bind, to loose, judicially, authoritatively, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective charges. If their Key shall erre, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Key of Knowledge, or their Key of Jurisdiction, they are accountable to their respective Superiours, and in the last place
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102273:76"/>
to a general Council, which under Christ upon Earth, is the highest Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies. Thus we have seen what is the Rule of Faith, and by whom, and how far respectively this rule is to be applied.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the manner of expounding <note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture.</note> holy Scriptures, (for there may be a privacy in this also, and more dangerous than the privacy of the person) many things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the right interpretation of the Law, to unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>stand the reason of it, the precedents, the terms, the forms, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and an ability to compare Law with Law. He that wants all these Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons altogether, is no interpreter of Law. He that wants but some of them, or wants the perfection of them, by how much the greater is his defect, by so much the less valuable is his exposition; And if he shall out of private fancy, or blind presumption, arrogate to himself, without these requisite means, or above his capacity and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Knowledge, a power of expounding Law, he is a mad-man.</p>
                  <p>So many things are required to render a man capable to expound the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, some more necessarily, some less, some absolutely, some respectively; As First, to know the right Analogy of Faith, to which all interpretations of Scripture must be of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102273:77"/>
necessity conformed. Secondly, to know the practice and tradition of the Church, and the received expositions of former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters in the successive ages, which gives a great light to the finding out of the right sense. Thirdly, to be able to compare Texts with Texts, Antecedents with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents, without which one can hardly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the drift and scope of the Holy Ghost in the obscurer passages. And lastly, it is something to know the Idiotisms of that language wherein the Scriptures were written. He that wants all these requisites, and yet takes upon him out of a phanatique presumption of private illumination to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Scripture, is a doting Enthusiast, fitter to be refuted with Scorn than with Arguments. He that presumes above that degree and proportion which he hath in these means, and above the talent which God hath given him, (as he that hath a little Language, yet wants Logick, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both Language and Logick, knows not, or regards not either the Judgement of former Expositors, or the practice and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the purest Primitive Ages, or the Symbolical Faith of the Catholick Church) <hi>is not a likely workman to build a Temple to the Lord, but ruine and destruction to himself, and his seduced followers.</hi> A new
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102273:77"/>
Physician (we say) requires a new Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; But such bold ignorant Empericks in Theology, are ten times more dangerous to the Soul, than an ungrounded unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Quacksalver to the Body.</p>
                  <p>This hath alwaies been the doctrine, <note place="margin">This is conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our Church. <hi>Can.</hi> 1603. <hi>Can.</hi> 49.</note> and the practice of our English Church; First, it is so far from admitting Laymen to be Directive Interpreters of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it allows not this Liberty to Clergy-men so much as <hi>to gloss upon the Text,</hi> untill they be Licenced to become Preachers. Secondly, for Judgement of Discretion onely, it gives it not to private <note place="margin">Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If you understand another Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, distinct from that (as this of the Mass seems to be, for confessedly the Priest is not the same, the Altar is not the same, the Temple is not the same) If you think of any new meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious satisfaction to God for the sins of the world, or of any new supplement to the merits of Christs Passion, you must give us leave to renounce your Sacrifice indeed, and to adhere to the Apostle; <hi>By one offering he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sected for ever them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>

                  <p>Surely you cannot think that Christ did actually sacrifice himself at his last Supper (for then he had redeemed the world at his last Supper, then his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent sacrifice upon the Cross had been superfluous) nor that the Priest now

We do readily acknowledge an Eucharistical sacrifice of prayers and praises; we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess a commemoration of the sacrifice of the Cross; and in the language of holy Church, things commemorated are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as if they were then acted; As, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>

We believe that this inherent Justice and Sanctity, doth make them truly just and holy. But if the word <hi>Justification</hi> be taken <hi>in sensu forensi,</hi> for the acquittal of a man from former guilt, to make an offender just in the eye of the Law, as it is opposed to Condemnation, <hi>It is God that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,</hi>

                  <p>Next for Merits, we never doubted <note place="margin">Of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> of the necessity of good Works, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Faith is but a fiction. We are not so stupid to imagine that Christ

                  <p>Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no Apostolical Orthodox, or Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>They have changed the Apostolical Creed, by making a new Creed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are many things inserted, that hold no Analogie with the old Apostles Creed; The Apostolical Succession, by ingros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the whole succession to <hi>Rome,</hi> and making all other Bishops to be but the Popes Vicars, and Substitutes, as to their Jurisdiction; The Apostolical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment by erecting a visible and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Monarchy in the Church; And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Apostolical Communion, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating three parts of the holy Catholick Apostolick Church.</p>
                  <p>Again, That Church which resolves its Faith not into divine Revelation and Authority, but into Humane infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,

                  <p>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> resolves its Faith, not into divine Revelation and Authority, but into the Infallibility of the present Church, not knowing, or not according, what that present Church is, whether the Virtual Church (that is the Pope,) or the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church (that is a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil) or the Essential Church, (that is the Church of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not true faith. The greater number of your Writers is for the Pope, that this infallibility is fixed to his Chair. But of all other Judgements, that is most fallible and uncertain; for if Simony make a Nullity in a Papal Election, we have great reason to doubt, that
