            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>For your delight, Faire Ornament of Worth;</l>
            <l>Is here, come, to bee publikely disclos'd:</l>
            <l>And to an vniuersall view put forth.</l>
            <l>Which hauing beene but yours and mine before,</l>
            <l>(Or but of few besides) is made hereby</l>
            <l>To bee the worlds: and yours and mine no more.</l>
            <l>So that in this sort giuing it to you,</l>
            <l>I giue it from you, and therein doe wrong,</l>
            <l>To make that, which in priuate was your due:</l>
            <l>Thus to the world in common to belong.</l>
            <l>And thereby may debase the estimate,</l>
            <l>Of what perhaps did beare some price before:</l>
            <l>For oft we see how things of slender rate,</l>
            <l>Being vndiuulg'd, are choisely held in store:</l>
            <l>And rarer compositions once expos'd,</l>
            <l>Are (as vnworthy of the world) condemn'd:</l>
            <l>For what, but by their hauing beene disclos'd</l>
            <l>To all, hath made all misteries contemn'd.</l>
            <l>And therefore why had it not beene ynow,</l>
            <l>That Milton onely heard our melodie?</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Baucis</hi> and <hi>Philoemon</hi> onely show,</l>
            <l>To Gods and men their hospitalitie:</l>
            <l>And thereunto a ioyfull eare afford,</l>
            <l>In mid'st of their well welcom'd company:</l>
            <l>Where wee (as Birds doe to themselues record)</l>
            <l>Might entertaine our priuate harmonie.</l>
            <l>But fearing least that time might haue beguild</l>
            <l>You of your owne, and me of what was mine,</l>
            <l>I did desire to haue it knowne my Child:</l>
            <l>And for his right, to others I resigne.</l>
            <l>Though I might haue beene warn'd by him, who is</l>
            <l>Both neare and deare to mee, that what we giue</l>
            <l>Vnto these times, we giue t'vnthankfulnesse,</l>
            <l>And so without vnconstant censures, liue.</l>
            <l>But yet these humours will no warning take,</l>
            <l>Wee still must blame the fortune that wee make.</l>
            <l>And yet herein wee doe aduenture now,</l>
            <l>But Ayre for Ayre, no danger can accrew,</l>
            <l>They are but our refusalls wee bestow,</l>
            <l>And wee thus cast the old t'haue roome for new:</l>
