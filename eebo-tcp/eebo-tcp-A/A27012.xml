         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Obligations and duty of Parents required of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Children, in their Educating of them in godlineſs.</head>
            <p>BE ſure in the firſt place, that you do your part in entring them at firſt into the Baptiſmal Covenant; 1. See that you be true to your Covenant your ſelf, for the promiſe is made to the true Chriſtians and their Seed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 Ch. 13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17 Ch. 4. 13. 14. <hi>2ly,</hi> Do not think that his Bare being the Child of godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is his full condition of Right to the benefits of the Covenant, that is but the Fundamental part; but you muſt Actually dedicate him to God in Baptiſm, <hi>(Deut.</hi> 29. ch. 11. 12. ver. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11 ch. 16, <hi>John</hi> 3. ch. 2. 5.) <hi>The child of a Believer actually offered or dedicated to God, is a rightfull Receiver of Baptiſm and its benefits. 3ly.</hi> Teach them therefore to know what Covenant they have made, and then ceaſe not till you have brought them heartily to conſent to it at Age themſelves: and then bring them to the Miniſter of the Church, that he may Solemnly own the Covenant made in his Baptiſm, and ſo may be Admitted into the Number of Adult Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Members in a regular way.</p>
            <p>Teach them the words of the Covenant, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1 ch. 13. and alſo the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and the Catechiſm, teach them the meaning of them, and the way of practiſing all labour to poſſeſs them with the greateſt Reverence of God and the Holy Scriptures: then ſhew them the Word of God, for all that you would teach them to know or do. <hi>2ly.</hi> Never ſpeak to them of God and Holy things, but with the greateſt gravity and reverence: for if they are uſed once to ſlight, or jeſt, or play with Holy things, they are hardened and undone. Uſe often to take an Account of what they know and what they do, both in their open and ſecret practiſe; leave them not careleſly to themſelves, but narrowly watch over them. <hi>3ly.</hi> Uſe all your skill and diligence by word and deed to make a Holy Life appear to them, as it is the moſt honourable, profitable, ſafe, and pleaſant life in the world, that it may be their conſtant delight; make good things pleaſant to them, keep them from feeling Religion as Burthenſom, or unpleaſant, or a needleſs thing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, begin with the eaſieſt parts, as Scripture Hiſtories, and then Church Hiſtories: let them read the Lives of Holy Men, written by Mr. <hi>Samuel Clark</hi> and his Martyroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the Lives of Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Joſeph Allir,</hi> Mr. <hi>Janeway;</hi> Dr. <hi>Beards</hi> Theatre of Gods Judgments, ſpeak much to them of the praiſe of Ancient and latter Holy men; be much in opening to them the Riches of Grace, and the joyes of glory: exerciſe them much in Pſalms and praiſing God; let your diſcourſe with them be much in the diſgrace of Senſuality, Pride, and wordlyneſs: tell them how Pride is the Devils ſin, which caſt him from Heaven, when others tell them of Riches, Honours, and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do you tell them theſe are the Devils baites to allure and ſteal thy Heart from God that they may be damned, make them often read, <hi>Luk</hi> 12 ch. 16. 18. ver <hi>Jam.</hi> 14 ch. 5. ver. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 ch. 12. ver. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5 ch. 21. 6. ver. <hi>Wiſely break them of their own Wills, and let them know that they muſt obey and like Gods Will and yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let their Apparell be plain and decent, not gaudy; be ſure when they come to years of ripen, that you keep them from opportunity, nearneſs, or familiarity with tempting Perſons of another Sex. Be ſure you ingage your Children in good Company, and keep them as much as poſſible out of bad: wicked Children will infact them before you are aware, as to drink, to ſwear, to game, to talk filthily, to lying, and to make a mock of godlineſs and Sobriety. Teach them to know the value of precious time, and the ſhortneſs of this Life, and to ſet death ſtill before their eyes; uſe them to read good Books, let your correction of them be wiſely uſed as they need it, not too ſeverely as to diſaffect them to you, nor ſo little as to leave them in a courſe of ſin and diſobedience, let it be alwayes in love.</p>
            <p>Pray earneſtly for them, and commit them by Faith to Chriſt, into whoſe Covenant you did ingage them. Go before them by a holy Life: let your practice tell them what you would have them be, eſpecially in repreſenting godlineſs delightful, and in living in the joyful hopes of Heaven. Chooſe ſuch Trades for them that have leaſt dangerous temptations, and when marriagable, provide ſuch for them as are truly Suitable, and ſtay not till Luſt and Folly inſnate them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Counſels which I earneſtly recommend to you in this important work, for your Childrens Souls are ſo precious, and the difference between the good and bad ſo great, that all this muſt not ſeem too much, for I take the due Education of Children for the needfulleſt and excellent work in the world, eſpecially for Mothers.</p>

               <hi>4ly.</hi> To avoid all diſſentions, and to bear with thoſe Infirmities in each other which you cannot cure: to aſſwage, and not to provoke unruly paſſions, and in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things to pleaſe each other. <hi>5ly.</hi> To keep continual Chaſtity and fidelity, and to avoid all unſeemly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt carriage with any other, which may ſtir up jealouſie, and yet to avoid jealouſie which is unjuſt. <hi>6ly.</hi> To help each other to bear their burthens (and not by Impatience to make them greater) in poverty, croſſes, ſickneſs, and dangers, to comfort and to ſupport each other, and to be delightful Companions in Holy Love and Heavenly hopes and duties, when all other outward comforts faile.</p>
            <p>The more ſpecial duties of Husbands are to exerciſe Love and Authority together, (never ſeperated) to his Wife. <hi>2ly.</hi> To be chief teacher and governour of the Family, and provider for its maintainance, to excell the Wife in Knowledge and Patience, and to be her Teacher and guide in the matters of God, and to keep up the Wives Authority &amp; Honour in the Family over inferiors.</p>
            <p>The ſpecial duties of Wives are, to excell in Love, and <hi>2ly.</hi> Be obedient to their Husbands, and examples therein to the reſt of the Family, ſubmiſſively to learn of their Husbands, (that can teach them) and not to be ſelf conceited, talktive, or imperious, to ſubdue their paſſions, not to tempt their Husband to ſatisfie their vain deſire in Pride, Exceſs, Revenge, or any evil; not to rob God and the poor by a proud waſtfull humour. <hi>5ly.</hi> To govern their Tongues, that their words be few, and grave, and ſober. <hi>6ly.</hi> To be contented in every condition, to avoid the Childiſh vanity of gaudy Apparel, and following of vain faſhions of the prouder ſort. <hi>7ly.</hi> To help on the maintainance of the family by frugality, not to diſpoſe of her Husbands Eſtate without his conſent. <hi>8ly.</hi> Above all to be conſtant helpers for the Holy Education of their Children; for this is the moſt eminent Service that women can do in the world; ſhe muſt daily Catechiſe them, and teach them to know God, and mind them of the world to come, and teach them to pray.</p>
