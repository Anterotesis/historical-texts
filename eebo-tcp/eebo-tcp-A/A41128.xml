            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Conſcience is Gods preacher in our boſomes: And it is a moſt certain rule; That that man that will not regard the preacher in his boſome will never regard the preacher in the pulpit. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the preacher in the pulpit doth no more good, is becauſe the preacher in the boſome is ſo much deſpiſed and neglected. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doubt not but this book (theſe motives conſidered) will be very acceptable to all thoſe that have or deſire to have a good and quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. For as <note n="*" place="margin">Unicuique liber eſt propria conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia; &amp; ad hunc li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutiendum &amp; emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandum omnes alii invenli ſunt.</note> S.

of conſcience.</hi> Let thoſe that reade this book of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience look into the book of their own conſcience, and amend all the faults of that book by this.</p>
            <p>The reverend Authour of this book was a Miniſter very conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious, and one that had a great abilitie given him by God to preach unto and work upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of people, to awaken the ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie conſcience, to inform the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous conſcience, to ſettle the doubtfull conſcience, and to comfort the wounded conſcience: his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were all dipt in conſcience: And therefore a ſubject of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt needs be welcome from ſuch a preacher. It is true that this birth is <hi>Posthumum opus,</hi> and cometh out after the death of the Authour: But I hope it will be the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to revive the memory of him whoſe life and labours were deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly precious in the eſteem of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:62503:5"/>
people. And if conſcience, though for a while blind, &amp; dumbe, and ſeared, &amp; put out of all office, will notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at laſt be put into office, and made to ſee, ſpeak and feel, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction of an impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; why may not a diſcourſe of Conſcience, though long ago preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be ſuffered to revive and live for the ſalvation of thoſe that ſhall have grace to reade it aright? eſpecially conſidering that theſe ſermons were perfected by himſelf in his life time?</p>
            <p>Much I could ſay in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this worthie Divine, both in regard of his unweariſome pains in preaching, conſuming his own bodie to ſave the ſouls of others, as alſo of his learning and exemplarie pietie:<note place="margin">Praelucen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do pereo.</note> but I forbear. All that I will ſay is this; They that fully knew him did love and reverence him: and if any did diſeſteem him, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not fully know him.
<pb facs="tcp:62503:5"/>
He is now a ſhining ſtarre in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of heaven. And there are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of people that will bleſſe God to all eternity for his pains. He need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not our praiſes, but our imitation.</p>
            <p>All that I deſire from you that reade this ſhort treatiſe is this, That ye would either get a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by the reading of this book, or bring a good conſcience to the reading of it.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE eſtate of a man before God is the relation that he ſtandeth in unto God,<note place="margin">What a mans eſtate before God is.</note> as God is the free fountain of all ſpirituall life and ſalvation, and the determiner of mens everlaſting conditions either in heaven or in hell: So that when we queſtion about a mans eſtate, we queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be in Chriſt or not; Whether he have true grace yea, or no; Whether he be one of Gods children or no, or whether he be yet no better then a reprobate.</p>
            <p>There be three things to be conſidered in this definition of every mans eſtate. Firſt, it is <hi>a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God</hi>; not as a man is in himſelf, it may be rich, it may be poore in the world; but I ſpeak here as he is in relation towards God, Whether he be rich towards God, yea or no. I do not ſpeak as a man is in regard of others; it may be he is a father or a ſonne, a maſter or a ſervant, a king or a ſubject: but in relation to God, Whether Gods ſevant or no, Gods child or no. <hi>Salute Apelles,</hi> ſaith Paul;<note place="margin">

               </note> and he tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62503:8"/>
us in what eſtate Apelles was in before God, namely, in an eſtate of approbation, <hi>approved in Chriſt.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaketh on the contrary of the unconverted Gentiles, that they were <hi>ſtrangers from the life of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18,</note> Epheſ. 4, 18. Secondly, As it is a relation unto God, ſo it is a <hi>ſtanding</hi> relation: That wherein he ſtandeth towards God, that is a mans eſtate before God. There is a difference between one that doth ſin and one that is in the ſtate of ſinne: A child of God may ſinne, but he is not in a ſtate of ſinne; you cannot call him a wicked man. So alſo there is difference between one that doeth ſome good actions and one that is in a good eſtate: A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man may do ſome good things, but he is not in a good eſtate. The eſtate of a man is a ſtanding thing, it is the relation that he ſtandeth in towards God. Thirdly, It is the relation that a man ſtandeth in towards God <hi>as he is the free fountain of ſpirituall life and ſalvation.</hi> It is not every ſtanding relation towards God: For a man may be conſidered in relation to God as a Creatour, and ſo the heavens and the earth and the very brute beaſts ſtand in relation to God as they are his creatures; but they have not this eſtate that we ſpeak of, which is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God as the free giver of ſpirituall life and ſalvation (He is free, he may chooſe whether he will give it or no.) Now this is a mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, the relation he ſtandeth in unto God, Whether the Lord hath given him his ſaving grace, yea or no; ſpirituall life in Chriſt Jeſus, yea or no; title to heaven and ſalvation, yea or no? this is the meaning when we ſpeak of a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62503:8"/>
mans eſtate. It is ſaid of Sodom, <hi>They were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners before God</hi>: that is they were in a bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.13.</note> a ſtate of ſinne. It is ſaid of Zachary and Eliſabeth, <hi>They were both righteous before God</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6.</note> they were both in a very good ſtate.</p>
            <p>All Chriſtians believe that there is a God:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Miniſters are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the eſtate of their people.<hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1.</note> It behoveth every one now to conſider in what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate he ſtandeth to his God. This is a great queſtion that we which are miniſters ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our people, to know their eſtates.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe we are ſhepherds, and are bound to look well how it ſtandeth with our flock. If we do not labour to know your eſtates, we can never look well to your ſouls. Conſider that place in the Proverbs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.23.</note> 
               <hi>Be diligent to know the ſtate of thy flock, and look well to thy herds.</hi> Where the wiſe man firſt requireth that we ſhould look well to our flocks, and then direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in the manner how, <hi>viz.</hi> by being dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to know their eſtate how it ſtandeth with them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are Gods labourers; and we muſt know in what eſtate our work ſtandeth: elſe we may labour and labour and all in vain; we may preach and exhort and call upon our people to heare and believe, and obey; and all this may ſtill be in vain, if we do not enquire in what eſtate they are. This is the reaſon why Paul could not forbear ſending and enquiring how it ſtood with the Theſſalonians,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.5</note> in what eſtate they were in, how it went with their faith, whether they kept it or no, leſt the tempter had tempted them, and his labour ſhould have been
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62503:9"/>
in vain; for ſo it had been for all his preaching and teaching them if they had not been in a good eſtate: therefore he ſent to know.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, we are to take the care and the charge of your ſouls: Now then how can we be quiet if we do not know in what eſtate your ſouls be? A good father cannot be at quiet if he do not know how it is with his children: How if they ſhould be ſick? how if undone? Oh it would comfort a good father to know his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be in good caſe: But if it were otherwiſe with them, though it would grieve him much yet he had rather know it then not; for if he know it he can better tell what to do. So it was with the Apoſtle; his very bowells yerned upon the Philippians,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philip</hi> 2.19.</note> 
               <hi>Oh my poore people,</hi> thought he, <hi>I wonder what eſtate they be in. How if they totter? how if they miſcarry? how if the devil have tempted them to ſinne and to apostatize? how if they be in trouble of conſcience?</hi> He could never be at quiet till he knew their eſtate: <hi>I trust in the Lord Jeſus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to ſend Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus ſhortly unto you, that I alſo may be of good comfort when I know your estate.</hi> He had a great care of their ſouls, and therefore it would comfort his heart to know what eſtate they were in.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we are teachers, and therefore we muſt know the eſtate of our people: otherwiſe we are ignorant what doctrine to provide for them, what points to handle among them. Paul in this epiſtle to the Coloſſians, knowing onely their eſtate in the generall, delivereth abundance of generall precepts and exhortations unto them:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62503:9"/>
he deſcribeth unto them the myſtery of Chriſt, admoniſheth them to continue ſtedfaſt therein, to embrace the preaching of the word, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of philoſophy and the vain traditions and ſophiſtry of men, to take heed of doting upon ceremonies, which are all ended in Chriſt, to ſet their affections on heaven, to mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, to put off the old man; he warneth them to be loving and humble: he biddeth wives do their duties to their husbands, and husbands to love their wives; children to obey their parents, and parents to encourage their children; ſervants to obey their maſters, and maſters to deal well with their ſervants; all to continue in prayer, watchfulneſſe, thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; to walk wiſely towards them that are without, to be carefull of godly &amp; holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: Thus knowing their eſtate onely for the generall he teacheth them in generall, and therefore now he concludeth, as if he ſhould ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>I ſpeak ſomewhat generally becauſe I do not know your eſtates in particular; and therefore I ſend to you Tychicus, a faithfull good minister, that he may learn your eſtates in particular, and deal with you anſwerably. It may be ſome of you want corroſives; it may be ſome of you want cordials; it may be ſome have need to be ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and humbled, ſome of you to be encouraged and comforted: I have ſent him to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your eſtates in particular, that he may do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Whom I have ſent unto you for the ſame purpoſe, that he may know your estate and comfort your hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The uſe of this is threefold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62503:10"/>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</hi> 1. <hi>Inſtruct.</hi>
               </note>Firſt, for inſtruction. Hence we may ſee that a miniſter doeth but his duty when he enquireth into mens eſtates how they ſtand before God: It is not prying into other mens matters; it is not buſi-bodineſſe in other mens affairs; it is not a ſpirit of meddling: No, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iniſter doeth but his duty when he doeth it. How can a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician apply true and proper phyſick unleſſe he enquire into the ſtate of mens bodies?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.12.</note> Now a miniſter is a phyſician to mens ſouls; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is to enquire of the ſtate of mens ſouls how they ſtand before God. They are men of Belial that ſay, <hi>What? must the minister know all?</hi> and, <hi>Can there be nothing done but the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter must heare of it?</hi> Theſe are very evil ſpeeches. The miniſter doeth but his duty when he is inquiſitive.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</hi>
               </note>The ſecond uſe may be for reproof. If it be the duty of a miniſter to enquire of mens eſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, then thoſe people are too blame that will not make known their eſtates. What is the reaſon that ſo many men abide in a rotten e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but becauſe they are loth to open truly and fully what they are to Gods miniſters? Nay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are like them in the prophet,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.10.</note> 
               <hi>who ſay to the ſeers, See not.</hi> They would not have Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſee what they do, nor ſee what they are. I confeſſe there be ſome that will open ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about their eſtates, but not all they know by themſelves: They keep in the main; like ſome fooliſh clients who miſinform their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, making their caſe better then indeed it is, and ſo their cauſe miſcarrieth: So ſome keep in that which would give moſt light to judge of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62503:10"/>
their eſtates: But this ought not ſo to be. I can tell you an example of one that being troubled about his eſtate before God, and ſome mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters being by, <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will tell you all that I know of my ſelf; I'le not hide a ſyllable from you: and if I be yet no better then a wretch, I beſeech you tell me plainly that I am ſo; and if I be in Christ, I beſeech you prove it plainly unto me.</hi> This man took a right courſe, and thereby through Gods mercy came in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpace to the aſſurance of his own bleſſed eſtate and condition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for exhortation.<note place="margin">3. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </note> Let Gods miniſters know of your eſtates, that they may be able to ſpeak to you accordingly. By this means they may ſpeak words in due ſeaſon, and like wiſe houſe-holders give every one his portion. If you had but a cut finger, would not you be glad to have the right plaſtre? and if you had a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fever, would you not deſire the right reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? how much more in curing the ſickneſſe of the ſoul?</p>
            <p>Now from the text it ſelf without any cutting up of the words we may gather foure propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<list>
                  <item>1. That there is an eſtate that every man is in, either an eſtate of grace or an eſtate of ſinne.</item>
                  <item>2. That this ſtate may be known.</item>
                  <item>3. That every man ſhould be willing to have his eſtate examined, that it may be known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or no.</item>
                  <item>4. That a man can never have true comfort till it be known that he is in a good eſtate.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv.</hi>
               </note> That there is an eſtate that

               <hi>I perceive,</hi> ſaith S. Peter, <hi>thou art in the gall of bitterneſſe and in the bond of iniquity.</hi> See, he telleth him what eſtate he was in, <hi>viz.</hi> a very bad eſtate, in a deſperate and damnable condition. In this ſtate of ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery are all they that are not renewed by Chriſt Jeſus. And for the other ſee an example, Rom. 16.7.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Salute Rufus choſen in the Lord</hi>: The text there telleth us what eſtate he was in, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good eſtate; He was a man in Chriſt, <hi>a choiſe man,</hi> that is, a man in the ſtate of grace and ſalvation. In this eſtate are all they that are called and ſanctified and made new creatures unto God. Every man is in one of the two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates: there is no middle eſtate which is neither the one nor the other, but in one of theſe two are all the whole world. The reaſon is,

                  </gap>own.</note>II. For the ſecond propoſition, This eſtate may be known: Eſpecially every man may come to the knowledge of his own eſtate before God. I do not ſay that every man may know whether he be elect or reprobate: yet this I ſay too, That a godly ſoul may know that it is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to life. The Apoſtle exhorteth all that are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62503:11"/>
godly <hi>to give diligence to make their election ſure,</hi> 2. Pet. 1.10. He that atteineth to that faith which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>the faith of Gods elect,</hi> Titus 1.1. and receiveth the word of God, as Paul ſaith the Theſſalonians did, and thence concludeth they were choſen of God, 1. Theſſ. 1.4, 5. he may attein to much aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his election. But though a godly man may know he is elected of God, yet for repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation the caſe is not alike: 1. Becauſe ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is not alwayes joyned with perſeverance. 2. Beſides, God hath many reaſons why he doth not reveal mens reprobation unto them: They would then be outragious in evil, deſperate in wickedneſſe; there could be no order or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in humane life: Beſides that, the form of Chriſts adminiſtration of his kingdome could not be ſo as it now is: for Chriſt hath bid his miniſters preach the Goſpel to every creature, to whole pariſhes and towns, and except none: Chriſt will not tell his miniſters which be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates and which not, that they may preach unto all, and labour to work upon every ſoul; and there is none in a pariſh but the miniſter muſt look upon him as one who may be ſaved: Chriſt will not tell his people which be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, that they may look upon every one as one that may be wonne to the faith for any thing they know: Chriſt will not tell the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates themſelves that they are reprobates, that every one of them may come to the uſe of the means; How do they know but they may find grace? yea and the Lord doth ſeriouſly call them; and it is their fault if they obey not. It

is Gods infinite mercy, that election, which is ſuch a comfortable point, may be revealed to Gods children; and that reprobation, which is ſo intolerable and bitter, is not revealed to the reprobate. Nevertheleſſe let me adde, That ſome particular men have known their own reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Cain and Judas,<note place="margin">Shrewd ſignes of it.</note> &amp;c. And there be ſhrewd ſignes of it: (I do not ſpeak it as though I meant to perſwade any man that he is one, but onely that he may take heed of them.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. Malicing the known truth is a very ſhrewd ſigne: As, when men know that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is pleaſing to God, and yet they hate a man for it; when men know the miniſter is commanded to rebuke ſinne, and yet they will ſpite him for ſo doing: this is a very ſhrewd ſigne. Paul perſecuted the truth; <hi>but yet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I obteined mercy, becauſe I did it ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 1. Tim. 1.13. intimating that if he had done it againſt knowledge he had been in danger to have found no mercy. And therefore ye that mock and hate thoſe wayes which God hath commanded, I beſeech you, take heed leſt ye ſin unpardonably.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Abſolute apoſtaſie is a ſhrewd ſigne too of reprobation: When men have been very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the profeſſion of the truth, and fall totally away and prove miſerably profane, as the Apoſtle, ſheweth, Heb. 6.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Finall impenitency. This is an infallible ſigne of reprobation, when a man liveth in ſin, dieth in ſin, &amp; goeth away without repentance. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> There be many of us have ſtood out
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62503:12"/>
long in impenitency; let us take heed leſt if we ſtay any longer we fall upon this great evil.</p>
            <p>I return to the point:<note place="margin">That a man may know his eſtate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> A man may come to the knowledge of his own eſtate before God. I do not mean, Whether he be in the ſtate of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or reprobation: but he may know, Whether he be in the ſtate of ſalvation or damnation, that is, Whether he be in the way that leadeth to heaven or hell, Whether he be in ſuch a caſe that if he die now he ſhall be ſaved or not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Every man may thus know in what eſtate he is;</p>

               <hi>He that hath this hope purgeth himſelf.</hi> Mark; the Apoſtle telleth us what eſtate that man is in who purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf; he is in a very good eſtate, in a ſtate of true hope in Chriſt. And ſo 1. Cor. 6.10. the Apoſtle nameth divers who are not in the ſtate of ſalvation but of damnation: if they die in ſuch caſe they cannot inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven. So that if a man will but ſearch the word, and believe that God doth ſay true, he may know his eſtate.</p>

            <p>Before I come to the Uſes let us conſider theſe three things:

                  <item>2. Conſider that the greateſt part of the world never mend their eſtates: But as they were born in a curſed eſtate, ſo they live and die in it. And I ſpeak not this of heathen onely; but alas! how many in the viſible church do ſo? How many were there in the church of Philippi whom the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62503:13"/>

Nay more then ſo; Many of them who ſeek to get into a good eſtate miſſe of it and periſh. See, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate:</hi> Mark; it's a ſtrait gate, and letteth but few in: <hi>for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall ſeek to enter in and ſhall not be able.</hi> Here and there a few even where the conſtant miniſtery is.</item>

And that hath made way now to a treatiſe of conſcience; which will ſhew us what eſtate we are in before God. I deſire to handle it common-place-wiſe: And firſt I will tell you in brief what the conſcience of every man is. I ſay, of every <hi>man</hi>: For Angels and devils have a conſcience too: ye may ſee it in the ſpeech of the Angel to John when John would have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him, <hi>I am thy fellow-ſervant,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Rev. <hi>19.10</hi>

               <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time.</hi> See; they had a conſcience that told them there would be a time when they ſhould be further tormented. But I am not to ſpeak of ſuch conſciences, but of the conſcience of man. Now the conſcience of man is the judgement of man upon himſelf as he is ſubject

to Gods judgement. Divines uſe to expreſſe it in this Syllogiſme, <hi>He that truly believeth in Chriſt ſhall be ſaved</hi>: My conſcience telleth me this is Gods word. <hi>But I believe truly in Chriſt</hi>: My conſcience telleth me this alſo. <hi>Therefore I ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And ſo alſo on the contrary ſide.

                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.</note> As it is impoſſible the fire ſhould be without heat, ſo it is impoſſible that any man ſhould be without a conſcience. Indeed we uſe to ſay, Such an one hath no conſcience: but our meaning is, that he hath no good conſcience. But every one hath a conſcience, either good or bad. The Lord engraved conſcience in man when he created him at firſt. True it is, ſince the fall of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is miſerably corrupted; but man can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put it off: Conſcience continueth for ever in every man, whether he be in earth or heaven or hell. The moſt baſe and deviliſh profanelings in the world have a conſcience: Let them choke it or ſmother it as much as they can, let them whore it or game it or drink it away as much as they are able for their hearts; yet conſcience will continue in ſpite of their teeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No length of time can wear this conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence out. What made Joſephs brethren to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the cruel uſage they ſhewed him but conſcience? It was about tvventy years before; yet they could not vvear it out.</p>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:62503:19"/>2. No violence nor force is able to ſuppreſſe conſcience but that one day or other it will ſhew it ſelf. What made Judas go and carry back the money that he betrayed our Saviour for, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to cry out, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> but conſcience? No queſtion but he laboured to ſuppreſſe it; but he could not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No greatneſſe nor power is able to ſtifle conſcience, but that it will one day like a band-dog flie in a ſinners face. What made Pharaoh crie out, <hi>I am wicked,</hi> but conſcience? He vvas a great King; and yet he vvas not able to over-povver conſcience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. No muſick, mirth, or jovializing can charm conſcience, but it vvill play the devil to a vvretched ſoul for all that. What vvas the evil ſpirit of melancholy that came upon Saul, but conſcience? He thought to allay it with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of muſick; but it ſtill came again.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Death it ſelf is not able to part conſcience from a ſinner. What is that vvorm that ſhall never die, but onely conſcience? and in hell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is as that fire that never goeth out.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe ſome ſeem to have loſt conſcience quite: They can omit good duties as though they had no conſcience at all: they can deferre repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and turning to God as though they had no more conſcience then a beaſt: but one day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience vvill appear, and ſhevv plainly, that it vvas preſent vvith them every moment of their lives, and privie to all their thoughts and all their vvayes, and ſet before them all the things that they have done.

Conſcience is a ſtanding power in a man that is evermore with him, and will evermore judge him and condemne him if he be guiltie before God. It will be with him when his dumpiſh fit is over.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> over life and death. All the world have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in ſome meaſure what is good and what is not, what is to be done and what not, what is according to conſcience and what not: All the world have this knowledge in ſome meaſure; I do not ſay, enough for ſalvation, but enough to make them inexcuſable before God for not following that light, and not living according to that knowledge which they have. If there were not ſome light in this behalf, ſome knowledge of the law of God in every man, conſcience could do nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Knowledge of our ſelves: This alſo is the light that conſcience acteth by. There is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ſome meaſure of knowledge of himſelf according to the meaſure of knowledge that he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62503:21"/>
hath of Gods law. Our conſciences look back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward; forward to Gods law, and backward on our ſelves, Whether we be ſuch as Gods law requireth, yea or no. Firſt, ye may find this in good men. This light did the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of David go by: <hi>I was upright before God,</hi> ſaith his conſcience,<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>18.23.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and I kept my ſelf from mine own iniquitie.</hi> His conſcience had a light whereby he knew what he did. Secondly, ye ſhall find this in wicked men. This light the conſcience of Achan went by: <hi>I have ſinned against the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſh. <hi>7.20.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and thus and thus have I done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the two lights that every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience goes by: It hath light in ſome meaſure to know the law of God, what he ſhould do and what he ſhould not do; and it hath light in ſome meaſure to know himſelf, what he hath done or not done, whether he hath done as he ſhould yea or no. Now theſe two lights are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; as thus I prove.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the knowledge of Gods law is neceſſary, For elſe conſcience cannot work. A drunkard might be drunk every day in the yeare, and yet conſcience could not trouble him nor condemne him of ſinne unleſſe he knew the law, That God hath forbid drunkenneſſe. And ſo the ſwearer. And ſo evil words and bad thoughts conſcience cannot accuſe for, unleſſe there be ſo much light as to know they are forbidden. And therefore Divines do all ſay that the <hi>Syntereſis</hi> is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the exerciſe of conſcience. The <hi>Syntereſis</hi> is this: When a man keeps in his mind the knowledge of the things conteined in Gods law:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62503:22"/>
namely, That we muſt obey God, honour our parents, not commit adultery, not kill, not ſteal, not lie, not covet, &amp;c. Unleſſe the knowledge of theſe be kept in mind conſcience cannot work. And therefore when we would ſtirre a mans conſcience, we appeal to his knowledge; <hi>Know you not that the unrighteous ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdome of God?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>6.9.</hi>
                  </note> As if he had ſaid, Your own conſciences may condemne you to the pit of hell if ye be unrighteous, becauſe your <hi>Syntereſis</hi> can tell you that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God. This is the reaſon why we ſay that there is a naturall conſcience and there is an illuminated conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; becauſe ſome have no light but onely the light of nature, ſome have beſides the light of Gods word, which ſheweth that which nature ſheweth, and much more clearly, and teacheth many things more which nature cannot teach: And hence the conſcience of the illightned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth for ſuch things as the naturall conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence never ſtirreth about.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the knowledge of our ſelves is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; elſe conſcience cannot act neither. Though we know what Gods law requireth and what not, what is good and what not, yet unleſſe we know whether we go with it or againſt it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot accuſe nor excuſe. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; A cloſe hypocrite, he knoweth well enough that the Lord hath condemned hypocriſie, and that hypocrites muſt have their portion in hell: yet if he do not know himſelf to be an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, his conſcience can never condemne him for being one. And therefore both theſe knowledges
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62503:22"/>
are neceſſary, as vvell the knovvledge of a mans ſelf as of Gods lavv. Many vvho had a hand in crucifying our Saviour, ſinned grievouſly; yet they ſinned not againſt knovvledge, becauſe they knevv not vvhat they did: <hi>Father, forgive them,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is a contradiction to ſay a blind conſcience in act. The conſcience cannot be blind and yet actually condemne. Indeed the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it ſelf may be blind, but it can never act and be blind: If it truly accuſe or excuſe it muſt have ſome light. It is true, it may erroneouſly excuſe or accuſe, and yet have no true light: Seeming light is enough to do that: ſeeming knovvledge is enough to make conſcience erroneouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: As they vvho killed the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">John <hi>16.2.</hi>
                  </note> their conſciences excuſed them, and told them they did God good ſervice: they ſeemed to knovv it vvas good ſervice to God, and therefore their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences excuſed them, &amp;c.

                  </note> to let us ſee the infinite neceſſity of knovvledge. As good have no conſcience at all as conſcience vvithout knowledge: for it cannot act and perform its office. This is the reaſon vvhy ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands go on in their ſinnes vvithout repentance, becauſe being ignorant they have no conſcience to prick them thereunto: as Jer. 8.6. <hi>No man repenteth him of his wickedneſſe, ſaying, What have I done?</hi> Why, vvhat vvas the reaſon that conſcience did not prick them, and ſay, This thou haſt done and that, Thus ye have rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

                  </note>Another uſe is, to exhort us that we would labour to perfect the light of conſcience, that it may be able to guide us and direct us unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Our conſcience hath knowledge enough by the light of nature to make us inexcuſable, and to clear the juſtice of God though he ſhould damne us for ever: but there muſt be a greater light then that, that muſt guide us to heaven. O let us pray to Chriſt the true light to ſet up this light in us, that we may never be at a loſſe in our way to happineſſe, never ſtep out of the right path but our conſcience may be able to put us in again, never go ſlowly but our conſcience may ſpurre us on faſter; that our conſcience may not be like the ſnuff of a candle in a ſocket, that fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth up now and then, and then is dark again, and again it flameth out and is dark again: A man may ſee his book by it, but he cannot ſee to reade; he may ſee his pen and ink by it, but he cannot ſee to write; a woman may ſee her needle and cloth by it, but ſhe cannot ſee to work: ſo it is with ſome mens conſciences: Their light is ſo dimme that they can ſee the duties, but they cannot ſee to do them; they can ſee the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, but they cannot ſee to obey them. O labour to perfect the light of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that ye may ſee to walk by them.

                  </note>The properties that are given unto conſcience in the diſcharge of its office are foure: 1. It is ſupreme; 2. It is impartiall; 3. It is faithfull; 4. It is privie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſupreme: It hath higheſt authoritie; it is the moſt uncontrollable and ableſt witneſſe that can be: the greateſt, weightieſt witneſſe in the world; better then ten thouſand witneſſes. Though all the world do condemne us, yet if our own conſciences do not, we need not fear: And ſo on the contrary, if conſcience do condemne us, it will be ſmall comfort though all the world flatter and commend and excuſe us. It is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme witneſſe: Though all the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould come and bear witneſſe, their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not ſo uncontrollable as conſcience is. There is no appealing from the witneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; we muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe and condemne us, the Lord onely is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then our conſcience, 1. John 3.20. and will
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62503:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
give judgement with it when it doth its office. And if our conſcience do not condemne us, we may be confident to ſtand before all the judges and kings in the vvorld, yea, <hi>we may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence towards God,</hi> ſaith the text. And as conſcience is ſupreme in bearing of witneſſe, ſo alſo it is ſupreme in commanding. All the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of it are powerfull and ſupreme: it will not be ſlighted: it bindeth kings and princes: Nay, though God himſelf command the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet can we not diſobey conſcience without ſinne. By this it appeareth, that when conſcience doth witneſſe its witneſſe is ſupreme; when conſcience commandeth, its command is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſcience as it is ſupreme in witneſſing or commanding ſo it is impartiall in judging. It reſpecteth no perſons, no eſtates, but accuſeth the richeſt as well as the pooreſt, the greateſt as well as the meaneſt. It made great Belſhazzar ſo to quake <hi>that the joynts of his loyns were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another,</hi> Dan. 5.6. It made great Felix to tremble to heare Paul ſpeak of righteouſneſſe and of judgement. Felix thought to ſcare Paul; but conſcience ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Felix. So on the other ſide, it is impartiall in excuſing. It will give evidence of the good works of the pooreſt in the world as well as of the wealthieſt. Art thou never ſo mean? thy conſcience will be as ready to excuſe thee if thou haſt done well, as if thou wert the greateſt. It is impartiall in its office: Others, it may be, dare not or will not accuſe, but conſcience ſpareth none, no not it ſelf: Though its accuſations do
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62503:25"/>
load and burden and torment it ſelf, yet it will do its office.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſcience alſo is faithfull in its office and ſincere. It alwaies ſpeaketh of us as it thinketh: It may be deceived and miſtaken for a time, but it never ſpeaketh contrary to what it thinketh: It is a faithfull and ſincere witneſſe of our thoughts, words, actions, and courſes, whether they be good or evil, ſo farre as it is illightned by Gods word. It ever giveth evidence aright; it never flattereth nor condemneth any without a cauſe: It is a faithfull and a very upright wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Others may diſſemble with us, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us and applaud us when we are naught, and call us good men and good women when we are nothing ſo: but this will tell us plainly how vile and ſinfull we are; and if we ſay we are good when we are not, it will tell us plainly we lie.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It beareth witneſſe of every good dutie we perform and of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good is in us. Though all Jobs friends ſpake evil of him, and God himſelf by his outward judgements ſeemed to condemne him for a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, yet ſtill his conſcience (like a faithfull witneſſe) did not forſake him nay, it offered to reaſon with God himſelf,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>I would reaſon with God: I know I ſhall be juſtified, and I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſake mine innocency till I die.</hi> Still his conſcience ſtood for him and excuſed him.

               <p n="4">4. It is moſt privy to what it doth witneſſe.

                  </note> Seeing conſcience is ſo ſupreme, ſo impartiall, ſo ſaithfull, ſo privy, we ſhould take heed how we do any thing that might give it advantage againſt us. If we were to appear before an earthly judge to anſwer for our behaviour, and ſhould have a companion preſent continually with us, marking every thing in us, telling us of every fault, and witneſſing it againſt us unto the judge, how carefull would we be of doing any thing that might give him advantage againſt us? Lo, we have conſcience as a continuall watch-man, eſpying out all our wayes, ſetting down whatever we do amiſſe, checking us for it for the preſent, and one day accuſing us before God and ſetting all things in order before our faces; Oh how ſhould we then labour to get into Chriſt Jeſus, that our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences may be purged in his bloud, and ſtudy all our life long to keep peace and friendſhip with them.

               <p>This I have ſpoken for the office of conſcience, which is to bear witneſſe either with us or againſt us: Now the parts of this bearing witneſſe are,

firſt, its ſingle witneſſing; ſecondly, its judiciall witneſſing.

David in a particular deceit was ignorant:<note place="margin">

He was deceived in that particular; but he knew very well the generall and chief bent of his heart, that it was truly ſet upon God and upon holineſſe. 2. It is true, many men take it that their hearts are ſet upon God when they are not: but what is the reaſon? Not becauſe they do not or may not know the contrary, that they love the world moſt: but becauſe they will not know it, they are unwilling to believe it, they are loth to have any bad conceit of themſelves. So that when Jeremy ſaith, <hi>The heart is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full above all things: who can know it?</hi> his meaning is, What carnall man can abide to know the worſt of himſelf? 3. It is not becauſe they know it not, but becauſe they will not heare the teſtimony of conſcience: but when it telleth them truly how the caſe is with them, they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the rotten and broken pieces of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

together to ſtop the mouth of conſcience, and to perſwade themſelves to think well of themſelves. 4. Men ſeem not to know their own hearts, not becauſe they do not know what they are, but becauſe they are ignorant of Gods law whereby they ſhould judge of themſelves. They know their hearts are ſet on the world, and that the bent and frame of their affections are placed on earthly things: but they hope an under-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to God will be accepted, to love God in the ſecond place will ſerve the turn.

               <p>Yet further concerning this judiciall vvitneſſe of conſcience: It is either about things to be done or omitted, or things already done or omitted. The judiciall vvitneſſe of conſcience about things to be done or omitted is double: 1. To judge out of Gods lavv vvhether it be good or evil; 2, To counſel out of our ovvn judgements either to do it or forbear it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the nature of the action is: If it be good, conſcience vvill counſel us to do it; if bad, to forbear it. The judiciall vvitneſſe of conſcience about things already done is fourefold: 1. To approve; 2. To abſolve; 3. To miſlike; 4. To condemne. I begin vvith the firſt, the judiciall vvitneſſe of conſcience about things to be done or omitted: vvhere I ſhall conſider, firſt, the Office of conſcience in this behalf, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. To judge, 2. To counſel: and then the Adjuncts of conſcience in diſcharging this office.</p>

As vve trie the vveight of gold by a pair of balances, ſo conſcience trieth all our actions by Gods vvord. It is the oracle of God: As the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62503:30"/>
Jevvs vvent to Gods oracle to enquire of the Lord, ſo our conſcience is Gods oracle to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of and to determine of things whether they be good or evil: It is a judge in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.

And ſo may many men be put upon many good duties, not for any love or liking of that which is good, but becauſe they would pleaſe and ſatisfie conſcience, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe will not ſuffer them to be quiet.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62503:33"/>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                     </note> vve muſt not obey conſcience erring or counſelling to that vvhich is evil; For our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of conſcience doth not make the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the lavv to be no ſinne; though an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous conſcience lead us to tranſgreſſe it. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the lavv of God is above conſcience; and therefore the commandment of Gods lavv ſtandeth in full force though conſcience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand contrary to it. Suppoſe a man ſhould think in his conſcience he might not take an oath though never ſo lawfully called thereunto by the magiſtrate and in never ſo neceſſary a caſe, when as the word of God commandeth us to ſwear in truth, in righteouſneſſe, and in judgement; I muſt follow the commandment of God rather then conſcience, becauſe Gods law is above con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. 2. Becauſe if I follovv my conſcience vvhen it is in an errour, I offend not onely againſt Gods lavv but I offend alſo my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: For though for the preſent while conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is erroneous it doth not take offenſe, yet vvhen it cometh to ſee its ovvn errour then it will. Therefore this is our firſt anſvver, We muſt not obey conſcience erring, or counſelling to that which is evil. If our conſcience ſhould counſel us to tell a lie to help our neighbour, that is evil and againſt Gods lavv; and therefore if in doing it vve do obey conſcience, vve ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly vve anſwer,<note place="margin">2.</note> That an erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience vvhatever it commandeth (though the lavv of God commandeth the clean contrary) yet vve cannot diſobey it vvithout ſinne. For this is a conſtant rule, We alwayes ſinne vvhen vve diſobey conſcience: If conſcience erre not,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62503:34"/>
then in diſobeying it vve ſinne double, againſt the law and againſt conſcience: if conſcience do erre and vve diſobey it, vve ſinne too; for though vve do not ſinne againſt the lavv, yet vve ſinne againſt conſcience, and ſo againſt the lavv too; not as though vve vvere bound to obey conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vvhen it erreth, and yet vve ſinne if vve diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, Albeit it be alvvayes a ſinne to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey conſcience though it erre, yet it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes a ſinne to obey conſcience when it erreth. Let us conſider three propoſitions, and you ſhall ſee vvhat I mean. Firſt, If conſcience think that to be commanded which is abſolutely forbidden, or that to be forbidden vvhich is expreſſely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, then vve ſinne vvhich ſide ſoever we take: As if an ignorant man thinks in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that he is bound to pray to Saints depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which thing the Lord hath expreſſely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden: if this man do pray unto Saints, he ſinneth, becauſe the Lord hath expreſſely forbid him to do it; if he do not pray unto Saints, he ſinneth too, becauſe his conſcience telleth him he is commanded to pray unto them. The ſecond propoſition is this, If conſcience hold a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to do or not to do which yet is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different but abſolutely commanded, then it is alwayes a ſinne not to do it, but it is no ſinne to do it. The third propoſition is this, If conſcience hold a thing neceſſarie which God hath left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as if a man in conſcience thought that he o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght to pray foure times a day (which thing yet God hath left indifferent) in this he is bound to obey conſcience though it erre. And it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62503:34"/>
is no ſinne to obey conſcience thus erring; though it be a ſinne in conſcience thus to erre.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of this is, I.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> To let us ſee vvhat a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſovereigne thing a mans conſcience is. It is alvvayes a ſinne to diſobey conſcience vvhether it erre or no, as it is alvvayes a ſinne to diſobey God. A man can never go againſt his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but he ſinneth. 1. Becauſe conſcience is our guide: It is our invvard and our inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble guide; vve can never come by any direction but by conſcience; vve can never let in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God but onely by conſcience: and therefore the Lord hath made it a very ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne thing. 2. Becauſe vve break a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment through the loyns of a ſinne, vvhen vve go againſt conſcience. Ajax light upon a beaſt and ſlevv it: his conſcience thought verily it vvas a man; <hi>Kill it not,</hi> ſaith conſcience, <hi>it is a man:</hi> he goeth againſt his conſcience and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it. His conſcience here vvas in an errour, yet he as truly guilty of murder before God as if he had indeed ſlain a man, becauſe he ſlevv a man through the loyns of this beaſt: His bloudy mind looked at a man, and ſmote at a man, and ſlevv a man. So vvhen conſcience is erroneous, and thinketh this is a commandment of God; it is not ſo, but he thinketh it ſo in his conſcience; if he do contrary he breaketh a commandment though it be none, becauſe the errour of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience made it one to him. Was not Herod tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of the murder of Chriſt? He thought in his conſcience that Chriſt had been among the infants ſlain at Bethlehem. Thus conſcience is a ſovereigne thing: It is alvvayes a ſinne to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62503:35"/>
go againſt it erre or not erre: and if it be a ſinne to go againſt conſcience vvhen it erreth, vvhat a ſinne is it to go againſt it vvhen it doth not erre?</p>

This may ſerve for a vvord of exhortation, to exhort men to bevvare leſt they ſinne againſt conſcience; eſpecially vvhen conſcience is in the right. Conſcience is as Gods face in a man: when conſcience looketh on thee, the Lord looketh on thee. It is true, the Lord looketh on thee alvvayes: but thou mayeſt ſee the Lords looking upon thee vvhen conſcience looketh on thee: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou never ſinneſt againſt conſcience but thou provokeſt the Lord to his face,<note place="margin">

If it be ſuch a ſinne to ſinne againſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in an errour, it is much more a ſinne to ſinne againſt conſcience it being in the right. Thus much of a conſcience erring.</p>

As for example; When one doubteth of the lawfulneſſe of playing at cards and dice; he is ſure it is no ſinne not to play, but whether he may lawfully play he doubteth: in this caſe he is bound not to play. So when one doubteth whether it be a ſinne not to call his family together every day to prayer; Gods miniſters tell him he muſt or he ſinneth: <hi>I doubt of that,</hi> ſaith he. Do you ſo? but you are ſure it is no ſinne to do it: Therefore you are bound to do it, becauſe you are bound to decline the doubtfull part and take that which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.

                        <hi>Rule</hi> 2.</note> When conſcience doubteth on both ſides which is the ſinne and which not, then a man ought to do that which is moſt void of offenſe. As for example; Say an Anabaptiſt amongſt us doubteth whether it be a ſinne in him to bring his child to church to be baptized, or a ſinne to refuſe; here is rule is, That that which is moſt void of offenſe, and moſt agreeable to brotherly unity and concord, is to be taken, the balance hanging otherwiſe even; and the arguments to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62503:36"/>
urge both the one or the other ſeeming of like weight, then this muſt be put into the ſcale and reſolve the doubt.</p>

                        <hi>Rule</hi> 3.</note>3. It is lawfull to do ſome things when yet our conſcience doubteth of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them. For we muſt conſider there are two kinds of doubting: there is a ſpeculative doubting, and there is a practicall doubting. Speculative doubting is to doubt of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the thing it ſelf to be done: Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall doubting is to doubt of the lawfulneſſe of the doing of it. Now this latter is not alwayes a ſinne, but the other is: As for example; If a ſervant be commanded of his maſter to attend on him on the Lords day, he knoweth not what his buſineſſe ſhould be, and perhaps doubteth it is not of ſuch moment as to be done on that day; yet he hath no reaſon to deny his attendance: in this caſe though he doubt of the lawfulneſſe of the thing done, yet he need not doubt of the doing of it, becauſe he knoweth not what the buſineſſe is, and hath no reaſon whereby he is able to juſtifie his refuſall.

                     <note place="margin">5.

This is a very rare conſcience: It is rare to find a conſcience every way faithfull. For, to ſay the truth, conſcience is alwayes faithfull in it ſelf; for it knoweth not how to deal deceitfully with any man:<note place="margin">

Again, a watchfull conſcience taketh notice of every motion and inclination to evil: it is awake to ſee when evil is conceived; to tell us of it, to oppoſe it, and to diſſwade us from it: like a watchman on the top of a tower, alwayes awake to ſee when any danger approcheth. It is Gods miniſter with eyes on every ſide, to eſpie ſeaſons of good, and ſtirre up to make uſe of them; and of evil, and give warning to avoid them.</p>

As civil people, that cannot ſwallow down couzenage and injuſtice, and yet neglect of prayer and other religious duties never

Thus it was with David. It cannot be thought but his conſcience ſaid, <hi>Plot not againſt Vriah's life:</hi> But he would; and ſo conſcience let him do it. This conſcience will be anſwered with every ſlight and idle excuſe: As when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience telleth one, <hi>Your wayes are not good: I wiſh you to repent, and make your peace with God</hi>; it may be the man anſwereth, <hi>Yea, ſo I mean to do; but I cannot yet intend it: when I have diſpatched ſuch and ſuch buſineſſe then I will do it.</hi> If conſcience ſpeak again, <hi>Yea, but you were beſt to do it now; True,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I know it, I know it.

This conſcience is like Eli, which ſaid, <hi>Ye do not well, my ſonnes,</hi> but exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed

                     </note>By this we ſee the dangerous eſtate of thoſe men who have ſuch a conſcience. There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who live in many ſinnes, in carnall courſes, ſome in company-keeping and drunkenneſſe, ſome in hatred and variance, ſome in chambering and wantonneſſe, ſome in covetouſneſſe and love of this preſent world: your conſciences, no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can ſay, <hi>Ye ſhould do well to be more godly, to look more after Chriſt and after heaven, and ye ſhould do well to get the truth of ſaving grace</hi>; yet it may be they ſay nothing or nothing to the purpoſe in this behalf. Therefore is theſe mens caſe ſo dangerous becauſe their conſciences are ſo ſilent and ſo remiſſe. They have loſt the moſt ſovereigne remedy, namely conſcience. Conſcience is the moſt ſovereigne means (under God and his holy Spirit) to work repentance in men that can be; and is it not dangerous to have it prove traiterous and unfaithfull? What good can the miniſterie of the word do unto you when every idle and falſe excuſe or pretenſe which the wiſdome of the fleſh can deviſe can ſtop the mouth of your conſcience when it calleth upon you to do what the word requireth? It muſt needs be dangerous, and ſo much the more becauſe it is ſo pleaſing unto you: ye take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſuch ſilent, and large, and remiſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull conſciences; ye love not to have your conſciences too buſie with you; ye like not that your conſciences ſhould be too clamorous and importunate with you; ye would have them not too rigid and vehement againſt your ſinnes. It
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62503:43"/>
fareth with you as with many young men who have ſold themſelves unto folly, and think none their friends but paraſites that flatter them, or thoſe who connive and wink at their folly: but ſuch friends will ſoon prove foes, and ſo will ſuch moderate and quiet conſciences. It is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing to have ſuch a ſilent conſcience; to want the chief means under God of doing a man good. It was conſcience that told the lepers,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 7.9.</note> 
                     <hi>We do not well to hold our peace</hi>: It was conſcience that never would let the prodigall ſonne be quiet till he returned to his father, and ſaid unto him, <hi>I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſonne</hi>: It is conſcience that is the moſt powerfull means under God to quicken a man up to repentance and obedience; and therefore they are in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable caſe that want this great help.</p>

                        <item>1. Ignorance is one cauſe why a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is unfaithfull, when we do not labour to have conſcience throughly illightened and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Who are more careleſſe and negligent of their duties both to God and man? who can with more freedome lye, ſteal, covet, ſinne, &amp;c. then thoſe that are ignorant of the law of God? They know not that they do ſo much hurt to their own ſouls as they do. An ignorant mind hath alwayes an evil conſcience. It is impoſſible conſcience ſhould be faithfull where it is not il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened: and hence it cometh to paſſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſo negligent and unfaithfull, becauſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62503:44"/>
we have been ſo careleſſe of informing it. Thy conſcience muſt needs be ſilent as long as thou art ignorant.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15.</note> Ignorance is ſoon put to ſilence.</item>
                        <item>2. A ſecond cauſe is often ſlighting of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It may be conſcience ſpeaketh not, or but coldly and remiſſely, becauſe when it hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, and counſelled, and admoniſhed; thou haſt neglected it and diſregarded it from time to time. Though it judge and counſel, yet thou wilt not liſten: Like Caſſandra the propheteſſe, who though her predictions were true and certain, yet were they never believed: ſo though conſcience ſpeaketh true, yet men follow it not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it becometh ſilent when it is not regarded, but all its counſel, and adviſe, and perſwaſions ſlighted and neglected. Hence, I ſay, it cometh to paſſe that for want of imployment it is ſtill and falleth aſleep, till the time come that it muſt be awaked.</item>
                        <item>3. The third cauſe is that violence that is often offered unto it. Many times when conſcience perſwadeth to any good duty, or diſſwadeth from any evil courſe, men will do againſt it and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it violently, and put off the wholeſome adviſe of it: hence it cometh to paſſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience having ſo many injuries offered unto it, beginneth to provide for its own eaſe, and ſo ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is ſilent and ſaith nothing, or elſe is ſoon anſwered and rebuked; as it was with Moſes: When Pharaoh would never hearken unto Moſes, but ſtill fell to excuſes, and at laſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all, he would not let Iſrael go notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that Moſes could urge, but ſaid to Moſes <hi>Get thee from me</hi>;<note place="margin">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62503:44"/>
face no more</hi>; Moſes then anſwered, <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken well: I will ſee thy face no more.</hi> So it is with conſcience; When men have been obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and have refuſed to heare it, and would have it ſpeak no more, <hi>Thou haſt well ſpoken,</hi> ſaith conſcience: <hi>henceforth I will trouble you no more, but let you alone to take your courſe: I will adviſe you no more; or if I do, I will not be any more importunate.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. A fourth cauſe is, that men do wilfully ſtop the mouth of conſcience: If it beginneth to ſpeak, preſently they buſie themſelves about other things; or if that will not do, they runne into companie, and there ſpend their time, that the howlings of conſcience may not be heard; and if ſtill it be loud, they ſtrike up the drumme, and ring all the bells, that the voice of it may be utterly drowned: and ſo conſcience at laſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſtand by, to heare and ſee and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. By this means many times it falleth out that thoſe who have had very turbulent and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous conſciences not ſuffering them to be quiet, have at laſt tamed them and put them quite to ſilence; or if they do ſpeak, it is ſo coldly and remiſſely that they care not whether they be obeyed or no. Oh theſe are damnable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh deviſes! Whoever ye be that do thus, ye are in a dangerous eſtate, and ye carry the brands of hell and damnation upon you. If ever you deſire to avoid this dangerous eſtate, then ſhun the cauſe: Labour to have your conſcience throughly illightned and informed by the word of God, that it may reade you your duty. A friend that knoweth but little can give but little
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62503:45"/>
counſel. Again, give heed evermore to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of conſcience. You know Achitophel took it ill that his counſel was not followed; therefore he made away himſelf in diſpleaſure: So conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will take it very ill if its counſel be not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: it will ſtrangle it ſelf, and ſmother it ſelf; you ſhall heare no more of it. Eſpecially take heed you do not reject conſcience, nor offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to it: If you do, you will make it unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and remiſſe; and then you loſe the beſt means under heaven of your good: Then dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit ſucceedeth, and hardneſſe of heart taketh place, and you deprive your ſouls of all poſſibility of cure. As long as a ſickman hath any poſſibility of cure he is ſtill under hope; but if ever he loſe that he is gone: Conſcience is the poſſibilitie of the ſoul to amendment; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you dull conſcience, and make conſcience remiſſe and unfaithfull, you take the ready way to deprive your ſelves of all poſſibility of riſing again. Conſider theſe things, and have a care of your conſciences.</item>

                  <p>THe ſecond part of the office of conſcience is to abſolve and acquit. Thus Samuel plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his innocency, had his conſcience teſtifying for him,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſe ox have I taken? or whom have I defrauded</hi>? and his conſcience abſolved him as clear and free from thoſe ſinnes. Thus alſo Job; <hi>If I have lifted up my hand againſt the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, when I ſaw my help in the gate; If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced becauſe my wealth is great; If I have not given my bread to the hungry; or if I have rejoyced at the miſery of mine enemie: then let it be thus and thus to me.</hi> His conſcience abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him as clear of thoſe ſinnes. Nay, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a child of God doth not onely abſolve him from the guilt of thoſe ſinnes which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver committed, but alſo from the guilt of thoſe ſinnes which he hath committed againſt God or againſt man. It can tell him he hath truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and truly been humbled, and truly got pardon. Ye know David had committed divers ſinnes: yet when he had humbled his ſoul before God, and obtained pardon, his conſcience telleth him as much and abſolveth him, Pſal. 103.3. <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who forgiveth

But that miſlike of conſcience which now I ſpeak of is of things that are ill done, that is, not done in truth and ſincerity. Thus it is in all that are not renewed by the holy Ghoſt: The office of their conſcience indeed is to miſlike what they do: When they have prayed, their conſcience can miſlike it, and ſay, <hi>I have not prayed with a heavenly mind, a holy heart:</hi> When they have been at a Sacrament, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can truly miſlike it, and ſay, <hi>I have not been a fit gueſt at Christs table,</hi> &amp;c. When they are croſſed and tempted, their conſciences truly miſlike their carriage, and ſay, <hi>I do not fight and reſiſt, but readily and willingly yield to every invitation to evil.</hi> Do ye not think that Jeroboams conſcience miſliked his altering Gods worſhip, his innovating religion, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Iſrael to ſinne? do not ye think his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence miſliked him for theſe things? Do not ye

think that Nabals conſcience miſliked his gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? and Doegs conſcience miſliked his ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering? and Paſhurs conſcience miſliked his oppoſing and miſuſing Jeremie? and the old prophets conſcience miſliked his lying?

This ſhould be a means to keep us from ſinne, and to keep us in a holy life: for according to our works ſo will be the evidences of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, whether they be good or evil. We had need to take heed what we write in our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; for according to what is written there ſo ſhall we be judged. Therefore if any ſinne ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon record in our conſciences, we had need get it blotted out by the bloud of Chriſt. Repent, be humbled, beg for pardon, reſt not till thou ſeeſt this debt-book conſcience croſſed, and thy ſinnes ſtand there cancelled and diſcharged.</p>
                  <p>THus I have ſhewed you the offices of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence about things heretofore done. Now let me ſhew you the affections of conſcience in the diſcharge of theſe offices. Ye have heard that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath foure offices in things heretofore done; 1. an office to approve; 2. an office to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve; 3. an office to diſlike; 4. an office to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne; The two former when we have done well and lived well; then the office of conſcience is to approve and abſolve: The two latter when we have done ill and lived ill; then the office of conſcience is to miſlike and to condemne. Now followeth the affections of conſcience in the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62503:48"/>
diſcharge of theſe offices; and they are foure: 1. A tender conſcience; 2. A ſleepie conſcience; 3. A benumbed conſcience; 4. A ſeared conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a tender conſcience; that is,<note place="margin">1. A tender conſcience.</note> a conſcience touched with the leaſt ſinne, and checking us for the leaſt ſinne; as for vain thoughts, exorbitant paſſions, idle words, and the like.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> Such was Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids conſcience, which ſmote him for cutting off the lap of Sauls garment. Such was Zaccheus his conſcience, which troubled him for ſuppoſed ſinnes: <hi>If I have wronged any man,</hi> ſaith he. He did not know; but his conſcience was ſo tender that it made him carefull of <hi>Ifs.</hi> This tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a ſingular bleſſing of God: And if we deſire to attain unto it we muſt labour to ſee the odiouſneſſe of ſinne, yea the malignity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding evil there is in the leaſt ſinne: this will make us tender of it. Secondly, we muſt labour to mourn for every ſinne though it ſeem little: this alſo will keep our conſciences tender. And we have great cauſe to prize a tender conſcience. What got the Bethſhemites by not being tender in conſcience? They looked into the Ark, and becauſe they durſt venture upon it the Lord ſmote fifty thouſand of them at once.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.32, 36.</note> What got the man that gathered ſticks on the Sabbath for not being tender in conſcience? He was ſtoned to death. Conſcience ſhould tender the leaſt commandment of God, and ſo be tender of the committing the leaſt ſinne. This conſcience is a great bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond affection of conſcience is ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.<note place="margin">2. A ſleepy conſcience.</note> A ſleepy conſcience is not ſo quick in ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us as it ought: either it checks not, or elſe with ſuch faintneſſe that it worketh not upon us;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62503:49"/>
it maketh us never the more watchfull againſt ſinne. This we ſee by many who can commit ſuch ſinnes without trouble or diſquiet as would bring others on their knees and make them walk heavily long after. This ſleepy conſcience is very dangerous: it maketh men as ready to fall into the ſame ſinnes to morrow as to day, and next day as to morrow: it letteth them ſee their faults, but amendeth none; becauſe this is ſuch a conſcience as doth not cauſe men to feel the burden of their ſinnes. A man can never come to Chriſt as long as he hath a ſleepy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; becauſe it doth not cauſe ſinne to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome. They who have this conſcience can ſleep for all it, and eat and drink and be merry for all it: Now a man can never come to Chriſt that is not burdened with his ſinne, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear it, cannot be quiet for it, cannot ſleep for it:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28.</note> then Chriſt calleth him, <hi>Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will eaſe you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3. A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbed conſcience.</note>A benumbed conſcience; that is, ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as is in a deep ſleep. This differs from the former in degree. You know there is a leſſe ſleep, and there is a greater ſleep: There is a leſſe ſleep, when onely the outward ſenſes are bound; and there is a ſleep when the inward ſenſes are bound too. Now a benumbed conſcience is a conſcience that is in a deep ſleep; Preach to it, it mourneth not; cry to it, it liſteneth not: This is a benumbed conſcience. Nor the greatneſſe of ſinne, nor the wrath of God denounced againſt it can move it. Men can know themſelves guilty of ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, and yet not lay them to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62503:49"/>
heart: conſcience never telleth them about it. Thus the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of thoſe <hi>who knew the judgement of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32.</note> 
                     <hi>that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death, yet not onely do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them:</hi> Their conſciences though informed, and in ſome meaſure knowing the evil of their courſes and the ſeveritie of Gods judgement, yet let them go on ſtill, and not onely commit the evil themſelves, but delight to ſee others as bad as themſelves. Such are our ſwearers, and drunkards, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany-keepers, &amp;c. This is a very wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: the Lord deliver us from it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a ſeared conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is,<note place="margin">4. A ſeared conſcience.</note> ſuch a conſcience as ſpeaketh not a jote; <hi>ſeared with a hot iron,</hi> as the Apoſtles phraſe is, 1. Tim. 4.2. a ſenſeleſſe conſcience, a paſt-feeling conſcience: when men can ſwallow down ſinne like drink, oathes, contempt of God, his word and worſhip, mockage of Gods ſervants, hating to be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſuch as ſinne without any remorſe. This kind of conſcience is in foure ſorts of men: 1. In diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and profligate perſons; who like common ſtrumpets have their ſouls lie open to every ſinne that cometh by. 2. In obſtinate ſinners, ſuch as, like Ahab, have <hi>ſold themſelves to work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> 3. In ſcoffers and jeerers; who <hi>ſpeak evil of them who runne not in the ſame exceſſe of riot</hi> with themſelves, and nickname the godly. 4. In Apoſtates and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders; who <hi>ſpeak lies through hypocriſie,</hi> and have fallen from the profeſſion of the truth: All theſe men have a conſcience ſeared with a red-hot iron. This is a great judgement of God:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62503:50"/>
greater then this there cannot be: No outward judgement that can fall upon us is like unto it: not the plague, nor ſhame, nor beggery, no nor any curſe beſides hell it ſelf is equall to it. By this the onely means under God of repentance is taken away. Such may come to repent; but it is a thouſand to one if ever they do. It is like a graveſtone lying upon their conſciences, which keepeth them under untill the day of judgement: at which time God will awaken their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and then they will be more furious in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting then the very devils themſelves.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Uſe.</hi>
                     </note>Ye that are not yet fallen upon this wretched conſcience, I beſeech you take heed that ye never do. But ye will ask me, <hi>How may we avoid it?</hi> Avoid it? alas, ye may avoid it if ye be carefull: for conſcience never ſeareth it ſelf: If ever it be ſeared, it is ye your ſelves that do fear it. Indeed the mind of man may blind its own ſelf; and the heart of man may corrupt its own ſelf; and the affections of man may defile their own ſelves: but conſcience never corrupteth it ſelf, never ſeareth it ſelf. But you will ſay, <hi>What muſt I do to avoid this ſearing of conſcience</hi>?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, liſten to conſcience well, that whatever it ſaith to thee from God thou maiſt do it. This was the courſe of the Pſalmiſt; <hi>I will hearken what the Lord God will ſay in me</hi> (ſo ſome tranſlate it.) Heare then and liſten what the Lord God will ſay in thee, what thy conſcience illightened ſaith in thee, and do it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whenever this conſcience is quick follow it. Nothing more ſeareth conſcience then ſuffering quicknings to die. Blow the coles if
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62503:50"/>
they do but ſmoke. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Quench not the Spirit</hi>; ſo quench not conſcience.</p>
                  <p>I have hitherto ſhewed you that every man hath a conſcience, and the reaſons why God hath given us a conſcience, the light that it act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by, the offices of it, and the affections of it. Now from all theſe proceed two other adjuncts of conſcience: 1. A quiet conſcience; 2. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet conſcience.</p>

               <head>A quiet conſcience.</head>
               <p>COncerning a quiet conſcience three things are to be conſidered: 1. What a quiet conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is; 2. How it differeth from that quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which is in the wicked; 3. The examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether we have this quiet conſcience or no.</p>
               <p n="1">I. For the firſt, What a quiet conſcience is; It is that which neither doth nor can accuſe us, but giveth an honourable teſtimony of us in the courſe of our lives and converſations ever ſince we were regenerate (I put that in too: for 1. we do not begin to live till we be regenerate, and 2. we can never have a true quiet conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till then.) Such a quiet conſcience had good Obadiah; <hi>I fear the Lord from my youth,</hi>

                  </note> ſaith his conſcience: This was a very honourable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony that his conſcience gave him. Such a quiet conſcience had Enoch:<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Before his tranſlation he received this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God.</hi> Haymo ſaith,<note place="margin">Die<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nte ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ inquit ille.</note> this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was the teſtimony of Scripture, Gen. 5.24. where it is ſaid that he <hi>walked with God.</hi> This is true; but this is not all: The text ſaith not there was ſuch a teſtimony <hi>given
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62503:51"/>
of him,</hi> but <hi>he had it:</hi> and that <hi>before his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>; but the teſtimony of Moſes was after his tranſlation: Therefore it was the teſtimony of his conſcience that bore witneſſe within that he pleaſed God. So that this is a quiet conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which neither doth nor can accuſe us, but giveth an honourable teſtimony of us in the whole courſe of our life and converſation. Now to ſuch a quiet conſcience there be three things neceſſary: 1. Uprightneſſe, 2. Puritie, 3. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods love and favour.</p>
               <p>Firſt, uprightneſſe is when a man is obedient indeed. Many will be obedient, but they are not obedient indeed, not humbled indeed, not reformed indeed. What it is to be obedient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ye may ſee Exod. 23.22. <hi>But if thou ſhalt indeed obey his voyce, and do all that I ſhall ſpeak,</hi> &amp;c. Mark; that is obedience indeed when we do all that God ſpeaketh, and are obedient in all things. This is an upright conſcience, when the heart is bent to obedience in all things.<note place="margin">Acts <hi>23.1.</hi>
                  </note> An example we meet with in Paul; <hi>I have lived in all good conſcience before God untill this day.</hi> His conſcience could not accuſe him of any root of wickedneſſe and corruption allowed and cheriſhed in him: That is an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right conſcience. Haſt thou ſuch a conſcience as this, <hi>My conſcience can truly bear witneſſe there is no ſinne I favour my ſelf in, allow my ſelf in, but condemne all, strive againſt all.</hi> Thus David proveth that his conſcience was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; <hi>If I regard iniquitie in my heart, the Lord will not heare my prayer.</hi> The regarding of any iniquity will not ſtand with upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:62503:51"/>A ſecond thing required to a true quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is puritie. Though our heart be upright and ſtand generally bent to the Lords will, yet if we be guiltie of ſome particular ſinne this will hinder the quiet of our conſcience. Therefore ſaith Paul, <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>4.4.</hi>
                  </note> nothing to accuſe me; no corruption, no root of unbelief reigning in him: Infirmities he had many, and frailties he had many, and he knew them, but be knew nothing to accuſe him. Whatever was amiſſe in him, his conſcience told him he uſed all holy means againſt it. If thy conſcience can truly ſay thus alſo of thee, then haſt thou a truly quiet conſcience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Aſſurance of Gods love, favour, and pardon. Though we have fallen into great ſins, yet our conſciences may have quiet if we can be truly aſſured of Gods love and favour in the pardon of them.<note place="margin">Heb. <hi>10.2.</hi>
                  </note> The Apoſtle proveth that the <hi>ſacrifices</hi> of the law could not <hi>purge away ſinne</hi>; but onely Chriſts bloud can do it. His argument to prove it is this, Becauſe thoſe ſacrifices could not free a man from <hi>having conſcience of ſinne</hi>; they could not purge the conſcience: but Chriſts bloud can: After aſſurance of pardon in Chriſts bloud conſcience can no more condemne for ſinne, how many or how great ſoever the ſinnes were which have been committed. Theſe are the three things required to a true quiet conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Furthermore a quiet conſcience implieth two things: 1. A calmneſſe of ſpirit: 2. A chearfull, merry and comfortable heart. Theſe two I mean when I ſpeak of a quiet conſcience.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:62503:52"/>1. A calmneſſe of ſpirit, or a quietneſſe of mind, not troubled with the burden of ſinne nor the wrath of God, nor terrified with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due unto ſinne. This quietneſſe and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit is promiſed to all them that truly hearken unto Chriſt and obey him;<note place="margin">Prov. <hi>1.33.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Who ſo hearkeneth to me ſhall be quiet from fear of evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A chearfull, merry and joyfull heart. When our conſcience giveth a comfortable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of us, it cannot but make our hearts joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>This is our rejoycing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>the teſtimony of our conſcience,</hi> ſaith Paul: The comfortable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which his conſcience gave of him made him to rejoyce. A wicked man cannot truly rejoyce: no, though he be merrie and joviall and laugh, yet his carnall eſtate is a <hi>ſnare,</hi> he can have no true joy; <hi>but the righteous ſing and rejoyce,</hi> Prov. 29.6. No mirth like the mirth of a good conſcience. All other joy is but outſide, painted, ſeeming joy: That is onely true joy that is rooted in the comfortable teſtimonie of an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right good conſcience, which telleth a man his peace is made with God, and that whether he be in ſickneſſe or in health God loveth him, <hi>whether he live or die he is the Lords.</hi> Thus ye ſee what a quiet conſcience is.</p>

               <head>How a quiet conſcience in the godly differeth from the quiet conſcience that is in the wicked</head>
               <p>THe ſecond thing propounded to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about a quiet conſcience, is, How it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from that quiet conſcience which is in the wicked. 1. I confeſſe that the wicked ſeem to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62503:52"/>
have a very quiet conſcience: Many thouſands of carnall people ſeem to live and die in quiet. Look into alehouſes, lewd houſes, into all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; who ſo merrie and brisk, and heart-whole (as they ſay) as they who have no ſaving grace? Yet 2.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 21.23.</note> this quiet conſcience in them muſt needs differ from the quiet conſcience of the children of God. Certainly the Lord will not <hi>give the childrens bread unto dogs</hi>; neither will he ſmile upon their ſouls; neither doth he pardon the ſinnes nor accept the perſons of the ungodly: And therefore if they have a quiet conſcience, it muſt needs differ from that in the godly. Muſt not copper needs differ from gold? And we who are the Lords meſſengers muſt teach you the difference:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.23</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall teach my people the difference between the holy and the profane.</hi> Now the queſtion is this, Wherein lieth the difference between the quiet conſcience of the righteous and the quiet conſcience of the wicked? <hi>Anſw.</hi> The difference between them lieth in foure things: 1. In the thing it ſelf; 2. In the cauſe; 3. In the effect; 4. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In the thing it ſelf. The quiet conſcience in the godly is double; not onely apparentiall and nominall, but reall and ſubſtantiall: It is quiet and quiet too, peace and peace too: <hi>I cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the fruit of the lips, peace, peace.</hi> Mark;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.19</note> 
                  <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> too; peace in appearance, and peace in truth and ſubſtance alſo. But the peace and quiet of conſcience which the wicked have is not ſuch peace: It is peace and no peace; peace in appearance, but no peace in truth. Their god
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62503:53"/>
is the god of this world, and he perſwadeth them they have peace: But <hi>my God,</hi> ſaith the prophet,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.</note> ſpeaketh otherwiſe; <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God.</hi> They talk of a good conſcience ſometimes, and boaſt they have a good conſcience; but the truth is, they cannot have true peace within: for ſaith the prophet, <hi>the wicked is like the troubled ſea which cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt.</hi> So doth a wicked mans conſcience ſecretly caſt up mire and dirt in his face: His peace can onely be outward and apparentiall.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There is a difference in the cauſe. The quiet of a good conſcience ariſeth from one cauſe, and the quiet of a bad conſcience ariſeth from another.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The quiet of a good conſcience ariſeth from a diſtinct knowledge of the word of God, and of the precepts and promiſes conteined in it: But the quiet of an evil conſcience ariſeth from ignorance: When men know not God nor his holy word, which ſhould bind conſcience, they fear nothing becauſe they ſee nothing; they know not the danger of ſinne: Like a blind man ſtanding before the mouth of a cannon, he feareth no danger becauſe he ſeeth none: ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men fear not becauſe they know not what cauſe they have to fear. Their very <hi>prayers</hi> that they make are <hi>an abomination to God,</hi> and they know it not: their good duties they do are all like <hi>cockatrices egs,</hi> and they know it not; they know not that they are <hi>in the bond of iniquitie,</hi> in <hi>the ſnare of the devil.</hi> Their conſciences are quiet becauſe they know not what cauſe they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62503:53"/>
have to be otherwiſe. This is one difference; The quiet and peace of a good conſcience ariſeth from light and from knowledge; the quiet and peace of an evil conſcience, from darkneſſe and ignorance.</p>
               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 22.</note> The quiet of a good conſcience ariſeth from a due examination of our ſelves by the word, and purging of our conſciences. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence never can be good without purging and ſprinkling; no nor without a due examination: the quiet of a good conſcience ariſeth from this. Whereas the quiet of a wicked mans conſcience ariſeth from want of this: He never examineth his conſcience, but letteth it ſleep till God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake it with horrour. I ſay, a wicked mans conſcience ſleepeth, and that maketh it quiet, and he is not troubled nor moleſted with it. Like a baillif or ſergeant fallen aſleep by the way; the deſperate debtour whom he lieth in wait for may paſſe by him then, and find him very quiet, and not offer to arreſt him: or like a curſt dog fallen aſleep; a ſtranger may paſſe by him then and not be meddled with: Such like is this quiet evil conſcience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The quiet of a good conſcience ariſeth from a good ground, from the works of Gods Spirit, from true ſaving grace, from righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Rom. 14.17. we reade of <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>peace</hi>: True peace of conſcience ariſeth from righteouſneſſe: Whereas the falſe peace of the wicked ariſeth onely from vain hopes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits; <hi>They are not guiltie of ſuch and ſuch great ſins</hi>; or, <hi>They are not ſo bad as ſome others:</hi> As the Phariſee's conſcience was quiet; why?
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62503:54"/>
                  <hi>God, I thank thee, I am not as other men are, no drunkard, extortioner, nor like this publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane.</hi> Or perhaps from this ground their peace ariſeth; <hi>The Lord is very mercifull</hi>; and, <hi>The Lord Jeſus died for ſinners.</hi> Or perhaps this is their plea, <hi>They are good comers to church; They have prayers in their families; They have been profeſſours of Christ Jeſus ſo many years</hi>: From hence they dream of peace upon falſe grounds, whenas <hi>the way of peace they have not known.</hi> When conſcience ſhall be awaked, then it will tell them how they have by flattery deceived their own ſouls, and that having no true righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe they could have no true peace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The quiet of a good conſcience ariſeth from tenderneſſe and from life. Therefore the Apoſtle joyneth together, <hi>life</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> Rom. 8.6. True peace of conſcience ariſeth from life: whereas the quiet of a wicked conſcience ariſeth from ſearedneſſe and benumbedneſſe and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when men being paſt feeling of ſinne are not troubled at the committing of it. Thus ye ſee the ſecond thing wherein the difference lieth, namely in the cauſe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. They differ in the effect. Firſt, The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the quiet of a good conſcience is comfort and rejoycing:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> What followeth? <hi>By whom we have acceſſe by faith, rejoycing,</hi> &amp;c. Mark; The peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bringeth forth rejoycing.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22.</note> And ſo in other places <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> are joyned together. But the evil conſcience, though quiet, wanteth this rejoycing. If carnall men had no more mirth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62503:54"/>
then what the quiet and peace of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences doth help them to, they would not be ſo merrie as moſt of them be. Secondly, Another effect of true peace of conſcience is, It ſanctifieth the ſoul, it purgeth the heart, purifieth the life, and reformeth the whole man. It is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby God ſanctifieth his people more and more:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23.</note> 
                  <hi>The God of peace ſanctifie you wholly.</hi> Obſerve the title which the Apoſtle there giveth unto God when he ſanctifieth his people, he calleth him <hi>the God of peace</hi>; he ſanctifieth his people by peace: It maketh them think thus, <hi>We muſt not do thus or thus as others do; we ſhall loſe the peace of our conſcience if we do.</hi> This maketh them ſtrive againſt ſinne, denie their own wills and carnall appetites; <hi>If I ſhould not do ſo I ſhould have no peace.</hi> This peace ſanctifieth: But the peace which carnall men ſeem to have doth not ſanctifie the ſoul: they are never the more holy for the ſame. Again, another effect of the peace of a good conſcience is, to put life into us in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of good duties: it maketh us with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and delight perform the duties of our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and particular callings: But the falſe peace of an evil conſcience ſuffereth the wicked to be dead and dull to good duties. The true <hi>peace keepeth</hi> our <hi>hearts</hi> and our <hi>minds</hi>: We ſhould loſe our minds in the things of this life, but this peace doth keep them upon God; we ſhould loſe our hearts upon our profits and pleaſures and affairs in the world, but the peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth keep them upon heaven: Phil. 4.7. <hi>The peace of God which paſſeth all understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62503:55"/>
ſhall keep your hearts and minds.</hi> This doth the peace and quiet of a good conſcience: but the quiet of a wicked mans conſcience doth not do thus; it keepeth not his mind in this manner, but it is upon earthly things for all that.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. They differ in reſpect of duration and continuance. The quiet of a good conſcience is ſettled and grounded in the godly; it never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them nor forſaketh them: the other peace is fading. Let a feeling ſermon come and rifle car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, it taketh away their peace from them; their conſciences then flie in their faces, and then they ſee they are not right: Let loſſe of outward things come a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> light upon them, or any other affliction, it taketh their peace from them; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience then breaketh out upon them and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them how they have deceived themſelves with falſe peace, eſpecially at their death, then an evil conſcience (that hath been quiet before) in ſtead of comforting will affright and amaze them. But if we have the quiet of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it will make us heare the word with comfort, and not be troubled and diſquieted by a ſearching ſermon or the threatnings of Gods judgements: Nay, if we be in trouble, this will quiet us; if in affliction, this will comfort us: It will endure all our life, and be preſent at our death; then eſpecially it will ſhew it ſelf a friend unto us, in ſtanding by us to chear and refreſh us.<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:62503:55"/>But here cometh a queſtion to be anſwered, &amp; it is this; Have all Gods children this peace of conſcience? I dare ſay ſome of you look for this queſtion, and long to have it anſwered. I anſwer therefore, No; they have it not alwayes. Job ſeemed one while not to have it:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job.</hi> 7.20.</note> 
                  <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> ſaith his conſcience: <hi>what ſhall I do unto thee, O thou preſerver of men.</hi> David ſeemed one while not to have it: <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over my head as a heavie burden; they are too heavie for me,</hi> Pſal. 38.4. His ſinnes lay heavie upon his conſcience for a fit. Hezekiah one while ſeemed not to have it: <hi>Behold, for peace I had great bitterneſſe.</hi> And therefore I ſay the children of God have it not alwayes. But let me tell you; They might have it alwayes. 1. It is poſſible they ſhould have it alwayes: Their ſinnes of ignorance and infirmitie do not break the peace of their conſciences: cannot; for if they could, then no man ſhould have true peace of conſcience at any time. Nothing but willing and witting ſinnes, ſinnes againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, can break the peace of conſcience: and as it is poſſible for the children of God to live without theſe, ſo it is poſſible for them alwayes to have peace; yea, they may have daily more and more peace. 2. As it is poſſible for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God alwayes to have peace, ſo they are commanded to keep their peace alwayes; and it is their own fault if at any time they loſe it: <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with God, and be at peace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, unto which ye are called.</hi> We are not onely commanded to <hi>have peace in our

hearts,</hi> but alſo that it may <hi>rule</hi> there, that no corruption perk over it to hinder it: we are <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> to this peace, and commanded to have it; and therefore as it is a ſinne in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth when one breaketh the peace, ſo it is a ſinne in the ſpirit to break the peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: we are all bound to the peace. 3. If the children of God have it not alwayes, then they feel the want of it: and in the want of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort nothing elſe will comfort them. It is not all the peace and proſperitie of the world that can comfort their hearts as long as they have not this peace; not all the mirth in the world can content them untill they enjoy this peace again, the peace and quiet of a good conſcience: they faint for it, and long after it, they can have no ſtrength without it;<note place="margin">

alwayes in them, which will ſprout forth at laſt, and then they ſhall find the worm of an evil conſcience again: ſo on the contrarie ſide, the godly may ſeem now and then to have no peace, but yet they have alwayes the ſeeds of true peace in them, which will in time ſhew themſelves, and ſolace their ſouls for ever. 5. They never want peace as the wicked do want it: The wicked want it, and have no poſſibility of having it: they go in ſuch <hi>paths</hi> as wherein they ſhall never <hi>know peace,</hi>

               <p>COncerning a quiet conſcience I propounded three things: 1. What it is; 2. How it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from that quiet conſcience that is in the wicked; 3. The examination whether we have this quiet conſcience yea or no. The two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer we have handled already: namely, What a quiet conſcience is; and, How it differeth from that quiet conſcience which is in the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let us paſſe on now unto the third, namely, to an examination of our ſelves whether we have a true quiet conſcience yea or no.</p>
               <p>A quiet good conſcience is ſuch a marvellous bleſſing that it cannot poſſibly be but we muſt like it and wiſh, <hi>O that we had it.</hi> Let us then examine our ſelves and ſee whether we have it or no. Many have peace and quietneſſe (as hath been ſhewed alreadie) ariſing from falſe grounds: they have peace of conſcience becauſe they know not what belongeth to trouble of conſcience; or if they know that a little (as ſome of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do) yet they do not conſider that ſorrow which one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

ſuch as we have carefully ſought for at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God in the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, when being pinched with the burden of our ſinnes we did fly to the promiſes of God to ſeek comfort, to the bloud of Chriſt, to find eaſe and to get aſſurance of Gods favour. If our peace come not this way, it is naught, and we were better to be without it then have it. It may be we ſpeak peace to our ſelves; but doth the Lord ſpeak peace to our conſciences?<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>35.8.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I will heare what the Lord will ſpeak: for he ſhall ſpeak peace to his people, and to his ſaints: but let them not turn again to folly</hi> (for that will break all their peace.) O go to God then, and heare whether he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth peace to your conſciences; whether it be <hi>God in Chriſt reeonciling the world to himſelf</hi> that ſpeaketh it to you. It is not true peace without we have ſought for it at the throne of grace, without it be peace of Gods making. Now the Lord ſpeaketh peace to his people who come to him for peace three wayes. 1. He ſpeaketh peace to them by his word. This ſpeaking is thus; When the word promiſeth peace to thoſe who walk by ſuch a rule, and they walk by that rule, then Gods word ſpeaketh peace to their ſouls. The rule is ſet down Gal. 6.15. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature:</hi> and then followeth, <hi>As many as walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this rule, peace be upon them.</hi> 2. God ſpeaketh peace to his people in their conſciences. This ſpeaking is thus; When the conſcience can ſay, <hi>I am in Christ, I am engraffed into Christ,</hi> then the Lord ſpeaketh peace by the conſcience,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62503:58"/>
                  <hi>peace be with you all that are in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>:<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</hi> Pet. <hi>5.14.</hi>
                  </note> ſo alſo when the conſcience can ſay, <hi>I hunger after righteouſneſſe, I truly mourn for ſinne, I deſire in all my wayes to pleaſe God.</hi> Thirdly, God ſpeaketh peace by his Spirit. This ſpeaking is thus; When the word hath ſpoken peace by the promiſe, and when the conſcience ſpeaketh, <hi>I am thus and thus qualified, and therefore I have peace,</hi> then the Spirit of God cometh in and witneſſeth, <hi>Yea, you ſay right; peace belongeth unto you indeed, and I ſay Amen to it.</hi> When the Spirit of God doth ſay thus, then the Lord ſpeaketh peace to the ſoul.<note place="margin">Gal. <hi>5.22.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.</hi> Peace is the fruit of the Spirit: it ſpeaketh it to the ſoul, breedeth it in the ſoul. Now, beloved, examine your ſelves: Is your peace of this ſtamp? do ye ſeek it of God, and get it in the bloud of Chriſt Jeſus? do ye get it by the word, and by your trueſpeaking conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and by the holy Spirit of God? If ye get it on this wiſe, then it is true peace of conſcience indeed. If ye get it by your own vain hopes and by your good meanings, &amp;c. this peace will not hold alwayes: when your conſciences come to be awaked, your peace will all vaniſh away and be no more. This is the firſt note to try and examine your ſelves by.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If our quiet and peace of conſcience be good, it is accompanied with ſuch a life as is agreeable to the will of God: it avoideth ſinne, as the thing that diſturbeth the peace. How can any man have true peace of conſcience when his life doth not pleaſe God but provoketh his wrath againſt him? It cannot be that he ſhould have
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62503:58"/>
true peace who in his heart doth regard ſinne: <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God.</hi> No, whereever true peace of conſcience doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, it dwelleth with godlineſſe of life and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamableneſſe of converſation; as the Apoſtle Peter joyneth them together, 2. Pet. 3.14. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, beloved, ſeeing ye look for ſuch things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without ſpot and blameleſſe.</hi> Mark the words; <hi>In peace, without ſpot and blameleſſe.</hi> If ever we would be found in true peace, we muſt live without ſpot and blameleſſe. A wicked mans conſcience may ſeem to have peace, and tell him he hath ſerved God;<note place="margin">Prov. <hi>7.14.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>This day I have paid my vowes,</hi> ſaith the conſcience of the whore: but this is a rotten and deceitfull peace. True peace of conſcience is ever accompanied with ſuch a kind of life as is agreeable to the will of God in his word.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If our peace be good, it will make us endure to heare any point in Gods word with joy and delight. A wicked heart can heare points of mercie and comfort with joy: ſo long his peace laſteth: <hi>Every man that calleth upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved; If we confeſſe our ſinnes, God is juſt to forgive us our ſinnes; If any man ſinne, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous; Whoever ſhall confeſſe that Jeſus is the Sonne of God, God dwelleth in him and he in God:</hi> Such points as theſe a wicked heart can reade with delight (though if they were truly opened and expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they would yield him cold comfort, yet he can heare them with delight in the lump:) But if a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62503:59"/>
ſearching point or ſome terrible point cometh, he is afraid to heare that. Ahab had a quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience but onely when Michaiah did preach: Felix had a quiet conſcience no doubt; yet he <hi>trembled</hi> to heare Paul preach of <hi>death</hi> and of <hi>judgement,</hi> Acts 24.25. One would have thought that Paul (a priſoner) ſhould rather have been afraid: but Paul had true peace of conſcience, and therefore he could think and ſpeak of death with great comfort, and of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with joy; So could not Felix. Beloved, this is a ſtrong ſigne of a falſe peace, when ſome points of Gods word lay us ſlat and bereave us of our hold. Ye ſhall have many ſay, <hi>O they have ſuch peace, and they have ſuch a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as quiet as can be, and as heartwhole as can be</hi>: By and by a ſound ſearching point cometh and ranſacketh them to the quick, and they are gone. I confeſſe they go and get ſome untempered morter or other, and dawb up their conſciences again; but they are gone for the time. This is a ſtrong ſigne of a rotten peace. But a child of God can heare any point, heare of death, of judgement, of any thing contained in the word, with delight and comfort. It is true, he may be amazed thereat: but he is glad at heart that he heareth it, and will make uſe of it, be it mercy or judgement. Sweet or bitter points all are welcome to him: even the bittereſt points are ſweet to him, becauſe God and he are at peace; and therefore he knoweth there is no news from God but it is good.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. If our peace of conſcience be good, it will heal that baſe fearfulneſſe which is in many: who
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62503:59"/>
dare not be in the dark, dare not go through a church-yard in the night. Some will quake at the very ſhaking of a leaf, as the wicked in Job:<note place="margin">Job. <hi>15.21.</hi>
                  </note> which is nothing but a guiltie conſcience. I grant this fearfulneſſe is naturall to ſome; yet I ſay the true peace of conſcience will cure it. I do not ſay this is a reciprocall ſigne of true peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; for many wicked men may be bold enough: but I ſay true peace of conſcience will cure this immoderate fearfulneſſe in the godly.</p>
               <p>But here two queſtions are to be asked. I. Whether every true child of God that hath true peace of conſcience can think of death with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and be deſirous to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Peace of conſcience doth not take away naturall fear. It is the nature of every living creature to be very fearfull of death. The Philoſopher calleth death <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the fearfulleſt thing of all fearfull things.</hi> Bildad calleth it <hi>the king of terrours.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job <hi>18.14.</hi>
                  </note> Nature loveth its own preſervation; and therefore feareth the deſtruction of it. Peace of conſcience doth not take away all this fear. 2. Beſides, peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth not take away alwayes all degrees of ſlaviſh fear of death. The reaſon is, becauſe peace of conſcience may be weak, mixed with much troubles of conſcience. For as faith may be very imperfect, ſo peace of conſcience may be in ſome very imperfect. Good old Hilarion was very fearfull to die: He cried out to his ſoul when he lay on his death-bed, <hi>O my ſoul, hast thou ſerved Chriſt theſe foureſcore years, and art thou now afraid to die?</hi> Again,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>What? I fear death? which is a thing ſo precious? Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints. Is death precious, and ſhall I be ſo vain as to fear it?</hi> Thus ye ſee an anſwer to the firſt queſtion, Whether every child of God that hath true peace of conſcience can be deſirous to die.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether a wicked man that hath no peace of conſcience may not be deſirous to die too? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The horrour of conſcience may make a wicked man deſirous to die. He may have ſo much horrour of conſcience as that he may think certainly hell cannot be worſe: (Hell is infinitely worſe; but he may not think ſo.) Thus Judas was deſirous to die, when he went and hanged himſelf:<note place="margin">Matth. <hi>27.5.</hi>
                  </note> Thus many in deſpair do make away themſelves. I confeſſe ſome in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair may be fearfull to die: as Cain was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to die; it was fear of death made him ſpeak thus unto God, <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe that every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me,</hi> Gen. 4.14. The reaſon was, becauſe, though he were in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, yet he was not ſo ſenſible of his horrour as Judas was: for Cain could go and build for all this, and train up his children in muſick and the like for all this; but Judas was in a caſe more ſenſible of his miſery. 2. Dolour of pain may make a wicked man deſire to die. Thus it was with Saul: Saul had received his deaths wound, and was in moſt grievous pain: he could not die preſently, neither could he live; but lying in very great pain between both, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Amalekite to ſtand upon him and ſlay him, 2. Sam. 10.9. (though Oſiander think
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62503:61"/>
the Amalekite lyed unto David to curry favour with him; but Joſephus and others think he ſpake the truth.) Sure it is, that many wicked wretches having no peace of conſcience to ſweeten and allay their torments, have been deſirous to die: nay ſome have haſtened their own death. 3. Malecontentedneſſe, &amp; ſhame, and diſappointment of their aims may alſo make wicked men deſirous to die, and, if death come not ſoon enough of it ſelf, to diſpatch away themſelves with cruel ſelf-murder. Thus it was with Achitophel: when he ſaw his counſel was not followed he haltered himſelf:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Sam. <hi>17.22.</hi>
                  </note> He had no peace of conſcience to comfort him againſt all his dumps and diſcontents; and therefore he was deſirous to die. 4. Wicked men, being vexed at ſomething for the preſent, may ſeem to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to die; and yet if death ſhould come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they would be of another mind, and be content death ſhould be further off. Nay, Jonas (that ſtrange man of a good man) O for a fit he would be dying, yea that he would, <hi>Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jon. <hi>4.3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>take my life from me: for it is better for me to die then to live.</hi> I ſuppoſe if God had taken him at his word, he could have wiſhed his words had been in again. But thus it is often in the mouthes of wicked people; <hi>I would I were dead</hi>; and, <hi>I would I were out of the world:</hi> not for any peace of conſcience they have, nor for any deſire of death, but onely for a momentany pang. If they were to die indeed, they would be loth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to it. Like the man in the Fable: who being wearied with his burden of ſticks, lay down and called for Death; but when Death
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62503:62"/>
came indeed to take him, and ſaid, <hi>What ſhall I do, man? thou calledſt me: I pray thee,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>help me up with my burden of ſticks.</hi> When he was to die indeed, then he would rather have his own weariſome burden. It is but a fable; but this is the faſhion of many. 5. When wicked men are deſirous to die indeed ſometimes not out of diſcontent or any ſuch like reaſon, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be out of any true peace of conſcience: They may go away like lambs, as we ſay; but it is in a fools paradiſe. It may be whileſt they lived they thought to go to heaven: but <hi>when they dy, then all their thoughts periſh,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh in another caſe.</p>
               <p>To return therefore where we left; O belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is there any of you that want the peace of a good conſcience? and do ye know what you want? what a great benefit and bleſſing? That ye may ſee this, and fully know it, and by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it earneſtly deſire it, conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it is the very head of all comforts. A worthy Divine calleth it <hi>Abrahams boſome to the ſoul:</hi> Ye know what a bleſſing it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Lazarus to be taken from his fores into Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams boſome: The peace of a good conſcience is like this boſome of Abraham: Who would not gladly lie in it? Such a man who hath it can never look upon another mans comfort, but a good conſcience will ſay, <hi>Yea, and I have my comfort too.</hi> When Paul was commending of Timothie, ſee how his own conſcience ſpake of himſelf at the ſame time:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>16.10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>He worketh the work of the Lord, as I alſo do.</hi> Mark; his conſcience would be putting in comfort for himſelf: <hi>Doth
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62503:62"/>
Timothie work the Lords work? yea and ſo do I too,</hi> ſaith his conſcience: It is Muſculus his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation upon the place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A quiet conſcience maketh a man to taſt the ſweetneſſe of things heavenly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall: It maketh the word to be to him, as to David, <hi>Sweeter then hony, yea then the hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe: I have not departed from thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, O Lord,</hi> ſaith he (thus ſaith his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:) now what followeth next?<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>119.103.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my tast yea, ſweeter then hony unto my mouth.</hi> A good conſcience maketh a man taſt ſweetneſſe in prayer, when his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence telleth him he prayeth aright: It maketh him taſt ſweetneſſe in a Sabbath, when his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience telleth him he ſanctifieth it aright: ſo alſo in the ſacrament, when his conſcience can witneſſe he receiveth aright. What is the reaſon ſo few of you taſt ſweetneſſe in theſe things? The reaſon is this; Becauſe ye have not the peace of a good conſcience: It would find ſweetneſſe in every good dutie, in every good word and work.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A good quiet conſcience maketh a man taſt ſweetneſſe in all outward things, in meat, in drink, in ſleep, in the company of friends: it putteth a <hi>Better</hi> upon a very <hi>morſel,</hi> Prov. 17.1. Brown bread and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, there is a <hi>Better</hi> upon it then upon all the coſtly fare of the wealthie without it. Bernard calleth a good conſcience <hi>a ſoft pillow:</hi> Another calleth it <hi>a dear boſome friend</hi>: Solomon calleth it <hi>a continuall feaſt.</hi> It maketh a man taſt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in every outward thing. The healthy man
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62503:63"/>
onely can take pleaſure in recreations, walks, meats, ſports, and the like: they yield no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to thoſe that are bedrid, or ſick, or half-dead. But when the conſcience is at peace the ſoul is all in good health; and ſo all things are enjoyed with ſweetneſſe and comfort.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It ſweetneth evils to a man, as troubles, croſſes, ſorrows, afflictions. If a man have true peace in his conſcience, it comforteth him in them all. When things abroad do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet us, how comfortable is it to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at home to chear us? ſo when troubles and afflictions without turmoil and vex us and adde ſorrow to ſorrow, then to have peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the peace of conſcience, to allay all and quiet all, what a happineſſe is this? When ſickneſſe and death cometh, what will a good conſcience be worth then? Sure more then all the world beſides. If one had all the world, he would then give it for a peaceable conſcience. Nay, what think ye of judgement and the tribunal of Chriſt? Do but think what a good conſcience will be worth then? When Paul was accuſed and hardly thought of by ſome of the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, this was his comfort;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Conſcience is a little pettie god.</hi> We may not give it ſuch a big title: but this is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; The conſcience is Gods echo of peace to the ſoul: in life, in death, in judgement it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable comfort.</p>
               <p>Is there any then that want this?<note place="margin">Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> Let them above all things labour to get it: It is more worth then all things elſe. Whatever we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, let us not neglect this. It is ſafer to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect bodie, health, means, maintenance, friends, and all that ever we have in the world then to neglect this. The more we have the worſe it is for us, if we have not this. Had we all this worlds good, it is like a ſtone in a ſerpents head or a toads head, or a pearl in an oyſter; not our perfection but our diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Again, you who have a peaceable conſcience, 1. Labour to maintain it. Be often in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, be not ſtrangers to him, the light of whoſe countenance is the peace of your ſouls. It is the walking with God that breedeth true peace and preſerveth it. It is ſaid of Levi, that <hi>he walked with God in peace.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. <hi>2.6.</hi>
                  </note> O let us ſtirre up our ſelves to walk cloſe with God, that ſo we may have peace: No ſweet peace but in ſo doing. 2. We muſt take heed we do not trouble nor diſquiet it, that we do not reſiſt it, or offer violence unto it by committing ſinne againſt the peace of it, but endeavour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the peace of it by obeying the voyce of it. Get the fear of God, which is wiſdome; and to depart from evil, which is true underſtanding: <hi>All her paths are peace,</hi> Prov. 3, 17. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk in any one path of true wiſdome but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62503:64"/>
we ſhall find in it peace: There is peace in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and peace in charity, and peace in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and peace in obedience, &amp;c. Break any of theſe things, and ye break the peace. Ye heare what an admirable thing the peace of conſcience is: O then, if ye have it, make much of it: nay, if ye have it, ye will for certain make much of it. The very having of it will teach you the worth of it, and learn you to prize it, and make you above all things unwilling to leave it. And thus much of the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> a quiet conſcience.</p>

               <head>An unquiet conſcience.</head>
               <p>I Have already handled a quiet conſcience. I come now to ſpeak of a troubled and unquiet conſcience: Concerning which I ſhall ſhew you three things: 1. What it is; 2. The degrees of it; 3. The difference of the trouble that may be in a good and that may be in a bad conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">What it is</note>I. What a troubled conſcience is. It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience accuſing for ſinne, and affrighting with apprehenſions of Gods wrath. And here I would have you conſider two things: 1. What are the cauſes of it; 2. Wherein it conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The cauſes of it are theſe five. 1. The guilt of ſinne: When a man hath done evil, and his conſcience doth know it, then doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience crie guiltie:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.4.</note> 
                  <hi>when he knoweth it,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>then he ſhall be guilty.</hi> This is it which woundeth and pierceth conſcience; this is the ſad voyce of conſcience. Like Judas; <hi>I have ſinned in betraying the innocent bloud:</hi> Like
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62503:64"/>
Cain; <hi>My ſinne is greater then can be forgiven.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21.</note> So the brethren of Joſeph; <hi>We are guilty,</hi> ſay they, <hi>concerning our brother.</hi> It is like the head of an arrow ſticking in the fleſh, or like a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full object continually preſenting it ſelf before our eyes: <hi>My ſinne is ever before me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3.</note> ſaith David. When we have tranſgreſſed Gods law, and our conſcience can cry guiltie, when the guilt of ſinne lieth upon conſcience, this is one cauſe of the trouble of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another cauſe is the apprehenſion of Gods wrath for ſinne: When knowing that we have ſinned and offended God, we apprehend his wrath in our minds, and behold the revenging eye of his juſtice againſt us. This is a very grievous thing, ſo terrible that no man or angel is able to abide it: As we ſee the kings and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, the mighty men of the earth, <hi>call for the mountains to fall upon them, and the hills to cover them from the wrath of God,</hi> Rev. 6.15, 16. When we have incurred Gods diſpleaſure and our conſciences ſee it, when his anger reſteth upon us and our conſciences feel it, this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of the trouble of conſcience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third cauſe of the trouble of conſcience is the fear of death and of hell: When we know we have offended Gods law, and we know alſo what our ſinnes do deſerve, namely death and judgement aad damnation for ever; this doth moſt trouble and diſquiet conſcience, when it faſtneth on the apprehenſion of it. The Apoſtle calleth it <hi>a fearfull looking for of judgement,</hi> When conſcience looketh for nothing elſe but for hell and damnation, this muſt needs trouble conſcience.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:62503:65"/>4. Another cauſe is privative, want of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; when God doth withhold from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the help of his Spirit. Ye know the Spirit can inable conſcience to undergo all its troubles; the Spirit can prompt it with mercies and the promiſes of God, and hold it up: but when the Lord bereaveth the conſcience of this help, and doth not at all ſupport it, this muſt needs alſo trouble conſcience.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When God doth faſten on the conſcience ſuch thoughts as may affright and terrifie it; as thus, <hi>God doth not love me; Chriſt will not own me; I have ſinned, I am a reprobate, paſt hope,</hi> &amp;c. When ſuch thoughts as theſe faſten on the conſcience, it cannot chooſe then but be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Thus I have ſhewed you what are the cauſes of the trouble of conſcience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This trouble of conſcience conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in two things: Firſt, in want of comfort: It cannot apply to it ſelf neither the promiſes of this life nor of that which is to come. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence crieth, <hi>This belongeth not to me: This mercy, this comfort is not my portion.</hi> Secondly, In a terrour and anguiſh of mind from theſe three heads: 1. From the guilt of ſinne; 2. From the apprehenſion of Gods wrath; 3. From fear of death and of judgement. This is the three-ſtringed whip wherewith conſcience is laſhed. Theſe ye ſhall find upon the conſcience of Adam and Eve, when they had ſinned againſt God. Their conſcience was whipped 1. With the guilt of ſinne; <hi>they ſaw they were naked,</hi> Gen. 3.7. 2. With the apprehenſion of Gods wrath; <hi>they hid themſelves from the preſence
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62503:65"/>

               <head>The degrees of a troubled conſcience.</head>
               <p n="2">II. THe next thing I promiſed to ſhew is the degrees of a troubled conſcience. A troubled conſcience hath divers degrees: For ſome conſciences are more troubled then other ſome. 1. The firſt degree is ſuch a degree as may be in Gods children: and this ariſeth not ſo much from the apprehenſion of Gods wrath as from the guilt of ſinne: Their conſciences grieve and are troubled to think that they have ſinned and offended the Lord God. Thus we ſee David could not be at quiet: Although Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than had told him from God that his ſinne was forgiven, yet his conſcience ſtill troubled him: <hi>Againſt thee onely have I ſinned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4.</note> 
                  <hi>and done this evil in thy ſight,</hi> ſaith he. I grant the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Gods children are troubled at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods anger; but then it is his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly anger, not the anger of an enemy. Though for a fit they may ſeem to apprehend th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> too,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62503:66"/>
yet moſtly it is for that they have provoked their loving Father to anger againſt them. A father may be angry with his child out of love; and ſo the Lord may be with his dear children. <hi>The Lord was angry with me too,</hi> ſaith Moſes, Deut. 1.37. <hi>O let not my Lord be angry,</hi> ſaith Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham the father of the faithfull.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4.</note> 
                  <hi>O God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. Sometimes the Lord is angry with the prayers of his people; but it is in love, becauſe he would have them pray better, and obey better, and look to their ſtanding bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now the conſciences of Gods people are very much troubled when the Lord is thus angry with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond degree of trouble of conſcience is ſuch as is in the wicked, and yet not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without hope. The conſcience is troubled, but yet ſo as it conceiveth hope: <hi>God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>; and, <hi>Chriſt died for poore ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. Thus many a wicked man is troubled and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted in conſcience, nor for ſinne, but for the wrath of God againſt it; yet he conceiveth for the preſent that the ſinne is pardonable and may be forgiven: <hi>Christ may forgive; God may pardon.</hi> It is indeed but a poore ground of hope and comfort upon poſſibilities: but yet this lightneth the trouble in the mean time, and it may be within a while ſhaketh it quite off: Like the wicked Jews, Iſa. 57.10. who were worried and <hi>wearied</hi> moſt grievouſly; <hi>yet they ſaid not, There is no hope.</hi> There may be much horrour and diſquiet in theſe conſciences for a time: but ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is a higher degree yet, a worſe troubled conſcience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:62503:66"/>3. The third degree of a troubled conſcience is, when it is for the preſent altogether hopeleſſe; ſuch a conſcience as is ſwallowed up in deſpair: when men thinking of their manifold ſinnes, of the direfull wrath of God, of the dreadfull tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell for ever, their conſciences make them deſpair of all hope or poſſibilitie of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this; bringing ſuch thoughts as theſe, <hi>What a deal of time have I ſpent in ſinne, wherein I might have made my peace with God, and have prevented all this? What a great and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God have I offended? What an infinite Judge have I provoked, who is able to revenge himſelf on me, and who will be my foe to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie?</hi> conſcience alſo bringing in thoughts of the torments and unſufferable pains to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in hell, and ſuch ſwallow up in deſpair with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hope for the preſent or the future. Like the wicked man which Eliphaz ſpeaketh of,<note place="margin">Deſperatio eſt homici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da animae, <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>He believeth not that he ſhall return out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Job 15.22. So theſe have no hope of eſcaping, expect to periſh as Spira; <hi>O,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I envy Cain and Judas: I would I were in their caſes: They are damned; but I ſhall be worſe for evermore.</hi> Now though to theſe all hopes be gone for the preſent, yet ſome of theſe troubled conſciences ſcramble up again with vain hopes, and ſome do not. Cain got up again, it ſhould ſeem: but Judas did not. Thoſe that never get up again, either 1.<note place="margin">Deſperate eſt in infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendere, <hi>Iſià.</hi>
                  </note> they live in intolerable hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and vexation of ſpirit, as if they had a devil in them to put them to anguiſh, and often (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of their lives) do make away them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo leap quick into hell: or elſe 2. they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62503:67"/>
runne deſperately into all abominable courſes: Their conſciences telling them there is nothing to be expected but damnation, they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſperately to commit ſinne with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſaying with them in Jeremie, <hi>There is no hope; therefore we will walk after our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes,</hi> Jer. 18.12. Or elſe 3. they grow ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of it. They ſee they are wrong, but they are not ſenſible of it. It may be they pray and reade and heare; but their conſciences ſecretly whiſper, <hi>All is to no purpoſe.</hi> Conſcience eateth and eateth like a worm,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ek</hi> 24.23.</note> and they <hi>pine away in their iniquities,</hi> as the prophet ſpeaketh. A kind of ſorrow they have, but they cannot mourn; a kind of ſad dolour, but they cannot weep: <hi>Ye ſhall not mone nor weep, but pine away in your ſinnes,</hi> ſaith the text. I confeſſe there be more preſumers in the world, who promiſe themſelves that all ſhall be well with them: but yet there be deſpairers too, and very many, whoſe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are troubled with ſecret deſpair; though it may be not apparently to others.</p>
               <p>Now the cauſes of theſe deſpairing conſciences are theſe. 1. The greatneſſe of ſinne; when the heart thinketh ſecretly thus, <hi>Certainly the Lord cannot find in his heart to forgive me.</hi> As it was with Cain: When he had lived in earthly-mindedneſſe, and then in formality, and then in diſcontent and in hatred, and then in hardneſſe of heart, the Lord rebuked him, and yet his heart was ſo hard that ſtill he went on in evil; then he murdered his brother; and laſtly he deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; <hi>My ſinnes are greater,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13.</note> ſaith his conſcience, <hi>then can be forgiven.</hi> He thought God could
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62503:67"/>
not find in his heart to forgive him. So when men ſinne and ſinne, and the Lord doth rebuke them, and yet they do ſinne, and their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do check them, and yet they go on, at laſt they come to have ſecret deſpairs in their heart, that God now will not look towards them; whereas if yet they had a mind to ſtoop to Jeſus Chriſt, they might be forgiven. 2. A ſecond cauſe of deſpairing is multitude of temptations. Indeed the godly ſhould not be ſo apt to think themſelves forſaken of God by reaſon of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as ſometimes they are: they ſhould rather <hi>count it joy,</hi> as James ſpeaketh, chap. 1.2. But yet many of the wicked deſpair finally by this means: Becauſe they do ſo often fall into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, therefore they conclude they are forſaken of God. 3. Ignorance of Gods word. When the guiltineſſe of ſinne meeteth with minds not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the doctrine of free grace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation by Chriſt; this is a cauſe of deſpair. 4. So alſo inured cuſtome of ſinning is another cauſe. When men are often quickned, and grow dead again; then quickned again for a fit, and then hardned again: in the end they fall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. Theſe and the like are the cauſes of deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſciences. And thus I have ſhewed alſo the ſecond thing propounded to be handled, namely, the ſundry degrees of troubled conſciences.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third thing is the difference between the troubled conſcience in the godly and in the wicked. The conſciences of Gods children may be troubled, and are many times; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the wicked they are troubled too: now the queſtion is, How do they differ? I anſwer,
<list>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:62503:68"/>1. That trouble in the conſcience of wicked men is accompanied with impenitency, and ſometimes with blaſphemy: <hi>I would I were able to reſist God,</hi> ſaith Francis Spira: like thoſe in the Revelation who <hi>blaſphemed God becauſe of their torments.</hi> Sometimes it is accompanied with curſings, as Iſai 8.21. ſometimes with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite murmuring. But in Gods children it is not ſo: When their conſcience is troubled, they ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie God, and clear God, and give him the glory of all, and ſubmit under his hand, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their hearts unto him: as David in his trouble did not fret and murmure againſt God, but ſaith he,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26.</note> 
                        <hi>If God have no pleaſure in me, lo, here I am: let him do with me what ſeemeth him good.</hi> So that the trouble of conſcience in the children of God and in the wicked doth much differ in this firſt reſpect.</item>
                     <item>2. The trouble of conſcience in the wicked ariſeth onely from the apprehenſion of Gods wrath and fear of judgement for ſinne, not for the ſinne it ſelf and from the love of holineſſe: But that in Gods children ariſeth chiefly for ſinne, and the want of the apprehenſion of Gods love unto them: <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</hi> Pſal. 13.1. Mark whence the trouble of the Pſalmiſt came: This was his trouble, that God did hide his face.</item>
                     <item>3. Trouble of conſcience in the wicked never maketh them part with ſinne, never breedeth a hatred of ſinne in them; but that in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doth. True it is that a wicked mans troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led conſcience may make him vomit up his ſinne,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62503:68"/>
like a dog that vomiteth up his troubleſome meat: but he doth not vomit up his ſtomach to that meat; for when the trouble is over he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to his vomit again. So a carnall man retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to his deadneſſe of heart again, and to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie again, when the trouble is over. Pharaoh, whileſt his conſcience was troubled at the ſenſe of Gods judgements, O then ſaith he, <hi>I have ſinned: I pray, Moſes, let me have your prayers; and I will let you go.</hi> If the children of Iſrael could have packed up and departed while this trouble had laſted, they might have been gone.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.15.</note> But <hi>when he ſaw there was reſpite, he hardned his heart again.</hi> Mark; His trouble of conſcience did not make him part with his ſinne: But that in Gods children doth.</item>
                     <item>4. That in the wicked driveth them from God: They have little heart to come unto him: They ſee nothing but wrath; and they rather go about to ſeek eaſe in other things then to ſeek his favour: as Saul ſought eaſe in muſick, and Cain in building caſtles and cities, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das in a deſperate courſe. Their trouble fetcheth them not to God. But the trouble in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren worketh otherwiſe: In the midſt of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of conſcience they reſt upon God: as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man crieth, <hi>O Lord God of my ſalvation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.1.</note> in the midſt of the troubles of his ſoul. The eyes of Gods children are ſtill towards heaven; they think ſtill they ſhould have ſome help from God: They pray and cry, and though God ſeemeth to neglect them, yet they cannot give over: They will not be beaten off from wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God when he will ſpeak comfort to them.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62503:69"/>5. That trouble that is in the wicked maketh their heart ſullen; but that in the godly melteth their heart: <hi>My ſoul is like melting wax,</hi> ſaith David in his troubles of conſcience. His ſoul melted before God, and was even poured out before him, Pſal. 22.13. This is a kindly work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus ye ſee the difference.</item>

It is the greateſt miſery that can be: it is even a hell to men here upon earth: it is like a diſmall ghoſt to terrifie the ſoul: it is like a burning furnace in the boſome: it maketh the life bitter. In a word, the ſpirit of man is not able to bear it:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſpirit of man will ſuſtein its infirmities: but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> As long as a mans ſpirit is ſound, it will bear any thing. Some have born agues, fevers, ſtones, colicks, convulſions, rackings, torturings: as long as a mans ſpirit is ſound he is able to bear any of them, all of them: <hi>but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Never was there man that was able to bear a wounded ſpirit. We may ſee by many of Gods children how heavy it is: David <hi>rored with the anguiſh</hi> of it: a ſtrange phraſe. Heman was ready even to runne out of his wits with it: <hi>While I ſuffer thy terrours,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted,</hi> Pſal. 88.15. Moſes putteth himſelf into the number, <hi>We are even conſumed by thine anger,</hi> Pſal. 90.7. Ethan complaineth that it was like a burning fever: <hi>How long, O Lord wilt thou hide thy face? for ever? ſhall
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62503:69"/>
thy wrath burn like fire?</hi> Pſal. 89.46. If it be thus with Gods children, what may we think of the wicked? If we could ſearch into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes of ſome wicked men who are enemies to God, then we might ſee and underſtand the true weight and burden of this troubled conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Cain crieth out of <hi>more then he can bear.</hi> Judas thought to find more eaſe in hell then in his own heart: So terrible was the torture of his troubled conſcience, that he murdered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, thinking verily that hell could not be worſe.</p>

There is a phraſe in Ezek. 30.24. where God ſaith he will make Pharaoh <hi>grone with the gronings of a man deadly wounded:</hi> So it will be with you, if you will not hearken and ſubmit to Jeſus Chriſt; conſcience will make you grone with fearfull grones; <hi>O wo is me, I am undone, without hope, without remedie.</hi> Conſider this therefore, and be wiſe, before the things which concern your peace be hidden from you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:62503:71"/>And let me the rather exhort you to this in regard of the danger of the times.<note place="margin">Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> The Lords wrath is gone out, and his judgements do flie through the earth, and his plagues do fall on every ſide of us: What will your guiltie conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do now? oh you can never endure them. Ye had need of purged conſciences now leſt ye be quite comfortleſſe in the day of viſitation. How miſerable is their caſe who want the peace of conſcience in the time of diſtreſſe? When troubles and afflictions are without, then how grievous is it to want peace and comfort with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? When Gods mortall arrows are in your bodies, then to have the arrow of his wrath ſticking in your ſouls, this will adde ſorrow to ſorrow, and make your eſtate much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable and unſupportable. Beloved, peace of conſcience is good at all times; but it is moſt precious when calamities fall on us: Then to have the peace of a good conſcience that may bring us good news from heaven, that all is well within, all peace there, this is ſuch peace as all the world cannot give nor ſell nor buy. Never more need of the peace of conſcience then now. As one ſaid of the books of faith, <hi>There be abundance of books written of faith:</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62503:73"/>I begin with the firſt: Suppoſe a man have peace of conſcience, what muſt he do to keep and maintein it? I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Firſt, We muſt labour to prevent troubles of conſcience by taking heed that we do nothing contrarie to conſcience. We muſt not be drawn by friendſhip, or credit, or the love of any luſt, to do that which conſcience forbiddeth. Nothing ſhould be ſo dear unto us as the peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: nothing for the love of it ſhould make us do ought againſt our conſcience. How miſerable are thoſe comforts, delights, ſatisfactions which we get to our ſelves in ſuch courſes as our own hearts do condemne! However they ſeem comforts for a while, and contentments for a while, and delights for a while, yet at laſt it will appear that miſerable comforts are they all. Nothing that we get in any evil way will chear and comfort us in a time of need. What ſaid Francis Spira at the time of his death, when ſeeing his wife and children about him, and thinking on the goods and eſtate which he had got for them by denying the truth which he had before mainteined againſt the Romiſh errours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cried out in the horrour of his conſcience, <hi>How terrible is the ſight of theſe unto me!</hi> However before they had been comforts to him, yet now he could not endure the ſight of them. <hi>O,</hi> thought he, <hi>I recanted for your ſake; I yielded to ſuperſtition, and it was long of you</hi>: Therefore he abhorred now the ſight o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in that which he alloweth:</hi> that is, Bleſſed is he that hath not a condemning conſcience, that alloweth not himſelf in any courſe wherein his conſcience doth condemne him. So that if we have peace of conſcience, and deſire to maintein it, let us never allow our ſelves in any courſe that our conſcience may condemne us in. That is the firſt anſwer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we will maintein our peace,<note place="margin">Anſw. <hi>2</hi>
                  </note> we muſt labour to have our hearts grounded in the aſſurance of the love of God: alas, it will fail us elſe, and leave us in trou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Cor. 13.11. <hi>The God of love and peace be with you.</hi> If he be the God of love to us, it is ſure enough he will be the God of peace alſo: If we know once that God loveth us, then we may ſet our hearts at reſt: As long as we doubt of his love our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can never have true peace: And therefore if we would maintein true peace of conſcience let us labour to be aſſured of Gods love.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We muſt uſe the exerciſe of faith in applying the bloud of Chriſt;<note place="margin">Anſw. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> we muſt labour to purge and cleanſe our conſciences with it. If we find that we have ſinned, we muſt runne preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the bloud of Chriſt to waſh away our ſinne. We muſt not let the wound feſter or exulcerate, but preſently get it healed. As there is a fountain of ſinne in us, ſo there is a fountain of mercie in Chriſt, <hi>ſet open for Judah and Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zech. <hi>13.1.</hi>
                  </note> and for every poore ſoul to waſh in. As we ſinne dayly, ſo he juſtifieth dayly, and we muſt dayly go to him for it: As every day we runne into
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62503:74"/>
new debts, ſo the Lords prayer teacheth us every day to beg forgiveneſſe: We muſt every day eye the brazen ſerpent. Juſtification is an ever-running fountain, and therefore we cannot look to have all the water at once. A fountain ever runneth anew; ſo juſtification ever floweth anew, and we muſt go to it. Chriſt is a <hi>Priest for ever after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> O let us ſue out every day a dayly pardon of courſe! Let us not ſleep one night without a new par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Better ſleep in a houſe full of adders and venemous beaſts then ſleep in one ſinne.

I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> Every man that falleth doth not fall on all foure, as we uſe to ſay; he doth not fall quite: There be degrees of falling. As in a ſick man, though he be ill yet he is not by and by dead; ſome life remaineth ſtill, which will look out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards health again: ſo there is ſo much life in juſtification as to recover thee again. Be conſtant therefore in this courſe: Ever go to Chriſt, ever waſh in this fountain, ever bring thy ſoul hither to be cleanſed; and then thy conſcience ever ſhall have peace.</p>

                  </note>Fourthly, If we would maintein our peace, then let us labour to be conſtant in obedience to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Whoſoever keepeth his word, in him verily is the word of God perfected; and hereby know we that we are in him,</hi> 1.

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:62503:74"/>II. Queſtion; <hi>How the peace of conſcience doth depend upon our care and our obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon why I raiſe this queſtion is this, Becauſe as our juſtification is onely in Chriſt, ſo our peace is onely in him; how then doth the peace of our conſcience depend on obedience? The place of Scripture that occaſioneth the doubt is, 1. Pet. 3.21. <hi>The anſwer of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God by the reſurrection of Jeſus Christ.</hi> It is by Chriſt; how dependeth it then on our obedience?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. A good conſcience doth not depend upon our obedience as the principall cauſe of it, but upon juſtification which we have by Chriſt if we be in him: Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Ye ſee then that our peace is grounded upon our juſtification as the principall cauſe of it. If we ſhould ſeek for peace from our works and obedience, alas, they are ſinfull and defective; there is no peace to be found in them: Our conſcience would be troubled at our beſt duties, at our weakneſſe in prayer, our frailties in hearing, our ſlips in every holy ſervice: There is nothing we do but our conſcience might find fault with it, and pick a hole in it; and therefore we had need to flie unto Chriſt for true peace. No wonder then that Papiſts have not true peace, but profeſſedly ſay, that every man muſt doubt, and no man can be ſure of his ſalvation. They muſt needs doubt indeed who truſt to their own works: which can never bring true peace. The conſcience muſt ever be quarrelling and finding of fault, and be without peace, if we truſt to the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62503:75"/>
beſt works. So that this is the firſt anſwer, All true peace dependeth upon juſtification by faith in Chriſt as the principall cauſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We anſwer, That our peace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon our obedience in this ſort, that we can have no peace except we be given to obedience. Thoſe men that can ſinne and yet be at peace, were never juſtified in their lives. A child of God when he ſinneth; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if he ſhould be tempted to lie, or to omit a good dutie, which he knoweth he is bound to perform; yet this would much trouble his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; his ſoul would be aſhamed, his heart perplexed, he would not know how to look the Lord in the face; <hi>I have ſinned: what ſhall I do unto thee, O thou preſerver of men</hi>? When David had ſinned againſt God, <hi>I am troubled,</hi> ſaith he;<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>28.6.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and I go mourning all the day long.</hi> And therefore peace of conſcience doth depend thus farre on obedience, as that a man cannot have peace unleſſe he be obedient, and take heed of ſinne, and labour in all things to be upright before God.<note place="margin">Dub. Sol.</note> Now if you ask me, But how doth our peace depend upon our obedience? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It dependeth upon obedience as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving cauſe: It removeth that which would hinder our peace. Sinne would interrupt our peace: now obedience removeth ſinne. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh 1. John 3.18, 19. <hi>My little children, let us not love in word and in tongue, but in deed and in truth: For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we know that we are of the truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before God</hi>: Hereby we ſhall aſſure our conſciences that we are in him, if we
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62503:75"/>
take heed of hypocriſie: If we love in truth, and be obedient in truth, we ſhall thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all our doubts and our fears, our troubles and perplexities of conſcience. So that peace doth depend on obedience as the removing cauſe: It removeth that which otherwiſe would hinder peace. This is the firſt. Again, our peace of conſcience dependeth upon our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as the witneſſing cauſe of it. Obedience is one of the witneſſes of true peace; it witneſſeth that we have peace with God. <hi>This is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Cor. <hi>1.12.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>even the testimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicitie and godly ſinceritie we have had our converſation in the world.</hi> See here, it is the witneſſing cauſe of it: Paul had peace of conſcience; his conſcience was able to make him rejoyce: How? Becauſe it gave teſtimony that his converſation was godly and ſimple and gracious. Though we be in Chriſt, yet we can have no peace unleſſe holy obedience doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the ſame. Obedience is not the cauſe of the peace of our conſciences before God, but it is the cauſe of our perceiving the ſame: We know we have peace by reaſon of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>They that walk by this rule, peace ſhall be upon them and upon the Iſrael of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62503:76"/>
our peace of conſcience dependeth on our obedience as the confirming cauſe: Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth our peace to us by making us walk cloſe to him and obedient unto him. Paul ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how it preſerveth peace, as a ſhoe preſerveth the foot: ye know if we ſhould walk without ſhoes, barefoot, our feet would be in danger of pricking and hurting: So doth obedience to the Goſpel preſerve our peace:<note place="margin">Epheſ. <hi>6.15.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Stand,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>having your feet ſhod with the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Goſpel of peace.</hi> Mark; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth it to a ſhoe, which he would have us ſhod with; and then it will be the Goſpel of peace to us, and our peace ſhall be in ſafety. Fourthly, our peace dependeth upon our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, not onely as a ſigne of true peace, nor onely as a guard to it, but as a thing pleaſing to God, without the which we diſpleaſe God. For though God be pleaſed with his children al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in Chriſt, yet he is not pleaſed that any in Chriſt ſhould be diſobedient to him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Theſſ. <hi>4.1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to pleaſe God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. When Gods children walk in obedience, that is pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. So that peace of conſcience doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend on obedience: For otherwiſe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will be troubled; <hi>O I do not pleaſe God; This is diſpleaſing unto God</hi>; and, <hi>This doth provoke God.</hi> Not as though there were any ſuch perfection in our obedience that can ſatisfie any tittle of Gods law; but becauſe when our perſons are pleaſing to God in Jeſus Chriſt, then our obedience to God is pleaſing too in Jeſus Chriſt, and conſcience will ſay it. Thus
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62503:76"/>
much ſhall ſuffice for anſwer to the ſecond que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Queſtion; <hi>What manner of obedience it is that peace of conſcience dependeth upon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of this queſtion is this; Becauſe it ſhould ſeem there is no ſuch obedience in this life as any peace of conſcience ſhould depend on. Doth not James ſay, <hi>In many things we ſinne all?</hi> Doth not our Saviour ſay, <hi>When ye have done all that ye can, ſay, We are unprofitable ſervants?</hi> If our conſcience can ſtill ſay that we are unprofitable, and that we do ſinne in every thing that we do, yea in many things, in all the duties we go about; if our conſciences can ſay thus, How can any peace depend upon obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? What obedience do you mean that peace of conſcience dependeth upon?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. Abſolute perfection in obedience is not required unto evangelicall peace. For if it were, no man could have peace; no not Paul, nor Abraham, nor any of the holieſt of Gods children: and therefore abſolute perfection is not required. <hi>If we ſay we have not ſinned, we make Chriſt a liar, and his word is not in us,</hi> 1. John 1.10. Our conſcience can ſtill ſay we have ſinned; and it can ſtill ſay our obedience is imperfect: A halting leg can never go perfectly. A Jacob is called he that halteth; and every godly ſoul halteth; Though he do not halt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two, as wicked people do, yet he halteth in following after God. What purblind eye can ſee perfectly? or thick eare heare perfectly? He that hath theſe imperfections of body can neither go nor ſee nor heare perfectly; So the beſt of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62503:77"/>
Gods children have imperfections of heart and ſpirit and mind: their faith is imperfect, their love is imperfect; and therefore their obedience muſt needs be imperfect. But abſolute perfection is not required to true peace of conſcience; and therefore this doth not hinder it. 2. Though ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfection be not required to peace, yet ſuch obedience is required as may be acceptable to God.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Cor. <hi>5.9.</hi>
                  </note> So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We labour that whether preſent or abſent we may be accepted of him.</hi> Such obedience we muſt ſhew as may be accepted of him, or we cannot have true peace. If our endeavours be not acceptable, our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will quickly heare of it, and tell us ſo: If we pray coldly, or heare unprofitably, or live looſely, if we do not do that which is acceptable to God, our conſciences will ſoon complain. Nay though we do do the duties, if we do not do them in an acceptable manner, conſcience will have matter againſt us ſtill. 3. This acceptable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of obedience lieth in this, when our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſincere, univerſall, and totall, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ſpirit of Chriſt Jeſus dwelling in us. The Apoſtle giveth it this phraſe, <hi>When we walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.4. That is our fulfilling the law, when Chriſt hath fulfilled the law for us, and maketh us ſincerely to walk by it, not after the fleſh but after the Spirit: when we do not favour our ſelves in one luſt, nor ſuffer our ſelves in any beloved ſinne; but whatever it be that is evil, our conſcience can ſay we truly do hate it and labour to avoid it; whatever it be that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, be it never ſo contrary to our nature,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62503:77"/>
yet our conſcience can ſay we ſincerely ſet our ſelves to do it. So walking not after the fleſh but after the Spirit, this is ſincerity of obedience, and this is required unto peace. 4. This ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of obedience maketh us to bewail our very infirmities, and to be humbled for them: not onely to be humbled for greater ſinnes, but alſo to be humbled for our infirmities. If we be not ſoundly humbled for our very infirmities alſo, they will hinder the peace of our conſcience: We can have no peace except our conſcience can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that our infirmities do humble us and drive us to Chriſt and cauſe us to ſue out a pardon. If conſcience have not a pardon ſealed for infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties alſo, it will not be at peace.<note place="margin">Matth. <hi>

               <p n="4">IV. Queſtion; <hi>How if a man have a burdened and troubled conſcience, what muſt he do to be freed from it</hi>?</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this queſtion is this; Becauſe men are ignorant about it. When men are troubled in conſcience and burdened a little that way, preſently they daub all with peace, and go a wrong way to work. This courſe the Lord doth complain of in the falſe prophets who preached too much peace;<note place="margin">Jer. <hi>8.11.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people ſlightly ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.</hi> And ſo they do more hurt then good: Like a chirurgion that skinneth the wound before he giveth ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalves to kill the matter of it: afterwards it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62503:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
breaketh out worſe, and it is a hundred to one but it will coſt the patient his life: So it is with many men: A man cannot rore a little for his ſinnes, <hi>I have been a ſinner, and what ſhall I do? I have been a beaſt,</hi> &amp;c. But, O, ſay they, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve man, Chriſt died for thee, and the promiſe is to thee, and God will pardon thee.</hi> Thus they heal him ſlightly with <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> and it may be there is no peace to him yet; he had need to be ſearched more deeply: they skinne the wound, and it is a thouſand to one but it loſeth the mans ſoul, by giving a cordiall where a corroſive was neceſſarie. And therefore great reaſon that this queſtion ſhould be anſwered, If a man have a burdened troubled conſcience, what muſt ſuch a man do to be freed from it?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. Let him take heed that he meddle not too much with the ſecret will of God, what his decree and purpoſe is from eternitie. As ſoon as an arrow is ſhot into the conſcience, and the conſcience cometh to be humbled, commonly the heart layeth about it, <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. Underſtand the word right. Do not think that becauſe God hath not in particular named thee, therefore he hath excluded thee.

But if thou wouldſt have Chriſt indeed, and be in Chriſt indeed, thy heart in Chriſt, thy will in Chriſt, thy whole ſelf in Chriſt; then ariſe, he calleth thee. Thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word right, the goſpel doth not exclude thee whoſoever thou art.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thou muſt not for fear of ſhame or loſſe, &amp;c. keep from reſtitution whereſoever thou haſt done wrong, or ſatisfaction whereſoever thou haſt cozened, or reformation whereſoever thou art accuſtomed to any evil, or the doing any thing that may procure eaſe and quiet to thy conſcience. It may be one is troubled in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for his wronging his neighbour in twentie pounds, and if he would make reſtitution he might have ſound peace: but he will not; no, he daubeth up his conſcience ſome other way. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other it may be ſuffereth diſorders in his familie and foul abuſes, which if he would redreſſe he might have peace: but he will not.

he would take any pains in good duties, be more diligent for the work of repentance, &amp;c. but theſe things will not be done: Men plaiſter up their conſciences (I know not how) ſome other way, and ſo go to hell for not taking the right way. But if any of you be troubled in conſcience, keep back nothing, hold back nothing that may make for your true peace and quiet.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thou muſt wait on God: Caſt thy ſelf at his feet, humbly deſire him to give thee the true peace of conſcience.

                  </note> he taketh notice: So thou muſt wait. <hi>As ſervants wait upon their maſters, ſo our eyes wait upon the Lord till he have mercie upon us.</hi> Be obedient in the mean time: go when he ſendeth; come when he calleth; obſerve when he beckeneth; be diligent to be doing his pleaſure. 3. Thou muſt wait onely upon God, not upon thy luſts too, and upon other things too; but thou muſt wait onely upon God: <hi>My ſoul, wait thou one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon God,</hi> ſaith David, Pſal. 62.5. If thou wait upon any thing elſe, this is not to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God. One waiteth a time to be revenged; another waiteth a time to ſatisfie this or that luſt: this is not to wait upon God at all. 4. Take heed of healing thy ſelf, and comforting thy ſelf, or daubing up thy conſcience thy ſelf: If thou doſt ſo, thou doſt not wait upon God to do it: If thou doſt it thy ſelf, and ſnatcheſt at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy ſelf before he do give it, then thou doſt not wait till he give it.

               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">1. Every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may inform him in what ſtate he is.</note>1. For the firſt, That every mans conſcience may inform him what eſtate he is in, whether good or bad; (I ſpeak eſpecially of ſuch as live under the light of the Goſpel of Chriſt.) There are two rules: the one is Gods word, which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62503:80"/>
pointeth out both eſtates; and the other is every mans conſcience, which is privy to the frame and ſtanding of every mans own heart, and which of theſe eſtates his eſtate is, conſcience is privy to this. I will inſtance in ſome ſorts of men. 1. The Jews, who contented themſelves with formality: they ſacrificed, they offered, they payed their tithes, they did that which Moſes commanded them for the letter of it: now ye ſhall ſee their conſcience could tell them that they were not perfect nor upright with God: All their duties, and formalities, and gifts, and ſacrifices <hi>could not make them that did the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice perfect, as perteining to the conſcience,</hi> Heb. 9.9. Mark; Their conſciences could ſay they were not upright for all this. As they were not upright, ſo their conſcience could tell them they were not upright. 2. Another inſtance we have in the Scribes and Phariſees: When they would have condemned the woman taken in adultery, their own conſcience was privy that they were ſinners themſelves, John 18.9. So alſo it is with a child of God: His conſcience is able to inform him that he is a child of God, and that he doth truly ſerve God. <hi>I thank God,</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> ſaith Paul, <hi>whom I ſerve with a pure conſcience.</hi> His conſcience told him he was a true ſervant of God, and that he was Gods: <hi>whoſe I am,</hi> ſaith he. So Davids conſcience; <hi>I am thine; ſave me: for I have ſought thy commandments.</hi> So the church; <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> Ye ſee then how conſcience can inform and tell us what eſtate we are in, whether we be godly or carnall, whether our converſation be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62503:81"/>
in heaven or on earth, whether we be in Chriſt or out of him. The ſpirit of man knoweth what is in him. It is eaſie to know what our great thoughts of heart are upon, what our greateſt purpoſes and projects and ſtudies be; whether about God or the world: the ſpirit of a man muſt needs know it. And therefore every man may draw out from conſcience a true concluſion how it is with him. The reaſons are theſe:
<list>
                     <item>1. The firſt is taken from the nature of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The nature of conſcience is ſuch that it muſt needs be able to know what is with a man. Now his welldoings or his illdoings are with him: he was with himſelf when he did them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When thou art proud, or impatient, or careleſſe in any duty, thou art with thy ſelf when thou art ſo: All thy illdoings are with thee: and therefore thy conſcience muſt needs know what thou art.<note place="margin">

This is the nature of conſcience; It is privy to what is with one.</item>
                     <item>2. The ſecond reaſon is taken from the equity of Gods judgements on the wicked. The Lord he will judge none to hell, but his conſcience ſhall confeſſe he was one that walked in the way to hell and death. Ye may reade it in the man that had not on the wedding-garment: When
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62503:81"/>
Chriſt did charge him with his not having on a wedding-garment, and did condemne him to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſſe, the text ſaith, <hi>he was ſpeechleſſe</hi>;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.12.</note> that is, his conſcience confeſſed that Chriſts judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was juſt: <hi>I have not on a wedding-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſaith his conſcience; <hi>and it is my fault that I have none; and I am rightly condemned.</hi> Thus his conſcience did know it; otherwiſe he could not have been ſpeechleſſe in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe. As Feſtus told Agrippa that he anſwered the Prieſts,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 25.16.</note> 
                        <hi>It is not the manner of the Romanes to deliver any man to dye before that he who is accuſed have his accuſers face to face, and have licence to anſwer for himſelf concerning the crime laid against him:</hi> So may I ſay, that the great Judge of quick and dead will not judge any man to hell but he will have his accuſers face to face, and if he can anſwer for himſelf he may. Now if conſcience be not privy to what eſtate ſoever a wicked man is in, his conſcience could never accuſe him face to face at the laſt day, nor juſtifie the Lord Jeſus and make the ſinner ſtand ſpeechleſſe before God. He might anſwer, <hi>Lord, I do not know any ſuch thing as is laid to my charge: I am not convinced that the caſe is thus and thus with me, that I am in ſuch an eſtate as I am accuſed of.</hi> No wicked man ſhall be able to ſay thus: Therefore conſcience can inform a man in what eſtate he is.</item>
                     <item>3. The third reaſon is taken from the Lords manner of judging the godly. He will judge them and abſolve them <hi>ſecundùm allegata &amp; probata,</hi> as we ſay, according to the word and their own conſciences. Ye may ſee the true form
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62503:82"/>
of judgement which the Lord will go by, Matth. 25. Where the Lord convinceth the whole world who were righteous and who not, who to be judged to puniſhment, and who to life for ever; at laſt he concludeth, <hi>The wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous into life eternall.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Your conſciences can ſay ye are wicked: ye did not feed, nor clothe, nor viſit me: Go your wayes to hell.</hi> So for the righteous; <hi>Your conſciences can ſay ye are righteous: Go ye to heaven.</hi> Thus the Lord will do. Now this could not be if conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence could not inform every one that is godly that he is ſo: If conſcience could not witneſſe what eſtate they are in, this could not be. Thus ye ſee the truth of the firſt thing.</item>

Becauſe conſcience hath a very good judgement. It is a very wiſe and judicious facultie in the ſoul of man. Some make it an act of judgement. We do not take it ſo: It is not an act of judgement, but it is a reflexive facultie of the ſoul having a very good judgement. <hi>Whether it be right to obey you rather then God, judge ye,</hi> ſaith Peter, Acts 4.19. appealing to their own conſciences to judge in the point. So that conſcience is a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a good judgement. Now if it be judicious, it muſt needs be able to reaſon and to argue about our eſtates, and find out whether they be good or no. It is the judgement of man that is able to argue, and able to hold an argument: <hi>We thus judge,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that if one died for all, then are all dead,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.14. Mark; His propoſition he would prove was, <hi>That all the believers in Chriſt are dead to themſelves

and alive unto God.</hi> Now ye may ſee how his judgement maketh here an argument; <hi>If Chriſt died for them all, then they are all dead: but Christ died for them all: therefore they are all dead.</hi> Judgement is able to make arguments: and therefore if conſcience be a reflexive faculty that hath a very good judgement, it muſt needs be able to frame arguments, and ſo make out what our eſtates are. 2. Becauſe there is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall logick in every mans conſcience: It can frame ſyllogiſmes, thus, <hi>As many as be led by the ſpirit of God, are the ſonnes of God,</hi> ſaith the word: <hi>But,</hi> ſaith a godly mans conſcience, <hi>I am led by Gods ſpirit, and I am carefull to follow the leading of Gods holy ſpirit: therefore I am one of Gods ſonnes.</hi> And ſo on the other ſide. Ye will ſay, How can a countrey-mans conſcience make ſyllogiſmes? It is onely for ſcholars and ſuch as have ſtudied logick in the ſchools to make ſyllogiſmes. I anſwer, It is true; Artificiall logick is onely among ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: But there is naturall logick in conſcience, which doth not ſtand upon forms. The godly people at Rome were never brought up at Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie: yet the Apoſtle telleth them they had logick enough to argue themſelves to be dead unto ſinne and alive unto God through Chriſt; <hi>Likewiſe alſo,</hi>

therefore conſcience is able to frame arguments about our eſtate, and to inform us what it is.</p>
               <p n="3">III.<note place="margin">3. When conſcience doth this.</note> The third thing I propounded to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, When conſcience doth this. This is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſarie point: and indeed ſo they are all; but this more eſpecially. I have ſhewed that conſcience is able to inform us what eſtate we are in, whether of grace or nature: but when doth it perform this? I anſwer, I need not ſo much ſpeak of the godly, becauſe they do mark conſcience. But let me ſpeak of ſuch as are fooliſh, diſobedient, ſerving divers luſts, who never had yet the waſhing of regeneration nor the renewing of the holy Ghoſt: I anſwer about them; 1. Their conſcience muſt needs have a time when to do it. <hi>I do remember my faults this day,</hi> ſaith Pharaohs butler, Gen. 41.9. His conſcience did inform him; and there was a time when his conſcience did inform him. 2. Conſcience would chooſe a time by it ſelf: it would inform a wicked man ſolemnly and punctually of his rotten and curſed eſtate he is in. I ſay, it would have a ſolemn time by it ſelf for this, if it could have it: but a wicked man taketh an order with his conſcience that it ſhall not tell him ſolemnly how it is with him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he find a time to ſuffer it: As it was with Felix; When his conſcience began to grumble againſt him, when Paul had told him of righteouſneſſe and of judgement, he trembled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his conſcience began to ſtirre, and would then have ſolemnly dealt with him indeed: but he ſhuffled it off, and would not find time;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Go thy way at this time,</hi> ſaith he to Paul; <hi>I will heare
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62503:84"/>
thee at a more convenient time.</hi> And ſo he ſaid to his conſcience too. Conſcience would take a ſolemn and ſet time to inform men what their eſtates are; but men will not ſuffer them: and therefore conſcience is fain to take ſuch ſudden times as it can get. Ye will ask, What times be they?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Conſcience interlineth.</note>I anſwer, Firſt, when conſcience interlineth: As for example, in the hearing of the word: While men are hearing the word, it may be the preacher preacheth of holineſſe, and a wicked man heareth it; <hi>But I have it not,</hi> ſaith his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Mark; his conſcience interlineth. It may be the preacher is preaching how deſperately careleſſe men are of their ſouls, how they look to every thing more then to them; conſcience interlineth, <hi>This is my caſe.</hi> It may be he is preaching againſt adulterie; <hi>This ſinne I have committed,</hi> ſaith a guiltie conſcience: or againſt ruſhing upon Gods ordinances without prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; <hi>This is my constant courſe,</hi> ſaith an evil mans conſcience. It may be the preacher is preaching of converſion and becoming a new creature in Chriſt; <hi>This I am yet to ſeek in,</hi> ſaith conſcience.

                  <hi>What ſhall I do then?</hi> ſaith his conſcience. Thus conſcience interlined, and made him tremble on a ſudden, like a ſudden ſhivering of a cold, or a ſudden ſtartle of a man affrighted, and away it was gone quickly. I beſeech you obſerve your own boſomes. Do ye not feel this now and then at a ſermon, when ye heare it? do not your conſciences interline our ſermons, and put in parentheſes now and then? When ye heare ſuch and ſuch a ſinne reproved, condemned, <hi>And this is my ſinne,</hi> ſaith conſcience: when ye heare theſe and theſe graces commended, <hi>And I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had theſe,</hi> ſaith conſcience: when ye heare theſe and theſe marks of a carnall eſtate, <hi>And theſe or ſome of theſe are in me,</hi> ſaith conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? do not your conſciences interline in this manner? As Paul was ſpeaking to the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men concerning God, his conſcience did ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interline thus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 27.23.</note> 
                  <hi>There ſtood by me this night an Angel of God, whoſe I am,</hi> ſaith his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And as he was writing to the Romanes, <hi>God is my witneſſe,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, when conſcience falleth a choking.<note place="margin">Conſcience choketh.</note> As for example, in prayer: a wicked man prayeth; <hi>But I do not pray right,</hi> ſaith his conſcience. <hi>I humbly beſeech thee, O Lord: Nay, but I do not beſeech humbly,</hi> ſaith his conſcience. <hi>I deſire to be ſanctified &amp; purged from my ſins: Nay, but I do not hunger after any ſuch thing,</hi> ſaith conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>I do not confeſſe my ſinnes right, nor beg for

Peradventure ye hardly perceive this choking at all: It is done in a moment, and it preſently ceaſeth, becauſe ye are not willing to heare it: and therefore it may be conſcience doth it by ſudden flaſhes. It is ſaid the Lord <hi>ſpake ſuddenly</hi> to Moſes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 12.4.</note> ſo often conſcience ſpeaketh ſuddenly to men, a word and away. As David ſaith of the wicked, <hi>God ſhall ſhoot an arrow at them, and they ſhall be wounded on a ſudden:</hi> So conſcience ſhooteth a quick arrow, and it woundeth men in the twinkling of an eye, and it is gone. <hi>Lord, have mercy upon us,</hi> ſaid one: <hi>But I ſhould not ſay ſo vainly and in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary talk,</hi> ſaith conſcience. <hi>I do not hate this man for his holineſſe and ſtrictneſſe: But you do,</hi> ſaith conſcience. And ſo when men are defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil by arguments; <hi>But this is falſe,</hi> ſaith conſcience. Thus conſcience choketh on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and is gone. I confeſſe generally the men of the world mark not theſe things: They are ſuch ſudden ſparklings of conſcience that men for the moſt part do not heed them: But theſe are Gods witneſſes; and men ſhall know one day they were truly informed of their eſtates by theſe inſtantaneous <hi>Items</hi> of conſcience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when conſcience ſhooteth like a ſtitch in a mans ſide. As for example; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when men are about their callin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62503:85"/>
Many times conſcience ſpeaketh while men are working, or playing, or eating, or buying, or ſelling.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſo likewiſe when conſcience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth upon the judgements of God.

It remaineth now that I ſpeak ſomething of the fourth point.</p>
               <p n="4">IV.<note n="4" place="margin">Why many are deluded about their eſtate.</note> How cometh it to paſſe then that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands miſtake, and are ignorant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded about their eſtates? The reaſon of this doubt is this; Seeing conſcience is able to inform every one what his eſtate is, whether it be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or curſed; and ſeeing alſo that conſcience doth it; and doth it by argument; and hath its time when it doth it: a man now would wonder that any ſhould be ignorant of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate when his own conſcience doth tell him how it is with him. For anſwer I will explain unto you two things: 1. The reaſons why men are miſtaken; 2. The reaſons why they are miſtaken though conſcience inform them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They build upon falſe grounds which are not in Gods word. Some are ſo fooliſh that they build upon outward things, as health, peace, proſperitie, ſucceſſe, and the like. They
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62503:86"/>
proſper, and all things go well with them, and therefore ſure God is at peace with them: This is not ſo; but they think ſo though. Some again build upon grounds which men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds do give them, or which they take from the common opinion of moſt, thinking that to be faith and repentance which the moſt take ſo to be, or which a teacher fit for their palate taketh ſo to be. On the contrarie ſide, weak Chriſtians oftentimes miſtake themſelves by judging their eſtates to be bad, becauſe God letteth them be poore and mean &amp; comfortleſſe in the world: Therefore they conclude God is angrie with them, or that they are not that which they ſeem to themſelves to be, becauſe they are ſo croſſed in all outward things. This is the firſt reaſon of errour in this kind.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note>2. A ſecond reaſon is the not-right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Gods word: As when men judge of themſelves by ſuch places of Scripture as were not inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be rules &amp; to be of uſe to ſuch ends as they apply them: as <hi>Whoſoever calleth upon the Lord ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.13. Hence the wicked may falſely conclude, <hi>I call upon the Lord, and I pray unto him; therefore I ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And ſo on the contrarie, a weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian who findeth not in himſelf thoſe degrees of grace which ſome places of Scripture ſeem to require concludeth from thence againſt himſelf, <hi>Therefore I have no grace at all.</hi> This is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe of miſtaking.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3.</note>3. A third cauſe is the not trying and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining our own hearts. Some are loth to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves about it: They are loth to think
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62503:86"/>
ſo bad of themſelves as that they are in ſuch a courſe as wherein God will not love them. Nay, they cannot endure that others ſhould diſcover their hearts unto them: They had as lieve they ſhould ſhew them the pit of hell as ſhew them themſelves. They look to ſome common gifts and graces that are in them, ſuch gifts and graces may be in a reprobate, but they will not think ſo; as illumination, knowledge, the gift of prayer, of temperance, &amp;c. Theſe they look to, and theſe they ſpeak of, though they have reigning luſts within in their hearts: As Jehu; <hi>Come, ſee my zeal,</hi> ſaith he, 2. Kings 10.16. He doth not ſay, <hi>Come, ſee my pride and hypocriſie</hi>: but, <hi>my zeal.</hi> Jehu looked at his zeal, and ſo thought he was right. So on the contrarie, weak Chriſtians may ſometimes look onely at their ſinnes and infirmities, and take no notice of Gods graces that are in them, &amp; ſo may miſtake their own ſelves, &amp; conclude amiſſe of their eſtates. Thus I have ſhewed you the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why men are miſtaken about their eſtates. Now I will ſhew you the reaſons why men are miſtaken though conſcience do tell them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſpeeches of conſcience in the wicked many times, yea moſt times, are low ſpeeches. The gnawings of conſcience whereby they are told they are in a bad and a damned eſtate are like the gnawings of a very little worm that a man can hardly feel.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Where their worm dieth not:</hi> The word in the originall, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ſignifieth a very little worm that breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in ſcarlet, that a man can very hardly ſee or perceive: ſo men ſometimes do hardly ſee
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62503:87"/>
or perceive the condemning and gnawing of conſcience. Again, conſcience biteth ſuddenly, as I told you; it giveth a little nip, and away: Like a ſparrow that flieth by; it flieth ſo faſt by a mans eye that he can ſcarce tell whether it be a ſparrow or no: So it is not eaſily percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved whether it be a condemning conſcience or no: it giveth ſuch ſudden nips, and away, that men ſeldome take notice. Beloved, there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a wicked man under heaven; unleſſe he be delivered up abſolutely to a reprobate ſenſe, but hath a thouſand of theſe ſudden momentany nips every day in the yeare. Had he the heart to obſerve them (but be hath not) he might ſee his wretched eſtate, to trouble him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to Chriſt, and to be converted that God might heal him; I ſay, had he a heart he might ſee it: but theſe nips are ſo ſecret and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that he doth not. So likewiſe it is with the godly in regard of true comfort: Their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſuddenly flaſheth in comfort, and they many times do not obſerve it. As Job ſpeaketh of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 9.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Lo, he goeth by me, and I ſee him not: he paſſeth on alſo, and I perceive him not:</hi> So doth the Lord go by his children in the ſudden flaſhes of comfort in their conſcience, but many times they ſee him not, perceive him not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the devil blindeth mens eyes, therefore they do not ſee what their conſciences do ſhew them. Ye may reade this of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked people in Corinth:<note place="margin">

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62503:87"/>
could not chooſe but ſay, <hi>Certainly Paul preacheth the truth, and Paul liveth right, and we muſt live as he ſpeaketh and doeth.</hi> He made their conſciences ſay thus, and to tell them they were not right if they did not. But mark what followeth: Some did not ſee this: Why? <hi>The god of this world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath blinded their eyes.</hi> So the god of this world blindeth the eyes of the wicked, that what their conſciences ſhew them they do not ſee it nor obſerve it. So for Gods people; Though they be in a good and a bleſſed eſtate, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences can ſay it, yet Satan oftentimes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth them that they do not perceive their own comfort.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Men do not love conſcience. We ſhould love conſcience better then the deareſt friend we have under heaven. We would do much for a friends ſake: but we ſhould do a thouſand times more for conſcience ſake:<note place="margin">

Let their luſts call, and their profits and pleaſures call for this and that thing, they heare all: but they love not to heare conſcience. Nay, many wicked men are angry to heare talk of it. When Paul had made mention of conſcience, Ananias commanded he ſhould be ſmitten: <hi>Men and brethren,</hi> ſaith Paul,<note place="margin">

This is moſt certain; men do not love conſcience, nor to be curbed by conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor informed by conſcience: They had as lieve ſee the devil as that their conſciences ſhould inform them of their eſtates, and tell them thus and thus they are. They are told rightly, and yet they are miſtaken, becauſe they do not love to heare conſcience of that theme.</p>

               <p>YE have heard concerning the witneſſe-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of conſcience about our eſtates. The next thing to be ſpoken of is that welknown di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of a Good and a Bad conſcience.

Of them both briefly and in order; and firſt of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good conſcience</note>The goodneſſe of conſcience is twofold; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and renewed. 1. The naturall goodneſſe of conſcience conſiſteth in thoſe reliques of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which it reteineth ſince the creation. Ye know man depraved and corrupted his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by his fall: yet there be ſome reliques left, as reaſon, and knowledge, and reflexion. I do not mean reliques of any ſpirituall goodneſſe in conſcience: For as there is no ſpirituall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe left in the other faculties of the ſoul, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62503:88"/>
in conſcience. But the naturall goodneſſe which I mean is nothing elſe but the veracity of conſcience, whereby it is inforced according to the knowledge it hath to tell the truth. Thus every wicked man hath a good conſcience: Their conſcience is good in that ſenſe; their conſcience hath this naturall goodneſſe, that it telleth them the truth how it is with them. Nay, it is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to conſcience to be good in this ſenſe. It is the eſſentiall property of conſcience to ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its knowledge. It is the beſt faculty a wicked man hath: it is better then his mind, or heart, or will. There is more goodneſſe in a wicked mans conſcience then in any other of the powers of his ſoul: His conſcience ſpeaketh more for God then himſelf doth, and ſtandeth more for God then himſelf will. Not but that as all the powers of the ſoul are deſperately cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by ſinne, ſo conſcience is deſperately cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted as well as any of them: but I ſpeak of the eſſentiall goodneſſe of it, which can never be loſt. The devils in hell have not loſt the goodneſſe of their eſſence: Nay, their eſſence is better then the eſſence of Gods Saints: their eſſence muſt be good, becauſe that is Gods creature; nay, better then any mans eſſence, becauſe the Lord made them a degree above man. And as man is a degree above beaſts, ſo angels are a degree above man: ſo conſcience is a degree above other powers of the ſoul in its naturall goodneſſe. That conſcience hath ſuch a naturall goodneſſe in it, ſee it in thoſe curſed Scribes and Phariſees, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, who brought the woman taken in adultery to Chriſt: Their conſcience was good;

                     <hi>John</hi> 8.9.</note> their conſciences dealt honeſtly with them, and told them the truth that they were wicked ſinners themſelves. This is the naturall goodneſſe in conſcience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A renewed good conſcience. I call it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed good conſcience, becauſe when a man is renewed, all the man is renewed; all his mind and the ſpirit of it is renewed, Epheſ. 4.23. <hi>That ye may be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind.</hi> If the man be renewed, all the mind muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; and therefore the conſcience muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed too; for the mind and the conſcience ever go together: nay, conſcience is mainly ſeated in the mind; and therefore if the mind be renewed, ſo is the conſcience; and if the mind be defiled, ſo is the conſcience.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.</note> 
                  <hi>To them that are defiled is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pure, but their minds and conſciences are defiled.</hi> Mark; When they are defiled, they are defiled together: ſo when they are waſhed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, they are waſhed and renewed together. Now this renewed conſcience is either perfect or defective. 1. Perfect. I mean not perfect in every degree of goodneſſe: For ſo no mans conſcience in the world is perfect: But I mean perfect in every part and condition of goodneſſe. 2. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective good renewed conſcience is that which faileth in ſome conditions of goodneſſe. We call it a <hi>weak</hi> conſcience, which is apt to be polluted and defiled again. 1. Cor. 8.7. <hi>Their conſcience being weak is defiled.</hi> This is a defective good conſcience, a conſcience renewed, but imperfectly renewed.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">A firm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note>I. To a good conſcience that is ſoundly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed five things are neceſſary.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:62503:89"/>1. Knowledge of Gods will, and that which doth follow the true knowledge of his will, namely true humiliation and fear. By nature the conſcience is blind and ſturdy and venturous; and therefore it is neceſſary that it ſhould be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened to underſtand the will of God and to preſſe it: and again it is neceſſary that the heart ſhould be humbled, or elſe it will not ſtoop to Gods will: and it is neceſſary alſo that this holy fear ſhould fall upon the heart, that it may not dare to tranſgreſſe. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter being to ſpeak of a good conſcience, premiſeth all theſe as neceſſarie thereunto: Firſt he adviſeth that Chriſtians have <hi>knowledge</hi> to be able <hi>to give a reaſon of the hope that is in them</hi>; and then that they ſhould have <hi>meekneſſe</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> for to do it:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>with meekneſſe and fear,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>having a good conſcience.</hi> Mark; Knowledge and meekneſſe and fear are required to make a good conſcience; without them the conſcience cannot be good. By nature we are all blind, and ſtubborn, and fearleſſe of ſinning: and therefore till we be cured of theſe evils, our conſciences cannot be good.</item>
                  <item>2. The ſecond thing is a watchfulneſſe and warfare againſt ſinne: This is required too to a renewed good conſcience. By nature we are drowſie, and careleſſe, and ſecure, and do not ſtand upon our guard to wage warre againſt our luſts and the deſires of our fleſh; and ſo long our conſciences can never be good: and therefore this ſpirituall watchfulneſſe and mainteining warre againſt ſinne is required to the having a good conſcience: <hi>That thou maist warre a good warrefare,</hi> ſaith Paul to Timothie, <hi>having faith
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62503:90"/>
and a good conſcience,</hi> 1. Tim. 1.18, 19. Some who ſeemed to have a good conſcience, becauſe they did not maintein this holy warfare againſt ſinne and the fleſh, they have loſt it: Therefore this is another requiſite required to a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</item>
                  <item>3. The third is tenderneſſe of conſcience. By nature our hearts are ſeared, and dead, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean: and therefore we muſt get us tender and pure hearts if we would have good renewed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. <hi>The end of the commandment is love, out of a pure heart and good conſcience and faith unfeigned,</hi> 1. Tim. 1.5. See how the Apoſtle compoundeth them together, <hi>a pure heart and a good conſcience.</hi> We muſt get our hearts purged and quickened, that they may be ſenſible of the leaſt evil; and then our conſciences will be good and be as a bridle to hold us from evil. A hard heart and a good conſcience can never ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</item>
                  <item>4. The fourth is the cleanneſſe of conſcience by the waſhing of Chriſts bloud. This is the main and the principall of all: Yea indeed the bloud of Chriſt is the ſole and onely cauſe of a good conſcience. I would not be miſtaken: I named indeed other cauſes; Knowledge, and Humbling, and a holy Fear, a Combat againſt ſinne, and Tenderneſſe: but I do not mean as though a good conſcience were partly beholding to them and partly to Chriſts bloud: For it is wholly and onely beholding to Chriſts bloud for its goodneſſe; his bloud is the onely price of it: But my meaning is this, That though Chriſts bloud be the one onely cauſe of redemption, yet
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62503:90"/>
in the application of redemption the Lord uſeth all thoſe forenamed graces while he applieth it to the conſcience. Therefore this now I adde; The waſhing of Chriſts bloud, this is chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the goodneſſe of conſcience. We have two places of Scripture to prove it: The one, Heb. 9.14. <hi>How much more ſhall the bloud of Christ purge your conſciences from dead works?</hi> It is that onely can do it. The other text is 1. Pet. 3.21. <hi>The anſwer of a good conſcience towards God by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Where the Apoſtle firſt giveth this title to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed conſcience, to be called <hi>a good conſcience</hi>: Secondly, he nameth the cauſe that maketh it to be good, the power of <hi>Chriſts reſurrection:</hi> When the reſurrection of Chriſt Jeſus is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full upon us, then conſcience becometh good.</item>
                  <item>5. The fifth is quietneſſe. By nature nothing is ſo fierce and violent, if it be once awaked, as conſcience is: O it is unſpeakably furious. Thus is conſcience by nature: and therefore it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be good untill we get it appeaſed with the aſſurance of the pardon of our ſinnes, and ſo true peace and comfort eſtabliſhed in it. This is the reaſon why the Scripture joyneth a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and faith ſo often together: as 1. Tim. 3.9. <hi>Holding the mysterie of faith in a pure conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> It cannot be a pure or good conſcience if faith be not held in it. As long as the conſcience is not underpropped by faith, the conſcience muſt needs be in a wilderneſſe: <hi>Perhaps my ſinnes are imputed unto me; perhaps they are pardoned: Perhaps they are covered, perhaps not.</hi> As long as the conſcience lieth under theſe uncertainties,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62503:91"/>
it cannot be firm and ſoundly good indeed: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt labour for aſſurance of pardon by faith. Thus much of a good renewed conſcience that is perfectly and ſoundly renewed.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">An infirm conſcience</note>II. Secondly, There is a good conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed but not ſoundly renewed, very much as yet defective and imperfect. The former conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is called <hi>conſcientia firma,</hi> a firm conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: This is called <hi>conſcientia infirma,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm conſcience. Rom. 15.1. <hi>We that are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak.</hi> This infirm conſcience is a good conſcience too, and renewed, but cumbred with ſundry imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which in proceſſe of time by growth in grace are, for the moſt part, conquered in the godly. True faith is required unto this: For the Apoſtle calleth ſuch an one <hi>a brother in Christ,</hi> one that hath this infirm conſcience:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.21.</note> 
                  <hi>It is good neither to eat fleſh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thy brother ſtumbleth.</hi> And we muſt not ſet ſuch an one at nought, <hi>Tuſh, what care I for him? I know I may lawfully do thus: and this is my Chriſtian liberty; and ſhall I loſe it for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his conſcience</hi>? Nay ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Why doſt thou ſet at nought thy brother?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10.</note> Mark; The Apoſtle counteth ſuch an one a Chriſtian brother, and not to be ſet at nought: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is a good conſcience too, differing as much as white from black from ſuch conſciences as are weak through ſuperſtition of mind and through pride of heart becauſe they will not be otherwiſe, or through affected ignorance becauſe they love not to be better informed. Theſe weak conſciences are wicked; I ſpeak not of theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62503:91"/>
ſpeak of a good conſcience, a conſcience renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but renewed imperfectly, having yet ſundry defects and imperfections. The imperfections of it are
<list>
                     <item>1. Imperfection of knowledge. It doth not yet ſoundly and clearly underſtand what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and what is pure, and what is by Chriſtian liberty indifferent. Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14.</note> 
                        <hi>I know and am perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing unclean of it ſelf: but to him that eſteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</hi> He ſpeaketh of things that are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: The Apoſtle had knowledge: but there were others who did not know this; <hi>O I may not eat this meat; I may not play at bowls, or uſe any other recreation: I ſhould ſinne if I ſhould,</hi> &amp;c. This is one weakneſſe in this kind of conſcience, weakneſſe of knowledge.</item>
                     <item>2. The ſecond imperfection is to be grieved where it needeth not be grieved: As when it ſeeth other do that which it ſelf through miſtake doth judge to be evil, it is apt to be grieved and troubled to ſee it;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15.</note> 
                        <hi>If thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not charitably.</hi> It may be thou thinkeſt it lawfull to eat ſuch meat; but he thinketh otherwiſe, and ſo is grieved to ſee thee eat. This is another imperfection in this conſcience, to be grieved and offended without juſt cauſe.</item>
                     <item>3. A third imperfection is in judgement: It is apt to judge and condemne another mans liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: 1. Cor. 10.29. <hi>Why is my liberty judged of another mans conſcience</hi>? He ſpeaketh of a weak conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>It is apt to be judging &amp; condemning
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62503:92"/>
my liberty</hi> ſaith he; <hi>but why ſo?</hi> This is a fault and an imperfection indeed; <hi>O ſuch an one ſinneth, he doeth ſo and ſo:</hi> yet it may be the thing is not unlawfull but a weak conſcience is apt ſo to judge it, and to condemne him that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. <hi>Let not him that eateth deſpiſe him that eateth not: and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth,</hi> Rom. 14.3.</item>
                     <item>4. A fourth imperfection is this: A weak conſcience is apt to be miſled. So the Apoſtle intimateth; <hi>Take heed leſt by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling-block unto them that are weak: for if any man ſee thee who haſt knowledge ſit at meat in the idoles temple, ſhall not the conſcience of him that is weak be emboldned to eat thoſe things which are offered to idoles? and through thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall thy weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt died?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9, 10, 11.</note> Where ye ſee that weak conſciences are apt to be miſled. The reaſon is this, Becauſe when they ſee others whom they know to be more learned and judicious then themſelves to do ſo and ſo, that may ſoon tempt them to do it though their conſcience be againſt it.</item>

               </p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1.</note>The firſt uſe is this; If any have weak conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences let them labour to ſtrengthen them. Ye ſee what imperfections are in a weak conſcience; how apt it is to be offended and to judge other mens liberty, how prone to miſleading: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every good ſoul labour to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>The ſecond uſe is this; Thoſe that be ſtrong muſt be carefull that they offend not the weak. Though they do believe ſuch and ſuch Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, if it be ſuch a ſinne to ſinne againſt the conſcience of the weak,<note place="margin">3.</note> then what a ſinne is it to ſinne againſt the conſcience of all that are godly, whether weak ones or ſtrong ones? Ye who walk after the fleſh, and can have diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in your families, and vanity in your mouths, and apparent corruptions in your lives; Ye who can drink and be drunken and keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and profane the Lords dayes; ye offend the conſciences of all that are godly: it is a grief to their ſouls to ſee it. Let me tell you; It is a ſinne to be wicked however, and the high-way to hell: but to be wicked when ye have godly neighbours about you, your ſinne now is double: For as you offend God, ſo you offend them too. Ye may remember what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever offendeth one of theſe little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a milſtone were hung about his neck, &amp; that he were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the depth of the ſea,</hi> Matth. 18.6. Ah ye vile wretches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ye little imagine what fearfull ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance ye pull on your own heads: It were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you that a milſtone were hung about your necks, and ye thrown into the ſea, then that ye ſhould offend one of theſe little ones. Ye may call them what ye will; call them <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes, preciſians, uncharitable people, cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers:</hi> ye may call them as Satan teacheth you to call them: but it is certain, it were better a

milſtone were hung about your neck, and ye thrown into the ſea, then that ye ſhould offend any one of Chriſts little ones: The Lord open your eyes that ye may repent and believe the Goſpel your ſelves and be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, be exhorted, brethren, to labour after a good conſcience. How excellent a thing is it that hath ſo many good ingredients! Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is one ingredient, and Faith is another, and Tenderneſſe another, and Pureneſſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Quietneſſe another, and the Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt another. It is like Aarons compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which ſmelt ſweetly when he went into the ſanctuarie: It is compounded of excellent conditions, ſuch as ſmell ſweet when we come before God: the Lord loveth that ſuch ſhould come near him.

It will make us with quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; contentedneſſe of ſpirit undergo whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſhall pleaſe God to lay upon us. How can they want comfort that have this? It is a ſpring of comfort within them. This will remain with us when all other comforts will forſake us: When friends fail, and eſtate faileth, when credit and health and ſtrength and all fail, then a good conſcience, if we have it, will ſpeak peace to us, yea and it will effect it in us, comfort us,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62503:93"/>
and faſten comfort upon us. Friends may ſpeak words of comfort and peace to us; but it may be we are not able to receive it: the miniſter may preach peace; but it may be we are not able to take it: But a good conſcience ſpeaketh peace and effecteth it; it doth not onely ſpeak it but it putteth it into our hearts. It proppeth us up in all miſeries, in ſickneſſes, yea in death it ſelf. A good conſcience then maketh us hold up our heads when all the world ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded: A good conſcience will bear us out againſt the King of terrours: It is onely a good conſcience that can look death in the face, and ſay, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting?</hi>

                  <hi>thanks be to God who giveth us victorie through our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> Yea, at the day of judgement, when the whole world ſhall be burning before us, when the great men of the world who go in ſilks and ſcarlet and broidered hair ſhall fear and ſhiver as a reed ſhaken with the wind, this will make us with boldneſſe undergo the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of it. This will make us happie in all our diſtreſſes: When croſſes pelt us, and ſickneſſe paineth us, and death attatcheth us, we are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie men. What if we have the tokens of Gods wrath upon our bodies ſo we have the marks of his love upon our ſouls?

                  </gap>r to get it by faith and a holy life. If we would be ſafe in the floud-time, in the day of Gods wrath, we muſt be buſie now about the ark, we muſt provide beforehand for it: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this ark will ſave us in the deluge of

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.20.</note> Jubal was a merrie man; he made pipes and organes: Jabal built tents; others planted vineyards: but Noah provided his ark. Many deſire comfort in ſickneſſe, in death; but they do not provide for it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand: They look after their ſports or buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the world; but this ark is neglected, this good conſcience, without which all mens labour is vain. Be they what they will be, in never ſo much credit and eſteem, they are yet moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable when troubles and afflictions come on them, as one day they ſhall and ſhall not tarrie; then all their comforts will forſake them: When death looketh them in the face: then their hearts die within them.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62503:95"/>
is given, Becauſe it is God onely who is able to ſave and to deſtroy. As if he had ſaid, God onely hath power over life and death, either to ſave a man for ever, or deſtroy a man for ever, and to judge a man according to all that he hath done: and therefore he onely can make laws to bind the conſciences of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now the ſecondarie or relative bond of conſcience is, when others who have authoritie from God bind conſcience to this or that. I call this a relative bond, becauſe it is onely in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the authoritie of God. For though men cannot challenge any doings or omiſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to their law to be ſinnes, yet if they have authoritie from God to command any thing, then they become beams and parts of Gods law, and do by virtue of that bind a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>This relative bond of conſcience is twofold. Firſt, other men may bind our conſciences; as magiſtrates, and maſters, and parents: who though they cannot bind conſcience as they are men, yet when they have authoritie from God, their commands have Gods ſeals upon them, and do bind, I ſay, in relation to Gods law, which biddeth us obey them; Rom. 13.5. <hi>Ye must needs be ſubject, not onely for wrath but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> The Apoſtle there ſpeaketh of Magiſtrates; and he telleth us that their laws bind our conſciences in relation to Gods, and therefore we muſt be ſubject unto them for conſcience ſake. Thus others may bind our conſciences. Secondly, we our ſelves may bind our own conſciences; and that is by vows
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62503:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which we make unto God, or by our promiſes which we lawfully make unto men. The vows which we freely make unto God, theſe bind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to keep them: Numb. 30.4. the vow of a woman is called <hi>the bond wherewith ſhe hath bound her ſoul.</hi> Mark; ſhe bindeth her ſoul and her conſcience with it. So the promiſes which we lawfully make unto men, theſe alſo bind conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: For though before we promiſe it was in our own power, yet when we have promiſed we have bound our own conſciences to the performance, becauſe there is Gods ſeal upon it; Gods law commandeth us to be true of our words. Theſe are relative bonds, bonds onely in relation to Gods law: Gods law is ſtill the ſupreme bond of conſcience. I will handle that firſt.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Becauſe God onely hath power over con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: It is his commandment onely that maketh any thing ſinne or not ſinne unto us. Auguſtine defineth ſinne to be <hi>A thought, or word, or deed, or luſt againſt the commandment of God. Againſt thee,</hi>

Conſcience is like the kings ſervant, whom none can arreſt or attach without leave from the king: ſo no man can bind conſcience without leave had from God: for conſcience is onely ſubject to his power: he onely hath power over conſcience.</p>

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.</note> that <hi>when the Gentiles which have not the law do the things conteined in the law, they having not the law are a law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> that is, Their conſcience is Gods law unto them. Like as the Bible conteineth Gods law for us Chriſtians, ſo did their conſciences contein the law of God to them: yea, to us Chriſtians much rather: For we are not to let Gods law be written onely in our Bibles, but we muſt get it written in our conſciences: our conſciences are to be Gods books wherein his laws are to be written. And therefore if it be a ſinne to adde a new law in the materiall book to bind men, then it muſt needs be a ſinne for any creature to put a new law into conſcience, which is the ſpirituall book of God. It is God onely who can write laws in this book: his book is above all the laws in the world; and none but God can put in and put out: and therefore none but he can bind conſcience.

Then this teacheth us to have an eye to Gods word in that which we do, if we would ſatisfie conſcience. I ſay, have an eye to Gods word: not onely to do that which it may be is in Gods word; conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence counteth that to be nothing: but to have an eye to Gods word. Conſcience will not be ſatisfied with any obedience that we do if we
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62503:98"/>
have not an eye to Gods word. Whatever we have an eye to beſides, conſcience knoweth it is nothing, if in all we have not an eye to the commandment of God: Though we do obey it, conſcience looketh upon it as if we did not obey it. It is onely Gods commandment and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie that bindeth conſcience: and therefore nothing ſatisfieth conſcience unleſſe we have an eye unto that. If we do not aim at Gods will in doing what we do, conſcience counteth our obedience as no obedience at all. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Ye that are husbands, ye love your wives: but is it becauſe God commandeth it? It may be ye love them becauſe they love you, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your affections are to them: Alas, this is nothing: Pagans and reprobates can do ſo. But do ye aim at the doing of Gods will, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth you? O ſay you, <hi>The Lord doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me, I do it.</hi> What of that? Do ye look at his commandment when ye do it? If not; be humbled, and know ye muſt get grace to do ſo, or ye are not obedient to God, neither will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſet it down for obedience. Ye that are ſervants, ye ſerve your maſters: but do ye aim at Gods will? thus, <hi>O the Lord hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to be faithfull and painfull in my ſervice.</hi> Doth your ſoul look to this? It may be ye ſerve them becauſe they are kind, and becauſe they pay you your wages, and the like: This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to conſcience: conſcience looketh at the commandment of God; and if your ſouls do not aim at the commandment of God, it will not ſatisfie conſcience. Ye that are neighbours, it may be ye love one another, and be friends

one with another: but doth your ſoul look at Gods commandment? is it becauſe God hath commanded us to love one another? People ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome aim at God in theſe caſes: They are friends with their neighbours: why? Their neighbours are friends with them. But they do not trouble their thoughts to aim at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment in it. Let me tell you; Conſcience will not count this obedience: For conſcience feeleth no bond but Gods word: and if ye do not look at that, it is no obedience with conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; conſcience will never acquit you or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve you for this; it accounteth of this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as no obedience at all. See 1. Cor. 10.25. and ſo forward. There the Apoſtle handling that queſtion of conſcience, at laſt concludeth, <hi>Whether ye eat or drink or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glorie of God,</hi> verſ. 31. Let your hearts look at that, and aim at that; in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye do, ſtill look at God: all is loſt with conſcience elſe. Though ye eat never ſo ſoberly, and drink never ſo moderately, pray never ſo duly, conſcience counteth it all nothing if ye do not look at God: It is God onely and his word that doth bind it; and it will never give a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge except your hearts look at him.</p>

Secondly, the conſcience of the regenerate is freed from ſeeking juſtification by the deeds of the law. Indeed the firſt covenant was by the works of the law; <hi>He that doeth them ſhall live in them:</hi> But the ſecond covenant ſpeaketh better things; <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> It is true, if God had not ſent his Sonne we muſt have ſought juſtification by the works of the law: Though it were impoſſible to find it by reaſon of our ſinnes, yet conſcience was bound that way. But now that Chriſt Jeſus hath ſealed up a new covenant in his own bloud, conſcience is freed from that former: Rom. 3.28. <hi>Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the law.</hi> For though juſtifying faith never be without the ſincere doing of the law, yet the deeds of the law have no influence into juſtification: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is freed from ſeeking juſtification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Thirdly, the conſcience of the regenerate is freed from the rigour of the law. They are bound in conſcience to uſe the law as a rule of their life, and in ſinceritie to obey it; but are not bound by the goſpel to the rigour of it: that they are freed from; and ſo they <hi>are not under the law but under grace.</hi>

They ſhall be condemned for every vain thought, for every idle word, for every the leaſt ſinne, for every the leaſt luſt, for any the leaſt omiſſion of good. They lie under the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the law, and they are bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to keep it, and they ſhall be countable for every tranſgreſſion, becauſe they are under the law. But the conſcience of the regenerate is free from this rigour, becauſe they are under grace,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6.</note> and therefore they are <hi>delivered from the law:</hi> The Lord hath deliverd them by the body of Chriſt; and therefore they are not bound by the goſpel to all that obedience that the law in rigour requireth. Fourthly, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the regenerate is freed from the curſe of the morall law. For though the law doth condemne, yet their conſcience needeth not fear it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</note> becauſe they are in Chriſt: <hi>There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus, which walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Indeed thoſe that are not regenerate, not ingraffed into Chriſt, they are ſtill in the mouth of the gunſhot: the law doth condemne them, and they have no ſhelter, and their conſcience is bound by it; and they ſhall find one day that by it their conſcience will condemne them to hell.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62503:101"/>
that the breach of it is a ſinne, bindeth conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but the law hath this authoritie, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regenerate nor unregenerate can tranſgreſſe it but they ſinne: therefore the law bindeth their conſciences. For the regenerate and all are bound in conſcience to take heed of ſinne:<note place="margin">1. <hi>John</hi> 3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever committeth ſinne tranſgreſſeth alſo the law.</hi> David was a regenerate man; yet when he had defiled Bathſheba, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> ſaith he. Joſeph was a regenerate man; yet confeſſeth, if he ſhould tranſgreſſe the Lords commandment, he ſhould ſinne: <hi>How ſhall I do this great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, and ſo ſinne againſt God</hi>? But ye will object, This is old teſtament. What of that? I hope you will not take up the old damned hereſie again of the Cerdonians, and Cainites, and Apellites, and Manichees, and Severians, and other ſuch curſed hereticks condemned by the Church of God: Their hereſie was, To hedge out the regenerate from the old teſtament. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Auguſtine proved it againſt them, That the morall law of God was ever the rule of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſhall ſo continue with the goſpel to the end of the world; and every tranſgreſſion thereof is ſinne. The breach of the ceremoniall law was a ſinne once; but now it is not: becauſe once it bound the conſcience; now it doth not: But the breach of the morall law is ſtill ſinne: therefore ſtill it bindeth the conſcience. Do ye not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what St James ſaith now under the Goſpel? he preſſeth it yet on mens conſciences: <hi>He that ſaid, Do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo,</hi>

But the law of God being obſerved doth cauſe the conſcience to excuſe; being tranſgreſſed, to accuſe; <hi>In many things we ſinne all,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Mark; Our conſciences do accuſe us: as we do ſinne in many things, ſo our conſciences do accuſe us when we do ſo. <hi>I am a ſinfull man,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter, Luke 5.8.

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4.</note>Fourthly, That which is the condition of Gods covenant of grace bindeth the conſcience, yea of the regenerate: but ſincere obedience to Gods law is a condition of Gods covenant of grace. See Luke 1.72. <hi>To remember his holy covenant, and the oath that he ſware that he would give us, That being delivered out of the hands of our enemies we might ſerve him without fear in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him all the dayes of our life.</hi> Mark; Sincere and univerſall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is a condition of the covenant of grace, not onely for a manifeſtation to our ſelves that we are truly juſtified; as theſe upſtart patritians do hold: but it is the condition of the covenant of grace. Every covenant hath its conditions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62503:102"/>
and therefore it is called <hi>the book of the covenant,</hi> Exod. 24.7. <hi>the words of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Exod. 34.28. <hi>the tables of the covenant,</hi> Deut. 9.11. The reaſon is this; Becauſe when a covenant is made, the conditions are put into a book or a table and expreſſed in words. Onely here is the difference between the firſt covenant of works and the ſecond covenant of grace: Both have conditions; but here, I ſay, is the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; In the one grace giveth the covenant, and grace giveth the condition of the covenant; but a condition is annexed though: Now hence we may argue (and none but enemies to the Goſpel can denie it) If the covenant of grace do bind a mans conſcience, then certainly the condition of the covenant bindeth a mans conſcience too: But the covenant of grace bindeth the conſcience of the regenerate; and therefore the condition of it bindeth. If you ask, What is this to obedience? the anſwer is, That obedience is the condition of the covenant of grace, as the forenamed Scripture expreſſeth, Luke 1.72. Thus ye ſee the law of God bindeth the conſcience of all the regenerate. This is the third Uſe.</p>

Then hence we may learn, that no creature can diſpenſe with it, nor free conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from guilt when a man tranſgreſſeth the word. What a damned uſurpation is it in the Pope to offer to diſpenſe? The Canoniſts ſay he may diſpenſe <hi>de praeceptis veteris &amp; novi teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi> (They are their own words) <hi>he may diſpenſe with the commandments of the old and new teſtament.</hi> He diſpenſed with king Henry

O theſe are damned aſpirings; and they plainly declare him to be Antichriſt, who exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelf in this manner. The word of God is the ſupreme binder of conſcience: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not all the Angels in heaven can diſpenſe with one idle word.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>For ever, O Lord, thy word is ſettled in heaven.</hi> Gods word is ſettled for ever in heaven; and therefore ye may aſſoon remove the heaven from its place as one tittle of the word from binding conſcience. Doth the word ſay thus or thus? thou hadſt beſt do it: If thou wilt not, all the whole world cannot help thee; thy conſcience will condemne thee at the day of judgement without remedie. Hath the word convinced thee of thy ſinnes, and made thy conſcience ſay, <hi>I am a ſinner, and am guiltie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God</hi>? I tell thee then, Thy conſcience is bound, and all the world cannot looſe it. But haſt thou been humbled and emptied of thy ſelf, and doth the word pronounce pardon of thy ſinnes in Chriſts name, that thy conſcience can ſay, <hi>The Lord ſpeaketh peace to my ſoul</hi>? I tell thee, Thou art looſed, and nor hell nor devil nor, ſinne nor fleſh nor any thing can bind thee. Ye may ſee the power of Gods word in that ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven,</hi> Matth. 18.18. That is, My word which ye preach is of that nature, that if that looſe your conſcience, it is looſed indeed,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62503:103"/>
and nothing can bind it; if that do bind it, it is bound ſoundly indeed, and nothing can looſe it. O this is a terrour to the wicked! Doth the word of God ſay, <hi>He that hardneth his neck,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1.</note> 
                  <hi>being often rebuked, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured?</hi> O fear and tremble ye that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den your necks againſt the reproofs of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie: his word bindeth over your conſciences to Chriſts barre. Doth the word ſay. <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and adulterers God will judge</hi>? If thou beeſt ſuch an one, thy conſcience is bound with this word, and it will apply it to the ſoul before the tribunal-ſeat of Chriſt. Doth the word crie out againſt any of thy courſes? thy conſcience is bound as with chains, and it is not all thy vain hopes and excuſes can looſe thee. Again, this is comfort to the godly: Gods word is the ſupreme binder of conſcience. O ye bleſſed of the Lord, the word of God tieth ſuch a faſt knot to your comforts that all hell cannot open it with their teeth: The word of the Lord Jeſus is with you, <hi>who hath the key of David, that openeth and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no man openeth.</hi> Yea, but ſayeſt thou, <hi>My ſinnes are against me:</hi> What then? mark what the word ſaith, <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father:</hi> Thy conſcience is bound to believe that. <hi>Yea, but I have a very naughtie heart, and I cannot tell what to do with it:</hi> Mark what the word ſaith; <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> This bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thy conſcience. <hi>But I offend dayly:</hi> Mark ſtill what the word ſaith;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.</note>

               <p>YE have heard that the bonds of conſcience are of two ſorts: Firſt, there is a ſupreme bond of conſcience, and that is Gods word: of which I have already ſpoken. Secondly, there is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive bond of conſcience, which bindeth conſcience indeed, but it is onely in relation to Gods word, becauſe Gods word putteth authority upon it.

               <p n="1">1. Magiſtrates have power to command us. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and the powers that be are ordained of God,</hi> Rom. 13.1. That chapter doth moſt clearly prove this concluſion unto us.</p>
               <p>Out of the firſt part of the chapter we learn, 1. That Magiſtrates have power and authority to make laws, and to eſtabliſh orders among men; and therefore they are called <hi>powers:</hi> 2. We learn that theſe laws of Magiſtrates receive ſtrength and force from the law of God: <hi>For the powers that be are ordained of God,</hi> ſaith the text. 3. Thoſe laws made by the Magiſtrate and confirmed by God have power to bind conſcience, verſ. 5. <hi>Wherefore we muſt be ſubject not onely becauſe of wrath but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> And the violating of them is ſinne. When their authority is confirmed by God, we cannot <hi>reſiſt them</hi> but we <hi>reſiſt the ordinance of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: nay, we may pull <hi>condemnation upon us</hi> if we do; <hi>They that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> verſ. 2.

Again, ſo farre onely are they to be obeyed (ſo farre onely, I ſay) as they virtually do flow from Gods word: for ſo farre onely they receive force from Gods law. This is the firſt concluſion.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The commandments of Magiſtrates and thoſe that are in authoritie loſe their power of binding the conſcience in foure caſes:
<list>
                     <item>1. When they command that which though in it ſelf it be not ſimply and abſolutely ſinfull and unlawfull, yet it doth put us upon a neceſſity of ſinning: As for example, If a Magiſtrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſingle life to all Miniſters, this thing is not in it ſelf ſimply unlawfull (for it is lawfull to marry, and it is lawfull not to marry) yet this commandment is unlawfull, becauſe it would put Miniſters upon a neceſſity of ſinning: The reaſon is, becauſe all have not this power. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a commandment as this would not bind conſcience: For the conſcience cannot be bound to impurity, or an apparent danger of impurity: and therefore though the thing be not ſimply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, yet the commandment is ſimply unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and doth not bind conſcience. The Apoſtle
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62503:105"/>
maketh ſuch a commandment to argue a ſeared conſcience in the commander: and therefore none but a ſeared conſcience can think it is bound by it, 1. Tim. 4.2, 3.</item>
                     <item>2. The commandments of Magiſtrates loſe their power of binding the conſcience when they command things that are unlawfull in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and contrary to the word of God. In this caſe they do not bind conſcience, becauſe Gods ſeal is not on them. We have an example of this in the three bleſſed children;<note place="margin">Dan. <hi>3.16.</hi>
                        </note> Who when the king commanded them to worſhip the image that he had ſet up, they did not conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound in conſcience to obey: they would rather ſuffer torment then obey it. So alſo Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, when he was commanded not to ask any petition of God for thirty dayes ſpace, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the king, Daniel did not conceive himſelf bound in conſcience, nay he choſe rather to be caſt into the den of lions then obey.<note place="margin">Dan. <hi>6.16.</hi>
                        </note> In this caſe the anſwer of the Apoſtles is neceſſary; who when they were commanded not to preach any more in the name of the Lord Jeſus, thus they anſwered, <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God to obey men rather then God, judge ye.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. When mens laws and commands over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the libertie of Chriſtianitie, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us, then they loſe their power of binding the conſcience. But here I muſt tell you of a cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>viz.</hi> That this libertie may be conſidered in a double reſpect: 1. In regard of it ſelf, the libertie it ſelf; 2. In regard of the exerciſe or uſe of this libertie. Now there is a very great
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62503:106"/>
difference between theſe two conſiderations; as there is a great difference between a mans ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſword and a mans wearing a ſword. The Magiſtrate may reſtrain a man from wearing a ſword at ſuch or ſuch a time, though he do not take his ſword from him: ſo there is difference between the having our libertie and the uſing our libertie. There is a libertie purchaſed for Gods children, whereby all things are become lawfull unto them: <hi>All things are lawfull unto me,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>14.14.</hi>
                        </note> ſaith Paul 1. Cor. 6.12. <hi>and there is nothing evil in it ſelf:</hi> (he ſpeaketh of indifferent things.) Gods children are freed from the obſervation of meats, and drinks, and times, and garments. Now whatſoever commandment is made by the Magiſtrate contrarie to this libertie doth not bind conſcience: for nothing can bind conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence when Chriſt doth looſe it: Yet there may be a reſtraint of the uſe of this libertie: as for example, the Magiſtrate may command us to forbear ſome kinds of meats at ſome certain times; and ſo alſo for garments, and the like: namely, when the doctrine about meats and drinks and garments is pure. And therefore in ſuch a caſe the command of the Magiſtrate bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the conſcience; otherwiſe not.</item>
                     <item>4. When they command things indifferent to be abſolutely neceſſarie, to make them ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous or ſuperſtitious, then in this caſe they are unlawfull and bind not the conſcience to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them. But when are they idolatrous? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; 1. When they are commanded either as abſolutely neceſſarie to Chriſtianitie, to the very being of religion and the worſhip of God, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62503:106"/>

When they are commanded for the ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perfection of religion, as though religion were imperfect without them, then they are made idolatrous, and loſe their virtue of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſcience.

Nay, though they command that which is utterly unlawfull, we muſt not riſe

We muſt obey them one way or other, either actively or paſſively: When they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that which is lawfull for us to do, we muſt obey them by doing: when they command that which is unlawfull for us to do, and threaten puniſhment, then we cannot actively obey them by doing, becauſe they command againſt God; yet we muſt paſſively obey by ſuffering and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to their penalties, becauſe the Lord hath given them authority over us.

               <p n="4">4. Thoſe laws of Magiſtrates which by Gods law do not bind conſcience, do yet in matter of ſcandal bind us to obedience. If the Magiſtrate ſhall command any thing beyond his power to command yet not unlawfull for us to do, though ſuch a command do not bind to obedience in caſe of conſcience, yet in caſe of ſcandal it doth.

I will put an example of another nature; In a private wrong, though we are not expreſſely bound to it, yet rather then ſcandalouſly to contend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth bind us to yield. Needed Abraham to have condeſcended ſo farre unto Lot as to let him take his choice before him? No rather then ſcandal of religion ſhould ariſe, ye may reade that he did it. Thus I have briefly made it manifeſt how farre the commands of the Magiſtrate do

not bind conſcience, and how farre they do.</p>

conſcience. Again, this confuteth the Papiſts, who teach that their Popes laws and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of ſupreme authoritie, and require equall ſubmiſſion of ſpirit with Gods laws: and alſo that the omiſſion of them is death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Our doctrine and religion goeth between both: For we teach that Gods authoritie is onely ſupreme, and that he onely can make laws under pain of death and damnation; and that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Magiſtrates is ſecondarie, and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie obedience is to be given unto them. The Papiſts ſpeak blaſphemie in ſaying their Pope can make laws under pain of damnation to be kept: Our Saviour Chriſt maketh this a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie onely of God; <hi>Fear not him that can kill the bodie, and there is all that he can do: but fear him who can caſt both bodie and ſoul into hell: I ſay unto you, Fear him,</hi> Luke 12.4.

Ye may reade a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example in Ephraim; They were utterly deſtroyed for obeying their King rather then their God: The King commanded to worſhip the calves, and to go unto Bethel and not to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem

O ſay they, <hi>Ye are irregular and deſpiſers of authoritie.</hi> I ſay, this is comfort to the godly, that God is able to bear them out in obeying him rather then men. Gods word is the ſupreme binder of conſcience; and therefore, whatever men think of ſuch, they are abſolutely bound to obey God. If men command us againſt the word of God, we know their authoritie is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God; and therefore if they go beyond that, they do not bind us in conſcience. If God had not bound us in conſcience to him, others might have taken it ill if we ſhould not obey them: but now what cauſe have others to think ill of us? What folly were it in us to ſeek to pleaſe men and to diſpleaſe God? If we were at libertie, then we might chooſe whom we would obey: but now we are bound unto God, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62503:109"/>
muſt be obedient unto God, whatever men command to the contrarie, let us do it therefore with chearfulneſſe. By this we ſhew our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to God; by this we ſatisfie conſcience, which being bound unto God doth continually urge us to obey him. Why ſhould we omit part of the exactneſſe of our obedience which the word of God doth require? We have more to do then ever we ſhall be able to perform: we ſhould therefore be carefull to do all that we may. By our obedience to God in this kind we convince the conſcience of others of our up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe towards God: Though through the overruling dominion of their luſts and paſſions they rage at us, and their mouthes ſpeak evil of us, yet we may have an evidence in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences within which may teſtifie for us: their conſciences will whiſper within them, <hi>Surely they do well to pleaſe God rather then men:</hi> their conſciences will be on our ſide, though their actions and tongues be againſt us. We have a notable example of this Acts 4.15, 16. When the rulers of the Jews had threatned the Apoſtles, and had reviled them with many bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words, and had bidden them go aſide for a while, then they concluded among themſelves, <hi>Surely an evident ſigne is done by them, and we cannot deny it:</hi> So that their conſciences acquitted them for good men. So when the wicked of this world have ſpoken evil of the wayes of the righteous, and blaſphemed the holy name after which they are named: yet when they are alone, and their conſciences at counſel within themſelves, then they conclude,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62503:110"/>
                  <hi>Indeed they do well.</hi> Thus their conſciences give a good evidence of us, and accuſe them for not doing the like. And thus much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken of other mens binding of conſcience.</p>

                     <item>2. Such as we make of things unlawfull; when we vow to do that which is contrarie to Gods law: ſuch as Davids was when he vowed the deſtruction of Nabals familie: This doth not bind conſcience:<note place="margin">

                        </note> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bindeth conſcience but that which hath Gods ſeal upon it: but this hath not Gods ſeal on it; and therefore it doth not bind conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed it bindeth us in conſcience to repent of it.</item>
                     <item>4. Such as though they be lawfull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and in our own freedome, yet if there fall a greater conſequence before the time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, we are not bound in conſcience to perform them: as if a man upon the receit of ſome mercie ſhould in teſtimonie of his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe vow a hundred pounds to good uſes, in the mean time his eſtate ſo decayeth as that he ſhall undo himſelf and his familie if he perform it; this is ſo great a conſequence, and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently hapned, that it freeth his conſcience from performing what he had vowed: Or if a man ſhould promiſe marriage to a woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of nuptials ſhe be found unchaſt; this is a farre greater conſequence, and he is not bound in conſcience to marry her.

and beſides it may prove ſcandalous and offenſive to them to whom we make it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to them that ſhall heare of it: And therefore it requireth good judgement and adviſe to vow. What a raſh vow was that of good Jephthah? <hi>If thou wilt deliver Ammon into my hand,</hi>

Ye have all made a vow unto God in your baptiſme that ye would live otherwiſe then ye do, and ye make no conſcience to keep it.

It is moſt certain, that Baptiſme doth greatly bind us in conſcience to walk anſwerably to it in all righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe: And we can never be ſaved (though we are baptized) except we can anſwer with a good conſcience that we live as we vowed in our Baptiſme: 1.

Do not think that God will be mocked: Ye are content to go for Chriſtians: but if ye be Chriſtians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ye are under a great vow; and if ye do not keep it, Gods covenant hath a quarrel againſt you, and ye ſhall be broken in judgement. There is no ſinne that ye live in, no luſt that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience telleth you hath enterteinment in your hearts, but it is ſacramentall perjurie againſt the vow that ye made unto God in your Baptiſme.
