         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Mr. Boudaen,</hi> was an Elder of the English Congregation, in Midleburgh,
they declared that <hi>Mrs. White</hi> was not receiuable in her quallity as yet.
<hi>Which was a manifest deniall of Justice in Zeland, and a wronge
to the Judicature of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. <hi>That</hi> Mrs. White <hi>appealed from the Sentence of Midleburgh, to

of Midleburgh; but in case of refusall, they condemned him, to account
with Mrs. White, for Mr. Iohn Moncys Estate, reserving such right, as any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
might pretend to the validity or invalidity of Mr. Moncys will. <hi>Which
was</hi> nihil ad rem. <hi>but very impertinent, and a possitive deniall of
Justice, in the supreame Court of Judicature of Holland, to sett
up a false Executor in Zeland, against a legall Administratrix in
England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. That after <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> had obliged himselfe, by a notoriall

<hi>Sr. VVilliam Courten</hi> with his will annexed being granted to the sayd
<hi>G<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rge Carew</hi> (after the death of <hi>VVilliam Courten</hi> the Executor) he
gave a generall Procuration in the yeare 1662. unto <hi>Iames Boeve</hi> who

in the same yeare, and prayed by his bill that <hi>Peter Boudaen,</hi> should be
injoyned to account with <hi>Mr. Carew</hi> concerning the Partnershipp in
his quallity as Administratour of <hi>Sr VVilliam Courten,</hi> or be ordered to
deposite the generall Books of Trade, and other papers into the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Office of the sayd Citty, or any neutrall place, that an account
might be settled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at a joynt charge, in the presence of <hi>Mr. Boeve,</hi> who
was a servant to <hi>Mr. Iohn Moncy,</hi> and knew how to setle the same.</p>
            <p>15. That <hi>Peter Boudaen,</hi> being a Director of the East-India Company,
and one of the Common Councell of the Citty, was admitted by the
Magistrates to demand caution of <hi>Mr Boeve</hi> for Costs, before they
would proceed, which was neuer demanded in any such cases before.
And after <hi>Mr. Boeve</hi> had given sufficient caution accordingly, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
tooke Exeption against it, and would have other caution, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely

cancelled the obligations of all past Treaties, and Agreements by

both in Justice, and Equity, to require satisfaction and repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
(according to the debt already stated under the great Seale of
England) as if those Treaties had neuer been made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>28. That in persuance of the sayd report, the <hi>King</hi> sent his Letter da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to trauell into Holland with his Servants, who toke with him the <hi>Kings</hi>

relating to the premises. Yet notwithstanding the States of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
committed <hi>Mr. Carew,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Iohn Sherland,</hi> close prisoners, tooke
away all their writings, and bagage, and detained them as criminalls,
without access, during the warr, where they were jubject, to many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts,
&amp; abuses, both from the States of Holland, and the tumultuous
inhabitants there.</p>
            <p>30. That <hi>Iames Boeve,</hi> was by the contrivance of old <hi>Boudaens</hi> Sonns,
and their confederates, kept in Prison, at the Hague (upon a faigned
action of <hi>Mr. vander Helme,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Rymsdike,</hi> in the Admiralty of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)
for the space of 4. years, purposely to obstruct him in the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
of his owne, and <hi>Mr. Carews</hi> affaires, and afterwards in the month
of December 1672. pretending he was a confederate of <hi>Mr. Carews,</hi> who
(they sayd) had obstructed the good intelligence betweene England and
Holland, by prosecuting the actions, and demands, against the East-India
Company, and others, they with-drew their action upon <hi>Mr. Boeve</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to be charged, as a criminall also, and toke away his books papers
and writings, relating to the sayd actions, and kept them during the

            <p>31. That <hi>Don Pedro Fernandez de Iovar &amp; Valasco, Marquis del Frenza,</hi> the

whereby is confirmed and renewed (in the 7.th Article) the Treaty
of Breda, as also, all other former Treaties in their full force and vertue,
but noe further notice taken of the <hi>Bona Esperanza,</hi> and <hi>Henery Bona Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventura.</hi>
The States of Holland pretending that the <hi>King</hi> is to give Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to the claymours, out of the moneys, to be payd by the States.</p>
            <p>32. That after the Conclusion, of the peace, <hi>Pensionaris Fagell</hi> proposed
to <hi>Sr. Gabriell Silvius</hi> at the Hague. That if the <hi>King</hi> would discharge the
Dutch Prisoners in the Tower, and sett them free of all costs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences.
That then the States Generall would doe the like by <hi>Mr. Carew,
Mr. Boeve,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Sherland,</hi> where-upon <hi>Mr. Secretary Coventry</hi> did
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103817:6"/>
write, unto <hi>Sr. Gabriell Sylvius,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> was contented soe to doe,
provided that his subjects should be first discharged, and have their
writings, papers and bagage delivered, <hi>being committed, and detained
contrary to the Laws of Nations, and Common right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>33. That after three weeks debate, <hi>Pensionaris Fagell</hi> proposed, that
<hi>Sr. Gabriell Silvius,</hi> or <hi>Mr. Carew</hi> should give security, that the <hi>King</hi>
should performe on his parte, or that one of the three, should remaine
prisoner, untill the <hi>King</hi> had performed, or that the charges and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursments
of the Dutch Prisoners, should be deducted out of the
200000. p. the <hi>King</hi> was to receive, by the Treaty, which was lookt
upon, by the English Prisoners, to be very dishonorable demands.</p>
            <p>34. That then the States of Holland, finding by computation that
the cost and charges of the Dutch Prisoners, would anmount unto
1500. p. or there-abouts, consented at last to discharge <hi>Mr. Boeve,
Mr. Carew,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Sherland,</hi> computing thier cost, and incident charges
of imprisonment, to amount unto the like summ which they promised
to pay, accordingly.</p>
            <p>35. That notwithstanding the King did <hi>bona fide</hi> pay 1540. p. sterling
for the costs and incident charges of <hi>Advocate Sass, Mr. Wacktendonke,
Mr. Payne,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Overscheld,</hi> who were really guilty of high crimes and
misdemeanours; yet the States Generall to this day have only payd
150. p. and left unpayd 1230. p. upon the account of <hi>Mr. Carew,
Mr. Boeve,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Sherland</hi> (that died sone after hls releasment of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
humours, contracted in prison, for want of good company,
ayre and exercise) <hi>where the Hollanders, will not be punctuall, in
littlr matters, there is small hopes of their performance in greater,
who never kept a Treaty with any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>56. That <hi>Mr. Carew,</hi> after his releasment, knowing that <hi>Mr. Boudaen,</hi>
had left his Sonns and Daughters vast summs of money at his death,
beyond expectation of the World, besids severall of the best planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and possessions in Surinam, he went to Midleburgh, and sent
a publique Notary on the 8.th of Iune 1674. unto <hi>Iohn, Peter,</hi> and
<hi>Henery Boudaen,</hi> and the rest of the Sonns, and Daughters, of old
<hi>Boudaen,</hi> to require an account of <hi>Sr. William Courtens</hi> Estate, resting
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103817:7"/>
in their hands, and in case of deniall, to protest, for all costs and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
already sustained, or that should be sustained, by their further
obstinacy, and delays, who still refused to come to any account. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Mr. Carew</hi> revived, the former action against the children, that
was brought by <hi>Mr. Boeue</hi> against the Father, upon <hi>M. Carews</hi> account,
and gave other caution by a sufficient Marchant of the place to the
liking of the Magistrates. <hi>Yet neuertheless</hi> they have admitted the
sayd <hi>Boudaens</hi> (being directors of the East and West-India Companies)
to make frivolous exceptions, against the Iudicature of England, only
for delay, contrary to the very ordinance of their owne Courte, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
contained in the 45'th Article of Instructions, for their proceeding
at Law in Midleburgh. <hi>Where <hi>Mr. Carew</hi>
               </hi> hath ever since, to his
great costs, and damages, dayly solicited the Magistrates, Burgermasters,
and Schepens for Iustice; in regard of <hi>Mr. Boeves</hi> age, who knows the
