         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>BEing in conference with my loving friend Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Rice,</hi> one of the Gunners of the Tower, much
exerciſed in making of Dyals in many eminent pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the City, he was pleaſed to communicate unto
me the knowledge of a General Scheme, for Inſcribing the
Requiſites in all Oblique Leaning Plains, which he added,
was the uſeful Invention of the Learned Maſter <hi>Samuel
Foſter,</hi> Profeſſor of Aſtronomy in <hi>Greſham</hi> Colledge <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
deceaſed, from whom he received Inſtructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſame, in the year 1640. And the ſaid Mr. <hi>Rice</hi>
not having his Papers about him, did dictate to me from
his Memory the Conſtruction and Practice of the ſaid
Scheme, which I afterwards Methodized juſt as it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in <hi>page</hi> 25 and 26. At the ſame time alſo I received
directions for Inſcribing the Subſtile and Stile in upright
Decliners, and Eaſt or Weſt Reclining, or Inclining Plains,
but they were of another mans Invention, and did not
ſeem to be derived from the former general Scheme, and
therefore I have not uſed them in this Treatiſe, but derived
the performance thereof from the ſaid general Scheme:
Moreover, Mr. <hi>Rice</hi> added, that in regard of the death of
the Author, and ſince of his Executor, who had the care
and inſpection of his Papers, I ſhould do well to Study
out the Demonſtration of the former Scheme, and make
it publick, the rather, becauſe it hath been neglected. The
manner of Inſcribing the hour-lines being already publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Treatiſe of the Authors, Intituled, <hi>Poſthumi Poſteri;</hi>
this deſire of his, which was alſo furthered by Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi>
and others, I am confident is fully effected in the following
Treatiſe, and much more then was in his Requeſt, and
<pb facs="tcp:61099:4"/>
here let me adde, that I have had no other light from the
Endeavors of the Learned Author, then what was as above
communicated unto me, all which might be expreſſed in
half a page of paper, or little more, to which I have made
this large Acceſs and Collection, <hi>nam facile eſt inventis
adore;</hi> not that I would hereby any thing endeavor to ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe
the Authors Work, the excellency of whoſe Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in this and other kindes, will ſpeak forth his Renown
to all poſterity. And though in probability I have not
performed ſo much, nor ſo well, as was obvious to the
knowledge of the Learned Author, yet I am confident
when the Reader underſtands what is written, he would be
as loath to be without the knowledge thereof, as my ſelf;
and I am induced to believe, that the Author left nothing
written about many particulars in this Treatiſe; throughout
which, we ſuppoſe the Reader, furniſhed with the common
Rudiments of Geometry, that he can raiſe Perpendiculars,
draw Parallels, deſcribe a Parralellogram, bring three points
into a Circle, underſtands Definitions and Tearms of Art,
knows what a Line of Chords is, can prick off an Arch
thereby; all which, with Delineations for all the uſual Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Triangles, both from Projection and Proportions,
the Reader will meet with in my Treatiſe, called, <hi>The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners

ſo that the Plummet may play in the hole, if which way

               <p>Now to finde the Reclination of a Plain, apply the ſtreight edge
of the Board we uſed for trying of Horizontal Plains, to the Plains

hole, that it may interſect the line, parallel to the ſtreight edge of the
Board, and make two pricks upon the Board where the threed paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
and it will make an Angle with the ſaid Line, equal to the
Plains Reclination, to be meaſured with Chords, according as
was directed for taking of Altitudes; and if need require, a Line
may be drawn parallel to that drawn on the Board, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the threed, which will make the ſame Angle with the Plains
perpendicular, the former Line did.</p>
               <p>The Inclination will be eaſily got, by applying the ſtreight edge
of the Board, to the Plains perpendicular, and holding the threed

the Boards ſtreight edge, and it will make an Angle therewith,
equal to the Plains Inclination.</p>

               <p>As in the Scheme an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
let BC be Radius,

prickt off with Chords,
as BE; I ſay, if the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

BA, a line drawn from A into the center, ſhall include the ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle

               <p>In like manner an Angle may be prickt off by Sines, the neareſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from E to BC is the Sine of the Arch BE, ſo in like manner
the neareſt diſtance from B to EC, is the Sine of the ſame

and what is here done by a line of natural Sines or Tangents, by help
of a Decimal line of equal parts, equal to the Radius' may be done by
help of the natural Tables without them.</p>
               <p>Any Proportion relating to the ſixteen caſes of Sphoerical Triangles,
amongſt which the Radius is always ingredient, may be ſo varyed,
that the Radius may be in the third place, and a Tangent or a Sine

Proportional be known, an Angle equal thereto may be prickt off by
Tangents or Sines according to the nature of the fourth term, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth;
if it be unknown, notwithſtanding an Angle equal thereto
may be prickt off with Sines or Tangents according to the nature of
the fourth term, from the two firſt terms of the Proportion, becauſe
they are in ſuch Proportion, the firſt to the ſecond, as the Radius or

Now one of the Proportions for finding the Subſtile diſtance from
the Meridian is this following:
<q>
                        <p>As the Sine of the Plains Declination,

                        <p>So is the Radius to the Tangent of the Subſtiles diſtance from the

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence it follows, that if the Sine of the Declination be
pricked on the Horizontal Line from the Center, as VC, and the
Tangent of the Latitude, erected perpendicularly thereto, as CI equal
to VA, it ſhall give a point from whence a Line drawn into the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſhall be the Subſtilar Line.</p>
                  <p>Now I am to prove that VA is the Tangent of the Latitude, thus
it is made good: In a Tangent Line of 45<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, if the Tangent of any
part or ark of it be aſſumed to be Radius (as here FB the Cotan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of the Latitude equal to VO, which before was made Radius)
then doth the ſaid whole Tangent line (which in this caſe is any ſide
of the Square) become the Tangent of that arks complement: thus,
VA becomes the Tangent of the Latitude, becauſe the Radius is a
mean Proportional between the Tangent of an Ark, and the Tangent
of that Arks complement; For,

                  <p>Conſequently the Stiles height may be prickt off from the two firſt

                  <p>By conſtruction the Angles VPI and VIK are right Angles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſquare of VI is equal to the two ſquares of VP, and IP by

ſquares of IK and IV, wherefore the ſquare of VK is equal to the

Sine, and IK its Coſine are equal to the ſquare of the Radius.</p>
                  <p>But the ſquare of the Radius, and the ſquare of VP, the Tangent

divide a Semicircle into 90 equal parts by 20 Prop. 3. Euclid. becauſe an

               <p>They may be referred to a new Latitude, in which they ſhall ſtand
as upright Plains, and then they will have a new Declination in that
new Latitude; which two things being found, the former Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for upright Decliners will ſerve to Calculate all the Arks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>How this may be done on a Globe, is not difficult to apprehend,
having ſet the Globe to your Latitude, let one of the Meridians of
the Ecliptick or Longitude in the heavens, repreſent a Declining Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
Plain, this Circle interſects the Meridian of the place in two
Points, the one above, the other beneath the Horizon: Imagine the
Globe to be ſo fixed, that it cannot move upon its Poles, then ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
or depreſs the Globe ſo in the Meridian that the point of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection
above the Horizon may come under the Zenith, then will the
Pole of the world be elevated above the Horizon to the new Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
ſought, and where the Meridian of Longitude that repreſents
the Plain interſects the Horizon it ſhews the new Declination.</p>
               <p>Or it may be thus apprehended: The diſtance between the Pole
of the world, and that point of Interſection that repreſents the
Zenith of the new Latitude, is the complement of the ſaid new
Latitude, and the diſtance between that point, and the Equinoctial
is the new Latitude it ſelf; the new Declination is the complement
of the Angle between the plain and the meridian of the place, an
Ark uſually found in Calculation under this denomination.</p>

of which ſhadows
if two be found e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
a line let fall
perpendicularly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61099:57"/>
from the Point A, upon a line joyning, the extremities of thoſe
two ſhadows, ſhall be a true Meridian line.</p>
               <p>But if all three be unequal, as let AC be the leaſt, erect three
lines from the point A, perpendicular to AP, AC, AD as is AF, AG,
and AH equal to the Stiles height AE, and draw lines from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamities
of the three ſhadows to theſe three points as are FB, GC,
and HD; then becauſe AC is leſs then AB, therefore GC will be
leſs then FB, by the like reaſon GC will be leſs then HD, wherefore
from FB and HD cut off or Subſtract FI and HK equal to GC, and
from the points I and K let fall the perpendiculars IL, KM, upon the
Baſes AB, AD, afterwards draw a line joyning the two points M,
L, and from the ſaid points let fall the perpendiculars LN equal to
LI, and MO equal to MK.</p>
               <p>Then becauſe the two ſhadows AB and AD are unequal, in like
manner FB and HD will be unequal; but foraſmuch as FI and HK,
are equal by conſtruction, it follows that LI, KM, or LN and MO
will be unequal, and foraſmuch as theſe latter lines are parallel a
right line that connects the points O and N, being produced will
meet with the right line that joyns M, L produced, as let them meet
in the point P, from whence draw a Line to C, and it ſhall be a
true line of Eaſt and Weſt, and any Line perpendicular there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſhall be a Meridian line, thus the perpendicular AQ let fall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is a true Meridian Line paſſing through the point A, the place
of the ſtile or wyre.</p>
               <p>Whereto I adde that if MO &amp; LN retaining their due quantities be
made parallel it matters not whether they are Perpendicular to ML
or no, alſo for the more exact finding the Point P, the lines MO and
LN, or any other line drawn parallel to them, may be multipyled or
increaſed both of them the like number of times from the points <hi>M</hi>
and <hi>L</hi> upwards, as alſo from the points O and N downwards, and
Lines drawn through the points thus diſcovered, ſhal meet at P with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
producing either <hi>ML</hi> or ON. See 15 Prop. of 5 Euclid. and the
fourth of the ſixth Book.</p>
               <p>The greater part of <hi>van Schootens</hi> Demonſtration is ſpent in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that <hi>ML</hi> and ON produced will meet ſomewhere, this for the

the right Lines AB, AC and AD, whence it will come to paſs
that the three points F, G, and H meet in one point, as in E the top
of the Stile AE, and that the right lines FB, GC and HD are in the
Conique Surface of the ſhadow which the Sun deſcribes the ſame day
by his motion, the top of which Cone being the point E.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if from thoſe right Lines we ſubſtract or cut off the
right Lines FI, GC and <hi>HK</hi> being each of them equal to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then will the points I, C and K, fall in the circumference of a
Circle, the plain whereof is parallel to the plain of the Equator;
and therefore if through the points K and I ſuch a Poſition a right
Line be imagined to paſs, and be produced to the plain of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
it will meet with <hi>ML</hi> produced in the point <hi>P,</hi> where ON be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
produced, will alſo meet with it; ſo that the point P being in
the Plain of the Circle, as alſo in the plain beneath it, as alſo the
point C being in each Plain, a right line drawn through the Points
P and C will be the Common Interſection of each plain, and the line
PC will be parallel to the Plain of the Equator, and is therefore a
true Line of Eaſt and Weſt, which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>On all Plains though they Decline, and Recline, or Incline, after
the ſame manner may be found the Line PC, which will repreſent the
Contingent Line of any Dyal, and a perpendicular raiſed upon the

from this manner of finding a Meridian Line on a Horizontal
plain, nothing elſe can be deduced without more Scheams: From the
three ſhadows, may be had the three Altitudes, and the Meridian
line being given, the Azimuths to thoſe three ſhadows are likewiſe
given, which is more then need be required in order to the finding
of the Latitude of the place, and the Declination and Amplitude
of the Sun, which becauſe this Scheam doth not perform of it ſelf, I

Having from the three ſhadows prickt off the three Altitudes to
F, G, and H, from thoſe points to the ſhadows belonging to them, let
fall the perpendiculars FI, GK, HL, which ſhall be the Sines of thoſe
Altitudes, and the Baſes IC, <hi>KC,</hi> and LC ſhall be the Coſines, from
the point K in the greater Altitude, draw Lines to the points I and L
in the leſſer Altitudes and produce thoſe lines.</p>
               <p>From the points K and I, the Sines of the two Altitudes, are to
be erected perpendicularly, thus KM is made equal to KG, and IN
is made equal to IF, then producing MN and KI, where they meet
as at W, is one point, where the plain of the Suns parallel of Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
interſects the plain of the Horizon; in like manner on the Baſe
KL, the Sines of two Altitudes KG, and LH, ought to ſtand perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly
from the points K and L in their common Baſe, but if they
retain the ſame height, and are made parallel to one another, a line
joyning the points of the tops of thoſe Sines produced, ſhall meet
with the line joyning the points of their Baſes produced, in the
ſame point as if they were perpendicular.</p>
               <p>Thus KP and LQ are drawn at pleaſure through the points K, and L
parallel one to another, and KG is the Sine of the greater Altitude,
and LO is equal to the Sine of the leſſer Altitude, and theſe two
points being joyned with the Line OG produced, meets with the Line
KL produced, in the point E, another point where the plain of the
Suns parallel interſects the plain of the Horizon.</p>
               <p>Or you may double KG, and finde, the point <hi>P,</hi> as alſo double LO
and finde the point Q, a line drawn through <hi>P</hi> and <hi>Q,</hi> findes the
point E, as before, but with more certainty.</p>
               <p>If you joyn EW it ſhall be a true Line of Eaſt and Weſt, and a
perpendicular let fall thereon from C the Center, ſhall be a true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian

               <p>The Arch SR is the Suns Amplitude from the North 50<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 6′ the

               <p>Upon <hi>K</hi> erect <hi>KV</hi> equal to the Sine of the Suns greateſt Altitude

of declination and the Plain of the Horizon, is always equal
to the complement of the Latitude, and if upon T as a Center with
the Radius CS, you deſcribe the Ark <hi>KX,</hi> the ſaid Ark ſhall meaſure
the complement of the Latitude in this example 38<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 28′ which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Azimuth thereto, the Vertical Altitude and hour thereto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
many other propoſitions depending on the Suns motion, as I have
elſewhere ſhewed.</p>
               <p>The whole ground hereof is, that a right line extended through
the tops of the Sines of any two Altitudes of the Sun taken the ſame
day before his declination very, ſhall meet with the Plain of the
Horizon in ſuch a point where the Plain of the Suns parallel inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects
the Plain of the Horizon, and finding of two ſuch points, a

Sines, as <hi>KI</hi> extended ſhall be in the Horizontal Plain, and the Line
MN extended through the tops of thoſe Sines is in the plain of the

               <p>In every oblique Plain aſſuming any Point in the Stile, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Stile with a perpendicular to that Point, which ſhall meet
with the Subſtile, the Point ſo found in the Subſtile, is the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
Point, in reſpect of the aſſumed Point in the Stile; hence we
may inferre that if theſe two Points and the Subſtilar line were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61099:61"/>
the Center of the Dial might be eaſily found, now the former
conſtruction applyed to an oblique Plain, aſſumed to be an Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Plain, in reſpect of ſome unknown place, will find the Equinoctial
Point and the ſubſtilar Line, the Stile Point being aſſumed in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of a Gnomon any wayes placed or ſtuck in a wall at randome.</p>
               <p>From the former Scheme it may be obſerved that the Sine of any
of the three Altitudes being erected on the Perpendicular between
the foot of that Sine and the Suns parallel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gave an Angle equal
to the elevation of the Equinoctial above the Horizon, which is the
thing ſought in the following work, but the Sine of the greateſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
performs the propoſition beſt.</p>
               <p>If a ſtick or pin be ſtuck into a wall for this purpoſe, and doth not
make right Angles therewith, a Perpendicular muſt be let fall from
the extremity thereof into the wall, which is called the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Stile, and the diſtances of the ſhadowes; from the foot thereof
muſt be meaſured thence, in reſpect of the tip of this perpendicular
Stile the Equinoctial Point muſt be found, wherefore it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to aſſume the ſaid perpendicular Stile to be the Sine of the
greateſt of the three Altitudes of the Sun above the Plain, which pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perly
in reſpect of Us are Angles between the wall and the Sun. Up
on this aſſumption it will follow, that the ſhorteſt ſhadow will be
the Coſine of that Angle, and the diſtance between the tip of the
Stile, and the extremity of that ſhadow will be the Radius: now
from the lengths of the three ſhadows, and the height of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
Stile, it will be eaſie to find the Sines and the Coſines of
the Angles between the wall and the Sun.</p>
               <p>In the following figure, let the Circle be ſuppoſed to be deſcribed
upon a leaning Plain, on which let AB repreſent a Stile ſtuck in at
