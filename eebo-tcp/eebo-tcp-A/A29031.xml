            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is, Courteous Reader, part of the Satyr of <hi>Petronius</hi> against the Vice of his own Time. <hi>Priscis temporibus, cum adhuc nuda Virtus placeret, vigebant Artes ingenuae, summumque certamen inter homines erat, ne quid profuturum saeculis diu lateret.

                     </gap>tion of some Ages which were antient to his Own, It is evident out of History, that there was never at once any great Number, who seriously and in earnest for the Benefit of Mankind applyed themselves to these severe Scrutinyes of Natural Bodyes. It is true that now and then, in all Centuries from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, there have appear'd some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of a Nature more refin'd, as if indeed (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Phancy of the Old Poets) some <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> had made them either of another Metall, or of another Temper, from the Vulgar, utterly above all Mixture with, or Embasement by the common Fashions of this World; who did make it the End of their Lives, by Severing and Mixing, Making and Marring, and multiplying Variety of Experiments on all Bodies, to discover their hidden Vertues, &amp; so to enlarge the Power &amp; Empire of Man. But these were ever very few and singular. Even in that so much celebrated Time of <hi>Democritus</hi> these Studies were so rare, that his usual Exercise of the Anatomy of Beasts was look'd upon, as that which made the Soundness of his Mind questionable, even as a Spice of Madness in him: and probably much more might the Vulgar of his Age have been amused, had
<pb facs="tcp:56384:4"/>
they seen him torturing Minerals and Metals in the more toilsome Anatomy of Fire.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be a dishonourable Crimination to an Age, that it hath brought out no Persons who make it their great Endeavour <hi>Ne quid profuturum saeculis lateat</hi>: and if the Discovery of one or two persons of this Kind be enough to expiate for, and take off the Dishonour of the Proletarian Lazinesse and Luxury of the Rest, I think I may justly esteem that the exhibiting to the World the History of the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of the Honourable Author of this Piece may serve to be the Apology and Defence of our Age against such Censures as that wherewith the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cited <hi>Satyrist</hi> stained his own Time.</p>
                  <p>And this was one great Reason that hath made me very forward to promote the Publication of This, and diverse other Writings of the same Noble Author. For were there only Tokens of Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in Them, the proof of This Endeavour (even without Attainment) ought to wipe off all Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this nature. But this Motive (though I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that by exhibiting this Expiation I do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what oblige the Age, whose Honour is thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, yet) was far from being the most great and forcible. For the Excellence of the Works them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb facs="tcp:56384:5"/>
even as soon as they fell from the pen of the Author, did long since in all Equity set an <hi>Imprima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> on them.

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he was casting up the account of his life, upon the very Day of his Death, mentions a very great pleasure that he even then took in two Parts of his former Studyes: And these were his <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones,</hi> and his <hi>Inventa; Points well argued,</hi> and <hi>things happily sound out.</hi> The two very same particulars are principally conspicuous in this ensuing Piece. There are good Conclusions against the Enemies of the Being and Providence of God in the First Part, and in the Second there be Notices of divers <hi>Inventa</hi> profitable to the Use of Man. By the one sound Notions are proposed to the Readers apprehension from the Contemplation of God's Creation and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, and thereby good Matter is suggested to his Affection for the Advancement of his Devotion; by the Other, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e are divers things deliver'd, which may tend to enlarge Man's power of doing Good: By them, in the whole, both our Honour to God, and our Charity to our Neighbors
<pb facs="tcp:56384:5"/>
may be assisted: in which two the Substantial part of all the most Noble, not only Human but Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Vertues, both Speculative and Practical, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly contained.</p>
                  <p>I must not omit, that an Argument of this Nature, at this Time, may justly be commended for its Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness, when divers Persons, who know not the way of <hi>Experimental Philosophy,</hi> and are loath now to give themselves the trouble of learning it, have been making some attempts, very unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to traduce both It, and its Promoters.</p>
                  <p>These Considerations passed with me for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and had upon me this force and Prevalence, that as soon as I had the Authors leave, I durst not forbear the committing of them to the Press, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his Many arguments, which were plausible enough to the Contrary: as, namely, that much of the <hi>First Part</hi> was written when he was of so immature Years, that should I be particular concerning his Age then, to any person who hath read the Piece, the Paucity of such Instances might justly make me dispair of begetting Credit to my Relation. Another Objection was, That, though his Method did of necessity lead him to it, yet it might be look'd upon as unbecomming for Him to
<pb facs="tcp:56384:6"/>
meddle with the Physitians Art, of which he never did (nor could, by reason of his Native Honour) make any Profession. But these Oppositions being raised upon points of Curiosity in Ceremony and outward <hi>Decorum,</hi> were of lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le weight, when the forementioned Noble Offices of Charity and doing good were in the other Scale.</p>
                  <p>The greater Question was. Suppose them to be publisht, But why now? Why so soon? Should not rather the Edition have been delay'd, untill it might have come out together with <hi>The second Section of the second Part?</hi> (which discovers the Use that may be made of Experimental Learning, to advance the Empire of Man over other Creatures) or untill the Common Preface, and some other little Tracts, all written long since, and intended to accompany this, might be revised by the Author; or at least untill the Author might have had leisure to have made some more new &amp; full Animadversions to the Receipts &amp; Processes contain'd in the Appendix? The Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which answer'd this Objection was, That this Piece, as now printed alone, would make (as you see it doth) a very competent Book, which would have by it Self the perfection, if not of the Whole yet of a more principal part; and of that part, which to
<pb facs="tcp:56384:6"/>
Professors or Candidates of Learning is most desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And then the Author's Avocations and other Studies being so many, that we could prefix no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time for the complement of the mention'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining parts, I was loath to hazard the Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of These by deferring the Impression; since I know there is no Security of the continuance of those Writings which are reposed only in single, or at most in few written Copies. I remember, the Author had once lost for a good while one of these very Essays which are now here Printed, and put beyond that Danger for the future. Besides other Casual accidents, the very Contingency of Humane life, and the chance of a Man's papers after Death, (For to them the Question of King <hi>Solomon</hi> is most proper and pertinent, <hi>VVho knows whether then they may happen to fall into the hands of a Wise man or a Fool?</hi>) were of force enough to perswade me to secure these, when it was in my power, unto the Common Use. Would not Printing in all probability have preserv'd unto Us that Universal History of Vegetables from the Cedar of <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ibanus</hi> unto the Moss that groweth upon the Wall, written by that Wise and Learned King, and the loss of which we now in vain lament? Would not Printing have sav'd that Excellent Book
<pb facs="tcp:56384:7"/>
of <hi>Democritus,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he inscribed his XEIPOKMHTA or EXPERIMENTS <hi>of his own personal Tryal,</hi> so ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lost, that the Name of the piece is not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd among the Catalogue of his Writings in <hi>Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius?</hi> And may not the Printing of this Piece be a meanes of the preservation (besides the Notional part) of divers very useful XEIPOKMHTA of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Author, who hath been ever unwearied in the Tryal of all probable Experiments, that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the Light or advance the Profit of Mankind?</p>
                  <p>But before I leave the Reader, I must give him this single Advertisement, that the Passages included within the <hi>Paratheses</hi> or <hi>Crotchetts,</hi> as the Press stiles them, that is, between any two such Marks as these [] were inserted long since the writing of these Essays, upon the Relection of some parts of the Book before He sent it to me: Which I therefore did so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish, and do intimate, that there may appear no inconsistency in our Author, and the Reader may not marvel to find somethings very Recent in a Book written several Years agoe.

But yet I do without much Reluctancy comply with those Friends, who would by no means consent, that the Five first Essays of this Treatise should not come forth with the Rest; partly because not

writing all things for all Readers, I hold it not unfit to publish something to gratify those, who desire with me to be both excited and assisted to admire and praise the Great and VVise Author of all things; partly because the Treatise would seem main'd and incompleat, if the latter Essays should come abroad without the Rest; and partly too because Learned Men have been pleas'd to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure me, that those Essays are not destitute of Notions and Ratiocinations, that are not altogether vulgar or contemptible. However those Readers, that either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rellish, or at least desire not any thing, but what is meerly Physiologicall, may, thus advertis'd, passe by the former part of this Treatise, and content themselves to read over the Latter, though they who shall take the Pains to read Both, will not perhaps think their Labour lost: Since I have taken Care to leave even the former Part as little disfurnisht with Experiments and useful Notions, as, the Argument consider'd, I conveniently coul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And since also for the Paucity of such things in the First Part, I have endeavoured to make amends in the Second, which is almost wholly Physiological; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which nevertheless I shall admonish the Reader. And indeed the whole Tenets that make up the following Book, are by no means to be look'd upon as Published for an acurate Treatise of the Usefulnes of true Physiology, but as Familiar Writings, that want only the formality of

And one thing that must be especially comprehended in this Admonition is, that the Particulars I have mentioned, to shew of what use Chymical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be to a Physitian, are not, possibly, the chiefest that even I could set down, if I were not restrained by some justifiable Considerations; especially 'till I see what Entertainment, the things I now venture abroad, will meet with there: Some of those I reserve, appearing such to me, that I confesse I do not slight them enough to be fond of obtruding them upon the Publick, if I thought they would not be welcome to it.

But, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY, which you will find Treated of in the following Essayes, is a Study, if duely prosecuted, so difficult, so chargable, and so toilsome, that I think it requisite, before I propose any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Subjects to your Enquiries, to possesse you with a just value of true and solid Physiologie; and to convince you, That by endevouring to addict you to it, I invite you not to mispend your time or trouble on a Science unable to merit and requite it. In order, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to the giving you this satisfaction, Give me leave to mind you, that it was a saying of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>

worthy so celebrated a Philosopher, That there are two things which most <hi>ennoble</hi> Man, and make him resemble the Gods; <hi>To know the Truth, and To do Good.</hi> For, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that Diviner part of Man, the Soule, which alone is capable of wearing the Glorious Image of its Author, being endowed with two chief Faculties, the Understanding and the Will; the former is blest and perfectionated by Knowledg, and the latter's Loveliest and most improving property is Goodnesse. A due Reflection upon this excellent Sentence of him to whom Philosophers owe that modest name, should, me thinks, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear to us the Study of Naturall Philosophy. For there is no Humane Science th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t does more gratifie and enrich the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing with variety of choice and acceptable Truths; nor scarce any that does more enable a willing mind to exercise a Goodnesse beneficiall to others.</p>
                  <p>To manifest these truths more distinctly, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> and yet without exceeding that Brevity my Avocations and the bounds of an Essay exact of me, I shall, among the numerous advantages accruing to Men from the Study of the Book of Nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my selfe to instance only in a Couple, that relate more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to the <hi>Improving of Mens Understandings,</hi> and to mention a few of those many, by which it <hi>encreases their Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The two chiefe advantages which a reall acquaintance with Nature brings to our Minds, are, First, by instructing our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings and gratifying our Curiosities; and next, by exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and cherishing our Devotion.</p>
                  <p>And for the first of these, since, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> teacheth, and was taught himself by Common Experience, <hi>all Men are Naturally desirous to Know:</hi> that Propensity cannot but be powerfully engaged to the Works of Nature, which being incessantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to our senses, do continually sollicite our Curiosities: Of whose potent inclining us to the Contemplation of Natures Wonders, it is not perhaps the inconsiderablest Instance, That though the Naturall Philosophy hitherto taught in most
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56384:10"/>
Schools, hath been so Litigious in its Theorie, and so barren as to its Productions; yet it hath found numbers of Zealous and Learned Cultivators, whom sure nothing but Mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred fondnesse for the Object it converses with, and the end it pretends to, could so passionately devote to it.</p>
                  <p>And since that (as the same <hi>Aristotle</hi> taught by his Master <hi>Plato</hi> well observes) Admiration is the Parent of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, by engaging us to enquire into the Causes of the things at which we marvail; we cannot but be powerfully invited to the Contemplation of Nature, by living and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing among Wonders, some of which are obvious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous enough to amaze even ordinary Beholders; and others admirable and abstruse enough to as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>onish the most inquisitive Spectators.</p>
                  <p>The bare prospect of this magnificent Fabrick of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, furnished and adorned with such strange variety of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and usefull Creatures, would, suffice to transport us both with Wonder and Joy, if their Commonnesse did not hinder their Operations. Of which Truth Mr <hi>Stepkins,</hi> the famous Oculist, did not long since supply us with a memorable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: For (as both himselfe and an Illustrious Person that was present at the Cure informed me) a Maid of about Eighteen yeares of Age, having by a couple of Cataracts, that she brought with her into the World, lived absolutely blind from the moment of her Birth; being brought to the free Use of her Eyes, was so ravisht at the surprizing spect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cle of so many and various Objects, as presented themselves to her unacquainted Sight, that almost every thing she saw transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with such admiration and delight, that she was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to loose the eyes of her Mind by those of her Body, and expound that Mysticall Arabian Proverb, which advises, <hi>To shut the Windowes, that the House may be Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the bare beholding of this admirable Structure is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of pleasing men so highly, how much satisfaction, <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophilus,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56384:11"/>
may it be supposed to afford to an Intelligent Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who is able both to understand and to relish the admirable Architecture and skilfull contrivance of it: For the Book of Nature is to an ordinary Gazer, and a Naturalist, like a rare Book of Hieroglyphicks to a Child, and a Philosopher: the one is sufficiently pleas'd with the Odnesse and Variety of the Curious Pictures that adorne it; whereas the other is not only delighted with those outward objects that gratifie his sense, but receives a much higher satisfaction in admiring the knowledg of the Author, and in finding out and inriching himselfe with those abstruse and vailed Truths dexterously hinted in them.</p>
                  <p>Yes, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> as the Understanding is the highest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in Man, so its Pleasures are the highest he can naturally receive. And therefore I cannot much wonder that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Archimedes</hi> lighting in a Bath upon an Expedient to resolve a perplexing difficultie in Naturall Philosophy, should leap out of the Bath, and run unclothed like a mad-man, crying nothing but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>'Tis true indeed, that even the generality of Men, without making it their design, know somewhat more of the Works of Nature, then Creatures destitute of Reason can, by the advantage of that Superior Faculty, which cannot but even unurg'd, and of its own accord make some, though but slight, reflections on the Information of the Senses: But if those Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions be onely receiv'd and not improv'd, but rather neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;

as of a Propertie, that should methinks not faintly recommend Naturall Philosophy, to curious and active In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals.</p>
                  <p>For most other Sciences, at least as they are wont to be taught, are so narrow and so circumscrib'd, that he who has read one of the best and recentest Systems of them, shall find little in the other Books publisht on those subjects, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd repetitions; and a diligent Scholar may in no long time learn as much as the Professors themselves can teach him. But the objects of Naturall Philosophy, being as many as the Laws and Works of Nature are, so various and so num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlesse, that if a Man had the Age of <hi>Methuselah</hi> to spend, he might sooner want time then matter, for his Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And so pregnant is each of that vast multitude of Creatures, that make up the Naturalists Theme, with usefull matter to employ Mens studie, that I dare say, that the whole life of a Philosopher spent in that alone, would be too short to give a full and perfect account of the Natural Properties and Uses of any one of several Minerals, Plants, or Animals, that I could name. 'Tis an almost incredible variety of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, that the teeming Earth, impregnated by Gods <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducat Terra,</hi> does in several Regions produce.

And what I have lately try'd or seen, makes me think it very possible to recruit those many of <hi>Kircherus,</hi> with some further Magnetical Experiments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd in his Book. And I have, the very day I writ this, made in that admirable Stone a not-inconsiderable Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not extant (that I remember) there: For taking an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Load-stone, and heating it red-hot, I found the attractive Facultie in not many minutes, either altogether abolish'd, or at least so impaired and weakned, that I was scarce, if at all, able to discern it. But this hath been observed, though not so faithfully related, by more then one; wherefore I shall adde, That by refrigerating this red-hot Load-stone either North or South, I found that I could give its Extreams a Polarity (if I may so speak) which they would readily display upon an exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Needle freely plac'd in <hi>Aequilibrium:</hi> And not onely so, but I could by refrigerating the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some other Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this nature, not extant in <hi>Kircherus,</hi> we may have elsewhere fit opportunity to mention. And indeed, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmatical Mineral (if I may so call it) the Load-stone, is a subject so fertile in Rarities, that I hear, he himself is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing that accurate Treatise, with new and large Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

For the true Naturalist (as we shall see hereafter) does not only Know many things, which other men Ignore, but can Performe many things that other men cannot Doe; being ennabled by his skill not barely to understand se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Wonders of Nature, but also partly to imitate, and partly to multiply and improve them.

vouchsafes to Naturalists, that though he gives them not the power to produce one Atome of Matter, yet he allowes them the power to introduce so many Formes (which Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers teach to be nobler then Matter) and work such changes among the Creatures, that if <hi>Adam</hi> were now alive, and should Survey that great Variety of Man's Productions, that is to be found in the shops of Artificers, the Laboratories of Chymists, and other well-furnished Magazine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As the poor Indians lookt upon the Spaniards as more then Men, because the knowledg they had of the Properties of Nitre, Sulphur and Charcoale duely mixt, ennabled them to Thunder and Lighten so fatally, when they pleased. And this Empire of Man, as a Naturalist, over the Creatures, may perchance be to a Philosophical Soul preserved by reason untainted with Vulgar Opinions, of a much more satisfactory kind of Power or Soveraignty then that for which ambitious Mortals are wont so bloodily to contend. For oftentimes this Latter, being commonly but the Gift of Nature or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Fortune, and but too often the Acquist of Crimes, does no more argue any true worth or noble superiority in the possessor of it, then it argues one Brasse Counter to be of a better Mettal then its Fellowes, in that it is chosen out to stand in the Account for many Thousand Pounds more then any of them.

                  <p>THe next Advantage, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that we mention'd the Knowledg of Nature to bring to the Minds of Men, is, That it therein excites and cherishes Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Which when I say, <hi>Pyroph.</hi> I forget not that there are severall Divines (and some of them Eminent ones) that out of a Holy Jealousie (as they think) for Religion, labour to deterre men from addicting themselves to serious and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Enquiries into Nature, as from a Study unsafe for a Christian, and likely to end in Atheisme, by making it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Men (that I may propose to you their Objection as much to its Advantage as I can) to give themselves such an Account of all the Wonders of Nature, by the single Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Second Causes, as may bring them to disbelieve the Necessitie of a First. And certainly, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> if this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension were well grounded, I should think the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Evill so considerable, that instead of inviting you to the Study of Naturall Philosophy, I should very earnestly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to Disswade you from it. For I, that had much rather have Men not Philosophers then not Christans, should be better content to see you ignore the Mysteries of Nature then deny the Author of it. But though the Zeale of their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions keep Me from harbouring any unfavourable Opinion of the Persons of these Men, yet the Prejudice that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound from their Doctrine (if generally received) both to the Glory of God from the Creatures, and to the Empire of Man over them, forbids Me to leave their Opinion unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56384:20"/>
though I am Sorry that the Necessity of Vindicating the Study I recommend to You from so Heinous a Crime as they have accus'd it of, will compel me to Theologize in a Philosophical Discours: Which that I may do, with as much Brevity as the Weight and Exigency of my Subject will permit, I shall Content my selfe onely in the Explication of my own Thoughts, to hint to you the grounds of Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what is alledg'd against them.</p>
                  <p>And First, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I must premise, That though it may be a Presumption in Man, (who to use a Scripture Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>Is but of Yesterday, and knows Nothing, because his Dayes upon the Earth are but as a shadow</hi>) precisely and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily to define all the Ends and Aimes of the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient God in His Great Work of the Creation; Yet,<note place="margin">Job 8.9.</note> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, it will be no great venture to suppose that at least in the Creating of the Sublunary World, and the more Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Stars, two of God's Principal Ends were, the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of His own Glory, and the Good of Men.<note place="margin">Prov. 16.4.</note> For the First of these; <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himselfe,</hi> saies the Preacher; <hi>For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things,</hi> saies the Apostle. And, <hi>Thou hast Created all things; and for Thy Pleasure they are and were Created,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11.36.</note> say the Twenty foure Prostrate Elders (Representatives, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of the whole Church of both Testaments, propagated by the Twelve Patriarchs, and the like number of Apostles) to their Creatour, which Truth, were it requisite, might be further confirmed by several other Texts, which to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline needlesse prolixity, I here forbear to insist on. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonantly to this we hear the Psalmist Proclaiming that <hi>The Heavens Declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament sheweth his Handy-Works.</hi> To which purpose we may also observe,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.1.</note> that though Man were not Created till the close of the Sixt Day (the Resident's Arrival being Obligingly Suspended till the Palace was made ready to entertain Him) yet that none of God's works might want Intelligent Spectators and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers,

the Angels were Created the First Day, as Divines generally infer from the Words of God in <hi>Job; Where wast thou when I laid the Foundations of the Earth?</hi> and a little after; <hi>When the Morning Stars sang together, and all the Sons of God shouted for Joy.</hi>

So when in <hi>Noah's</hi> time a Deluge of Impiety call'd for a Deluge of Waters, God looking upon the living Creatures as made for the Use of Man, stuck not to Destroy them with him, and for him; but involv'd in his Ruine all those Animals that were not necessary to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuation of the Species, and the Sacrifice due for <hi>Noah's</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.

But such an Animal fruition (if I may so call it) of the Works of Nature, affords not Man all the good that God design'd him in them. For Religion being not only the great Duty of Man, but the grand Instrument of his future Happinesse, which consists in an Union with and Fruition of God, during that endlesse Terme that shall succeed the expiration of his transitory Life on Earth; what ever increases or cherishes his Religion deserves to be lookt on as a great contributer to his Happinesse. And we may therefore venture to affirme that the knowledg of the Creatures does lesse advantage Man, as it ennables him to Master them; then as it Assists him, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring and serving him, to become Acceptable to their Author. And what ever our distrustful Adversaries are pleas'd to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to the contrary, certainly God intended that his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures should afford not only Necessaries, and Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to our Animal part, but Instructions to our Intellectual. The World is wont to be stil'd not unfitly by Divines, <hi>The Christians Inne</hi>; but perchance it may be altogether as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call'd <hi>his Ship:</hi> for whereas both Appellations suppose him a Traveller, the Inne, though it refresh him in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, does not further him in it, but rather retard his progresse by detaining him in one place; whereas a Ship not only serves the Passenger for an Inne when he is weary, but helps to convey him towards his Journey's End. And according to this Notion, to suppose that God hath placed in the World innumerable things to feed Man, and delight him, and none to instruct him, were a conceit little lesse injurious to God, then it were to a wise Merchant, that sends Persons, he loves, to a farre Country, to think that he would furnish their Cabinets with plenty of Provisions, soft Beds, fine Pictures, and all other accommodations for their Voyage, but send them to

                  <p>And indeed so farre is God from being unwilling, that we should Prye into his Works, that, by divers Dispensations he imposes on us little lesse then a necessity of studying them. For first he begins the Book of Scripture with the Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Book of Nature; of which he not only gives us a general account, to informe us that he made the World; since for that end the very first Verse in the Bible might have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd: But he vouchsafes us by retaile the Narrative of each Day's Proceedings, and in the two first Chapters of <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though that in most other places of the Scripture, where the Works of Nature are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned but incidently, or in order to other purposes, they are spoken of rather in a Popular then Accurate manner, I dare not peremptorily deny, being unwilling to interesse the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Holy Writ (design'd to teach us rather Divinity then Philosophy) in the doubtful contentions of Naturalists, about such matters as may (though the History of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot) be known by the meer Light of Natural Reason. We may next observe, that God has made some knowledg of his Created Book, both conducive to the beliefe, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Understanding, of his Written one: Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our making it one cause of the Sadduces great Error about the Resurrection, that they <hi>knew not the Power of God.</hi> And the Scripture being so full of Allusions to, and comparisons bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the properties of the Creatures, that there are many Texts not clearly Intelligible without some knowledg of them; as may appear even by the first Gospel (The Promise <hi>that the Seed of the Woman should Bruise the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And indeed so many of the Texts in Scripture are not to be competently illustrated, without some knowledg of the properties of the Creatures related to in them, that I wonder not, that <hi>Levinus Lemnius, Frantzius, Rueus,</hi> and other Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men have thought it requisite to publish entire Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, some of the Animals, others of the Stones, and others of the other Works of Nature mentioned in Scripture: Only I could wish that they had been as wary in their Writings, as commendable for their Intentions, and had not sometimes admitted doubtful or fabulous accounts into Comments upon that Book, whose Prerogative it is to teach nothing but Truth.</p>
                  <p>Nor ought their Labors to deterre others from cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same Theme; For as (such is Gods condescention to Humane weaknesse) most of the Texts, to whose Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition Physiologie is necessary, may be explicated by the knowledg of the external, or at least more easily observed qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Creatures; So, that there are divers not to be fully understood without the Assistance, of more penetrating indagations of the Abstrusities of Nature and the more unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious properties of things, an Intelligent and Philosophical peruser will readily discerne.</p>

And therefore upon such Considerations, and because the modestest Computation allows the Firmament to be great enough to make the Earth but a Point in comparison of it; it will be safe enough, as well as just, to conclude with the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is unsearchable.</hi>

                  <p>The next Attribute of God that shines forth in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is his Wisdom; which to an intelligent Considerer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very manifestly express'd in the World, whether you contemplate it as an Aggregate or System of all Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or consider the Creatures it is made up of, both in their particular and distinct Natures, and in Relation to each other, and the Universe which they constitute. In some of these the Wisdom of God is so conspicuous, and written in such large Characters, that it is legible even to a vulgar Reader: But in many others the Lineaments and Traces of it are so delicate and slender, or so wrapt up and cover'd with Corporeity, that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56384:26"/>
it requires an attentive and intelligent Peruser. So numberless a multitude, and so great a variety of Birds, Beasts, Fishes, Reptiles, Herbs, Shrubs, Trees, Stones, Metals, Minerals, Stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and every one of them plentifully furnish'd and endow'd with all the Qualifications requisite to the Attainment of the respective Ends of its Creation, are productions of a Wisdom too limitless not to be peculiar to God: To insist on any one of them in particular (besides that it would too much swell this Discourse) might appear injurious to the rest; which do all of them deserve that extensive Exclamation of the Psalmist, <hi>How manifold are thy works, O Lord; in Wisdom hast thou made them all.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 104.24.</note> And therefore I shall content my self to observe in general, That as highly as some Naturalists are pleased to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue their own knowledge, it can at best attain but to understand and applaud, not emulate the Productions of God. For as a Novice, when the curiosest Watch the rarest Artist can make, is taken in pieces and set before him, may easily enough dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Workmanship and Contrivance of it to be excellent; but had he not been shown it, could never have of himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised so skilful and rare a piece of Work: So, for instance, an Anatomist, though when by many and dexterous Dissecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of humane Bodies, and by the help of Mechanical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Rules (without a competent skill wherein, a Man can scarce be an Accomplish'd and Philosophical Anatomist) he has learn'd the Structure, Use and Harmony of the parts of the Body, he is able to discern that matchless Engine to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably contriv'd, in order to the exercise of all the Motions and Functions whereto it was design'd: And yet this Artist, had he never contemplated a humane Body, could never have imagin'd or devis'd an Engine of no greater Bulk, any thing near so fitted to perform all that variety of Actions we daily see perform'd either in or by a humane Body. Thus the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion of the Blood, and structure of the Valves of the Heart and Veins (The consideration whereof, as himself told me, first hinted the Circulation to our Famous <hi>Harvey</hi>) though
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56384:27"/>
now Modern Experiments have for the main (the <hi>Modus</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet so fully explicated) convinc'd us of them, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them to be very expedient, and can admire Gods Wisdom in contriving them: Yet those many Learned Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomists, that have for many succeeding Ages preceded both D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <p>And though it be true, that the greater Works of God do as well declare his great Wisdom as his Power, according to that of the Inspired Philosopher;<note place="margin">Prov. 13.19, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By his Knowledge the depths are broken up, and the Clouds drop down the Dew</hi>: Yet does not his Wisdom appear less in lesser Creatures; for there is none of them so little, but it would deserve a great deal of our Wonder, did we attentively enough consider it. And as <hi>Apelles</hi> (in the Story) was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by the skilful <hi>Protagoras,</hi> by so neat and slender a Line, that <hi>Protagoras,</hi> by being scarce able to discern it, discern'd it to have been drawn by <hi>Apelles</hi>: So God, in these little Creatures, oftentimes draws traces of Omniscience, too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate to be liable to be ascrib'd to any other Cause. I have seen Elephants, and admir'd them less then the structure of a dissected Mole, which hath better Eyes then those, that will not see a designation in the dimness of its Eyes (made onely to see the Light, not other Objects by the help of it) and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted posture of its Feet, given it not to run on the Ground, but to dig it self a way under Ground. And, as despicable as their Littleness makes the Vulgar apt to think some Creatures, I must confess my wonder dwell not so much on Natures

Clocks (if I may so speak) as on her Watches, and is more exercis'd in the coyness of the sensitive Plant, and the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Properties of a small and abject Load-stone, then the bulk of the tallest Oakes, or those vast Rocks, made famous by Shipwracks. I have pass'd the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and have seen as much to admire at in an Ant-hill, and have so much wondred at the Industry of those little Creatures themselves that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited it, that I have ceas'd to wonder at their having given a Theme to <hi>Solomon's</hi> Contemplation. Those vast Exotick Animals which the Multitude flocks to see, and which Men give Money to be allow'd to gaze on, have had many of them lesse of my Admiration, then the little Catterpillar (as Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Naturalists esteem it) to which we are beholden for Silk. For (not to mention all the Observables crouded by Nature in that little Worm) I thought it very well deserv'd my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (when not long since I kept some of them purposely to try Experiments) how this curious Spinster, after he had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed himself alive in the precious Tomb he had wrought for himself out of his own Bowels, did cast off his former Skin and Legs, and, in shew, his former Nature, appearing for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers days but an almost movelesse Magot; till at length, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesting this second Tegument also (in which Nest, Phenix-like, he had been regenerated out of his own Remains) he came forth (if I may so speak) out of this attiring Room un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another form, with Wings, Eyes, and Leggs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to act a new part upon the Stage of the World; which (having spent some days without feeding (that I could observe) in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the propagation of his Species) he forsakes and dies. And I the rather mention the Silk-Worm, because that there have been of late divers subtle Speculators, who would fain perswade us, That Animals do nothing out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, or, if you please, innate or seminal Impressions; but Spin, build Nests, and perform all the other Actions for which they are admir'd, barely by Imitation of what they have seen done by others of the same Kinde. But in the Silk-Worm
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56384:28"/>
(at least here in <hi>England)</hi> this plausible Opinion will not hold: For the Silk-worms I kept, were not hatch'd but in the Spring, out of Eggs laid some Days in the Sun; and the Worms that laid those Eggs, being every one of them dead the Winter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was impossible these new Silk-Worms, when they first began to spin their scarce imaginable fine Web, and inclose themselves in Oval Balls of a very Artificial Figure and Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, should have wrought thus by Imitation; there not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been for many Moneths before, in the place where they were hatch'd (nor perhaps in the whole Country) any Silk-Worms alive which they might imitate. But I must leave these curious Spinsters to their Work, and proceed to tell you, That Seas and Mountains, with the other Hyperboles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (if I may so term them) proclaim indeed Gods Power, but do not perhaps more manifest his Wisdom, then the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of some living Engines, and (if I may so call them) Breathing Atoms, that are so small that they are almost all Workmanship; so that, as before, in the Psalmists Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we truly said of Gods Greatnesse, <hi>That it was unsearchable</hi>; we may now as truly say of his Wisdom in the Prophets Words, and in the same Text where he represents him as the Creator of the ends of the Earth,<note place="margin">Isa. 40.28.</note>

And yet though a Mite seem but a moving Atome, and unless there be divers together, is not easily discern'd by the unassist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eye; yet in an excellent Microscope I have, you know,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56384:29"/>
several times both seen and shewn to others, even in a gloomy Day, and a disadvantageous Place, not onely the Limbs of this little Animal, but the very Hair growing upon his Legs. Now let us but consider how strangely skilful and delicate a Workmanship must be employ'd to contrive into so narrow a compass, the several Parts Internal and External, requisite to make up this little Animal; how many must goe to the texture of the Eyes, and other Organs of Sense; how many to the Snout (which he has, not unlike a Hog) and the several parts of it; how many to the Stomach and Guts, and the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Parts addicted to the digestion of Aliment, and exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Excrements; and to be short, how inimaginably sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle must be the Animal Spirits running too and from Nerves suitable in such little Legs: And if, as we have observ'd them to multiply by Eggs, the little Creatures be hatch'd in those little Eggs, after the manner of divers other Oviparous Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, how much smaller then a hatched Mite must be a Mite upon the Animation of its delineated Parts? since in Hens Eggs we have sometimes seen the Chick manifestly alive, and its Limbs clearly delineated, whilst yet it took up so small a portion of the Egge, that both the White and the Yolk (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which it is generated, and not of the <hi>Chalaza</hi> or <hi>Tredle,</hi> as <hi>Aquapendente</hi> and other Moderns teach) seem'd to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times yet intire, as well as involv'd in their peculiar Membranes. But it is not so conspicuous in gradient Animals (if I may so speak) as in swimming ones; How vastly disproportionate Masses of Matter the wise <hi>Former of all things</hi> can fashion into living Engines. For Whales are much more stupendious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures then Elephants: And not to mention what <hi>Hartenius (apud Johnstonum)</hi> tells us of twenty sorts of Whales, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the eighteenth Species, which he calls <hi>Nordhwal,</hi> is by him related to be Ninety Ells long; but what Ells he means, I know not: Nor to mention those less incredible Accounts which are given of the vastness of Whales by our English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators, who are wont to Fish for them; I shall onely set

The same inquisitive Writer adds, That four Years before, near the Island of <hi>Corsica,</hi> not far from the Coast of <hi>Italy,</hi> another Whale was cast, One hundred Foot long; which being a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, was found to be big with a Cub of thirty Foot long, 1500 pound weight. But that which will let you see, <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> the disproportion betwixt there kinde of Fishes and common Elephants, is, that which the same Author adds, <hi>That the Lord onely, or Fat</hi> (as he speaks <hi>Carnea pinguedo) of this corpulent Creature, weigh'd One hundred and thirty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound,</hi> that is, above Twenty seven times the weight of the whole Elephant, which was caus'd to be weigh'd by <hi>Pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reskius.</hi> And though the Omnipotent Creator be able to make swimming Creatures of such prodigious bigness, that the Ocean it self may seem to be but a proportionate Pond for such Fishes; yet is the same Omniscient Continuer, as able to make a swimming Engine more slender then a Cheese mite, and so little, that a small part of a Grain may out-weigh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them. For, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I must here acquaint you with a strange Observation, which I have been inform'd to have been some while since made in <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Panarola</hi> a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Physitian</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> who is said, by the help of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Microscope, to have discern'd in Vinegar small Living Creatures, which he takes to be Worms. The mention of so unlikely an Experiment, made me engage some excellent Philosophers and Mathematicians to assist me in examining it: But though our Microscopes exceeded the best that were
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56384:30"/>
brought us over from <hi>Rome,</hi> yet all our diligence and attention did but make them conclude that <hi>Panarola</hi>'s Eyes had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded. Notwithstanding which, causing a somewhat hollow bottom of pure Crystalline Glasse to be fitted to my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope, I prosecuted the Enquiry my self; and at length was so lucky, as not onely to discover these little Creatures with a Microscope, but by holding the Liquor in a Crystal Viol, almost upon the strong Flame of a Candle, to discover multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of them with my naked Eyes, as weak as they are. But though I have already convinc'd those that formerly derided such Observations, as not to be made with the best Micros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope, yet the great weakness of my Sight has not permitted me to perfect my Observations concerning these Creatures. And therefore reserving the more particular mention of this odde Observation till another time, I shall now onely tell you as much as is pertinent to our present purpose; namely, That having with a certain parcel of strong White-wine Vinegar (for 'tis not in every Vinegar that they are constantly to be found) fill'd up to the top thin Viols with long and slender Necks; and having likewise with the same Liquor fill'd other small Crystalline Viols, though short-neck'd, and held them betwixt my Eye and the Sun, or a Window open towards it, or very near a great Candle, I have often in these Glasses, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in their slender Necks, after having a while fix'd my Eye on them (attention being in this case very necessary) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miringly observ'd great numbers (and sometimes as it were Shoals) of living Creatures, which seem'd to be rather Fishes then Worms; for they swim freely up and down the Liquor, and often hover about the top of it, with a wrigling motion, like that of Eels, to which likewise their long and slender shape resembles them. And though these swimming Creatures be not all exactly of a size, yet some of them seem'd slenderer then any sort of living ones, that hath hitherto been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by the unassisted Eye: And I remember, that having look'd in a good Microscope upon one of them, and a Cheese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56384:30"/>
much about the same time, the Fish appear'd so slender, that we judg'd it not much thicker then one of the Legs of the Mite: So that considering what a vast deal of matter the great Creator can manage and fashion into a Whale, and in how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle room he can contrive all the parts requisite to constitute a Fish, we may justly say to him in the Psalmists Language,<note place="margin">Psal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But most resplendent does the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God appear towards his Favourite Creature, Man, whom having vouchsaf'd to ennoble with his own Image, he makes most of the Creatures of the world visible to us, pay homage to him, and in some manner or degree do him service: God's liberality at once bestowing on him all those Creatures by endowing him with a Reason enabling him to make use of them; so that even those Creatures which he is not able to subdue by his Power, he is able to make serviceable to him by his Knowledg; as those vast Globes of Light, which are so farre above him, that their Immensity and Brightnesse can scarce render them visible to him, are by man's Mathematicks forced to give him an account of all their Motions, and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon his Dials keep time for him; and even the defects of such works of Nature, are by man's skill made serviceable to him, as the Eclipses of the Moon serve Geographers notably in that difficult and useful worke of finding Longitudes.

                  <p>HAving thus, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> endeavored to evince, that the Opinion that would deter Men from the scrutiny of Nature, is not a little prejudicial to Mans Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, and does very much lessen the Advantages he may derive from the Creatures, both in relation to his accommodation in this Life, and his Felicity in the next: Let us proceed to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether the Doctrine we oppose do not likewise tend, in its own nature (though not in the Intentions of its Patrons) to defeat God of much of that Glory which Man both ought and might ascribe to him, both for himself and the rest of the Creatures. How unlikely is it that we should be able to offer to God that Glory, Praise, and Admiration, he both expects and merits from such a contemplation of the Creatures, as though it be requisite to the true knowledge of their Nature and Properties, is yet suppos'd either pernicious, or at least dangerous, You, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> or any other impartial Person may easily determine.</p>
                  <p>For the Works of God are not like the Tricks of Juglers, or the Pageants that entertain Princes, where concealment is requisite to wonder; but the knowledge of the Works of God proportions our admiration of them, they participating and disclosing so much of the inexhausted Perfections of their Author, that the further we contemplate them, the more Foot-steps and Impressions we discover of the Perfections of their Creator; and our utmost Science can but give us a juster

veneration of his Omniscience. And as when some Country Fellow looks upon a curious Watch, though he may be huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken with the rich Enamel of the Case, and perhaps with some pretty Landskip that adorns the Dial-plate; yet will not his Ignorance permit him so advantageous a Notion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Makers skill, as that little Engine will form in some curious Artist, who besides that obvious Workmanship that first entertains the Eye, considers the exactness, and knows the use of every Wheel, takes notice of their proportion, contrivance, and adaptation altogether, and of the hidden Springs that move them all: So in the World, though every Peruser may read the existence of a Deity, and be in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree affected with what he sees, yet is he utterly unable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scry there those subtler Characters and Flourishes of Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which true Philosophers are sharp-sighted enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. The existence of God is indeed so legibly written on the Creatures, that (as the Scripture speaks in another sense) <hi>He may run that reads it</hi>;<note place="margin">Habb. 2.2.</note> that is, even a perfunctory Beholder, that makes it not his business, may perceive it. But that this God has manifested in these Creatures a Power, a Wisdom, and a Goodness worthy of himself, needs an attentive and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Surveyor to discover. How different notions of Gods Wisdom do the Eggs of Hens produce in the ordinary Eaters of them, and in curious Naturalists, who carefully watch and diligently observe from time to time the admirable progress of Nature in the Formation of a Chick, from the first change ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the <hi>Cicatricula</hi> (or little whitish speck discernable in the Coat of the Eggs Yolk) to the breaking of the Egg-shell by the perfectly hatched Bird, and on Natures exquisite me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in the order and fashioning of the parts, make such Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical reflections as you may meet with (not to mention what <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Fabricius ab Aquapendente,</hi> have observed on that subject) in the Ingenious Treatise of Generation, which our accurate and justly Famous Anatomist, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

To illustrate this subject yet a little further, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> give me leave to observe to you, That Philosophers of almost all Religions have been, by the contemplation of the World, mov'd to consider it under the notion of a Temple: <hi>Ne adoremus</hi> (says <hi>Plutarch) Elementa, Coelum, Solem, Lunam, &amp;c. specula sunt haec, in quibus artem illius singularem intueamur, qui mundum condidit, &amp; adornavit; nec est aliud Mundus quam Templum ejus: Let us not venerate the Elements, the Heaven, the Sun, the Moon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>these are but</hi> Miroirs, <hi>wherein we may behold his excellent Art, who fram'd and adorn'd the World; nor is the World any thing else but his Temple: Homines</hi> (says <hi>Cicero) tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entur illum Globum, quem in Templo hoc medium vides, qui terra dicitur: Men abide upon that Globe which you see in the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Upon what account, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I esteem the World a Temple, I may elsewhere have occasion to Declare; but this for the present: It will not be rash to infer that if the World be a Temple, Man sure must be the Priest, ordain'd (by being
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56384:38"/>
qualifi'd) to celebrate Divine Service not only in it, but for it. For as in Schools, when the Prince or some munificent Benefactor confers some large possession or rich annuity upon the Foundation, though all the Boyes be concern'd in the benefit, yet because most of them are too young to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of it, or too unlearned to be able to make the retribution of a handsome acknowledgment, either the Master or that other person of the Society, who is most capable and the best spoakesman, is by a kind of natural right engag'd to the duty of returning praise and thanks, not for himself alone, but in the name of all the rest: So in the World, where there are so many inanimate and irrational Creatures, that neither understand how much they owe to their Creator, by owing him even themselves, nor are born to a condition inabling them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it; Man, as born the Priest of Nature, and as the most oblig'd and most capable member of it, is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne Thanks and Praises to his Maker, not only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe but for the whole Creation. In which sense we may reconcile those two current Assertions, <hi>That God made all things for His own Glory, and that God made all things for Man, and Man for himselfe.</hi> Since whether or no Man be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosme or Little World in <hi>Paracelsus's</hi> sense, if not as a resembler, yet as a representer of the Macrocosme or Great World, he presents with his own adorations the Homages of all the Creatures to their Creator, though they be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what is done, as Infants under the Law were of the sacrifices offered on their account. And in this Relation may the Creatures answer the Solemn invitation made them in the whole 148 <hi>Psalm,</hi> and numerous other Scriptures: which they may do (to borrow a barbarous but significant School-terme) objectively, though not formally; I mean, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occasions, though not singers of his praises, and being such objects as prompt and invite Man to pay God that praise upon their score, which they cannot actually pay him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; even God's mutest works being capable of being said

And I shall not scruple to confesse unto you, that I dare not confine the Acts of Devotion to those which most men suppose to comprise the whole exercise of it; not that I at all undervalue, or would depreciate any, even the meanest practises of Devotion, which either Scripture or reason consonant to it recommends; but that I esteem that God may be also acceptably (and perhaps more nobly) serv'd and glorifi'd by our entertaining of high, rational, and as much as our nature is capable of worthy notions, attended with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and proportionable admiration of those divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Prerogatives for whose manifesting he was pleas'd to construct this vast Fabrick.</p>

                  <p>By this time, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I hope you begin to think, that the Doctrine that tends to deter Men from enquiring into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is as well derogatory from Gods Glory, as prejudicial to Mans Interests. And indeed, I purpos'd to content my self with the having disperst throughout the past Discourse, the grounds of answering their Objection against the study of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siology, who pretend it is apt to make Men Atheists: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am much concern'd to have you satisfied of so important a Truth, as that which we have hitherto been laboring to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, I must beg your leave, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to adde, <hi>ex abundanti</hi> (as they speak) to what has been already alledg'd, some things that may more directly answer the Objection of our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and manifest how little their severity is befriended, either by Scripture, Reason, or Experience.</p>
                  <p>And first, it seems not at all probable, That if the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient Author of Nature knew that the study of his Works did really tend to make Men dis-believe his Being or Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, he would have given Men so many Invitations, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Necessities, to study and contemplate the Nature of his Creatures: Of these Invitations divers have been mention'd already, and more might be added to them, if we thought it requisite. But what has been above alledg'd, will make us

And though our Western Churches, for certain Reasons (not here to be inquir'd into) have long since disus'd the Solemnizing of the Saturday, and appointed the Sunday for the Celebration of both the Works of the Redemption, and Creation of the World together; yet 'tis evident enough that the Primitive Christians did for the most part keep the Saturday as Holy-day, as well as the Sunday: For that ancient Book (whoever be resolv'd to have written it) which goes under the Name of <hi>Clement</hi>'s <hi>Constitutions,</hi> affords us, among others, these two memorable Passages to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: And first,<note place="margin">

                  <p>I Ignore not that not onely <hi>Leucippus, Epicurus,</hi> and other <hi>Atomists</hi> of old, but of late some Persons, for the most part Adorers of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Writings, have pretended to be able to explicate the first <hi>Beginning of Things,</hi> and the Worlds <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> without taking in, or acknowledging any Divine Author of it: And therefore, though we may elsewhere, by the assistance of that Author, have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to give You an Account of our unsatisfiedness with the Attempts made by some bold Wits in favor of such Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Yet since the main Truth We plead for, in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, is so nearly concern'd in what hath been taught by those that would keep God from being thought to have any share in the Production of the Universe; I can scarce forbear (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing as I am to digress) to represent to You, on the present occasion, a few Considerations which may assist You, if not to lessen the Arrogance of such Persons, at least, to keep Your self from thinking their Evidence as great as their Confidence is wont to be. Now of the Philosophers we speak of, some being Atomists, and others not, it will be requisite to say something to each of the two sorts: And because we not long since, in an Illustrious Company, where You, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> are not unknown, met with one of them, who avowedly, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Opinions on the <hi>Aristotelean</hi> or vulgar Physiology, We

shall first recommend to You two or three Considerations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning such arrogant Peripateticks (For I speak not of that Sect in general, of which I know there are divers excellent Men.)</p>
                  <p>First then, You will in many Passages of the following Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says, finde, that dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I shall next take notice, That Philosophers, who scorn to ascribe any thing to God, do often deceive themselves, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have sufficiently satisfied our Enquiries, when they have given us the nearest and most immediate caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s of some things; whereas oftentimes the assignment of those Causes is but the manifesting that such and such Effects may be deduc'd from the more Catholick affections of things, though these be not unfrequently as abstruse as the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> explicated by them, as having onely their Effects more obvious, not their Nature better understood: As when, for instance, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is demanded of that strange supposed Sympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Quick-silver and Gold; in that we finde, that whereas all other Bodies swim upon Quick-silver, it will readily swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up Gold, and hide it in its Bosom. This pretended Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy the Naturalist may explicate, by saying, That Gold being the onely Body heavier then Quick-silver of the same bulk, the known Laws of the <hi>Hydrostaticks</hi> make it necessary, that Gold should sink in it, and all lighter Bodies swim on it: But though the cause of this Effect be thus plausibly assign'd,

by deducing it from so known and obvious an affection of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as Gravity, which every man is apt to think he sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understands; yet will not this put a satisfactorie period to a severe Inquirers Curiositie, who will, perchance, be apt to alledge,<note place="margin">

And that therefore he that desires no further account, desists too soon from his Enquiries, and acquiesces long before he comes to his Journies end. And indeed, the investigation of the true nature and adequate cause of gravity, is a task of that difficulty, that in spight of ought I have hitherto seen or read, I must yet retain great doubts whether they have been clearly and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly made out by any Man. And sure, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> there are divers Effects in Nature, of which, though the immediate Cause may be plausibly assign'd, yet if we further enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Causes of those Causes, and desist not from as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending in the Scale of Causes till we are arriv'd at the top of it, we shall perhaps finde the more Catholick and Primary causes of Things, to be either certain, primitive, general and fix'd Laws of Nature (or rules of Action and Passion among the parcels of the Universal Matter) or else the Shape, Size, Motion, and other primary Affections of the smallest parts of Matter, and of their first Coalitions or Clusters: especially those endowed with seminal Faculties or Properties, or (to dispatch) the admirable conspiring of the several parts of the Universe to the production of particular Effects; of all which it will be difficult to give a satisfactory Account, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging an intelligent Author or Disposer of Things.</p>
                  <p>And the better to clear so weighty a Truth, let us further consider on this occasion, That not onely <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and those that, mis-led by his Authority, maintain the Eternity of the World, but very many other Philosophers and Physitian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, who ascribe so much to Nature, that they will not be reduc'd to acknowledge an Author of it, are wont very much to delude
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56384:43"/>
both themselves and others in the account they presume to give us, as satisfactory of the Causes or Reasons of very many Effects: I will not instance in the Magnetick Properties of Things, nor any of those numerous abstrusities of Nature, which 'tis well known that the <hi>Aristoteleans</hi> are wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Sympathy, Antipathy, or Occult Qualities, and strive to put Men off with empty Names, whereby they do not so much lessen our Ignorance, as betray their own.</p>
                  <p>But I shall instance in those more obvious <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> of which they suppose they have given us very satisfactory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: If you ask one of those I speak of, whence it comes to pass that if a Man put one end of a long Reed into a Vessel full of Water, and suck at the other end, his Mouth will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly fill'd with that Liquor; he will readily tell you, That the Suction drawing the Air out of the cavity of the Reed, the Water must necessarily succeed in the place deserted by the Air, to prevent a Vacuity abhorr'd by Nature. If you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ask such a Man, Why to Women about a certain Age, their <hi>Purgationes Menstruae</hi> do commonly supervene, he will think he has sufficiently answered you, when he has told you, that about that Age, beginning to beripe for Procreation, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has wisely provided that their superfluous Blood should be sent to the Uterine Vessels, partly to dis-burthen the Mass of Blood of an useless load, and partly to contribute Matter, or at least afford Nourishment in case of Conception. But though these Solutions are wont to be acquiesc'd in by such as those that give them, yet I see not how they can satisfie a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Reasoner. For not now to mention what may be objected against them out of some Modern Mechanical and Anatomical Observations, let us a little consider, that to say that the ascent of the Water in the first Problem, proceeds from Natures De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of a Vacuity, supposes that there is a kinde of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Mundi,</hi> furnished with various Passions, which watchfully provides for the safety of the Universe; or that a Brute and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate Creature, as Water, not onely has a power to move

                  <p>But to shew Men by an easie Experiment how little Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is perform'd to avoid a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> I have sometimes done thus; I have taken a slender Pipe of Glass, of about four Foot long, and putting one of the open ends of it into a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel full of Quick-silver, I have suck'd as stronly as I could at the other, and caus'd one to watch the ascent of the Quick-silver, and mark where it was at the highest, and I found not that at one suck, I could raise it up much above a Foot; and having caus'd a couple of strong Men, one after another, to suck at the same end of the same Pipe, I found not that either of them could draw it up much higher. Nor did it appear that by repeated Suctions, though the upper end of the Pipe were each time stopp'd, to hinder the relapse of the Quick-silver, it could at all be rais'd above the seven and twenty Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gits at which it us'd to subsist in the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiment <hi>De Vacuo</hi>: Whereas the same end of that Tube being put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a small Vessel of Water, I could at one suck make the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter swiftly ascend thorow the perpendicularly held Tube into my Mouth, which argues, that the ascension of Liquors up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Suction, rather depends upon the pressure of the Air, and their respective measures of Gravity and Lightness compar'd to that Pressure, then it proceeds from such an abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> as is presum'd.</p>
                  <p>And so likewise in the other Question propos'd, it is imply'd, that there is in a Female Body something, that knows the rule of Physitians, that of a <hi>Plethora,</hi> the Cure is the convenient Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of Blood, and that this intelligent Faculty is wise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

And in a word, there is a multitude of Problems, especially such as belong to the use of the Parts of a humane Body, and to the Causes and Cures of the Diseases incident thereunto, in whose Explication those we write of, content themselves to tell us, That Nature does such and such a thing, because it was fit for her so to do; but they endeavor not to make intelligible to us, what they mean by this Nature, and how meer, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bruit, Bodies can act according to Laws, and for determinate Ends, without any knowledge either of the one or of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let them therefore, till they have made out their <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> more intelligibly, either cease to ascribe to irrational Creatures such Actions as in Men are apparently the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Reason and Choice, and sometimes even of Industry and Virtue; or else let them with us acknowledge, that such Actions of Creatures in themselves Irrational, are perform'd under the superintendence and guidance of a Wise and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Author of Things. But that you may not mistake me, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> it will be requisite for me, to acquaint you in two or three words with some of my present thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this subject: That there are some Actions so peculiar to Man, upon the account of his Intellect and Will, that they cannot be satisfactorily explicated after the maner of the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of meer corporeal Agents, I am very much inclin'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: And whether or no there may be some Actions of some other Animals, which cannot well be Mechanically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, I have not here leisure or opportunity to examine.

But for (most of) the other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, methinks we may, without absurdity, conceive, That God, of whom in the Scripture 'tis affirm'd, <hi>That all his Works are known to him from the Beginning</hi>; having resolved,<note place="margin">Acts 15.18.</note> before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make such a World as this of Ours, did divide (at least if he did not create it incoherent) that Matter which he had provided into an innumerable multitude of very variously figur'd Corpuscles, and both connected those Particles into such Textures or particular Bodies, and plac'd them in such Scituations, and put them into such Motions, that by the assistance of his ordinary preserving Concourse, the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> which he intended should appear in the Universe, must as orderly follow, and be exhibited by the Bodies necessarily acting according to those Impressions or Laws, though they understand them not at all, as if each of those Creatures had a Design of Self-preservation, and were furnish'd with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Industry to prosecute it; and as if there were diffus'd through the Universe an intelligent Being, watchful over the publick Good of it, and careful to Administer all things wisely for the good of the particular Parts of it, but so far forth as is consistent with the Good of the whole, and the preservation of the Primitive and Catholick Laws esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the Supreme Cause. As in the formerly mention'd Clock of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> the several Pieces making up that curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Engine, are so fram'd and adapted, and are put into such a motion, that though the numerous Wheels, and other parts of it, move several ways, and that without any thing either of Knowledge or Design; yet each performs its part in order to the various Ends for which it was contriv'd, as regularly and uniformly as if it knew and were concern'd to do its Duty; and the various Motions of the Wheels, and other parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to exhibit the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> design'd by the Artificer in the Engine, as exactly as if they were animated by a common Principle, which makes them knowingly conspire to do so, and might, to a rude Indian, seem to be more intelligent then

                     <hi>Cunradus Dasypodius</hi> himself, that published a Description of it, wherein he tells the World, That he contrived it, who could not tell the hours and measure time so accuratly as his Clock. And according to this Notion, if you be pleas'd to bear it in your memory, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> you may easily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in what sense I use many common Phrases, which custom hath so authorized, that we can scarce write of Physiological subjects without employing either them, or frequent and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Circumlocutions in their stead: Thus when I say, that a stone endeavors to descend towards the Centre of the Earth, or that being put into a Vessel of Water, it affects the lowest place: I mean that not such a Mathematical Point as the Centre of the Earth, hath power to attract all heavy Bodies, the least of which, it being a point, it cannot harbor; or that a Stone does really aim at that unknown and unattainable Centre; but that, as we say, that a Man strives or endeavors to go to any place, at which he would quickly arrive, if he were not forcibly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by some Body that holds him fast where he is, and will not let him go: So a Stone may be said to strive to descend, when either by the Magnetical Steams of the Earth, or the pressure of some subtle Matter incumbent on it, or by what ever else may be the cause of Gravity, the Stone is so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to tend downwards, that if all Impediments, interpos'd by the Neighboring Bodies, were removed, it would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly fall to the ground; or being put into a Vessel with Water, or any other Liquor much less heavy then it self (for on Quick-silver, which is heavier, Stones will swim) the same Gravity will make it subside to the bottom of the Vessel, and consequently thrust away its bulk of Water, which though heavy in it self, yet because it is less ponderous then the Stone, seems to be light. And so in our late instance in the Clock, if it be said that the Hand that points at the Hours affects a circular motion, because it constantly moves round the Centre of the Dial-plate, 'tis evident that the inanimate piece of Metal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects not that motion more then any other, but onely that the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56384:45"/>
impression it receives from the Wheels, and the adaptation of the rest of the Engine, determine it to move after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And although if a Man should with his Finger stop that Index from proceeding in its course, it may be said, in some sense, that it strives or endeavors to prosecute its former Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Motion; yet that will signifie no more, then that by virtue of the Contrivance of the Engine, the Index is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd, that, if the Obstacle, put by the Finger of him that stops it, were taken away, the Index would move onwards, from that part of the Circle where it was stopt, towards the mark of the next Hour. Nor do I by this, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> deny that it may in a right sense be said, as it is wont to be in the Schools, that <hi>Opus Naturae est opus Intelligentiae</hi>: Neither do I reject such common Expressions as <hi>Nature always affects and intends that which is best,</hi> and <hi>Nature doth nothing in vain.</hi> For since I must, according to the above-mention'd Notion, refer many of the actions of irrational Creatures to a most wise Disposer of Things, it can scarce seem strange to me, that in those particulars in which the Author intended, and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that irrational Creatures should operate so and so for their own Preservation, or the Propagation of their Species, or the publick good of the Universe, their Actions being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by a Reason transcending Ours, should not onely often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times resemble the Actings of Reason in Us, but sometimes even surpass them. As in effect we see that Silk-worms and Spiders can, without being taught, spin much more curiously their Balls and Webs, then our best Spinsters could; and that several Birds can build and fasten their Nests more Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially then many a Man, or perhaps any Man could frame and fasten such little and elaborate Buildings. And the Industries of Foxes, Bees, and divers other Beasts, are such, that 'tis not much to be wondered at that those Creatures should have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons ascrib'd to them by divers Learned Men, who yet perhaps would be less confident, if they considered how much may be said for the Immortality of all rational Souls. And that the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56384:46"/>
subtle Actings of these Beasts are determined to some few Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars requisite for their own Preservation, or that of their Species; whereas on all other occasions, they seem to betray their want of Reason, and by their Voice and Gestures seem to express nothing, but the Natural Passions, and not any Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or Logical Conceptions. And therefore, as when (to resume our former comparison) I see in a curious Clock, how orderly every Wheel and other part performs its own Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with what seeming Unanimity they conspire to shew the Hour, and accomplish the other Designs of the Artificer, I do not imagine that any of the Wheels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the Engine it self is endowed with Reason, but commend that of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who fram'd it so Artificially. So when I contemplate the Actions of those several Creatures that make up the World, I do not conclude, the inanimate Pieces, at least, that 'tis made up of, or the vast Engine it self, to act with Reason or Design, but admire and praise the most wise Author, who by his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Contrivance can so regularly produce Effects, to which so great a number of successive and conspiring Causes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd.</p>
                  <p>And thus much, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> having been represented con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those, that rejecting from the Production and Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Things, all but Nature, yet imbrace the Principles of the vulgar Philosphy, you will perhaps think it more then enough: but Object, That what is not to be expected from the barren Principles of the Schools, may yet be perform'd by those Atomical ones which we our selves have within not very many Pages seem'd to acknowledge Ingenious. And I know indeed, that the modern Admirers of <hi>Epicurus</hi> confidently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough pretend, that he and his Expositors have already, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being beholding to a Deity, clearly made out, at least the Origine of the World, and of the principal Bodies 'tis made up of: But I confess, I am so far from being convinc'd of this, that I have been confirm'd rather, then unsetled in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the difficulty of making out the Original of the World,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56384:46"/>
and of the Creatures, especially the living Ones that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, by considering the accounts which are given us of the Nativity (if I may so speak) of the Universe, and of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, by those great Denyers of Creation and Providence, <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and his Parapharst <hi>Lucretius</hi>: Whose having shown themselves (as I freely confess they have) very subtile Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers in explicating divers Mysteries of Nature, ought not so much to recommend to us their impious Errors, about the Original of Things, as to let us see the necessity of ascribing it to an Intelligent Cause. This then is the account of this matter, which is given us by <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself, in that Epistle of his to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> which we finde in <hi>Diogenes Laertius: Quod ad Meteora attinet existimari non oportet, aut motum, aut conversionem, aut Ecclipsin, aut or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Hypothesis</hi> express'd in these Verses (which please our Author so well, that he has almost the same Lines in several other places of his Poem) he prosecutes and applies to some particular parts of the Universe in the same 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book: But whilst he thus refuseth to allow God an Interest in the Worlds production, his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> requires that we should allow him several things, which he doth assume, not prove: As First, That Matter is Eternal. 2. That from Eternity it was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally divided, and that into such insensibly small parts, as may deserve the name of Atoms; whereas it may be suppos'd, that Matter, though Eternal, was at first one coherent Mass, it belonging to Matter to be divisible, but not so of necessity, to be actually divided. 3. That the number of these Atoms is really infinite. 4. That these Atoms have an <hi>inane Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> (as the Epicureans speak) to move in. 5. That these Atoms are endowed with an almost infinite variety of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Figures, some being round, others cubical, others hooked, others conical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas not to mention before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand what we may elsewhere object, besides against this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, he shews not why, nor how this Atome c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me to be Spherical rather then Conical, and another Hooked rather then Pyramidal: But these Assumptions I insist not on, because of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56384:47"/>
two others much more considerable, which our Author is fain to take for granted in his <hi>Hypothesis</hi>: For 6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, He supposes his Eternal Atoms to have from Eternity been their own Movers, whereas it is plain that Motion is no way necessary to the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Matter, which seems to consist in extension: For Matter is no less Matter, when it rests, then when it is in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and we daily see many parcels of Matter pass from the state of motion to that of rest, and from this to that, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their motion to Matter that lay still before, and thereby loosing it themselves. Nor has any Man, that I know, satisfactorily made out how Matter can move it self: And indeed, in the Bodies which we here below converse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, we scarce finde that any thing is mov'd but by something else; and even in these motions of Animals that seem sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, the Will or Appetite doth not produce the motion of the Animal, but guide and determine that of the Spirits, which by the Nerves move the Muscles, and so the whole Body, as may appear by the weariness and unweildiness of Animals, when by much motion the Spirits are spent. And accordingly I finde that <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> though he believed, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> did after him, that Matter was Eternal, yet he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd that the notion of Matter not necessarily including mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was a necessity of taking in a <hi>Mens,</hi> as he stiles God, to set this sluggish Matter a moving. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, in one place of his Metaphysicks,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aristot: Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phys: lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputing against some of the antienter Philosophers, askes, <hi>Quonamque modo movebuntur si nulla erit actu causa? non enim ipsa materia seipsam movebit <gap reason="foreign">

For <hi>Epicurus</hi> will have his Atoms move downwards, and that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56384:48"/>
not in paralel Lines, lest they should never meet to constitute the World, but according to Lines somewhat inclining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another; so that there must be not onely motion, but gravity in Atoms, before there be any Centre of gravity for them to move towards; and they must move rather down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards then upwards, or side-ways, and in such Lines as nothing is produc'd capable of confining them to. Which are Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions so bold and precarious, that I finde some, even of his Admirers, to be asham'd of them: Which will save me the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of arguing against them, and allow me to take notice in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> place, That this Epicurean Doctrine supposes that a sufficient number of Atoms, and their motion downwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, there will need nothing but their fortuitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in their fall, to give a Being to all those Bodys that make up the World. Indeed, that the various coalitions of Atoms, or at least small Particles of Matter, might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the World, had not been perhaps a very absurd Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for a Philosopher, if he had, as Reason requires, suppos'd that the great Mass of lazy Matter was Created by God at the Beginning, and by Him put into a swift and various motion, whereby it was actually divided into small Parts of several Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes and Figures, whose motion and crossings of each other were so guided by God, as to constitute, by their occursions and coalitions, the great inanimate parts of the Universe, and the seminal Principles of animated Concretions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wonder not much that the <hi>Milesian Thales</hi> (the first of the Grecian Philosophers (as <hi>Cicero</hi> informs us) that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd into these matters) should hold that Opinion which <hi>Tully</hi> expresses in these Words:<note place="margin">

And really it is much more unlikely, that so many admirable Creatures that constitute this one exquisite and stupendous Fabrick of the World should be made by the casual conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of falling Atoms, justling or knocking one another in the immense vacuity, then that in a Printers Working-house a multitude of small Letters, being thrown upon the Ground, should fall dispos'd into such an order, as clearly to exhibit the History of the Creation of the World, describ'd in the 3 or 4 first Chapters of <hi>Genesis,</hi> of which History, it may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether chance may ever be able to dispose the fallen Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Words of one Line. I ignore not that sometimes odde Figures, and almost Pictures may be met with, and may seem casually produc'd in Stones, and divers other inanimate Bodies: And I am so far from denying this, that I may elsewhere have opportunity to shew You, that I have been no carelesse Observer of such Varieties.</p>

                     <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> having already done that copiously for me. And indeed it seems so pure a Fiction, that were it not that the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> he took upon him to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, could scarce afford him any less extravagant account of the Original of Animals, The unsuitableness of this <hi>Romance,</hi> to those excellent Notions with which he has enriched divers other parts of his Works, would make me apt to suspect, that when he writ this part of his Poem, he was in one of the Fits of that Phrensie, which some, even of his Admirers, suppose him to have been put into by a Philtre given him by his either Wife, or M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
                     <hi>Lucillia</hi>; in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of which, they say, that he writ his Books.</p>
                  <p>And here let us further consider, That as confidently as many Atomists, and other Naturalists, presume to know the true and genuine Causes of the Things they attempt to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, yet very often the utmost they can attain to in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, is, That the explicated <hi>Phaenomena</hi> May be produc'd after such a Manner as they deliver, but not that they really Are so: For as an Artificer can set all the Wheels of a Clock a going, as well with Springs as with Weights, and may with violence discharge a Bullet out of the Barrel of a Gun, not onely by means of Gunpowder, but of compress'd Air, and even of a Spring. So the same Effects may be produc'd by divers Causes different from one another; and it will often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be very difficult, if not impossible for our dim Reasons to discern surely which of those several ways, whereby it is possible for Nature to produce the same <hi>Phaenomena</hi> she has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made use of to exhibit them. And sure, he that in a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Watch-makers Shop shall observe how many several ways
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56384:50"/>
Watches and Clocks may be contriv'd, and yet all of them shew the same things, and shall consider how apt an ordinary Man, that had never seen the inside but of one sort of Watches, would be, to think that all these are contriv'd after the same manner, as that whose Fabrick he has already taken notice of; such a Person, I say, will scarce be backward to think that so admirable an Engineer as Nature, by many pieces of her Workmanship, appears to be, can, by very various and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Contrivances, perform the same things; and that it is a very easie mistake for Men to conclude, that because an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect may be produc'd by such determinate Causes, it must be so, or actually is so. And as confident as those we speak of use to be, of knowing the true and adequate Causes of Things, yet <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself, as appears by ancient Testimony, and by his own Writings, was more modest, not onely contenting himself, on many occasions, to propose several possible ways whereby a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> may be accounted for, but sometimes seeming to dislike the so pitching upon any one Explication, as to exclude and reject all others: And some Modern Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers that much favor his Doctrine, do likewise imitate his Example, in pretending to assign not precisely the true, but possible Causes of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> they endeavor to explain. And I remember, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself (what ever confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he sometimes seems to express) does in his first Book of <hi>Meteors</hi> ingeniously confess, that concerning many of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> he thinks it sufficient that they May be so perform'd as he explicates them. But granting that we did never so certainly know in the general that these <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature must proceed from the Magnitudes, Figures, Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thence resulting Qualities of Atoms, yet we may be very much to seek as to the particular Causes of this or that particular Effect or Event: For it is one thing to be able to shew it possible for such and such Effects to proceed from the Various Magnitudes, Shapes, Motions, and Concretions of Atoms, and another thing to be able to declare what precise,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56384:50"/>
and determinate Figures, Sizes, and Motions of Atoms, will suffice to make out the propos'd <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity to any others to be met with in Nature: As it is one thing for a Man ignorant of the Mechanicks to make it plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the motions of the fam'd Clock at <hi>Strasburge</hi> are perform'd by the means of certain Wheels, Springs, and Weights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and another to be able to describe distinctly, the Magnitude, Figures, Proportions, Motions, and (in short) the whole Contrivance either of that admirable Engine, or some other capable to perform the same things.</p>
                  <p>Nay, a Lover of disputing would proceed farther, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion that way of reasoning, which even the eminentest Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists are wont to employ to demonstrate that they explicate things aright.</p>
                  <p>For the grand Argument by which they use to confirm the truth of their Explications, is, That either the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> must be explicated after the manner by them specified, or else it cannot at all be explicated intelligibly: In what sense we disallow not, but rather approve this kinde of Ratiocination, we may elsewhere tell you. But that which is in this place more fit to be represented, is, That this way of arguing seems not in our present case so Cogent, as they that are wont to imploy it think it to be: For besides that, it is bold to affirm and hard to prove that, what they cannot yet explicate by their Principles, cannot possibly be explicated by any other Men, or any other Philosophy; besides this, I say, that which they would reduce their Adversaries to, as an Absurdity, seems not to deserve that name: For supposing the Argument to be conclusive, That either the propos'd Explication must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, or Men can give none at all that is intelligible, I see not what absurdity it were to admit of the consequence: For who has demonstrated to us, That Men must be able to explicate all Natures <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> especially since divers of them are so abstruse, that even the Learned'st Atomists scruple not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their being unable to give an account of them.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56384:51"/>
And how will it be prov'd that the Omniscient God, or that admirable Contriver, Nature, can exhibit <hi>Phaenomena</hi> by no wayes, but such as are explicable by the dim Reason of Man? I say, Explicable rather then Intelligible; because there may be things, which though we might understand well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if God, or some more intelligent Being then our own, did make it h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Work to inform us of them, yet we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of our selves finde out those Truths. As an ordinary Watch-maker may be able to understand the curiousest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the skilfullest Artificer, if this Man take care to explain his Engine to him, but would never have understood it if he had not been taught. Whereas to explicate the Nature and Causes of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> we are speaking of, we must not onely be able to understand, but to investigate them.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is peremptorily insisted on by some Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans, who thereby pretend to demonstrate the excellency and certainty of their Explications, that according to them, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is declar'd to produce things in the way that is most facile and agreeable to our Reason: It may be replyed, That what we are to enquire after, is, how Things have been, or are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally produced, not whether or no the manner of their Production be such, as may the most easily be understood by us: For if all things were, as those we reason withal maintain, casually produced, there is no reason to imagine that Chance considered what manner of their Production would be the most easily intelligible to us. And if God be allowed to be, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is, the Author of the Universe, how will it appear that He, whose Knowledge infinitely transcends ours, and who may be suppos'd to operate according to the Dictates of his own immense Wisdom, should, in his Creating of things, have respect to the measure and ease of Humane Understandings, and not rather, if of any, of Angelical Intellects, so that whether it be to God, or to Chance, that we ascribe the Production of things, that way may often be fittest or likelyest for Nature to work by, which is not easiest for us to understand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:56384:51"/>And as for the way of arguing, so often imploy'd (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Truth we now contend for) and so much rely'd on by many Modern Philosophers, namely, That they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not clearly conceive such or such a thing propos'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think it fit to be rejected; I shall readily agree with them in the not being forward to assent to any thing, especially in Philosophy, that cannot well be conceiv'd by knowing and considering Men: But there is so much difference among Men, as to their faculty of framing distinct Notions of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ngs, and through Mens partiality or lazyness, many a particular Person is so much more apt, then these Men seem to be aware of, to think, or at least, to pretend, that he cannot conceive, what he has no minde to assent to, that a Man had need be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry how he rejects Opinions, that are impugn'd onely by this way of Ratiocination, by which, I hope, it will not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that we should be more prevail'd with, then that Sect of Philosophers that imploys it most. And among those that resolve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature into the Mechanical Powers of Things, or the various Figures, Sizes and Motions of the parts of Matter; I meet with some, as the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who tell us, They cannot frame a Notion of an Incorporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or Spirit, nor conceive how, if the Soul were such, it could act upon the Body: And yet others that seem no less speculative, seriously and solemnly professe, That they can conceive a clear and distinct Notion of a Spirit, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the humane Soul, that regulates at least, if not produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces divers Motions of the Body, to be; denying on the other side, That it can be clearly conceiv'd, either that any thing that is onely material can think, or that there can possibly be any <hi>Vacuum</hi> (that is, Place without any Body) in the Universe; both which the <hi>Epicureans</hi> profess themselves not onely to conceive as Possible, but to believe as True.</p>
                  <p>And thus much, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> it may suffice to have said in relation to those who would reject God from having any thing to do, either in the Production or Government of the World,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56384:52"/>
upon this ground, that they, if you will believe them, can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the Original and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of it without him; but 'tis not all, nor the greatest part of the Favorers of the Atomical Philosophy, that presume so much of themselves, and dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate so much from God: To say therefore something to the more moderate and judicious of that Perswasion, we will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly propose on their behalf the most plausible Objection we can foresee against the Truth we have been all this while plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for. They may then thus argue against us, That though the Atomists cannot sufficiently demonstrate from what Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Causes every particular Effect proceeds, and satisfactorily explicate after what determinate manner each particular <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi> is produc'd; yet it may suffice to take away the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of having recourse to a Deity, that they can make out in general, That all the things that appear in the World, may, and must be perform'd by meerly corporeal Agents; or if you please, That all Natures <hi>Phaenomena</hi> may be produc'd by the parcels of the great Mass of Universal Matter, variously shap'd, connected, and mov'd. As a Man that sees a screw'd Gun shot off, though he may not be able to describe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, bigness, shape and coaptation of all the Pieces of the Lock, Stock, and Barrel, yet he may readily conceive that the Effects of the Gun, how wonderful soever they may seem, may be perform'd by certain pieces of Steel or I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In answer to this Objection, I must first profess to you, That I make a great doubt whether there be not some <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> in Nature, which the Atomists cannot satisfactorily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain by any Figuration, Motion, or Connection of material Particles whatsoever: For some Faculties and Operations of

the reasonable Soul in Man, are of so peculiar and transcendent a kinde, that as I have not yet found them solidly explicated by corporeal Principles, so I expect not to see them in haste made out by such. And if a spiritual Substance be admitted to enter the Composition of a Man, and to act by and upon his Body; besides that, one of the chief and fundamental Doctrines of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> (namely, That there is nothing in the Universe but <hi>Corpus</hi> and <hi>Inane</hi>) will thereby be subverted; it will appear that an Incorporeal and Intelligent Being may work upon Matter, which would argue, at least a possibility that there may be a spiritual Deity, and that he may intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with, and have an influence upon the Operations of things Corporeal: But to insist no longer on this, let us give a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and direct Answer to the propos'd Objection, by represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, That although as things are now established in the World, an Atomist were able to explain the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> we meet with, by supposing the parts of Matter to be of such Sizes, and such Shapes, and to be mov'd after such a manner as is agreeable to the Nature of the particular <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> to be thereby exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, yet it would not thence necessarily follow, That at the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>st production of the World, there was no need of a most powerful and intelligent Being to dispose that <hi>Chaos,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd heap of numberless Atoms into the World, to establish the universal and conspiring Harmonie of things; and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to connect those Atoms into those various seminal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textures, upon which most of the more abstruse Operations, and elaborate Productions of Nature appear to depend: For many things may be perform'd by Matter variously figur'd and mov'd, which yet would never be perform'd by it, if it had been still left to it self without being, at first at least, fashion'd after such a manner, and put into such a Motion by an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Agent. As the Quill that a Philosopher writes with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dipt in Ink, and then mov'd after such and such a manner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on White Paper, all which are Corporeal things, may very

well trace an excellent and rational Discourse; but the Quill would never have been mov'd after the requisite manner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Paper, had not its motion been guided and regulated by the Understanding of the Writer: Or rather, yet once more to resume our former Example of the <hi>Strasbourgh</hi> Clock, though a skilful Artist, admitted to examine and consider it, both without and within, may very well discern that such Wheels, Springs, Weights, and other Pieces of which the Engine consists, being set together in such a coapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion, are sufficient to produce such and such Motions, and such other Effects as that Clock is celebrated for, yet the more he discerns the aptness and sufficiency of the parts to produce the Effects emergent from them, the less he will be apt to suspect that so curious an Engine was produc'd by any casual concurrence of the Parts it consists of, and not rather by the skill of an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and ingenious Contriver; or that the Wheels, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, were of this or that Size, or this or that determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Shape, for any other reason, then because it pleas'd the Artificer to make them so; though the reason that mov'd the Artificer to employ such Figures and Quantities, sooner then others, may well be suppos'd to have been, that the Nature of his Design made him think them very proper and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for its accomplishment, if not better then any other suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the several Exigencies of it.</p>
                  <p>If an <hi>Epicurean</hi> should be told, that a Man, after having been for some days really dead, became alive again, I think it will not be doubted, but that he would reject such a Relation as impossible, and therefore too manifestly false to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any Man in his Wits: And yet, according to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the Man, as well Soul as Body, consisted onely of divers Particles of the Universal Matter, by various Motions brought together, and dispos'd after a certain manner: And consequently, he must ground his perswasion that 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to redintegrate the Engine once spoil'd by death, upon this,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56384:53"/>
That as Chance cannot with the least probablity be presum'd to have produc'd such a strange Effect; so according to him, there can be no Cause assign'd, knowing and powerful enough, to rally and bring together again the disbanded and scattered parcels of Matter (or substitute other equivalent ones) that together with the remaining Carcase, compos'd the dead Man, so to reunite them to the rest; and lastly, so to place and put into Motion both the one and the other, as were requisite to make a living Man once more result from them. I know that this Example reaches not all the Circumstances of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie we have been debating; but yet, if I mistake not, it will serve the turn for which I propose it: For, not now to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon this inference from it, That a considering Man may confidently reject a thing that is not absolutely impossible, provided it be highly incredible; not to insist on this, I say, the thing I aim at in the mention of it, is onely to shew, That such things may possibly be effected by Matter and Motion, as no wise Man will believe to have been produc'd by a bare Agitation of the Particles of Matter, not guided by the superintendency of a Powerful and Knowing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Atoms, or Particles of Matter of which the World consists, made no agreement with each other to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene and settle in the manner requisite to constitute the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, <hi>Lucretius</hi> does not so properly confess, as affirm, in that fore-cited Passage where he judiciously tells us, That

                  <p>IT remains now, <hi>Pyroph</hi>: that we at length return into the way from whence the foregoing Digression has, I fear, too long diverted us, and that to prosecute and finish our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, we take it up where we left it and were tempted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, namely, at the end of the III <hi>Essay</hi>; betwixt which, and the beginning of this V, all that has been interpos'd may be look'd upon but as a long Parenthesis.</p>
                  <p>In the third place then I consider, That whether or no it be true which our Antagonists suggest, that there are some things in Nature which tempt Philosophers more then they doe the Vulgar, to doubt or deny a God; yet certainly there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things in Nature that do much conduce to the evincing of a Deity, which Naturalists either alone discern, or at least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them better then other Men: For besides the abstruse Properties of particular Bodies, not discover'd by any but those that make particular Enquiries into those Bodies, there are many things in Nature, which to a superficial Observer seem to have no relation to one another; whereas to a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Naturalist, that is able to discern their secret Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies and Alliances, these things which seem to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Irrelative each to other, appear so Proportionate and so Harmonious both betwixt themselves, and in reference to the Universe they are parts of, that they represent to him a very differing and incomparably better Prospect then to another

Man: As he that looks upon a Picture made up of scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd and deform'd pieces, beholding them united into one Face, by a Cylindrical Looking-glass aptly plac'd, discerns the skill of the Artist that drew it, better then he that looks onely on the single parts of that Picture, or upon the whole Picture, without the uniting Cylinder. Which brings into my minde, That whereas in the Sacred Story of the Creation, when mention is made of Gods having consider'd the Works of each of the first six Days, at the end of it, it is said of the Work of every Day, <hi>That God saw that it was good</hi> (except of the second Day, because the separation of the Waters was but imperfectly made on that day, and compleated in the next, on which it is therefore twice said, <hi>That God saw that it was good</hi>) whereas, I say, when God look'd upon his Works in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, it is onely said, <hi>That he saw that they were good</hi>; when He is introduc'd at the close of the Creation, as looking upon, and surveying his Creatures in their Harmony, and entire Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem, it is emphatically said, <hi>That he saw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good.</hi> And if <hi>Aristotle</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Author of the Book <hi>De Mundo ad Alexandrum,</hi> which passes for his, and is said to have been Written by him towards the end of his Life, it would not be unworthy our Observation to take notice, how he that in his other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings is wont to talk of Gods Interest in the Creatures darkly, and hesitantly enough, is wrought upon by the Contemplation of the Universe, as it is an orderly Aggregate or System of the Works of Nature, to make Expressions of the Divine Architect, which are not unworthy of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> though being meerly humane they cannot be worthy of God. Amongst many I shall single out some; and I hope, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> you will excuse me, if in this <hi>Essay,</hi> and some of the precedent ones, I do contrary to my custom, employ pretty store of Passages taken out of other Authors.

For this Muscle seems so made, as if Nature had design'd in it, to manifest, That she is skill'd in the Mechanicks, not onely as a Mathematician that understands the powers of Distance, Weight, Proportion, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Figure; but as an Artificer, or Handy-crafts man, who knows by dextrous Contrivances to furnish the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd parts of his Work, with what is more useful to make it lasting: There being (to omit other Observables, belonging to that Muscle) a deep notch made in the <hi>Coxendix,</hi> to shorten the way betwixt the two extremities of the Muscle, and make it bear upon the Bone with a blunter Angle. And because the <hi>Tendon</hi> is long, lest, notwithstanding the former provision, it should be apt to fret out upon the edge of the Bone, Nature has provided for it a Musculous piece of Flesh, wherein it is as it were sheath'd, that so it might not immediately bear, and grate upon the Bone; just as our Artificers use to sow Cases of Leather upon those parts of silken Strings, which being to grate upon harder Bodies, were otherwise endangered to be fretted out by Attrition.</p>
                  <p>And a like skilfulness of Nature in the Mechanical Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Parts, is more obviously discernable in the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of that admirable Engine, by which such variety of other Engines are made, the Hand: where (not to mention the <hi>Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum latum,</hi> or Wrist-band, that keeps the <hi>Tendons</hi> that move under it from inconveniently starting up upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the respective Muscles) the wonderful perforations that are made through the <hi>Tendons</hi> of the <hi>Musculi per forat,</hi> by those of the <hi>Musculi perforantes,</hi> for the more commodious motion of the Joynts of the Fingers, may conspicuously ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the Mechanical Dexterity of Nature; as it may her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding

And to assist you in so pleasing a speculation, as that of the Eye, we shall adde, That by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Ox Eyes are much larger, and much easier to be had then humane ones, we are wont to make much use of them, and to discern some things better in their Coats, we immerse them for a little while in boyling Water, and to be able to consider the form and bigness of the Vitreous and Crystalline humors, better then the fluidity of the one, and the softness of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are wont to allow Anatomists to do; we have sometimes, by a way hereafter to be set down, speedily frozen Eyes, and thereby have turn'd the Vitreous humor into very numerous and Diaphanous Films (as it were of Ice, and the Crystalline into a firm Substance, but (which perhaps you will wonder at) not Transparent. An eye thus frozen, may be cut along that which Optical Writers call the Optical Axis, and then it affords an instructive Prospect, which we have not been able to obtain any other way. But because, notwithstanding this Expedient in the Eyes of Men, and the generality of Terrestrial Animals, the Opacousness of the <hi>Sclerotis</hi> hinders the Pictures that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Objects (unless they be lucid ones) make with in the Eye to be clearly discern'd. We think our selves oblig'd to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mathematician of your Acquaintance, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> who, upon some Discourse we had with him concerning this Subject, lately advis'd us to make use of the Eyes of white Rabbets (for if those Animals be of another colour, he says, their Eyes will not prove so fit for our purpose) For having held some of these Eyes at a convenient distance betwixt my Eyes and the Window, I found them to be so transparent, That the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56384:57"/>
rayes proceeding from the Panes of Glass, Iron Bars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Window, passing through the Crystalline humor, and in their passage refracted, did on the <hi>Retina</hi> exhibit in an inverted Posture, according to the Optical Laws, the contracted, but lively Pictures of those external Objects; and those Pictures, by reason of the transparency of the <hi>Sclerotis,</hi> became visible through it to my attentive Eyes: As in a darken'd Room the shadows of Objects without it, projected on a fine sheet of Paper, may, by reason of the thinness of the Paper, be seen thorow it by those that stand behinde it. By Candle-light we could see little in the bottom of these eyes, but lucid Objects, such as the flame of the Candle, which appear'd tremulous, though inverted; but by Day-light we could manifestly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in them both the motions of very neighboring Objects, and the more vivid of their colours.</p>
                  <p>And really, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> it seems to me not onely highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable for a Reasonable Soul to live in so Divinely built a Mansion, as the Body she resides in, altogether unacquainted with the exquisite Structure of it; but I am confident, it is a great obstacle to our rendring God the Praises due to him, for his having so excellently lodg'd us, that we are so ignorant of the curious Workmanship of the Mansions our Souls live in; for not onely the Psalmist, from the consideration of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Art display'd by God, in the moulding and fashioning his Body in the Womb, takes a just occasion to celebrate his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, <hi>I will praise thee</hi> (says he) <hi>because I am fearfully and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully made, marvellous are thy works, and that my Soul know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth right well: My substance was not hid from thee,</hi>

                  <p>Perhaps it may be truly said yet further, That although in humane Bodies, many Wonders, as we have lately mention'd, have been discover'd to us by Anatomy, yet Anatomy it self has not discover'd to us all the Wonders to be met with in a humane Body, nor will detect them, till Anatomists be skill'd in some other things over and above that of dexterously Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secting: For it seems very probable, that the excellent contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of some parts will never be fully apprehended, without a competent knowledge of the Nature of those Juices tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are to pass thorow them, and some of them receive their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or some alteration in them; And the Nature of these Juices will scarce be exactly known, without some skill in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of Physiology, and especially in Chymistry. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the reason of the Origination, Shape, Bulk, Length, Progress, and Infection of each particular Muscle, can hardly be well accounted for, without some skill in the Principles of Mechanicks, and in the nature and properties of Leavers, Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56384:58"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moreover, there is a certain Harmonious Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt the parts of a humane Body, in reference both to the whole, and to one another, which is not wont to be heeded by Anatomists, but much taken notice of by Statuaries and Painters: For they reckon, that when a Mans Arms are display'd, the distance betwixt his middle Fingers is equal to the height of his Body; so they reckon sometimes seven, sometimes eight lengths of the Head, to the length of the Body, and four times the length of the Nose to that of the Head, as three times the same length to that of the Face: And divers such Observations we have met with among them, which we shall not now insist on, but rather tell you, That without some skill in Opticks, it will be hard for an Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist to shew the Wisdom of God in making the Crystalline humor of the Eyes of Men, onely of a somewhat convex or lenticular form, rather then as those of Fishes of an almost perfectly Spherical one. Nor do I remember that in Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Schools I have heard any account given of this difference, which yet tends much to manifest the Wisdom of the Author of Nature, who has so excellently suited the Eyes of Animals to the several parts of the Universe he design'd them to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. For Men, and other Terrestrial Animals living in the Air, the Beams of Light, reflected from visible Objects, and falling over the <hi>Cornea</hi> and the Aqueous humor, do necessarily suffer a Refraction there, as coming from the Air, which is a thinner <hi>Medium</hi> into a thicker, and so there needs the less of further Refraction to be made by the Crystalline humor, and consequently its Figure needs to be but moderately convex; whereas Fishes living constantly in the Water, the <hi>Medium,</hi> through which they see things, is almost of a like thickness with the <hi>Cornea</hi> and Aqueous humor; so that there being little or no Refraction made in their Eyes but by the Crystalline it self, it was necessary that that should be exceedingly convex, that it might make a very great Refraction, and thereby unite the Beams nearer at hand; which if the Crystalline were less
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56384:59"/>
convex, would tend to a point of Concourse beyond the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,</hi> and consequently paint on it but a languid and confus'd Picture of the Object they should represent.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> certainly he is injurious to Man, if (as some eminent Chymists expound him) he calls Man a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosm, because his Body is really made up of all the several kindes of Creatures the Macrocosm or greater World consists of,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>De usu Part.</hi>
                     </note> and so is but a Model or Epitomy of the Universe: For (to omit that the Antients (as <hi>Galen</hi> informs us) gave the Title of Microcosms to Animals in general) 'tis the Glory and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Man, that God was pleas'd to make him not after the Worlds Image, but His own. On which occasion, give me leave to tell you, That however, the consideration of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity conferr'd on us in the Image of God, (in whatever that Image be resolv'd to consist) should, methinks, be some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to us to look upon our selves as belonging unto God; As our Saviour, from the Image of <hi>Caesar</hi> stampt upon a Coyn, pronounc'd it fit <hi>to render unto Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God, those of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fourth place, I consider that the universal experience of all Ages manifests, That the contemplation of the World has been much more prevalent to make those that have addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to it, Believers, then Denyers of a Deity: For 'tis very apparent that the old Philosophers, for the most part, acknowledg'd a God, and as evident it is by their want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, by many Passages in their Writings, and by divers other things not now to be insisted on, That the consideration of the works of Nature, was the chief thing that Induc'd them to acknowledge a Divine Author of them. This Truth I could easily make out, were I at leisure to transcribe Testimonies, which, because I am not, I shall content my self to mention to you one, which may well serve for many, it being a Confession made by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or whatever other Learned Philosopher it was, who writ the Book <hi>De Mundo,</hi> That Gods being the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect and Upholder of the World, was the general belief of

                  </p>
                  <p>In the fifth place, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I consider, that when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines we are answering suppose Physiology likely to render a Man an Atheist, they do it (as hath above been noted already) upon this Ground, That Natural Philosophy may enable him to explicate both the regular <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and the aberrations of Nature, without having recourse to a first Cause or God. But though this supposal were as great a Truth, as we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to make it a Mistake, yet I see not why a Studier of Physiology, though never so great a Proficient in it, may not rationally be an utter Enemy to Atheism: For the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Creatures, is but one of the ways of coming to be convinc'd that there is a God; and therefore, though Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were unable to make use of the Argument drawn from the Works of Nature, to prove the existence of a Deity, yet has she other Arguments enough besides, to keep any Considerate
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56384:62"/>
and Impartial Man from growing an Atheist. And here give me leave, for the sake of these Divines, to observe, That though the Devils be Spirits, not onely extreamly knowing in the Properties of Things (by their hidden skill in Physiology, by which they teach Magicians, and their other Clients, to do divers of the strange things for which they are admired) But also unmeasureably proud, and willing to pervert their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the cherishing of Atheism; yet St. <hi>James</hi> informs us, <hi>That they themselves believe there is a God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 11.19.</note> 
                     <hi>and tremble at him</hi>; which argues, either that skill in Natural Philosophy does not necessarily lead to Atheism, or that there are other Arguments, besides those drawn from Science, sufficient to convince the most refractary of the existence of a Deity.</p>
                  <p>But not to insist on any thing of this nature, nor so much as to mention what proofs the consideration of our own Minds, and their in-bred Notions, may affo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d us of a Deity, I shall content my self to minde you, That the several Patefactions which God has been pleas'd to make of himself, to Man espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, those made by seasonably accomplish'd Prophesies, and by Miracles, do not onely demonstrate the Being, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and divers of the Attributes of God. And indeed, methinks, the Divines we reason with may well allow these Patefactions to be capable of evincing the existence of a God, since they are sufficient, and, for ought I know, the best Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have to convince a rational Man of the truth of the Christian Religion. For the Miracles of Christ (especially his Resurrection) and those of his Disciples, by being Works al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together supernatural, overthrow Atheism; and being owned to be done in Gods Name, and to authorize a Doctrine ascrib'd to his Inspiration; his Goodness, and his Wisdom, permit us not to believe that he would suffer such numerous, great, and uncontrouled Miracles, to be set as his Seals to a Lie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude Men little less then inevitably into the belief of a Doctrine not true. And as for the Miracles themselves (especially that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56384:62"/>
of Christs Resurrection, so much, and so deservedly insisted on by <hi>Peter</hi> to the Jews, and <hi>Paul</hi> to the Gentiles) the truth of them is so ascertain'd to us by many of the solemnist, and most authentick ways of Attestation, whereby the certainty of Matters of Fact is capable of being satisfactorily made out, that 'tis hard to shew how these Testimonies can be deny'd, without denying some acknowledg'd Principle of Reason, or some other received Notion, which these Contradictors Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or Practice manifest them to look upon as a truth. And upon this account, so much might be said to evince the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of assenting to the Christian Religion, and to shew, that as much may be said for it, as need be said for any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and much more then can be said for any other; that it need be no wonder, that, as Learned Men as ever the World admir'd, have not been many of them Embracers, but some of them Champions of it. But having more fully, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treatise, discours'd of this subject, I shall content my self to make this Inference from what has been alledg'd, that since the most Judicious Propugners of Christianity have held and found, that, upon the score of Gods miraculous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of himself, rational Men might be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the abstruser Articles of the Christian Religion, those Revelations cannot but be sufficient to convince them of so fundamental and refulgent a Truth (which all the others sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) as that of the existence of God.</p>
                  <p>In the sixth and last place, I will here adde (on this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that an insight into Physiological Principles, may very much assist a Man to answer the Objections of Atheists, against the Being of a Deity, and the Exceptions they make to the Arguments brought to prove that there is one: For though it has long been the custom of such Men, to talk as if themselves, and those of their minde, were not alone the best, but almost the onely Naturalists; and to perplex others with pretending, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, whereas it is not conceiveable how there can be a God,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56384:63"/>
all things are by the Principles of the Atomical Philosophy, made clear and facil. Though this, I say, have long been us'd among the Opposers of a Deity, yet he that not regarding their confidence, shall attentively consider the very first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of things, may plainly enough discern, that of the Arguments wherewith Natural Philosophy has furnish'd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists, those that are indeed considerable, are far fewer then one would readily think; and that the difficulty of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Eternity, Self-existence, and some other Attributes of God (though that afford them their grand Objection) proceeds not so much from any absurdity belonging to the Notion of a Deity, as such; as from the difficulty which our dim humane Intellects finde to conceive the Nature of those first Things (whatever we suppose them) which, to be the Causes of all others, must be themselves without cause: For he that shall attentively consider, what the Atomists themselves may be compell'd to allow concerning the Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Matter, the Origine of local Motion (which plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to the Nature of Body) the Infinity or Bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness of space, the Divisibleness or non-Divisibility of each Corporeal Substance into infinite Material Parts, may clearly perceive that the Atomist, by denying that there is a God, cannot free his Understanding from such puzling Difficulties as he pretends to be the Reasons of his Denyal. For instead of one God, he must confess an infinite number of Atoms to be Eternal, Self-existent, Immortal, Self-moving, and must make Suppositions, incumbred with Difficulties enough to him that has competently accustomed his Thoughts to leave Second Causes beneath them, and contemplate those Causes that have none. But I am unwilling to swell this Essay, by insisting on such Considerations as these, especially since you may finde them more aptly deduc'd in other Papers, some of which treat of the Truth of Christian Religion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are design'd for the Illustration of some things in this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56384:63"/>
&amp; the fore-going Essays. For I must confess to you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that by reason of the sundry Avocations, I have been so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from proposing some of the Reasons I have employ'd, to their best advantage, that I my self, at another time, could have both mention'd them with lesser disadvantage, and have added divers others: And therefore I have not onely had thoughts of enlarging upon some Passages of our past Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but I long since made a Collection (though it be not now in my power) of Observations, and Experiments to elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidate a Point in one of those Discourses, whereby may be enervated one of the three chief Physiological Reasonings, that I have met with among the Atheists.</p>
                  <p>Upon consideration of all the Premises, I confess, <hi>Pyrophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> that I am enclined to think there may, perhaps, be more cause to apprehend, that the delightfulness of the Study of Phisiology should too much confine your Thoughts and Joys to the Creatures, then that your Proficiency in it should bring you to dis-believe the Creator: For I have observ'd it to be a fault, incident enough to Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Persons, to let their mindes be so taken up, and, as it were, charm'd with that almost infinite variety of pleasing Objects, which Nature presents to their Contemplation, that they too much dis-relish other Pleasures and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and are too apt to undervalue even those wherewith the improv'd Opportunities of serving God, or holding Communion with Him, are capable of Blessing the Pious Soul.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Pyroph</hi>: though comparatively to Fame, and Mistresses, and Baggs, and Bottles, and those other transient, unsatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (in a word) deluding Objects, on which the greatest part of mistaken Mortals, so fondly dote, the entertaining of our Noblest Faculties, with Objects suited to them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per both to gratifie our Curiosity, and to enrich our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56384:64"/>
understandings, with variety of acceptable and useful Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, affords a satisfaction that very well deserves the choice and preferrence of a rational Creature: Yet certainly, <hi>Pyrophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> as God is infinitely better then all the things that he has made, so the Knowledge of Him is much better then the knowledge of them; and he that has plac'd so much delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in a Knowledge, wherein he allows his very Enemies to become very great Proficients, has sure reserv'd much Higher, and more contenting Pleasures to sweeten and endear those Disclosures of Himself, which He vouchsafes to none but those that love Him, and are lov'd by Him.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> though I will allow you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the Contemplation of Nature a greater satisfaction, then from any thing you need decline for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I would not have you expect from it any such satisfaction as you may entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquiess in, for nothing but the enjoyment of Him that made the Soul for Himself can satisfie it, the Creatures being as well uncapable to afford us a compleat Felicity by our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Speculations of them, as by our sensual Fruitions of them; for though the knowledge of Nature be preferrable by odds to those other Idols which we have mention'd, as inferior to it, yet we here attain that knowledge, but very imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and our acquisitions of it cost us so dear, and the Pleasures of them is so allay'd with the disquieting Curiosity they are wont to excite, that the wisest of Men, and greatest of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers among the Antients, scruples not, upon his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.13.</note> to call the addicting of <hi>ones heart to seek and search out by Wisdom, concerning all things that are done under the Heaven, a sore travel given by God to the sons of Men, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd</hi> (or, as the Original hath it, <hi>to afflict themselves) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with</hi>: And the same experienc'd Writer elsewhere tells us, <hi>That he that encreases knowledge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 1.18.</note> 
                     <hi>encreases sorrow.</hi> And 'twas perhaps for this reason that <hi>Adam</hi> was form'd out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and afterwards by God brought into it, to intimate, That
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56384:64"/>
Felicity is not a thing that Man can acquire for himself, but must receive as a free gift from the liberal Hand of God: And as the Children of the Prophets sought translated <hi>Elias</hi> with very great diligence, but with no success,<note place="margin">2 Kings cap. 2.</note> so do we as Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly as Industriously, seek after perfect Happiness here, both they and we, missing of what we seek for the same reason; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we seek for that on Earth, which is not to be found but in Heaven: And this I forewarn you of, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> not at all to discourage you from the study of Physiology, but to keep you from meeting with that great Discouragement of finding in it much less of satisfaction then you expected, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great expectation from it, being one of the disadvantagiousest Circumstances with which it is possible for any thing to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
                  <p>But at length, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> though late, I begin to discern in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to how tedious a digression my zeal for Natural Philosophy, and for you, has mis-led me, and how it has drawn from my Pen some Passages, which may seem to relish more of the Preacher, then the Naturalist; yet I might alledge divers things to justifie, or, at least, extenuate what I have done: As first, That if in making this Excursion I have err'd, I have not done so without the Authority of great Examples; for not onely <hi>Seneca</hi> doth frequently both season his Natural Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations with Moral Documents and Reflections, and owns, that he purposely does so, where he says, <hi>Omnibus rebus,</hi>

Physiology, for it seems consonant both to Gods Goodness, and that repeated Axiome in the Gospel, which tells us, <hi>That he that improves his Talents to good uses, shall be intrusted with more,</hi> That the imploying the little Knowledge I have in the service of Him I owe it to, may invite Him to encrease that little, and make it less despicable. And perhaps it is not the least cause of our ignorance, in Natural Philosophy it self, that when we study the Great Book of Nature, call'd <hi>The Universe,</hi> we consult, peradventure, almost all other Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors to understand its Mysteries, without making any address for instruction to the Author, who yet is justly stil'd in the Scripture,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.17.</note>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56384:65"/>
make such discoveries by virtue of them, as both others, and the person himself, whose knowledge is thus encreased, would scarce have imagin'd to be possible: And in effect, the chiefest of the Secrets that have been communicated to me, the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have acknowledg'd to me to have been attain'd, rather, as they were pleas'd to speak, by accidental Hints, then accurate Enquiries: confessions of this nature I have divers times met with in the Writings of the more Ingenious of the Chymists, and of other Naturalists, and by one of these accidental Hints, of late, the acute and lucky <hi>Pecquet</hi> was directed to finde the newly discovered <hi>Lactea Thoracica,</hi> as before him <hi>Asellius</hi> found without seeking, as himself confesseth, the <hi>Lactea Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senterica</hi>; and by an accident too (as himself hath told me) did our industrious Anatomist, Dr. <hi>Jolive,</hi> first light upon those yet more freshly detected Vessels, which afterwards the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous <hi>Bartholinus,</hi> without being inform'd of them, or seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, hath met with, and acquainted the World with, under the name of <hi>Vasa Lymphatica</hi>; and the two great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of the later Ages, Gunpowder, and the Loadstones respect unto the Poles, are suppos'd to be due rather to Chance, then any extraordinary skill in Philosophical Principles (which indeed would scarce have made any Man dream of such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Properties, as those of Magnetick Bodies) As if God design'd to keep Philosophers humble, and (though he allow regular Industry, sufficient encouragement, yet) to remain Himself dispenser of the chief Mysteries of Nature.</p>
                  <p>To what hath been represented, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I might adde much more to excuse my Excursions, if I were not content to be beholden to you for a Pardon, and to invite you to grant it me, I shall promise you to be very careful not to repeat the like offence; and whereas most Chymical Writers take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

from almost every Discovery or Process they acquaint us with, to digress and wander into tedious, and too often dull and impertinent Theological Reflections or Sermons. I have troubled you with almost all that I have to say (to you) of Theological at once, and I have endeavored to sprinkle it as far as the subject would allow me, with some Passages Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental. And indeed I should not at all have engag'd my self into so long a Discourse of the not onely Innocency, but Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the knowledge of Nature, in reference to Religion, but that I could not acquiess in what I had met with on that subject in any of the Writers I have perus'd, Divines being commonly too unacquainted with Nature, to be able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it Physiologically enough, and Naturalists commonly esteeming it on part of their work to treat of it at all. And therefore I scruple not to confess freely to you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that, as I shall think my self richly rewarded for all the ensuing Essays, if the past Discourse but prove so happy as to bring you to value, and to make the Religious use of the Creatures recommended to you in it: So I had rather any of my Papers should be pass'd by unperused, then those parts of these Essays that treat of that use. And indeed 'tis none of the least of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, I hope, to derive from my Physical Composures, that by premising before them the now almost finish'd Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I have done my hearty endeavor to manifest and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the true use of all the Discoveries of Nature, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Enquiries, or your own, may afford you. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for my part, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I esteem the Doctrine I have been pleading for of that importance, that I am perswaded, That he that could bring Philosophical Devotion into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest it Merits, should contribute as much to the solemnizing of Gods Praises, as the Benefactor of Choristers and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Chauntries, and not much less then <hi>Davids</hi> so cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated

                  <p>For the sensible Representations of Gods Attributes to be met with in the Creatures, occurring almost every where to our observation, would very assiduously solicit us to admire Him, did we but arightly discern Him in them: And the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions made on the Minde by these Representations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding not from a bare (and perhaps languid) whether Belief or Notion of the Perfections express'd in them, but from an actual and operative intuition of them, would excite an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (with the Devotion springing thence) by so much the more intense, by how much (it would be) more rational. And sure, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> so much admirable Workmanship as God hath display'd in the Universe, was never meant for Eyes that wilfully close themselves, and affront it with the not judging it worthy the speculating. Beasts inhabit and enjoy the World: Man, if he will do more, must study, and (if I may so speak) Spiritualize it: 'Tis the first act of Religion, and equally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging in all Religions: 'Tis the duty of Man, as Man; and the Homage we pay for the Priviledge of Reason: Which was given us, not onely to refer our selves, but the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that want it, to the Creators Glory. Which makes me sometimes angry with them who so busie themselves in the Duties and Imployments of their second and superinduc'd Relations, that they will never finde the leisure to discharge that Primitive and Natural Obligation, who are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd as Citizens of any place, then of the World; and both worship God so ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the neglect of this Philosophical Worship of

God, for which we are pleading, seems to be culpable in Men proportionably to their being qualified, and comply with that invitation of the Psalmist, to <hi>sing Praises</hi> to God <hi>with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>

                     <hi>to praise him according to his excellent Greatness.</hi> For Knowledge being a gift of God, intrusted to us to glorifie the Giver with it, the Greatness of it must aggravate the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of imploying it gratefully; and the sublimest Knowledge here attainable will not destroy, but onely heighten and enoble our admiration, and will prove the Incense (or more spiritual and acceptable part, of that Sacrifice of Praise (for those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections which their Nature makes onely acts of Reason, their End may make acts of Piety) wherein the Intelligent Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer offers up the whole World in Eucharists to its Maker. For admiration (I do not say astonishment or surprize) being an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Objects transcending our Knowledge, the learneder the transcendent Faculty is, the greater is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Objects transcendency acknowledg'd: And certainly, Gods Wisdom is much less glorifi'd by the vulgar astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an unlettered Starer (whose ignorance may be as well suspected for his Wonder, as the excellency of the Object) then from their learned Hymns, whose industrious Curiosity hath brought their understandings to a prostrate Veneration of of what their Reason, not Ignorance, hath taught them not to be perfectly comprehensible by them.</p>

And on the open'd Body of the same Animal, a skilful Anatomist will make reflections, as much more to the honor of its Creator, then an ordinary Butcher can; as the Musick made on a Lute, by a rare Lutanist, will be preferable to the noise made on the same Instrument by a Stranger unto Melody.

Tit. 2.10.</note> even the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christians of his time,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.19.</note> to commit their Souls to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of a Faithful Creator) so neither hath he given up his right to those Intelligent Adorations from us, which become us upon the account of being his rational Creatures; neither are such performances made less acceptable to him by the filial relation into which Christ hath brought us to him, that Glorious relation as well endearing to him our services as our persons.</p>
                  <p>And let me adde, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that not onely <hi>Galen</hi> (as we have seen already) tells us, That the discerning ones self, and discovering to others the Perfections of God display'd in the Creatures, is a more acceptable act of Religion, then the burning of Sacrifices or Perfumes upon his Altars; and not onely <hi>Trismegistus</hi> forbidding <hi>Asclepius</hi> to burn Incense,<note place="margin">

That you may know she would not only have them seen, but look'd upon, take notice of the place she hath given us: For she hath not onely made Man of an upright Stature, but being so made, for better Contemplation, that he might follow with his Eye the course of the Stars, from the Rising to the Setting, and carry about his Looks, together with his whole Body, she hath both given him a tall Head, and placed that upon a flexible Neck: Then she shews six Constellations by Day, and six by Night; She hath laid open every part of her Self, that by those things which she hath offered to the Eyes of Man, she might breed a desire of knowing the rest. Yet neither do we see all her Works, nor those that we see, do we see in those Proportions which they truly have: But our Sight, by searching, does open a way unto it self, and lay the grounds of Truth, that so Inquiry may pass from things that are plain to things that are obscure, and finde somewhat more Ancient even then the World it self, See <hi>Sen. de Vita Beata, Cap.</hi> 32.</q>

Whereas therefore (saith he) all Men ascribe that to Art, which is made aright in all respects; but that which is so only in one or two, not to Art, but Fortune: The structure of our Body gives us cause to admire the excellent Art, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and power of Nature which fram'd us. For our Body consists of above Two hundred Bones; to each of which tends a Vein for conveying of nourishment (in like manner as to the Muscles) which is accompanied with an Artery and a Nerve, and the parts are exactly pairs, and those plac'd in the right side of an Animal, are wholly alike to those in

the other, Bone to Bone, Muscle to Muscle, Vein to Vein, Artery to Artery, and Nerve to Nerve; excepting onely the Bowels, and some other parts, which seem to have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar construction. So that the parts of our Body are double, and altogether alike among themselves, both in greatness and shape, as also in consistence, which I place in the diversity of softness and hardness. As therefore we use to judge of things made by Men, acknowledging the skill of a Work-man, by the building of a Ship with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Art; so also it behoveth to do in those of God, and to admire the Framer of our Body, whosoever of the Gods he were, although we do not see Him.</q>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter having, in the former part of this Treatise, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> thus largely endeavored to manifest to you the advantagiousness of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy to the minde of Man, we shall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to speak of its Usefulness, both to his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Fortune. For I must ingeniously confess to you, <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophilus,</hi> That I should not have neer so high a value as I now cherish for Physiology, if I thought it could onely teach a Man to discourse of Nature, but not at all to master Her; and served onely, with pleasing Speculations, to entertain his Understanding without at all increasing his Power. And though I presume not to judge of other Mens knowledge, yet, for my own particular, I shall not dare to think my self a true Naturalist, till my skill can make my Garden yield bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Herbs and Flowers, or my Orchard better Fruit, or my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56384:79"/>
Fields better Corn, or my Dairy better Cheese then theirs that are strangers to Physiology. And certainly, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> if we seriously intend to convince the distrustful World of the real usefulness of Natural Philosophy, we must take some such course, as that <hi>Milestan Thales</hi> did, who was by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents reckoned among the very first of their Naturalists, and their seven celebrated Wise-men: Of this <hi>Thales</hi> it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, That being upbraidingly demanded what advantage the Professors of Astrology could derive from the knowledge of it; he Astrologically foreseeing what Year it would prove for Olives, before any wonted signs of it did appear to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, Ingrossed, by giving earnest, the greater part of the Olives, which the next Season should afford to <hi>Chios</hi> and <hi>Miletus</hi>; And being thereby inabled, when most Men want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oyl, to sell his at his own rates, he made advantage enough of his skill, to let his Friends see, That Philosophers may have the acquisition of Wealth more in their power then in their aim.</p>
                  <p>Me thinks, it should be a disparagement to a Philosopher, when he descends to consider Husbandry, not to be able, with all his Science, to improve the precepts of an Art, resulting from the lame and unlearned Observations and Practice of such illiterate Persons as Gardeners, Plow-men, and Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids. And indeed, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> though it be but too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the barren Philosophy, wont to be taught in the Schools, have hitherto been found of very little use in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life; yet if the true Principles of that fertil Science were thorowly known, consider'd and apply'd, 'tis scarce ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, how universal and advantagious a change they would make in the World: For in Man's knowledge of the nature of the Creatures, does principally consist his Empire over them. (his Knowledge and his Power having generally the same limits) And as the Nerves, that move the whole
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56384:79"/>
Body, and by it, that great variety of Engines imployed by Man on his manifold occasions, proceed from the Brain; so all the operations, by which we alter Nature and produce such changes in the Creatures, flow from our knowledge of them. Theological inquiries excepted, there is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mployment wherein Mankinde is so much and so generally concern'd, as 'tis in the study of Natural Philosophy. And those great Transactions which make such a noise in the World, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish Monarchies or ruine Empires, reach not to so many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with their influence, as do the Theories of Physio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
                  <p>To manifest this Truth, we need but consider, what chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Face of things have been made by two Discoveries, trivial enough; the one being but of the inclination of the Needle, touched by the Load-stone, to point toward the Pole; the other being but a casual Discovery of the supposed antipathy between Salt-Peter and Brimstone: For without the knowledge of the former, those vast Regions of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and all the Treasures of Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones, and much more Precious Simples they send us, would have probably continued undetected; And the latter, giving an occasional rise to the invention of Gunpowder, has quite alter'd the condition of Martial Affairs over the World, both by Sea and Land. And certainly, true Natural Philosophy is so far from being a barren speculative Knowledge, that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, Husbandry, and very many Trades (as those of Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Dyers, Brewers, Founders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are but Corollaries or Applications of some few Theorems of it.</p>
                  <p>If I had not a great respect for the Great <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> I should venter to say, That some of those rigid Laws of <hi>Draco</hi> (whose severity made Men say, That they were written in Blood) have, perhaps, cost fewer Persons their Lives, then that one Aphorism of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which teaching, <hi>That if a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56384:80"/>
teeming Woman be let Blood, she will miscarry,</hi> has for divers Ages prevail'd with great numbers of Physitians, to suffer multitudes of their Female Patients to die under their hands, who might propably have been rescued by a discreet Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which experience has assured us (whatever the close of <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Hippo. Apho</hi> 31. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> the Aphorism says to the contrary) to have been sometimes not onely safely, but usefully employed, even when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is grown pretty big. But my respect for so great a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> makes me content it should be thought, That till of late, Physitians have for the most part mistaken their Dictators meaning in this Aphorism, provided it be granted me, That through this mistake numbers of teeming Women have been suffered to perish, who might probably, by the seasonable loss of some of their Blood, have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that of their Lives.</p>

                  <p>And indeed, since the Physitian borrows his Principles of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56384:80"/>
the Naturalist, I cannot but somewhat admire to see divers Persons, who are by themselves and others thought such wise Men, think the study of Natural Philosophy of small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment: for when by their Policy or good Fortune they have acquired never so much Wealth or Power, and all other transitory Goods, and are blest with Children to inherit them, if the Principles of Natural Philosophy be mis-laid, we often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times see the ignorance or the mistake of a Doctor, deprive them of all at once, and shew how dangerous it is to be sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous of the means of attaining the accommodations of Life, with the contempt of that Knowledge which in very many cases is humanely necessary to the preservation of Life it self.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> though our unintended prolixity in the former part of our Discourse concerning the Usefulness of Physiology, oblige us to the greater brevity in this latter part of it; yet to shew you, That of the two things, which you may remember we told you <hi>Pythagoras</hi> pronounc'd most God like in Man <hi>(The Knowledge of Truth, and the Doing of Good</hi>) Physiology as well qualifies us for the latter, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches us with the former. It will not be amiss a little more particularly (though as succinctly as so copious a Subject will permit) to consider the probability there is that no small Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement may be made by Mens proficiency in Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Knowledge of those Arts which are the chiefest Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Man's dominion over the Creatures. These Arts (to divide them not accurately, but popularly) do serve either to relieve Man's necessities, as Physick and Husbandry; or for his accomodation, as the Trades of Shoo-makers, Diers, Tanners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or for his delight, as the Trades of Painters, Confectioners, Perfumers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to all which Arts, and many others ally'd to them, Philosophical Experiments and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56384:81"/>
may, by a knowing Naturalist, be made to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a meliorating Influence.</p>
                  <p>If I should, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> say this, without offering any thing at all by way of Proof that I say it not inconsideratly, You would, I fear, believe, that I deliver it too slightly for a Matter of that moment: And if, on the other side, I should in this Discourse present to you all the Particulars that I think I could, without Impertinency, employ to countenance what I have said, it would swell this Treatise to a Volumn, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud divers of my other Essays. And therefore I hold it not unfit to choose a middle way, and set down, on this occasion, either onely or chiefly those things which do the most readily occur to me, and do not so properly belong to the rest of my physiological papers. And to avoid Confusion, I shall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Division newly propos'd, employ one Section of this Second part of the present Treatise, in setting down such things as relate to the Improvement of Physick: And in the other Section, deliver such particulars as concern those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther useful Arts that depend upon Natural philosophy. But in regard that (as I have already intimated) the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is to consist chiefly of those things that belong not to any of my other Essays, You will not, I presume, expect that I should handle any subject fully or Methodically on this occasion: Which warning I especially intend for that part of the ensuing Discourse that relates to physick. For you will easily believe, that I am far from pretending to be a Doctor in that Faculty: And accordingly, in this and the four follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Essays, I shall onely throw together divers such particulars as not belonging to my Writings, would, perhaps be lost, if I did not lay hold on this Opportunity for their preservation, of which they are not altogether judged unworthy by some knowing Men, whose Encouragements, to mention them to you, have disswaded me from wholly passing by, in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

For since it were too barbarous, and too great a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the Laws, not onely of Divinity but Humanity, to dissect humane Bodies alive, as did <hi>Herophilus</hi> and <hi>Erasistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who (as I finde in some of the Ancients) obtain'd of Kings the Bodies of Malefactors for that purpose, and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled not to destroy Man to know him; And since, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less divers things in Anatomy, as particularly the motion of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56384:82"/>
the Blood and Chyle cannot be discover'd in a dead dissected Body (where the cold has shut up and obliterated many Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages) that may be seen in one open'd alive; it must be very advantagious to a Physitians Anatomical knowledge, to see the Dissections of Dogs, Swine, and other live Creatures, made by an inquisitive Naturalist: Consonantly whereunto we may remember, that the discoveries of the milky Vessels in the Mesentery by <hi>Asellius,</hi> of those in the <hi>Thorax</hi> by <hi>Pecquet,</hi> and of the <hi>Vasa Limphatica</hi> by <hi>Bartholinus,</hi> were first made in Brute Bodies, though afterwards found to hold in humane ones. Nor is it a small convenience to the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, that he may in the Bodies of Bruits make divers instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Experiments, that he dares not venture on in those of Men; as for instance, that late noble, and by many not yet credited Experiment of taking out the Spleen of a Dog with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out killing him: For that this Experiment may be very useful, we may elsewhere have occasion to shew. And that it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be safely made (though many, I confess, have but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosperously attempted it, and it hath been lately pronounced impossible in Print) our selves can witness. And because I have not yet met with any Author that professes himself not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late this Experiment (of the exemption of a Dogs Spleen) upon the credit of others, but as an eye-witness; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to assure you, That that dextrous Dissector, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Jolive</hi> (of whom we formerly made mention) did the last Year, at my request, take out the Spleen of a yong Setting-dog I brought him: And that it might not be pretended, the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment was unfaithfully or favorably made, I did part of it my self, and held the Spleen (which was the largest in proportion to his Body that ever I saw) in my Hand, whil'st he cut assun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Vessels, reaching to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, that I might be sure there was not the least part of the Spleen left unextirpated, and yet this Puppy, in less then a Fortnight, grew not onely well, but as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56384:82"/>
sportive and as wanton as before: which I need not take pains to make you believe, since you often saw him at your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers House, whence at length he was stol'n. And though I remember the famous Emperick <hi>Fiorouanti,</hi> in one of his <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Books, mentions his having been prevail'd with by the importunity of a Lady (whom he calls <hi>Marulla Greca</hi>) much afflicted with Splenetick distempers, to rid her of her Spleen; and addes, That she out-liv'd the loss of it divers Years. Yet he that considers the situation of that part, and the consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of the Vessels belonging to it in humane Bodies, will probably be apt to think, that though his relation may be credited, his venturousness ought not to be imitated. The Experiment also of detaining Frogs under Water for very many hours (sometimes amounting to some days) without suffocation, may, to him that knows that Frogs have Lungs and Breath as well as other Terrestrial Animals, appear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable discovery, in order to the determining the Nature of Respiration. Besides, the scrupulousness of the Parents or Friends of the deceased Persons, deprives us oftentimes of the Opportunities of Anatomizing the Bodies of Men, and much more those of Women, whereas those of Beasts are almost always and every where to be met with.

and industry, not despicably, improve his Anatomical knowledge. In confirmation of which truth, give me leave to observe to you, That though <hi>Galen</hi> hath left to us so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and by Physitians so much magnified Anatomical Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, yet not onely divers of those Modern Physitians, that would eclipse his Glory, deny him to have learn'd the skill he pretends to, out of the inspection of the Dissected Bodies of Men or Women, or so much as to ever have seen a humane Anatomy. But I finde even among his Admirers, Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that acknowledge that his Knives were much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant with the Bodies of Apes, and other Bruits, then with those of Men, which in his time those Authors say 'twas thought little less then Irreligious, if not Barbarous, to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; which is the less to be wondred at, because even in this our Age, that great People of the Muscovites, though a Christian and European Nation, hath deny'd Physitians the use of Anatomy and Skeletons; the former, as an inhumane thing; the latter, as fit for little but Witchcraft, as we are inform'd by the applauded Writer <hi>Olearius,</hi> Secretary to the Embassy lately send by that Learned Prince,<note place="margin">

                  <p>To these things we may adde, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Zootomists may much contribute to illustrate the Doctrine of <hi>Andratomy,</hi> and both inform Physitians of the true use of the parts of a humane Body, and help to decide divers Anatomical Controversies. For as in general 'tis scarce possible to learn the true Nature of any Creature, from the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56384:83"/>
consideration of the single Creature it self: so particularly of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of humane Body 'tis very difficult to learn the true use, without consulting the Bodies of other Animals, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the part inquired after is by Nature either wholly left out as needless, or wherein its differing bigness, or situation, or figure, or connection with, and relation to other parts, may render its use more conspicuous, or at least more discernable.</p>
                  <p>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Truth may be somewhat illustrated by the following Observations, which at present offer themselves to my thoughts upon this occasion.</p>
                  <p>The Lungs of Vipers, and other Creatures (whole Hearts and whose Blood, even whil'st it circulates, we have always found, as to sense, actually cold) may give us just occasion to inquire a little more warily whether the great use of Respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be to cool the Heart.</p>
                  <p>The suddain falling and continuing together, which we may observe in that part at least of a Dogs Lungs, that is on the same side with the Wound, upon making a large Wound in his Chest, though the Lungs remain untouched, is a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Experiment, in order to the discovery of the principal Organ of Respiration.</p>
                  <p>If you dexterously take out the Hearts of Vipers, and of some smaller Fishes, whose coldness makes them beat much more unfrequently and leisurely, then those of warm Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, the contraction and relaxation of the Fibres of the Heart may be distinctly observed, in order to the deciding or reconciling the Controversie about the cause and manner of the Hearts motion, betwixt those Learned modern Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, that contend, some of them, for Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and others, for that of the Cartesians.</p>
                  <p>Towards satisfying my self in which difficulty, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I have sometimes taken the Heart of a Flownder, and having cut it transversly into two parts, and press'd out, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56384:84"/>
with a Linnen cloth wip'd off the Blood contain'd in each of them, I observ'd, that for a considerable space of time, the sever'd and bloodless parts held on their former contraction and relaxation. And once I remember that I observed, not without Wonder, That the sever'd portions of a Flownders Heart, did not onely, after their Blood was drain'd, move as before, but the whole Heart, observ'd for a pretty while, such a succession of motion in its divided and exsanguious pieces, as I had taken notice of in them whil'st they were coherent, and as you may with pleasure both see and feel in the intire Heart of the same Fish.</p>
                  <p>Some of the other Controversies agitated among Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists and Philosophers, concerning the use of the Heart, and concerning the principal seat of Life and Sense, may also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive light from some such Experiments, that we made in the Bodies of Bruits, as we could not of Men.</p>
                  <p>And the first of these that we shall mention, shall be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment that we remember our selves formerly to have made upon Frogs: For having open'd one of them alive, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cut out his Heart, without closing up the Orifice of the Wound (which we had made wider then was necessary) the Frog notwithstanding leaped up and down the Room as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, dragging his Entrals (that hung out) after him; and when he rested, would upon a puncture leap again, and being put into the Water, would swim, whil'st I felt his Heart beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt my Fingers. The Hearts of others of them were taken out at an Incision, no greater then was requisite for that purpose; when we had stitched or pin'd up the Wound, we observ'd them to leap more frequently and vigorously then the former: They would, as before they were hurt, close and open their Eye lids upon occasion: Being put into a Vessel not full of Water, they would as orderly display their fore and hinder Legs in the manner requisite to swimming, as if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56384:84"/>
they wanted none of their parts, especially not their Hearts; they would rest themselves sometimes upon the surface of the Water, sometimes at the bottom of it, and sometimes also they would nimbly leap, first out of the Vessel, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Room, surviving the exsection of their Hearts; some about an hour, and some longer. And that which was further remarkable in this Expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iment, was, that we could, by gently pressing their Brest and Belly with our Fingers, make them almost at pleasure make such a noise, as to the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers made them seem to croak; but how this Experiment will be reconcil'd to the Doctrine ascrib'd to Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> or to to that of the <hi>Aristotelians,</hi> who tell us, That their Master taught, the Heart to be the seat of Sense (whence also though erroneously, he made it the original of the Nerves) let those that are pleas'd to concern themselves to maintain all his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, consider.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Frogs, though they can move thus long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Heart, yet they cannot at all bear the exemption or spoiling of the Brain; we will adde what we have observ'd, even in hot Animals, whose Life is conceived to be much more suddenly dissipable, and the motion of each part much more dependent upon the influence of the Brain: We open'd then an Egge, wherein the Chick was not onely perfectly formed, but well furnished with Feathers, and having taken him out of the Membrane that involved him, and the Liquors he swam in, and laid him on his Back on a flat piece of Glass, we clip'd away, with a pair of Sciffers, the Head and the Brest-bone; whereby the Heart became exposed to view, but remain'd fastned to the Headless Trunk: and the Chick lying in this posture, the Heart continued to beat above a full hour, and the Ears seem'd to retain their motion a pretty while after the Heart it self had lost his; the motion of none of the other Parts appearing many moments to survive the loss of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56384:85"/>
Head: and which is most considerable, the seemingly dead Heart was divers times excited to new, though quickly cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing motion, upon the puncture of a Pin, or the point of a Pen-knife. And to evince that this was no casual thing, the next Day we dealt with the Chick of another Egge, taken from the same Hen, after the above recited manner; and when the motion of the Heart and Ears began to cease, we excited it again, by placing the Glass over the warm steam of a Vessel full of hot Water, bringing still new Water from off the Fire to continue the heat, when we perceiv'd the former Water to begin to cool; and by this means we kept the Heart beating for an hour and an half by measure. And at another time, for further satisfaction, we did, by these and some other little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustries, keep the Heart of a somewhat elder Chick, though exposed to the open Air, in motion, after we had carefully clipt off the Head and Neck, for the space of (if our memory do not much mis inform us) two hours an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> an half by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Upon what conjectures we expected so lasting a motion in the Heart of a Chick, after it had lost the Head, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Brain, would be more tedious and less fit to be mention'd in this place, then the strange vivacity we have sometimes, not without wonder, observed in Vipers: Since not onely their Hearts clearly sever'd from their Bodies may be observ'd to beat for some hours (for that is common with them to divers other cold Animals) but the Body it self may be sometimes two or three days after the Skin, Heart, Head, and all the Entrals are separated from it, seen to move in a twining or wrigling manner: Nay (what is much more) may appear to be manifestly sensible of punctures, being put into a fresh and vivid motion, when it lay still before, upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pricked, especially on the Spine or Marrow with a Pin or Needle.</p>

                  <p>That the Claws likewise of Lobsters being torn off, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will sometimes grow in the room of it, is not onely said by Fisher-men, but hath been affirmed to me by very credible persons, one of which assured me, that he himself had observed it very often. And I am the more apt to believe it, because the like is to be met with among Craw-fishes, which are so like Lobsters, that by many they are taken (though not considerately enough) to be but a smaller kinde of them. For I remember, that going to look upon a Reposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory where a multitude of them was kept, and causing divers of the fairest to be drawn up, that I might take the stony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, commonly called <hi>Oculi Cancrorum,</hi> out of their Heads I observ'd one large Fish that had one of his Claws proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the bulk of his Body, but the other so short and little, that the greater seem'd to be four or five times as big as it; whereupon its good shape and fresh colour, seeming to argue it to be but yong and growing, invited me to ask one of them that had the oversight of the Fish, whether he had formerly seen any Claws torn off to grow again; he affirmed to me, That in that sort of Fish it was very usual.</p>
                  <p>I could also tell you how fruitlesly I have indeavored to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that stomachical Acidity, to which many of our Modern Physitians are pleas'd to ascribe the first digestion of the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of Animals, in the purposely dissected Stomachs of ravenous Sea-fishes, in whose Stomachs, though our taste could not perceive any sensible acidity, yet we found in one of them a couple of Fishes, each of them about a Foot long, whereof the one, which seem'd to have been but newly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56384:87"/>
hath suffered little or no alteration in the great Fishes Stomach; but the other had all its outside, save the Head, uniformly wasted to a pretty depth, beneath the former sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Body, and look'd as if it had been not boil'd, or wrought upon by any considerable heat, but uniformly corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, like a piece of Silver Coyn kept a while in <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> according to the criminal tricks of Adulterators of Money.</p>
                  <p>Yet I am loth, till I have perfected what I design in order to that enquiry, either to imbrace or reject the Opinion I finde so general among the Moderns, concerning the Solution of Meat in the Stomach by something of Acid. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that when I was considering what might be alleadg'd for, as well as against that Opinion, I devis'd this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, among others, in favor of it: I provided a Liquor, with which I drench'd a piece of the Wing of a rosted Pullet, hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng, did, as I expected, turn to a deep Blood red, or sometimes rather a lovely purple Liquor, though all this while there had been no external heat imployed to promote the action of the <hi>Menstruum.</hi> And the like Experiment I tryed also with a piece of Mutton, with Bread, and a piece of Veal, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther edible things, which at that time occur'd to me, and found the operation of the Liquor almost uniform, though it seem'd to act most effectually upon Flesh. And to gratifie in some measure your curiosity, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I am content to tell you, that the <hi>Menstruum</hi> was drawn from Vitriol, and that with the bare Oyl of it I have (though I could not with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi>) perform'd no less then what I have yet mention'd;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56384:87"/>
but least this should be thought a digression, let it suffice to have, on this occasion, mention'd thus much upon the by.</p>
                  <p>To what we lately took notice of concerning the Heart, may be added, That on the Sea-coast of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I observ'd a sort of Fishes, about the bigness of Mackrels, whose Hearts were of an inverted Figure, compar'd to those of other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, the basis or broad end of the Heart being nearest the Tail, and the accuminated part or apex being coherent to the great Artery, and respecting the Head.</p>
                  <p>To all these trifling Observations, divers more considerable ones might be added, but they may be more seasonably insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on elsewhere; and those already mention'd, may suffice to let you see, That the Naturalist by his Zootomy, may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry serviceable to the Physitian in his Anatomical Inquiries.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it onely by the dissection of various Animals, that the Naturalist may promote the Anatomists knowledge, but perhaps also he may do it by devising ways to make the dead Bodies of Men, and other Animals, keep longer then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they would do: For since experience teaches us, That Men finde it very easie to forget the originations, windings, branchings, insertions, and other circumstances of particular Vessels, and other parts of the Body, as well as those that study Botanicks, are wont to complain of their easie forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the shapes, differences, and alterations of smaller Plants, it cannot but be a great help to the Student of An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56384:88"/>
the figures and differences of Vegetables, by those Books which some curious Botanists make, wherein the Plants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, artificially dry'd, are display'd upon, and fastned to Leaves of white Paper; if it were not for one of those Books, wherein I have in one vast Volumn almost all the Plants of one of the chief Physick-gardens in <hi>Europe,</hi> I should every Year forget, by the end of Winter, to know again most of the smaller Plants I had learn'd to take notice of in the Spring. And by the way 'tis observable, how long Plants, by being carefully indeed, but barely dryed in the shade betwixt Sheets of Paper, which help to soak up the superfluous moisture, may be preserv'd. For I have divers Years had an Herbal, wherein several of the Flowers, and other Plants, retain their native yellow and blue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (but somewhat faint) though by the date it appear'd to be 22 or 23 Years old. And I am apt to think, that it would be very possible for Anatomists also to preserve the Bodies they contemplate for a considerable time: For experience hath inform'd us in good number of such Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, that Butter-flies, and divers other flying Insects, may have their shape and colours preserv'd, I know not how long, by running them through in some convenient part with Pins, and therewith sticking them to the inside of large Boxes. And on this occasion, I remember, that having sometimes reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Lasting of Spiders, Flys, and other small living Creatures, that having been casually enclos'd in Amber whil'st it was soft, are ever preserv'd entire and uncorrupted, I thought it not amiss to try whether some Substance, like Amber (at least as to the newly mention'd use of it) might not easily be prepar'd by Art: And hereupon I quickly found, that by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good clear <hi>Venice</hi> Turpentine, and gently evaporating away about a third part of it (sometimes more, sometimes less, according to the exigency of my particular purpose) I could make a reddish Gum, diaphanous and without Bubbles,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56384:88"/>
which would melt with a very gentle heat, and easily (being suffer'd to cool) become again so hard as to be brittle. This resinous Substance should be melted with as little heat as is possible (and therefore should be first pouder'd) that the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Vegetable or Animal Bodies to be cased over with it, might receive the less alteration: And when it is brought to the requisite degree of fluidity, then the Body to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd (being, if that be needful, stuck through with a Pin) must be gently plung'd into it, and presently taken out and suffer'd leisurely to cool, being turn'd, from time to time, this way or that way, if there be occasion, that the investing Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be every where of an equal thickness upon it. And if at the first time the Case be not thick enough, it may again, when it is cold, be immers'd into the liquid Matter (as Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are wont to thicken their Candles, by dipping them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into melted Tallow) of which some will every way adhere to it. And though these Cases be inferior to Amber, in regard of their being more apt to be sulli'd by dust, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; yet that inconvenience may be easily remedy'd, by keeping them shut up in Glasses or Boxes, at those times when one hath not occasion to consider them: And their clearness (especially if they be thin) and their smooth surfaces, together with their exactly keeping out the Air from the Body they enclose, may, perhaps, make so cheap and easie an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a not unwelcome trifle, especially considering how easily 'tis capable of Improvement.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the Preservation of more bulky Bodies, 'tis a known thing, to the Collectors of Rarities, that the external <hi>Idea</hi> of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

unknown to many Anatomists.

                  <p>We have also seen the Skeleton of a Monky, made, by an excellent French Chyrurgion of our acquaintance, whereon the Tendons and Fibres of the Muscles were so preserv'd, that it was look'd upon as a rarity, very useful to shew their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Insertions, and to explain the motions of the Limbs: And perhaps there may be some way to keep the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries &amp; the Veins too, when they are empty'd of Blood, plump, and unapt to shrink over-much, by filling them betimes with some such substance, as, though fluid enough when it is injected to run into the Branches of the Vessels, will afterwards quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow hard. Such may be the liquid Plaister of burnt Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baster, formerly mention'd, or Ising-glass steeped two days in Water, and then boild up, till a drop of it in the cold will readily turn into a still Gelly. Or else <hi>Saccarum Saturni,</hi> which, if it be dissolv'd often enough in Spirit of Vinager, and the Liquor be each time drawn off again, we have observ'd to be apt to melt with the least heat, and afterwards to grow quickly into a somewhat brittle consistence again.

For at present, <hi>Pyro</hi>: I have employ'd so much of the little time my Occasions will allow me to spend upon the Treatise I am now writing, in making out to you the Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Naturall Philosophy, to the Physiologicall Part of Physick, that I must not only not prosecute this Subject, but must both hasten to mention, and to mention the more cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorily its serviceablenesse to the four remaining Parts of the Physitians Art.</p>

                  <head>ESSAY II. Offering some Particulars relating to the Pathologicall Part of Physick.</head>
                  <p>AND to say something in the next place of <hi>Pathology,</hi> that the Naturalists knowledge may assist the Physitian to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the nature and causes of severall Diseases, may appear by the light of this Consideration, that, though divers <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsians</hi> (taught, as they tell us, by their Master) do but erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously suppose, that Man is so properly a Microcosme, that of all the sorts of Creatures whereof the Macrocosme or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse is made up, he really consists; yet certaine it is that there are many Productions, Operations, and Changes of things, which being as well to be met with in the great, as in the little world, and diverse of them disclosing their natures more discernably in the former, then in the latter; the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the nature of those things as they are discoverable <hi>out</hi> of mans body, may well be suppos'd capable of illustrating many things <hi>in</hi> man's body, which receiving some Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there from the nature of the Subject they belong to, passe under the notion of the Causes or Symptomes of Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. If I were now, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to discourse to you at large of this Subject, I think I could convince you of the truth of what I have proposed. And certainly, unlesse a Physitian be, (which yet I fear every one is not) so much a Naturalist, as to know how Heat, and Cold, and Fluidity, and Compactnesse,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56384:92"/>
and Fermentation, and Putrefaction, and Viscosity, and Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, and Dissolution, and such like Qualities, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and destroyed in the generality of Bodies, he will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten very much to seek, when he is to investigate the causes of preternaturall Accidents in men's bodies, whereof a great many depend upon the Presence, or Change, or Vanishing of some or other of the enumerated Qualities, in some of the Fluid or Solid Substances that constitute the body. And that the Explications of a skilfull Naturalist may adde much to what has hitherto commonly been taught concerning the Nature and Origine of those Qualities, in Phisitians Schools, a little comparing of the vulgar Doctrine, with those various Phaenomena, to be met with among Naturall things, that ought to be, and yet seem not to be, explicable by it, will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily manifest to you. And questionlesse 'tis a great advantage to have been taught by variety of Experiments in other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Differing waies whereby Nature sometimes produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the same effects. For since we know very little <hi>à priori,</hi> the observation of many such effects, manifesting, that nature doth actually produce them so and so, suggests to us severall wayes of explicating the same Phaenomenon, some of which we should perhaps never else have dream'd of. Which ought to be esteem'd no small Advantage to the Physitian; since he that knows but one or few of Natures wayes of working, and consequently, is likely to ignore divers of those whereby the propos'd Disease (or Symptome of it) may be produc'd, must sometimes conclude, that precisely <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> a thing is the determinate Cause of it, and apply his Method of relieving his Patient accordingly; which often proves very prejudiciall to the poor Patient, who dearly paies for his Physitians not knowing, That the Quality that occasions the Distemper, may be as probably, if not more rationally, deduc'd from an other Origine, then from that which is presum'd. This will
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56384:92"/>
scarce be doubted by him that knowes how much more likely Explications then those applauded some ages since, of divers things that happen as well within as without the body, have been given by later Naturalists, both Philosophers and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians: and how much the Theory of the Stone, and many other diseases, that has been given us by those many Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that would needs deduce all the Phaenomena of diseases from Heat, Cold, and other Elementary Qualities, is Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Account given us of them by those ingenious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, that have apply'd to the advancement of Pathologie, that Circulation of the Blood, the Motion of the Chile by the Milky vessels to the Heart, the consideration of the effects deducible from the Pores of greater bodies, and the motion and figuration of their minute parts, together with some of the more known Chymicall Experiments: though both of those, and of the other helps mention'd just before them, I fear men have hitherto been far enough from making the best use, which I hope it will dayly more and more appear they are capable of being put to. He that has not had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity to enquire out and consider the severall waies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Stones may be generated out of the body, not only must be unable satisfactorily to explicate how they come to be produc'd in the Kidnies and in the Bladder, but will, perhaps, scarce keep himselfe from imbracing such errors, because au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd by the suffrage of eminent Physitians, as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I am recommending would easily protect them from. For we find diverse famous, and, otherwise, learned Doctors, who (probably because they had not taken notice of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of hardning a matter once soft into a stonelike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence) have believ'd and taught that the Stone of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes is produc'd there by slime baked by the heat and drinesse of the Part; as a portion of soft Clay may, by externall heat, be turn'd into a Brick or Tile. And accordingly they have
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56384:93"/>
for cure, thought it sufficient to make use of store of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to moisten and cool the Kidneys; which, though in some bodies this be very convenient, are yet far inferiour in effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to those Nobler medicines, that by specifick qualities and properties are averse to such coagulations as produce the Stone. But (not to mention what a Physitian skill'd in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy would object against this Theory from the nature of the part affected) 'tis not unlike, the imbraces of this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis would not have acquiesc'd in it, if they had seen those putrefactions out of the bodies of men, which we elsewhere mention'd. For these would have inform'd them, that a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor abounding with petrescent parts, may not only turn Wood (as I have observ'd in a petrifying Spring) into a kind of Stone, and may give to Cheese and Mosse without spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their pristine appearance a strong hardnesse and weight; but may also produce large and finely shap'd Christalline bodies (though those I try'd were much lesse hard then Chrystall) in the bosome of the cold water, which brings into my mind, that I have diverse times produc'd a body of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most stony hardnesse in lesse then halfe an hour, even in the midst of the water, by tying up in a rag, about the quantity of a nutmeg, of well and recently calcin'd Alabastre, which being thus ty'd up and thrown into the botome of a bason full of water, did there speedily harden into a Lapideous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. And that even in the bodies of Animals themselves such concretions may be generated much otherwise then the Hypothesis we have been speaking of supposes, may appear by what happens to Craw-fishes, which though cold animals, and living in the waters, have generated at certain seasons in their heads Concretions, which for their hard and pulveriza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consistence, divers Authors call <hi>lapides Cancrorum,</hi> though in the Shops they are often but abusively styled <hi>Oculi cancrorum.</hi> And such strong concretions are affirm'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56384:93"/>
to be generated in these Fishes every Year, which I the less scrupled at, because I have not found them at all times in the Head of the Fish. And besides, these and many more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, that had they been observ'd by the Physitians we have been speaking of, might easily have kept them from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescing in, and maintaining their improbable explication of the manner of the Stones nativity: There is yet another kind of Coagulation, which may both be added to the former, and perhaps also serve to recommend the use of Chymical Experiments, in investigating the Causes of Diseases: This is made by the mixture of exquisitely dephlegm'd Spirit of fermented humane Urine, with as exactly rect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56384:94"/>
Substance, and commonly some Gravel: but even in rectified Spirit of Urine it self, I have had opportunity to observe, That after very long keeping, there hath spontaneously preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated a Feculency, copious enough in proportion to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that afforded it. Nay, in an other parcel of Spirit of Urine, that hath been kept much longer then that already mention'd, we observ'd the other day, that not onely there was a Terrestrial residence fallen to the bottom of the Glass, but to the sides of it as far as the Liquor reach'd, there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered a great multitude of small Concretions; which, as far as appeared by looking on them through the Crystal Viol, to whose insides they were fastened, were no other then little grains of Gravel, such as are often found sticking to the sides of Urinals, employed by calculous persons.</p>
                  <p>To which we might adde an Experiment of ours, whereby we are wont almost in a moment, by barely mixing together a couple of Liquors, both of them distill'd and transparent, and yet not both of them salin'd to thick them very notably and permanently, insomuch that they seem not to precipitate each other; yet having once, for curiosity sake, distill'd them with a prety strong Fire, I obtain'd a great quantity (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, a fourth of the whole mixture) of a blackish Mass, that was not onely coagulated and dry, but even brittle: But of the coagulation of distill'd Liquors, such as even Chymists themselves are not wont to look upon as at all dispos'd to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation, I may elsewhere have a better opportunity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain you, and therefore I shall forbear to do it now.</p>
                  <p>And by this way, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> doth <hi>Helmont,</hi> if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him aright, attempt to make out the generation of the Stone in humane Bodys: In which Theory, though some difficulties do yet keep me from acquiescing, yet, besides that perhaps what you will meet with by and by (about the distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Duelech</hi>) may make you the less wonder at this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56384:94"/>
explication. Besides this, I say, granting that none of the enumerated ways of Petrescency (if I may so speak) deserves to be look'd upon as satisfactory; yet to give so much as an account, <hi>not very absurd,</hi> of a Disease so anomalous and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse, and hitherto so unluckily explicated by Physitians, is perhaps more difficult, then it were to give (at least) a <hi>plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> account of divers other Distempers.</p>
                  <p>And possibly it may be safely enough affirmed, That not onely Physiology, in its full extent, but that Hand-maid to it, which is call'd Chymistry, may not a little contribute to clear up the nature of both of the digestions, and of those deficiencies or aberrations in them, which produce a great part of Diseases; especially if we allow what, as well Physitians, as Spagyrists agree in (whether warily enough or not, I shall not now dispute) <hi>viz.</hi> That whatever is separable from Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by the Fire, was, as a Constituent Element (or Principle) pre-existent in them.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps I need not minde you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that 'tis usual with the meerly <hi>Galenical</hi> Doctors themselves, to explicate the nature of Catarrhs, by comparing the Stomach to a seething Pot, and the Head to an Alembick, where the ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vapors, being, by the coldness of the Brain, condens'd into a Liquor, sometimes distil upon the Lungs, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall upon other weakned parts; in which explication, though for divers reasons I cannot acquiesce, yet it may suffice to shew you how little scruple many Learned Men, not like to be partial in the Case, would make of employing Chymical Operations to illustrate the Doctrine of Diseases. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, since the Liquors contain'd in the Body abound, divers of them, with saline or sulphureous parts, he that hath been by Chymistry taught the nature of the several sorts of Salts and Sulphurs, and both beheld and considered their various actions one upon another, and upon other Bodies, seems to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56384:95"/>
have a considerable help to discourse groundedly of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Operations of the humors, and other Juices contein'd in the Body, which he hath not that hath never had <hi>Vulcan</hi> for his Instructer. He that findes that there may be acid Juices in the Stomach, and elsewhere (as is frequently evident in the sharp Liquors which many Stomachs cast up) and that there are also Sulphureous Salts in the Body (as is apparent in Blood and Urine, which abound with such.) He that knows that the <hi>Serum</hi> that swims upon the Blood out of the Body, is by a gentle heat immediatly coagulable into a thick whitish Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, not unlike a Custard; and that Chymically analiz'd Blood yields store of volatile and sulphureous, but (as far as our tryals have hitherto inform'd us) no acid saltness.</p>
                  <p>He that knows that these animal Salts and Spirits may be so powerful, that we have been able with Spirit of Urine, or of Harts-horn, to make a red Solution of Flowers of Sulphur, and that with Spirit of Urine (though drawn without violence of Fire) we have (as we elsewhere more particularly declare) dissolved both in a very gentle heat, and in a very short time, the un-open'd Body of crude Copper, so as to make thereof a Solution of a rich, deep, and ev'n opacous Blew: And that we have done almost the like with unrectified Spirit of Mans Blood.</p>
                  <p>He that hath, as we have done, examin'd by Fire (especially produc'd by the help of a Burning-glass) that limpid Liquor that is to be found in the Limphatick Vessels, and hath taken notice of that odde consistence, smell, crackling, and other qualities discernable in it by heat.</p>
                  <p>He that observes how acid Liquors loose their acidity, by working upon some Bodies; as when Spirit of Viniger grows almost insipid upon the coral it hath corroded, <hi>and</hi> how those saline Liquors, by working upon certain Bodies, degenerate into Salts of another nature, as we have sometimes observ'd
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56384:95"/>
in Oyl of Vitriol, working upon the fourth part of its weight of Quick-silver, and how the contrariety of acid and sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Salts makes them sometimes disarm, sometimes, after some ebullition, precipitate each other; and sometimes unite into a third substance, of a differing nature from either of those from whose coalition it results, as we see in <hi>Tartaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Vitriolatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi>; and, as I have observ'd, in a Salt, I sometimes make to emerge from a due proportion of Oyl of Vitriol and Spirit of Urine, freed, after conjunction, from their aqueous moisture: And He, in a word, that hath carefully analiz'd and made tryals on many parts, both of the Macrocosm and Microcosm, and heedfully applyed his Experiments made on the former, to the illustration of the changes observable in the latter, shall be likely to explicate divers particulars in Pathology, more intelligibly then he that is a stranger to Chymistry.</p>
                  <p>And though I am very unwilling to meddle with Medical Controversies, and am apt to think, that Chymists are wont to speak somewhat too slightingly of the humors of the humane Body, and allow them too little a share in the production of Diseases; yet (to skip other reasons) the strange stories re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>Skenkius,</hi> and other eminent Physitians, of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosiveness of some Juices, which, rejected by Urine or Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, have been able to boyl on Brass, fret Linnen, and stain Silver; together with some odde Observations of this nature, our selves have had opportunity to make, do very much incline us to believe, That the generality of former Physitians have ascrib'd too much to the Humors, under the notion of their being hot and dry, cold and moist, or endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such other Elementary Qualities, and have taken a great deal too little notice of the saline (if I may so speak) and Sulphureous Properties of things. And in this Opinion I am not a little confirmed by the authority of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himself, both in other passages, and especially where he says,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56384:96"/>
                     <hi>Non calidum, frigidum, humidum, aut siccum, esse quod mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam agendi, vim habet, verum amarum &amp; salsum &amp; dulce &amp; acidum &amp; insipidum &amp; acerbum, &amp;c.</hi> are the things which, though inoffensive to the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Body, whilst they duly allay each other, prove hurtful to it, and distemper it, when any of them comes to sever it self from the rest, and grow predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And indeed, if the Juices of the Body were more Chymically examin'd, especially by a Naturalist that knows the ways of making fix'd Bodies volatile, and volatile fix'd, and knows the power of the open Air in promoting the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of those Operations; it is not improbable, that both many things relating to the nature of the Humors, and to the ways of sweetning, acuating, and otherwise altering them may be detected, and the importance of such Discoveries may be discern'd.</p>
                  <p>And perhaps it would adde to the usefulnesse of such an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if it were extended to the noxious Juices in distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd bodies: such as the rotten Phlegme spit up by those, whose Lungs are disaffected; the slimy excretions voided in the Lyantery, and the liquor that distends the <hi>abdomen</hi> in the Dropsy and <hi>Ascites</hi>: concerning which (to tell you that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the by) I found that it was of a differing nature from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Water or Urine. For a <hi>paracentecis</hi> being made in the <hi>abdomen</hi> of one dangerously sick of this sort of Dropsie, I found that the Liquor would keep a pretty while without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, (nor did the Patient's body, when I afterwards saw it open'd, smell almost at all, though the inside of the <hi>abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> lookt well neer as black, as if it had been sphacelated:) and having steam'd away some of it, whilst it was pretty fresh, over a somewhat slow fire; it first coagulated into a substance like Whites of Eggs, and, by a little farther evaporation, turn'd to such a glutinous substance, as tradesmen are wont to call <hi>Size</hi>; and being kept longer on the fire grew to be hard
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56384:96"/>
like fish glew, but more brittle, and transparent enough, but with a little tincture of a greenish yellow; and some of the forementioned liquor being distill'd in a Retort, did towards the end of the operation so darken the vessell with a thick blackish oyle, as hindred me from discerning what else perhaps I might have seen. And I suppose it may prove a usefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to the former purpose, if I somewhat circumstantially annex here what occurr'd to me, when I was accidentally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering of the <hi>Calculus humanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having therefore obtein'd of a skilfull Lithotomist of my acquaintance divers Stones, which he had cut out of mens bladders, I chose a couple of them (which were whitish al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, of equall bignesse, and figure, which was neer ovall, and which together weighed about two ounces and an halfe, these with the help of a strong knife I carefully open'd, to find whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no either of them consisted of an entire and uniforme matter, (as most other stones, and even some <hi>calculi humani</hi> do) and I found that each of them was made up of severall shells, as it were, successively involving one another, like the rinds of an Onion, and such shels, but more soft, and more of a colour; we likewise observed in a great stone taken a while since out of an Oxe's Gall, and sent us for a present; and though all of these were of an almost stony hardnesse, yet that hardnesse was not equall in them all; and in one of the stones we observed one of the rinds (to make use of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression) to be of a differing colour both frm that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly imbraced it, and from that which it immediately imbrac'd: some of these rinds equalled in thicknesse the length of a barley corne, and others were somewhat thinner. Though they did closely imbrace one another, yet they were actually separable, as well as visibly distinguishable. And proceeding very warily in the breaking one of these stones, we found that in the center of it, there lay a small and soft ovall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56384:97"/>
stone, as it were the kernell of those conglomerated shells; and this kernell lay so loose, that with a little industry and patience we picked it out of the shell, and kept it by us as a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This done, being desirous to know whither Chymicall tortures would force these Concreats to a further confession of their nature, we caused them to be finely powdred, and put into a small but strongly coated glasse Retort, whereunto lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a much larger Retort for a Receiver; we found that these two ounces and halfe of powder, being distilled for some hours in a naked fire, afforded us great store of volatile Salt (partly grey and partly white) which almost coverd the inside of the Receiver, and a pretty quantity of reddish spirit, which in the Receiver it selfe soon coagulated into Salt, and having severed our vessels, we found in the neck of the Receiver a very little darkish oyle, but in the neck of the Retort a greater quantity of the same adust Oyl, incorporated with a pretty quantity of volatile Salt, whose smell did readily recall to my minde that peculiar kinde of stink which I had sometimes taken notice of in the volatile Salt of unfermented Urine; nor were the taste of these two Salts unlike. The <hi>caput mortuum</hi> consisted of a fine, light, cole-black Powder, not unlike the finest sort of Soot; and by weighing but of six Drachmes, it inform'd us, that above two thirds of the distill'd <hi>calculi humani</hi> had been, as being volatile, forced from the Terrestrial Parts, even in a close Vessel, wherein the <hi>caput mortuum,</hi> though it were left insipid enough, yet retained stink enough to make us think, it still conteined pretty store of heavy Oyl: as indeed, having put it into a Crucible, and kept it a competent while in a stronger fire, we found it reduced to about two Drachmes of a br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ttle Mass of insipid white Calx, which did not slack, or fall asunder like Lime when it is cast into Water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56384:97"/>To this Example of the usefulnesse of Chymistry, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the unobserv'd, and otherwise scarce discoverable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>calculus humanus</hi> from other stones; we may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to adde, That though some <hi>Paracelsians</hi> do take too much liberty, when they crudely tell us, that there are arsenicall, vitriolate, aluminous, and other minerall substances, generated in humane bodies, yet if they had more warily propos'd their Doctrine, it would not perhaps appear so absurd, as they are wont to think it, who considering only the nature of the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments men usually feed upon, cannot conceive that such being but either Animals or Vegetables, can by so gentle a heat as that of man's body, (by which they suppose all the changes of the Aliments must be effected,) be Exalted to an energie like that of such bodies as are compos'd of active Minerall substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and have some of them perchance acquir'd a violence of operation from the fire. But we see that Concretions, so like Stones, (which belong to the Minerall Kingdome,) as to passe generally for such, may be produc'd in the bodies not only of men but of sucking children, whose Aliment is fluid Milk: and it seems a mistake to imagine (how many soever do so) that Heat must needs be the Efficient of all the changes the matter of our Aliments may happen to undergoe in a humane body: where there are Streiners, and Solvents, and new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xtions, and perhaps Ferments, and diverse other powerfull Agents, which by successively working upon the assum'd matter, may so fashion and qualifie it, as, in some cases, to bring the more dispos'd part of it to be not unlike even fossile Salts, or other minerall substances. A very eminent person was lately complaining to me, that in the fits of a distemper, which almost as much puzzls her Physitians as her selfe, she sometimes vomits up something so sharp and fretting, that, after it hath burnt her throat in its passage, almost like scalding water, it doth not only Staine the Silver vessels that receiv'd

And there dyed a while since a very intelligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, much imploy'd in publick affaires, who complain'd to me, that in the fits of the strange distemper he labor'd under, he divers times observ'd, that, that part of his pillow which his breath passed along, would by the strange fuliginous Steams, which that carried off with it, be blackt over, as if it had been held in some sooty smoak or other.</p>
                  <p>We may also consider, that the Rain-water, which in its passage through a Vine, or an Apricok-tree, or the like plants, is turn'd into a sweet fruit; in its passage through those plants that bear Lemmons and Barberries, is transmuted into a liquor sharp enough to corrode, not only Pearles but Corall, <hi>lapides cancrorum,</hi> and other hard Concrets, as spirit of Vitrioll would do. And writers of unsuspected credit, affirme, that an <hi>Indian</hi> fruit, (whose name I cannnot readily call to mind) will speedily corrode and wast the very steel knives 'tis cut with, if its Juice be left long upon them: and we see that some sorts even of our Apples and Peares, will quickly black the blades of Knives on which the Juice is suffer'd to continue. And least what I freshly mention'd about Limmon trees, should be question'd, I will here adde, that I remember also that I have made not only some other hot and strongly tasted Herbs, but even a <hi>Ranunculus</hi> it selfe, to grow and inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore since this plant is reckon'd amongst those, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are poisonous, or want but little of being so; and since its operation is so violent, that this sort of Vegetables, is taken notice of from the experience of Country people, to be able by outward application to draw blisters, and since neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that which this plant, without any heat discernable by the touch, transmutes into so virulent a substance, is but so una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

a body as water; why may not such aliments, as may have in them divers parts of a far more operative nature, be in a humane body, by an unusuall concourse of Causes and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, so alter'd and exalted, as to approach in operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (especially upon the more tender parts) to those of fossile Salts or other Minerals? So that a Chymist might upon such an account, without any great absurdity, teach some parcels of morbifick matter to be of an Arsenicall, or a Vitriolate, or an Antimoniall nature, especially since we see that sometimes Cancers, Ulcers, and sharp Juices generated in the body, doe by their vitiating and wasting the invaded parts, but too much emulate the pernitious operations of Arsnick, and of fretting Salts: and the infusion of Antimonie doth scarce more stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late nature to disburthen her selfe both upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, then doth sometimes an humor, such as that which causes the <hi>Cholera morbus,</hi> and perhaps more violent diseases.</p>
                  <p>And that such degenerations of Innocent aliments should sometimes happen in discompos'd bodies, you will perhaps think the lesse strange, if you duly perpend what I lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, of the transmutation of Water into hot and vesicatory substances; and if thereto I annex, that from a single pound of so common and temperate an Aliment as Bread, I can by an easie way, (and that without addition,) obteine many ounces of a <hi>menstruum,</hi> which (as tryall has inform'd) will worke more powerfully upon bodies, more compact then some hard mineralls, or perhaps Glasse it selfe: then a wary Chymist would expect to see <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> doe. These things I have mention'd, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to intimate some of the Reasons, why I think Chymicall Experiments may be usefully apply'd, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate some things in Pathologie, either by imitating out of the body, the production of some sorts of morbifick matter, or by such resolutions of that which is generated in the body, as may conduce to the discovery of its nature. And not that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56384:99"/>
I think, as Spagyrists do, the experiments or notions of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Chymists sufficient to explicate the whole doctrine either of Digestion or of Diseases: for it would be very difficult for them to make out the manner of Nutrition, or so much as how they that feed only on Vegetables, should (to propose the difficulty in their own Terms) have their Blood and Urine copiously enrich'd with a volatile sulphureous Salt, of which sort, plants are not wont to yeild any in distillation. And much more difficult would it be for them by principles peculiar to Chymists to make out the propagation of Hereditary diseases: or how madnesse, &amp; some other distempers, that do not visibly vitiate the organes of those functions that they pervert, should not only prove hereditary, but lurk very many yeares in the inheriting person's body, before they begin to disclose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: and sometimes too, be transmitted from the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to the Grand-child, and skip immediately the interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Son. And therefore I say again, that I pretend not that Vulgar Chymistry will enable a Physitian to explicate all or most of the Pathologicall <hi>Phaenomena</hi>; but that True Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry may assist him to explicate diverse of them, which can scarce be solidly explicated without it. And let me adde, that he that throughly understands the nature of Ferments and Fermentations, shall probably be much better able then he that ignores them, to give a fair account of divers <hi>phaenomena</hi> of severall diseases (as well Feavers as others) which will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be never throughly understood, without an insight into the doctrine of Fermentation, in order to which, for that and other reasons, I design'd my Historicall notes touching that subject.</p>
                  <p>Yet I am not sure, but there may be effervescences, (and perhaps periodicall ones) in the Blood and other Juices of the body without Fermentation properly so call'd. For there may be divers other waies of begetting a praeternaturall heat

in the Blood. We often see that in Coughs, when the flegme is rottten (as they speak) that is, when its former viscous tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is alter'd, it does no longer stick fast to the vessels of the Lungs, to which it obstinately adher'd before. And so at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times other humors in the body, either by growing more fluid themselves, or by some change in the Blood, whereby it becomes fitter to dissolve such humors, may swimme in, and be circulated with, the masse of blood, and thereby occasion praeternaturall heats: <hi>either</hi> by their indisposition to be well, and incorporated therewith: <hi>or</hi> by altering its texture: <hi>or</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing the wonted motion of its minute parts: <hi>or</hi> by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing its due Rarefaction as it passeth through the Heart: <hi>or</hi> by obstructing the more slender Vessels, and so hindering the free Circulation of the Blood through them; perhaps also causing some Extravasation, as we see that wounds &amp; bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And tryall hath taught me, that there are Liquors, in which the bare admixture of Milk, Oyle, or other Liquors, nay or of cold water, will presently occasion a notable heat: and I sometimes imploy a <hi>menstruum,</hi> in which nothing but a little flesh being put, though no visible Ebullition ensue, there will in a few minuts, be excited a Heat, intense enough to be troublesome to him that holds the Glasse. And yet it seems not necessary that this should be ascrib'd to a true fermentation, which may rather proceed from the perturb'd motion of the Corpuscles of the menstruum, which being by the adventitious liquor or other body put out of their wonted motion, and into an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate one, there is produc'd in the menstruum a brisk confus'd Agitation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> small parts that compose it; and in such an agitation, (from what cause soever it proceeds,) the nature of Heat seems mainly to consist. But to dispatch, I scarce doubt, but that if in the history of diseases, there were better
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56384:100"/>
notice taken of those <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that agree not with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions already in request, as well as of those that are thought consonant to them; and if also Chymicall tryals were skilfully varied and judiciously applyed to the illustrating of Patholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> the former might be made conducing to the better explication of the latter: especially if the businesse were mannag'd by a Naturalist well vers'd both in Chymicall Experiments, and in Anatomy, and the history of Diseases, without being too much addicted either to the Chymist's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the receiv'd opinions of Physitians.</p>
                  <p>And as the Naturalist may thus illustrate Pathologie as a Chymist, so may he do the like as a Zoologer; for either the true knowledge of Anatomy must be much lesse usefull to Physitians then they have hitherto beleived, or else the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries made by recent Anatomists of the <hi>Asellian, Pecquetian,</hi> and <hi>Bartholinian</hi> vessels, by either overthrowing the receiv'd doctrine of Digestions, (from whose aberrations many diseases spring) or at least by making diverse discoveries in relation to the aeconomy of Digestions unknown to the Ancients, most probably contribute much to the clearing up of diverse Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologicall difficulties in the explication of some diseases; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that the very liberty of making those Experiments in live Beasts, which are not to be made but in living creatures, nor are allowable to be made in living men, may enable a Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologist, by giving us a clearer account of divers parts of the body, to determine divers Pathologicall difficulties springing from either our ignorance or mistakes of the use of those parts, as by the formerly mention'd Experiment of the exse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a live dogge's Spleen, and a watchfull observation of all the diseases upon that Account, befalli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>And here we may represent unto you, <hi>Pyr:</hi> that not only the dissections of sound Beasts may assist the Physitian to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the like parts of a humane body, but the dissections of morbid beasts may sometimes illustrate the doctrine of the causes and seats of diseases. For that this part of Pathology has been very much improved by the diligence of modern Physitians, by dissecting the bodies of men kill'd by Diseases, we might be justly accused of want of curiosity, or gratitude, if we did not thankfully acknowledge; For indeed much of that improvement of Physick, (for which the Ancients, if they were now alive, might envy our new Physitians) may, in my poor opinion, be ascribed to their industrious scrutiny of the Seat and Effects of the peccant matter of Diseases in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of those that have been destroyed by them.</p>
                  <p>And that the instructions deducible from such observations may be either increased or illustrated by the like observations made in the bodies of Beasts, we have been inclin'd to think, partly by the having Chymically analyz'd (as they phrase it) the blood of divers Bruits, as Sheep, Deer, &amp;c. and found its Phlegme, Spirit, Salt, and Oyle, very like that of humane bloud; and partly by our having observ'd in the bodies of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Bruits, (not excepting Fishes) Wormes, Imposthumes, and the like, some of which seem'd manifestly to spring from such causes, as are wont to produce resembling distempers in men: and if the acute <hi>Helmont</hi> had been a more diligent disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of Beasts, he would perchance have escaped the Error he after others run into (and into which his Authority hath temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted others to run) when he affirm'd, that the Stone was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease peculiar to men, for, that in the bodies of Beasts, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally very Old ones, Stones are sometimes to be found, not only severall Butchers have assur'd me, but you may gather

partly from that taken out of an Oxe's Gall, which I have formerly mention'd, which was about the bignesse of a Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut) but principally from what I elsewhere deliver'd on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to disprove that fond assertion: and greater leasure may, upon another occasion, invite us to mention some patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall Observations made in diseased Beasts, by which, (were we not willing to hasten,) we might now perhaps much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme what we have propos'd touching the possibility of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating, by such Observations, the nature of some of the Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses inciden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to be met with in Physitians Books, which proceed not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from any internal distemper of the Patient, but are produced by some exterior Poyson, and are therefore wont to be call'd by Doctors, <hi>Morbi à veneno orti,</hi> to the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate knowledge of divers of which Diseases, Experiments made on Bruits may not a little conduce: For though I deny not that some things may be Poysons to Man, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Before I take leave of Vipers (or Adders, as some will have, those that here in</hi> England <hi>commonly pass for Vipers) it will not be impertinent to tell you, That it may be justly doubted, whether they be to be reckon'd amongst poysonous Creatures, in such a sense as those other venomous Creatures, who have in them a constant, and, if I may so speak, gross and tangible Poyson; for it may be suppos'd, that the venom of Vipers consists chiefly in the rage and fury wherewith they bite, and not in any part of the Body, which hath at all times a mortal property: Thus the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56384:103"/>
madness of a Dog makes his teeth Poysonous, which before were not so: And Authors of good repute supply us with instances of hurts in themselves, free from danger, that have been made fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal by a Venom created by the fierceness of the inraged (though not otherwise poysonous) Creatures that inflicted them. And</hi> Baccius, <hi>if I mistake not, in his Treatise</hi> De Venenis, <hi>tells us a memorable Story (whereof he affirms himself to have been an eye-witness) of a Man who was kill'd within three days, by a slight hurt received in his left hand, from an inraged Dung-hill Cock: And that no parts of the Viper have any constant inherent Poyson in them, I have been induced to suspect upon this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment; That dissecting some live Vipers, there came in acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally a strange Dog, to whom I gave the Head, Tail, and Gall (which are the parts supposed to contain the Poyson) of one of them, and the Head and Gall of another, wrapt up in meat; after which, I locked the little Dog up in my own Chamber, and watched him, but fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not that he was sick, or offered to vomit at all, but onely lap'd up gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And having since related this Experiment to an inquisitive Friend of mine, he assured me, That to satisfie himself further in this particular, he gave to a Dog a dozen Heads and Galls of Vipers, without finding them to produce in him any mischievous symptome: To which I shall adde, That the old Man, you know, that makes Viper Wine, does it (as himself tells me) by leaving the whole Vipers, if they be not very great, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for some moneths, without taking out the Galls, or separating any other part from them in the Wine, till it hath dissolved as much of them as it can.</hi>

Some horrid and unusual symptomes of this Venom, which yet agree not so well with those that are wont to be produc'd in persons bitten by <hi>Tarantula's,</hi> our Author proceeds to mention; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes us with a proof of what we were lately saying, when we told you that some things were poysonous to Men, which were not to some Beasts: by adding, as an admirable singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, that the Sheep of those parts do not onely eat these fatal Insects, but seek for them. I know also, by sad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in my self, what an outward application even of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides</hi> can do; for having occasion to have a large blister drawn on my Neck, the Chirurgion I employed, unknown to me, made use of <hi>Cantharides,</hi> among other Ingredients of his vesicating Plaister, which a few hours after I had taken it, waken'd me with excessive torment, to which it put me about the neck of my Bladder, so that I apprehended it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from some Stone unable to get out; of which sudden and sensible pain, after I had a while in vain conjectur'd what might be the cause, I at length suspected that which was indeed the true one; and having sent for the Chirurgion, he confess'd to me, upon my demand, that he had put some <hi>Cantharides</hi> in his Plaister, not thinking it would have had such an operation: whereupon I soon reliev'd my self, by drinking new Milk ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well sweetned with Suger candy.</p>

                     <p>TO enable you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to gratifie those inquisitive Persons that have heard some, and yet but an imperfect Report, of a much nois'd Experiment, that was some Years agoe devis'd at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and since try'd in other places before very Illustrious Spectators; I am content to take the occasion afforded me, by what was in the foregoing Essay lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd concerning the Application of Poysons, to inform you, That a pretty while after the writing of that Essay, I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to have some Discourse about matters of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with those excellent Mathematicians, Dr. <hi>I. Wilkins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Christopher Wren</hi>; at which the latter of those <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosi</hi> told us, That he thought he could easily contrive a way to convey any liquid Poison immediately into the Mass of Blood. Whereupon, our knowledge of his extraordinary Sagacity, making us very desirous to try what he propos'd, I provided a large Dog, on which he made his Experiment in the presence, and with the assistance of some eminent Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and other learned Men: His way (which is much better le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rn'd by sight, then relation) was briefly this: First, to make a small and opportune Incision over that part of the hind-leg, where the larger Vessels that carry the Blood, are most easie to be taken hold of: Then to make a Ligature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those Vessels, and to apply a certain small Plate of Brass (of above half an Inch long, and about a quarter of an Inch broad, whose sides were bending inward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>) almost of the shape and bigness of the Nail of a Mans Thumb, but somewhat longer. This Plate had four little holes in the sides, near the corners, that by threads pass'd thorow them, it might be well
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56384:105"/>
fasten'd to the Vessel: And in the same little Plate there was also left an Aperture, or somewhat large Slit, parallel to the sides of it, and almost as long as the Plate, that the Vein might be there expos'd to the Lancet, and kept from starting aside. This Plate being well fasten'd on, he made a Slit along the Vein, from the Ligature towards the Heart, great enough to put in at it the slender Pipe of a Syringe: By which I had propos'd to have injected a warm solution of <hi>Opium</hi> in Sack, that the effect of our Experiment might be the more quick and manifest. And accordingly our dexterous Experimenter having surmounted the difficulties which the tortur'd Dogs violent struglings interpos'd, convey'd a small Dose of the Solution or Tincture into the open'd Vessel, whereby, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the mass of Blood (some quantity of which, 'tis hard to avoid shedding in the operation) it was quickly, by the circular motion of That, carry'd to the Brain, and other pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ts of the Body. So that we had scarce unty'd the Dog (whose four feet it had been requisite to fasten very strongly to the four Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I, that was willing to reserve him for further observation, caus'd him to be whipp'd up and down the Neighboring Garden, whereby being kept awake, and in motion, after some time he began to come to himself again; and being led home, and carefully tended, he not onely recove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>'d, but began to grow fat so manifestly that 'twas admir'd: But I could not long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how it far'd with him. For this Experiment, and some other tryals I made upon him, having made him famous, he was soon after stoln away from me. Succeeding attempts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd us, that the Plate was not necessary, if the Finger were
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56384:106"/>
skilfully employ'd to support the Vessel to be opened; and that a slender Quill, fasten'd to a Bladder, containing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be injected, was somewhat more convenient then a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe; as also that this notwithstanding, unless the Dog were pretty big, and lean, that the Vessels might be large enough and easily accessible, the Experiment would not well succeed: The Inventor of it afterwards practic'd it in the presence of that most Learned Noble-man, the Marquess of <hi>Dorchester,</hi> and found that a moderate Dose of the infusion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> did not much move the Dog, to whom it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but once that he injected a large Dose (about two Ounces or more) it wrought so soon, and so violently upon a fresh one, that within a few hours after he vomited up Life and all, upon the Straw whereon they had laid him. I afterwards wish'd, that not onely some vehemently working Drugs, but their appropriated Antidotes (or else powerful liquid Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als) and also some altering Medicines, might be in a plentiful Dose injected. And in Diureticks, a very ingenious Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist and Physitian told me, he try'd it with very good success. I likewise propos'd, That if it could be done, without either too much danger or cruelty, tryal might be made upon some humane Bodies, especially those of Malefactors. And some Moneths after a foreign Ambassador, a curious Person, at that time residing in <hi>London,</hi> did me the Honor to visit me, and inform'd me, That he had caus'd tryal to be made, with infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> upon an inferior Domestick of his that deserv'd to have been hangd; but that the fellow, as soon as ever the Injection began to be made, did (either really or craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily) fall into a Swoon; whereby, being unwilling to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute so hazardous an Experiment, they desisted, without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other Effect of it, save that it was told the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, that it wrought once downward with him, which yet might, perhaps, be occasion'd for fear or anguish: But the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56384:106"/>
tryals of a very dexterous Physitian of my acquaintance in humane Bodies, will, perhaps, when I shall have received a more circumstantial account of them, be not unwelcome to you. And in Dogs, you may possibly from our own Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, receive a further Account of an Experiment, of which, I now chiefly design'd but to relate to you the Rise and first Attempts.</p>

                  <head>ESSAY III. Containing some Particulars relating to the Semiotical Part of Physick.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Semiotical</hi> part of the Physitians Art, seems ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the least improvement by Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. In which yet, <hi>first</hi> the Naturalist may, by illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating the Anatomical and Pathological parts, assist the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian to make more certain conjectures from the signs he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers of the constitution and distempers of his Patient. For you will easily believe that <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> he that better knows the nature of the parts and juices of the Body, will be better able to conjecture at the events of Diseases, then he that is less skill'd in them. And <hi>secondly,</hi> The Naturalist by improving the <hi>Therapeutical,</hi> may, at least, much change and alter the Prognosticks of the duration, ferocity and event of Diseases. For, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> it would be considered, that the Predictions hitherto current in Authors, and commonly made by Physitians, suppose the use of the received Remedies, and the dogmatical method of Physick; but if there were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered such generous and commanding Medicines, as, by power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully assisting Nature, or nimbly proscribing the Morbifick Matter that doth either produce or (though produc'd by them) cherish Sicknesses, might enable Nature to hinder the Disease from continuing its course, and acting almost all the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56384:107"/>
Scenes of its Tragedy in the Body; Physitians need not, in acute Diseases, wait so often for a <hi>crisis</hi> to instruct their Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks, and the threatning Symptomes of Chronical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers would often prove false Prophets.</p>
                  <p>To illustrate this but with a not ignoble instance, give me leave to tell you, That when that <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, that now begins to be somewhat taken notice of, under the name of <hi>The Jesuits Powder,</hi> had scarce been so much as heard of in this part of <hi>Europe,</hi> I went to visit a <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> who had been for some Moneths afflicted with a Quartan Ague, so violent and stubborn, that it had frustrated the skill, and almost tyred the indeavors of the most eminent Doctors of this Nation; of one of which, who was then accidentally with his Learned Patient, I enquired how my Friend did, and was answered, That he hoped he would recover when the Season would give him leave; but in the Winter he knew no Quartanes cured. Yet the Gentleman acquainting me with his having procured some of the <hi>American</hi> Bark against Agues, which we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in a former Essay, and I (after having tasted and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it) having incouraged him, as I have others, to make Tryal of it; as the strange Effects I have observ'd of it, hath divers times invited me to do: The candid and learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, not onely oppos'd not my Perswasions, but added his own to them. And my Friend taking two Doses of this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Bark, though it were at the unhopefullest Season of the Year (the Winter Solstice) and though he scarce found any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible operation (unless a little by sweat) of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, had by the first Dose his Fit very much lessen'd, and by the second quite remov'd. And though through some irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of Dyet (to which that keen Appetite, like that of recovering Persons, which I have observ'd this Powder to be wont to produce, tempted him) he did, as I then foretold him he would, after missing eight or ten Fits, relapse, yet by the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56384:108"/>
repeated use of the same Remedy, he again recover'd, and hath continu'd so ever since. Having also lately perswaded the use of the same Medicine, in the same Disease, to one of the greatest Ladies in this Nation, she told me the other day, That it immediately, and in unlikely weather, freed her from those Fits, from whence she despair'd to be deliver'd till the Spring. Having likewise sent some of it to a couple of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, sick of the like Malady, I had word brought me; That the one had miss'd his Fits for a Moneth, though in the midst of Winter; and the other was by the first Dose cur'd, and continues so. And divers eminent Physitians, to whom I have commended this Specifick, have us'd it with such suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that one of the severest of them, though he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly despis'd it, confess'd to me, that in a short time he try'd it upon eight or nine several Persons, without finding it to fail in any, though one of them especially, were, before he was call'd, judg'd irrecoverable; the obstinate Quartan being complicated with other almost as dangerous Distempers. And I confess, I somewhat wonder that Men have not the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity to try the efficacy of this powerful Bark, in other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases then Agues: It being highly probable, That a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, capable to prevail so strongly against so obstinate a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, as a Quartan (wherein most commonly divers of the considerabler parts of the Body are much affected) cannot be useless to several other Distempers. I deny not that those that have taken this Powder, have divers of them, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving miss'd six or seven Fits, relapsed into them (as it likewise happen'd to one of the Gentlemen I sent it to) yet (as I have elsewhere told you) it is much, and more then any common Remedy does to stop the Fits so long. Nor is it a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be able to give the Patient so much breathing time, and allow the Physitian the opportunity of imploying other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. And the Relapses we speak of are commonly cur'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56384:108"/>
by the same Powder: And we have known them prevented, when the Medicine hath been administred, not by unskilful Persons, but by a prudent Physitian who knows how to assist it, by opening and gently purging Physick. Wherefore that which I should the most gladly be satisfied of, about this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, is, whether or no it do indeed either proscribe the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick Matter, or so alter its Texture as to make it harmless; or else, whether it doth secretly leave such noxious Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Spleen, Guts, or some other important Part, as may shorten Life, by producing in process of time, either the Scurvy, or the Dropsie, or some other formidable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease. But because the Resolution of this Doubt must be a work of time, we must at present refer it to future Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, And therefore shall now subjoyn, that if the famous <hi>Riverius</hi> have not, in his learned Observations, flatter'd his own <hi>Febrifugum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Riverius in Observat</hi>:</note> whatever be resolv'd touching this <hi>Indian</hi> Bark, there will not want a safe Remedy which may allow Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians to make more cheerful Predictions about the lastingness and event of Quartains, then have hitherto been usual.</p>
                  <p>How painful and stubborn a Disease, the Kings Evil is wont to prove, is scarce more known, then that 'tis seldom cur'd without a tedious course of Physick: And yet, by the Herb mention'd in one of the former Essays, the yong Gentleman there spoken of, was cur'd in a short time, and with little or no pain or trouble. And that these are not the onely Diseases in which Observations, tending to our present purpose, may be made, the following part of this Treatise will afford you opportunity to observe.</p>
                  <p>I might adde, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that I was lately visited by an ancient Chymist, ennobled by divers eminent cures, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to me an Experiment of making very unusual, and yet rational Predictions in some abstruse Diseases, by a peculiar way of examining the Patients Urine. But because some
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56384:109"/>
Chymists have written extravagantly enough upon a like sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and because I have not yet made or seen the Experiment of it my self, I dare not yet give this new method of foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for an instance of the Usefulness of Natural Philosophy to the Semiotical part of Physick. Though I dare not deny but by precipitations, and some other ways not yet vulgarly practiced of examining the Urine, made by the same Patient at several times, before, in, and after some notable alteration in his Body, divers things (especially in Feavors, and other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Diseases) relating to the state of it, may be discover'd, especially if thereto be added a skilful and seasonable Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical <hi>Examen</hi> of the other Excrements, and vitiated Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Patients Body.</p>
                  <p>You will perchance expect, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion I should handle that controversie which is so hotly agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, betwixt the <hi>Paracelsians</hi> and their Adversaries, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the curableness of all Diseases: But, for ought I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the difference betwixt the more sober Men of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is more about Words then Things, and might be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a much less distance, if Men could but calmly consider, That 'tis one thing to dispute, <hi>Whether all Diseases by curable</hi>; and another, <hi>Whether all Persons be recoverable</hi>: For a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease may be call'd incurable, either in its own Nature, or by accident; that is, either because such a Disease is not to be cur'd in any Patient, or that it is so circumstantiated in this or that Patient, as not to be naturally curable in him. Now this distinction, duly consider'd, may conduce much to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the two Opinions, if not the Parties that maintain them: For neither would a sober <hi>Paracelsian</hi> affirm (though <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus</hi> himself doth somewhere seem to do so). That every Disease is curable in every Patient; there being some Palsies, Gouts, or Blindnesses, or the like, so obstinate, that (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lly if they are born with a Man, or inherited from his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents)
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56384:109"/>
the tone of some necessary or considerable part of the Body, being thereby rather abolished, then barely vitiated, it were a folly to promise recovery to such a Patient. And on the other side, a moderate <hi>Galenist,</hi> that is not unacquainted with the Discoveries which these latter Ages have made, of the power of Nature and Art, will not be forward to pronounce (as others do, and as the <hi>Paracelsians</hi> tax the <hi>Galenists</hi> too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discriminately for doing) That the Gout (for instance) the Dropsie, the dead Palsie, the Stone, are Diseases univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally incurable: Since, in the Writings of <hi>Erastus,</hi> and in the Observations of <hi>Schenkius,</hi> and others, there are Instances recorded of some Cures performed of the Dropsie, and one or two more of those stubborn Diseases, even by <hi>Galenical</hi> Remedies.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> though we cannot but disapprove the vain-glorious Boasts of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> himself, and some of his Followers, who, for-all-that, lived no longer then other Men; Yet I think Man-kinde owes something to the Chymists, for having put some Men in hope of doing greater Cures, then have been formerly aspir'd to, or even thought possible, and thereby ingage them to make Tryals and Attempts in order thereunto. For not onely before Men were awaken'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the many Promises, and some great Cures of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noldus de villa nova, Paracelsus, Rulandus, Severinus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> Many Physitians were wont to be too forward, to pronounce Men, troubled with such and such Diseases, incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and rather detract from Nature and Art, then confess that those two could do what ordinary Physick could not. But even now, I fear there are but too many, who though they will not openly affirm, that such and such Diseases are absolutely incurable; yet if a particular Patient, troubled with any of them, be presented, they will be very apt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56384:110"/>
(at least, if not) deride those that shall attempt and hope to Cure him.</p>
                  <p>And I am apt to think, that many a Patient hath been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to die, whose Life might have been saved, if Physitians would have but thought it possible to save it. And therefore I think it were no ill piece of service to Mankinde, if a severe Collection were made of the Cures of such Persons as have recovered after having been judg'd irrecoverable by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: That Men might no longer excuse their own Ignorance by the impotency of Nature, and bear the World in hand, as if the Art of Physick, and their skill, were of the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And the Cures that seem performed by Nature her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self, need not be left out of such a Collection: For still they shew what is possible to be done by Natural means, to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Morbifick matter, or alter its Nature (how dangerous soever it is grown) Or how far the tone of a part or strength of the Body may be vitiated or impaired, and yet be capable of some restitution. And such an observation I receiv'd from our most experienced <hi>Harvy,</hi> when, having consulted him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my weak Eyes, he told me, among other things (as a very remarkable one) that he had once a Patient (whose Name and Profession he told me, but I remember not) that had a confirm'd Cataract in his Eye, and yet upon the use of Physick, to which he could not ascribe so wonderful an effect, that Cataract was perfectly dissipated, and the Eye restored to its wonted Function. Which brings into my minde another Observation, imparted to me, a while since, by that excellent and experienc'd Lithotomist, Mr. <hi>Hollyer.</hi> who told me, that among the many Patients sent to be cured in a great Hospital (of which he is one of the Chirurgions) there was a Maid of about eighteen Years of age, who, without the loss of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had so lost the sense of feeling in the external parts of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56384:110"/>
her Body, that when he had, for tryal sake, pinn'd her Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief to her bare Neck, she went up and down with it so pinn'd, without having any sense of what he had done to her. He added, That this Maid having remained a great while in the Hospital without being cured, Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> out of Curiosity, visited her sometimes; and suspecting her strange Distemper to be chiefly Uterine, and curable onely by <hi>Hymeneal</hi> Exercises, he advised her Parents (who sent her not thither out of poverty) to take her home, and provide her a Husband, by whom, in effect, she was according to his Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostick, and to many Mens wonder, cur'd of that strange Disease. That in acute Sicknesses, Persons given over by the Physitians, may recover, the more judicious, even of those <hi>Galenists,</hi> that are of a dispondent temper, will not deny. For not onely <hi>Celsus</hi> gives us this sober admonition, <hi>Neque igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare aportet in acutis morbis fallaces magis notas esse &amp; s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lutis &amp; mortis</hi>; But even <hi>Hypocrates</hi> himself, who was so skilful in Prognosticks, confesses, that <hi>Morborum acutorum non in totum certae sunt praenunciationes neque salutis neque mortis:</hi> Whence the French have a Proverbial saying, that <hi>Il vaut mieux estre condamné par les Medecins, que par le Prevost des Mareschaux,</hi> as if in English we should say, <hi>It is better to be condemn'd to die by the Doctor, then by the Judge.</hi> And even in Chronical Diseases, where Events are wont much better to answer Physitians Predictions, there are sometimes such Cures performed, as may encourage humane Industry, and keep a sick Mans friends from forsaking the Cure of him, till Life it self have unquestionably forsaken him. For not onely it hath been not unfrequently seen, that divers Persons, who have been given over by some Physitians, have been cur'd by others, perchance rather more lucky then more skilful: But those that have been given over, and that too (sometimes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the believ'd incurableness of the Disease, then the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56384:111"/>
personal Condition of the Patient) even by judicious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Physitians, if such as are acquainted but with the ordinary Remedies, have been recover'd by the use of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily powerful, and especially, Chymical Physick. Of such Cures I have sometimes met with a few, which, because I may elsewhere relate, I shall now onely mention, on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, what I have heard concerning the cures of Cancers, performed by Dr. <hi>Haberfeld,</hi> one of the principal Physitians of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> And among other relations, of this kinde, made me by credible Persons. I cannot omit one, that was, Of a certain English Woman, of sixty and odde Years of age, who had long lain in an Hospital in <hi>Zeeland,</hi> sick of a Cancer in the Brest, and by this Doctor was, with one single inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, perfectly cured in the space of three Weeks. For this relation was made me by persons of very strict veracity; the one a Doctor of Physick, who was an Eye-witness of the Cure; the other a Childe of <hi>Cornelius Drebell</hi>'s, who not onely saw the Cure, but knew the Woman before, and out of Charity brought her to him that heal'd her. The same Persons likewise inform'd me, That the Chymical Liquor the Doctor constantly made use of, does, in the Dose, of about a spoonful or two, work suddenly and nimbly enough by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, but hath very quickly ended its operation, so that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an hour, or less, after the Patient hath taken it, he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly well again, and very hungry. And they having presented me some spoonfuls of this Liquor, I finde the taste to be offensive enough, and not unlike that of Vitriol, which, by the taste and emetick operation, I guess to be, at least, its principal Ingredient, however it be prepared. The same Persons assured me, that having obtain'd of Dr. <hi>Haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld</hi> a good quantity of his Specifick, they had been (in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as well as elsewhere) partly Eye-witnesses, and partly Performers of wonderful Cures by the help of it alone, under

God, in the Kings Evil. Insomuch that an eminent Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of this Nation, now alive and healthy, hath been cured by it, when the Kings Evil had brought his Arm to that pass, that the Chirurgions had appointed a time to cut it off. And with the same Liquor, onely taken inwardly, they profess themselves to have seen and done divers Cures of inveterate external Ulcers, whose proud Flesh, upon the taking of it, is wont to fall off, and then the Ulcer begins to heal at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; but of the recent effects of this Liquor, we may else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, perhaps, further entertain you. That Suffusions or Cataracts, may, by a manual operation, be cured even in a Patient that was born with them, I formerly told you, when I related the Cure done by my Ingenious Acquaintance, Mr. <hi>Stepkins,</hi> on a Gentlewoman of about eighteen Years of age, that brought a couple of Cataracts with her into the World. And I remember I was somewhile since in the company of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Woman, who told me, She was brought to Bed of five Children (if I much mistake not the number) successively; of which, she saw not any in a long while after, by reason of a couple of Suffusions, that had many Years blinded her; and yet now, by the help of a Dutch Oculist of my Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, she sees, and reads well, and hath freely enjoyed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored use of her Eyes for some Years already.</p>

                  <p>I need not tell you what sad Prognosticks Physitians are wont to make of Dropsies, especially of that sort which they call <hi>Ascites</hi>: And indeed the Event does but too frequently justifie their Predictions, when none but ordinary Remedies are employ'd. But I remember, that being acquainted with an Ingenious Person that was very happily cured of a Dropsie, and inquiring who it was that had perform'd the Cure; I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that that, and a multitude of the like had been wrought by a <hi>Germane</hi> Physitian, of whom, and of his Remedy, I had heard much Commendation in <hi>Holland,</hi> where he liv'd: And though on divers occasions I found him a modest Man; and accordingly, when I ask'd him concerning his Cures of the Dropsie, he answered me, That he neither did, nor would undertake to cure so formidable a Disease; yet he scrupled not to tell me, That as far as he had hitherto try'd, he had one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which had not fail'd him, though he had try'd it upon persons of differing Ages, Sexes, and Complections. But of this Specifick more hereafter. For, at present, I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to take notice, that as incurable a Disease as the radicated Gout is thought to be (especially in Patients not very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate) and as tedious a course of Physick as one would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be requisite to the Cure of it, in case it can be cur'd; Yet I have been several times visited by an honest Merchant of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> who was there noted for his Wealth, and his skill in <hi>Arte tinctoriâ</hi>: This Man, ten or twelve Years ago, had been for a long time so tormented with the Gout, both in Hands and Feet, that his Fits would sometimes vex and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine him for a great part of the Year, and not leave him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hard Knots, as unwelcome Pledges of their Return: But once, that he was tortur'd to a degree that made h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56384:112"/>
receiv'd from a great Chymist who had lodg'd in his House, a Secret, with which he had already throughly cur'd many, in a short time: Whereupon sending for this Person, and offering him any thing for some relief; the other refus'd to take above ten Crowns, which, as it seems, was the usual rate for the Cure; and would not receive that neither, till the reality of it had been evinc'd by the Patients continuing above six Moneths well: And accordingly, with a very few Doses of a certain Powder and Tincture, the Merchant was quickly free'd, not onely from his Pains, but from his Gouty <hi>Tophy</hi>: And though he indulge himself the drinking of Rhenish Wine very freely, yet he never had a Fit since, as himself assur'd me one Morning, wherein, for Exercise sake, he walk'd five or six Miles to give me a Visit; adding, That the Man that cur'd him, dying suddenly, never could discover what the Secret was, wherewith so many had been freed from a Disease that does so often mock the skill of the greatest Doctors.</p>
                  <p>I might, perhaps, if I had leisure, relate to you some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strange Stories, which may invite you to think, That as the Naturalists skill in Chymistry, and other Arts retaining to Physiology, may much assist him to discover more generous Remedies then are yet usual; so the Knowledge of such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, may, in divers cases, make a happy Change in the Rules of Prognosticating what will prove the Course and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of a Sickness. But I shall not, at present, particularly consider any more then one Disease, namely, The Stone in the Bladder. For whereas it is by most, even of the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Physitians, unanimously pronounc'd incurable by Physick, in what Person soever, if it deserve the name of a Stone, and be too big to be voided whole, the Remedilesness of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease may be justly question'd. I remember the famous <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardes,</hi> treating of the Seed of a <hi>Peruvian</hi> Plant, which they call <hi>Chalchoos,</hi> tells us, That it is highly esteemed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56384:113"/>
Country Gentleman, whom going to visit last Summer, he saw a Load of <hi>Persicaria,</hi> or <hi>Arsmart,</hi> brought to him by some of the Country People; and desiring to know what he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do with so vast a quantity of it, the Gentleman reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he yearly used as much, having by the Water of it, made by bare distillation in a common Rose-water Still, cured so many of the Stone, even in the Bladder, that he was usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally sollicited by Patients, numerous enough, to exhaust all the Liquor which he yearly prepared.</p>
                  <p>What we, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> have observed concerning this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Liquor, of which we use to prescribe a draught every morning for some Moneths together, we may elsewhere have occasion to relate. But now we shall go on to tell you, that being some Years since in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I met with an ancient Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perick, who was very famous in those parts, for cutting of the Stone of the Bladder, and for curing sore Eyes: This Man having given (in the Parts where I then was, and whilest I was there) some good proof of his skill, I sent for him to me, upon the account of a suspition I long had of the Stone in the Bladder, which, upon search, he assured me I was free from, and so (God be praised) I have afterwards found it. He was more a Traveller then a Scholar, and yet finding him, to my wonder, very modest and sober, I inquired of him, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had never any where met with a Remedy that could dissolve the Stone in the Bladder, offering him much more for a Cure of that kinde, then he would require as a Lithotomist: He answered me, That he could cure no Man of a confirmed Stone, but by the help of his Knife; but if the Stone confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of a lump of Gravel not very firmly cemented together, he had, by a certain inward Remedy he used, and a dexterous way of crushing the Stone from without with his Fingers, so broaken the Stone, partly by crumbling it, and partly by dissolving the Cement, as to make it voidable by Urine. And
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56384:114"/>
he added, That he had formerly cured a Citizen of <hi>Cork,</hi> of a good large Stone of the Bladder (for where I then was, he gave proof of his skill, in telling before-hand those he was to cut, the bigness and shape of the Stones that troubled them.)</p>
                  <p>Passing afterwards by <hi>Cork,</hi> I sent an intelligent Servant to inquire after this Citizen, but he being casually absent, his Wife sent me, by my Man, a Relation very agreeable to that which he had made me: The Receipt I purchased of him, and, though it seem not very artificial, yet I suppose you will not quarrel with me for annexing so experienc'd a one, to the end of this Essay. But because this Remedy needed the assistance of a manual operation, We shall further proceed to tell you, That <hi>Cardan,</hi>

                  <p>I insist not on the Testimony that the same <hi>Helmont</hi> gives to <hi>Paracelsus</hi> of his curing the Stone, though he often handle him very severely in other places of his Writings, because that the Epitaph of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> (out of which he labors to prove his having cured the Stone) makes no express mention of it. Nor shall I enumerate those Passages from whence the same <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Followers collect, That he himself was able to cure that Disease, by the resolution of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> his <hi>Ludus</hi>; but this experience hath evinc'd to me, that a much slighter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of that Stone, then was mention'd by <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> hath been able to do more in that Disease then a wary
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56384:114"/>
Man would readily believe. But to detain you no longer on this subject, I shall onely adde, That <hi>Wilhelmus Laurember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> a learned Physitian, and Professor at <hi>Rostoch,</hi> hath told the World how he cured himself of a confirm'd Stone of the Bladder, by the use of prepared <hi>Millepedes</hi> (by some in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish call'd <hi>Woodlice</hi>) and other Remedies, which he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly recorded in the History which he hath publish'd, and I have seen of this admirable Cure: which having been epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized by <hi>Sennertus,</hi> and other eminent Physitians, I shall not need to insist on it. And the Arguments alledged (even by the most Judicious) against the curableness of the Stone, though very plausible, seem not to me unanswerable; for whereas first, they appeal to the innumerable fruitless at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that have been made to cure great Princes, and rich Men, without cutting, that Argument drawn from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, may, by the former Experiments, be answered; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since <hi>Horatius Augenius</hi> (upon whose account <hi>Laurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergius</hi> tryed <hi>Millepedes)</hi> tells us, not onely that he cured a young Man at <hi>Rome,</hi> that was going to be cut for the Stone, but that the Jesuite that chanced to confess this Youth, and perswaded him to the use of <hi>Millepedes,</hi> had experimented their efficacy both upon himself and others: And indeed, we our selves have found them to be highly Diuretick and Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritive.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is next objected, That Medicines must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily loose their efficacy before they can reach the Bladder, I confess, that for the most part, it is very true: But yet that it is possible for some Medicines to retain their Nature, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many alterations and digestions we have elsewhere declared. And in our present Case, we not onely finde that Turpentine and Asparagus, do manifestly affect the Urine (as I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten observed in my own, and almost any Man may observe it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56384:115"/>
in his) But that which is most to our purpose, <hi>Rubarb</hi> tinges the Urine of those that have taken any quantity of it. And lastly, whereas it may be yet further alledged, That not only there hath not been yet a Liquor found capable of dissolving so solid a Body as a Stone; but if there were, it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be so corrosive as to destroy the Patient, by fretting his Stomach, or Guts, or Bladder, which are parts so much more tender. To the first part of this plausible Objection it may be replyed, That even good Viniger will dissolve, not onely those stony Concretions, call'd <hi>Lapides Cancrorum,</hi> which, like the <hi>Calculi</hi> we treat of, are formed in the Bodies of Animals; but even the more hard and solid Body of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which will loose but little of its weight, in a Fire that would waste a great part of the <hi>Duelech</hi>: And that the bare Juices of Vegetables (such as Lemmons and Barberies) will readily dissolve both Pearl and Coral, is known even to the Apothecaries Boys. Indeed what <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of their <hi>Alkahest,</hi> with which they prepare their Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick against the Stone, and with which the later of them, if not both, pretend to be able to reduce, not onely the Stone they call <hi>Ludus,</hi> but all other Stones, Vegetables, Minerals, Animals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into insipid Water, is so strange (not to say incredible) that their Followers must pardon me, if I be not forward to believe such unlikely things, till sufficient experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath convinced me of their truth.</p>
                  <p>But yet I must not conceal from you, That a Chymist, whom you have often seen, advised with me several times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the way of preparing this immortal Liquor (as <hi>Helmont</hi> calls it) and that, when we had agreed that such a way was the most promising, he prosecuted it so long, and so industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, that at length he obtain'd, and shew'd me a Liquor, which (though it seemed to me far short of the <hi>Alkahest)</hi> I confess I
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56384:115"/>
admired; and not I alone, but our Ingenious Friend Dr. <hi>C.</hi> (who had been imployed into several parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> by a rich and curious Prince, to purchase Rarities) agreed with this Chymist, to give Two hundred Crowns for a Pint of this <hi>Menstruum</hi>; and confessed to me withal, That he saw him, with this Liquor, not onely dissolve common <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and bring it over the Helm, but reduce Antimony into sweet Chrystals; with a few of which it was, that he (I mean Dr. <hi>C.</hi>) to the wonder of many, did, without Purge or Vomit, cure our good Friend Sir <hi>C. C.</hi> of a very radicated and desperate Disease, as the restored Patient soon after told me. And to the second part of this Objection it may be answered, That if we knew and considered well, how many of the operations of Natural Bodies depend upon the suitableness and difference of the Figures of their Parts, and the Pores intercepted between them, the number of impossibilities would not, perhaps, be thought so great, as by many Learned Men it is.</p>
                  <p>That it is very possible for a Body to have an effect upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other determinate Body, without being able to operate, in like manner, upon a multitude of other Bodies, which may seem more easie to be wrought on by it; may appear by the Load-stone, which will draw and work onely upon Iron, and (which is but refined Iron) Steel, but not upon wood or straws, or any of those innumerable Concrets that are lighter, and of a more open texture then the heavy and solid Body which it attracts. And to give you an instance that comes nearer to our case, Quick-silver, that will not corrode our skin, nor so much as taste sharp upon our tongue, will yet readily dissolve that most compact Body of Gold, which even <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> that can insinuate it self into all other Mettals, and corrode them, will not meddle with; though the same Quick-silver will not dissolve Iron, which yet <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> will very nimbly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56384:116"/>
fret asunder. So that although I dare not confidently believe all that I have found averr'd even by eminent and learned Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, of their having made or seen Liquors, which, without appearing any way sharp to the Tongue, would dissolve Gold and Silver, and other hard compact Bodies; because I have not yet, my self, seen any severe and satisfactory tryal made to evince the efficacy of insipid Dissolvents: yet, by reason of divers things I have read and heard, and of some things too I have seen, I dare not peremptorily deny the possibility of such <hi>Menstruums.</hi> And who knows, but that in Nature there may be found, or by Art there may be prepared, some Liquor, whose parts may have such a sutableness to the Pores of a humane <hi>Calculus,</hi> as those of Quick-silver have to the Pores of Gold, and yet may as little work upon the rest of the Body, as we have observed the same Quick-silver to do upon Iron (which yet is a much more porous and open Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal) even when it hath been distill'd in Iron Vessels? And as to that part of the Objection wherein the strength of it chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lies, let me tell you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that I have sometimes, for curiosity sake, taken an Egge, and steep'd it in strong Vineger for some days, and by taking it out, and shewing that the shell was so eaten away, that the Egge could be squeez'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unusual Forms, but the thin skin that involves the white continu'd altogether unfretted, I convinc'd an Ingenious Man, that the operations of Dissolvents are so determin'd by the various textures of the Bodies on which they are imploy'd, that a Liquor, which is capable to corrode a more hard and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Body, may be unable to fret in the least, an other more soft and thin, if of a texture indispos'd to admit the small parts of the <hi>Menstruum.</hi> And I must confess to you, <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> That one thing, among others, which hath made me backward to affirm with many Learned Men, that there can be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56384:116"/>
no potent Dissolvent that is not corrosive enough to fret in pieces the parts of a humane Body, hath been a Story, which I divers years since chanch'd to meet with in the Learned <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi>'s <hi>Paralipomena,</hi> where, though he relates it to another purpose, yet it is so pertinent to our present design, and in it self so singular, not to say matchless, that I cannot forbear to mention it here on this occasion. He tells us then, That in the end of the Year, 1632. <hi>Johannes Nesterus,</hi>

And not long agoe there was here in <hi>England</hi> a private Souldier (who, for ought I know, is yet alive) very famous for digesting of Stones: And a very inquisitive Man, that gave me the accuratest account I have met with concerning him, assures me, That he knew him familiarly, and had the curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to keep in his company for 24 hours together to watch him, and not onely observ'd that he eat nothing in that time, save Stones (or Fragments of them) of a pretty bigness, but that his grosser Excrement consisted chiefly of a sandy Substance, as if the devour'd Stones had been in his Body dissolved and crumbled into Sand.

And since one Liquor, prepar'd by Nature one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, could in this Mans Stomack dissolve that great variety of Bodies above enumerated, why should it be thought that the Alkahest, or some other <hi>Menstruum</hi> wherein Nature is skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully assisted, and to the utmost highten'd by Art, should not be able to dissolve Concretes of very differing Textures. For though Chymists must acknowledge that such common <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struums</hi> as will dissolve one Body, will not oftentimes meddle with another; as <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> will dissolve Silver, and not Gold, and if by <hi>Salarmoniack</hi> you turn it into <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> it will indeed dissolve Gold, but then it will not Silver: Yet since that may be suppos'd to proceed rather from our want of skill to prepare the most potent <hi>Menstruum,</hi> then from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of one <hi>Menstruums</hi> dissolving great variety of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; Why may not Nature and Art afford a <hi>Menstruum,</hi> whose variety of Parts, and Figures, and (perhaps also) Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may give it ingress into Bodies of very differing Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? as in our former Instance, though <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> will dissolve Gold, not Silver; and <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> Silver, but not Gold; yet Quick-silver will dissolve both, and Copper, Tin, and Lead to boot.</p>
                  <p>If I were not at present under some restraint, I might tell you, some things, that you would, perhaps, think no weak Confirmations of the past Discourse: And however, since I
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56384:118"/>
have observ'd it to be the main thing, that keeps judicious Men from seeking, or so much as hoping for nobler Dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, that they are scarce to be perswaded there can be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably piercing <hi>Menstruums,</hi> that are not proportionably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosive: I will here acquaint you with a Liquor, that may, I presume, assist you to undeceive some of them. We take then ordinary houshold brown Bread (I like that of Rye, but I have divers times us'd that of Wheat) and when it is cut into slices, and somewhat dry'd, we almost fill a glass Retort with it, and placing that in a sand Furnace, by degrees of Fire, we draw off what will be made to come over, without much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The Oyl, as useless to our purpose, being by a Tunnel, or a Filter, sever'd from the rest of the Liquor, we also, by a gentle heat, free the Spirit from some of its Phlegm, which yet sometimes we finde no great necessity to do. And yet this Spirit, which you will easily believe is no such Corrosive as <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or other distill'd Liquors of Mineral Salts, will work upon the hardest sorts of Bodies, and perform things that Chymists counted of the judiciousest, would not have us expect from the most sharp and corrosive <hi>Menstruums</hi> now in use. For with this we have, in a short time, and that in the cold, drawn Tinctures (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is done by the solution of the finer parts of the Concrete) not only from crude Corals, and some of the more open Minerals, but likewise from very hard Stones, such as Blood stone, and Granates (even unpowder'd) Nay, and though Ruby's seem to be the hardest Bodies yet known, save Diamonds (for I have learned from those that cut preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones, that they can grinde other Gems with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Rubies, but not these with any Powder, save their own, and that of Diamonds) yet have, even these, afforded me in the cold, a not ignoble Tincture. And not to anticipate what I may elsewhere have occasion to tell you concerning
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56384:118"/>
the efficacy of this <hi>Menstruum,</hi> which is the same that I have intimated, without naming it, in the last, and another of the former Essays. I shall now onely adde, That an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Chymist assures me, he hath, but tells me not how, done greater matters with it, or the like; and that to satisfie my self that these high Tinctures, proceeded not from the standing or digestion of the <hi>Menstruum</hi> (as we elsewhere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve concerning some other Liquors) I not onely tryed, that from some Minerals it will draw a much higher Tincture then from others, and from some scarce any at all, but that it would, if kept by it self, for many Moneths continue clear and limpid. What further use I have made, or think others may make of this odde <hi>Menstruum,</hi> I must not, as I said at present, express; but returning to what I was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing concerning the cure of the Stone, annex, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what hath been objected against the possibility of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Liquor, which, without being highly corrosive, can be able to work upon Stone; It may indeed be also alledg'd against the hopes we seem to countenance, that what hath cured the Stone in one Mans Bladder, may be unable to do the like in anothers: But first, the truth of that hath not been proved; and next, we highly value those Specificks that can remove Agues, Fluxes, and the like Diseases, though scarce any of them do alike succeed in all Patients, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally so as to secure them, during their whole lives, from ever relapsing into the like Disease; and besides all this, it will be no small matter to finde that the Disease, in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not incurable; and it would recompence Mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry to be able to free, even a few Patients, from so pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and stubborn a Disease. Which I have rather then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, chosen to insist upon, because it is so generally believed not to be curable by inward Remedies in any Person what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:56384:119"/>But I have entertained you so long on this subject, that I must reserve, for some other opportunity, what I have to say to you concerning the Dropsie, and some other Diseases, commonly put into the Catalogue of the incurable ones, and therefore shall now onely tell you in general, That as on the one side I think the Arguments which <hi>Helmont</hi> and others draw from the Providence of God, for the curableness of all Diseases are not very cogent, and somewhat irreverent (For God being not oblig'd any more to continue Life or Health to sinful Man then to Beasts that never offended Him, we ought humbly to thank Him, if He hath, among His Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, dispers'd Remedies for every Disease, but hath no right to accuse Him if He have not) so on the other side, I am not much convinc'd by the grand Argument alleadg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> and the Chymists, that hold all Diseases to be in their own Nature curable; namely, That they themselves, many of them (no nor even their very Master) lived not to the Age attain'd by many Strangers to Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry.</p>
                  <p>For this, That many of them (not destroy'd by War, or outward accidents) died young enough, and consequently by Sickness; and that <hi>Paracelsus</hi> himself out-liv'd not the 47<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of his age, is a much stronger Objection against the Men, then against their Opinion; for it infers indeed plausibly, that they had not such Remedies as they boasted of (since probably, had they had any such, they would have cured themselves with them) but concludes not that no such Remedies can be prepar'd by any other. And this you will be the less apt to think irrational, if you consider, how much more learned, sober and experienc'd, it is possible for many a Man to be, then <hi>Paracelsus</hi> appears to have been: For he seems not by his Writings to have been any great Logician
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56384:119"/>
or Reasoner; he manifestly despis'd many parts of Learning, useful to a Physitian; he lived not many Years, and spent divers of those few which he lived, in an unsetled and disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious course of life; and yet this <hi>Paracelsus</hi> attain'd to some such Remedies, as both in his own, and after times, have made him a very considerable Person, in spight of all his indiscretions and deficiencies. And among his other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, his famous <hi>Laudanum</hi> did such wonders, that <hi>Opo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> himself, in that short account, which seems to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Satyr then a Narrative of his Life, hath this Passage of it: <hi>De Laudano</hi> (saith he) <hi>suo (ita vocabat pilulas instar murium stercoris, quas impari semper numero, in extrema tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum morborum difficultate, tanquam sacram medicinam exhibebat) ita gloriebatur, ut non dubitarit affirmare ejus soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us usu se è mortuis vivos reddere posse; idque aliquoties dum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud ipsum fui, re ipsa declaravit.</hi> So signal a Testimony coming from one whom the <hi>Paracelsians</hi> call his fugitive Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, hired by his Enemies to slander him, under pretence of writing his Life, deserves not to be slighted: and though it manifestly contains an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> yet I do the less wonder at the <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> by reason of those strange things which your Mother, and divers other of your Friends, can tell you, they have seen performed in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Helmont</hi>'s <hi>Laudanum opiatum</hi> (though much inferior to that of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus.</hi>) And I remember, that a Friend of yours and mine, that is a great enemy to all kindes of Chymical Remedies, and was before also to Chymistry, having begg'd of me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bottle of it, which I had obtain'd from a Friend of the younger <hi>Helmont</hi>'s, to whom he communicated the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gave me awhile after, an account of such Cures that had been perform'd, with that small quantity, upon almost dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Persons, as I think it not discreet for me, that was not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56384:120"/>
an Eye-witness of them, to relate. And I remember too, that the same Friend of young <hi>Helmont</hi>'s, being, at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of one Woman whom he had cured of a dangerous Consumption, call'd to another that was thought to be dying of an <hi>Asthma,</hi> came to advise with me whither he should meddle with so desperate a Patient; telling me, That she had been many Years sick of that stubborn Disease, which, in process of time, passing into an <hi>Orthopnea,</hi> had at last put her, by want of sleep (from which the violence of her sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had very long kept her) into a Feaver, and so desperate a condition, that it was scarce expected she should live till the next morning. But I, representing to him that her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being avowedly desperate, he might exercise his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without danger to his Reputation; and perswading him to try <hi>Helmont</hi>'s <hi>Laudanum,</hi> together with the Spirit of Man's Blood (which we elsewhere teach you to prepare) he gave her that Night a Dose of those Remedies, which made her both sleep and breath pretty freely; and a Week after, he coming to visit me, told me, he had casually met his Patient well and abroad in the Streets.<note place="margin">

And to these, <hi>Pyr</hi>: he adds some other Narratives, which, though I confess I know not well how to believe, yet there are Circumstances which keep me from daring to reject them: For first, as he well observes, that which was most stupendous in this Remedy, was but the smalness of the quantity. Next, a Gentleman in <hi>France,</hi> being not long since reported to have a fragment of this Stone, and to have cured several Persons (and especially one very dignified) of inveterate Diseases, by leting them lick it; my Noble Friend Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> then in <hi>France,</hi> was solemnly requested from hence to inquire into the truth of that Report, and answered, That he could not, upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, finde it other then true. Besides, <hi>Helmont</hi> not onely relates these Cures as an Eye-witness of them, but tells us, how upon an occasion that he mentions, he once suspected the efficacy of the Oyl, and that, without expecting that it should do any thing, he anointed it on the right arm and the ancles of his own Wife, who had for some Moneths been torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great pains in the former, and very great tumors in the latter of those parts; and that almost in a trice, motion was restored to her arm, and all the <hi>oedema</hi> of her legs and feet vanished; adding, That at the time of his writing she liv'd healthfully, and had done so since that recovery, during nineteen Years: And this Story, she, long after her Husband<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

death, confirm'd to our ingenious Friend Dr. <hi>C.</hi> who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, and much extolls her: These Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, may be assisted by two more very considerable ones; the one is, That <hi>Helmont</hi> is the more to be credited in these Relations, because mentioning Cures not perform'd by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but by another, and that by Remedies unknown to him, he seems by these Narrations, out of loyalty to truth, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse his own Reputation: And the other is, that in a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Story which we may elsewhere relate to you (it being not here proper to insert so long a one) you'l finde an eminent and strange testimony given to <hi>Butler</hi>'s Secrets, by our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Country man, Dr. <hi>Higgins,</hi> whose confession you will not doubt, if you consider how rare a Physitian and Chymist he was, how familiarly he lived in the same House with <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>; and how studiously, at last, they endeavored to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way each others Life.</p>
                  <p>But whatever be to be thought, <hi>Pyr</hi>: of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we may well enough make this reflection on the other things that have been delivered concerning formidable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, that since the power of Nature and Skill may reach much farther then many distrustful (not to say lazy) men have imagin'd, it will not be charitable to rely too much upon the Prognosticks, even of famous Writers, when they tell us, That such and such Diseases, or Patients in such and such conditions cannot possibly be cured.

                  <p>How much preparation may do to correct and meliorate both hard and liquid Aliments, is notably instanced by the account that we receive from both the French and English that inhabit the <hi>Barbados, St. Christophers,</hi> and other <hi>Caraibes</hi>

And though I shall not too resolutely affirm it, to be a Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son properly so called; yet in confirmation of its being very noxious, I shall tell you, That having purposely enquired of a very intelligent Gentleman, who commanded an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Europeans</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> what experience he had seen of the qualities of this Plant, he told me, That between thirty and forty of his Soldiers, having on a time (whil'st they were unacquainted with the Countrey) either through ignorance or curiosity, eaten of it unprepared, it cost most of them their Lives. And yet this pernicious Root, which some Herbarists call <hi>Yucca,</hi> by the rude <hi>Indians</hi> ordering, comes to afford them both almost all their Bread, and no small part of their Drink: For this Root being grated, and carefully freed from its moisture, by being included in Bags, and very strongly pressed till all the Juice be squeezed out; it is afterwards dryed in the Sun, and so made into the Meal of which they make their Bread: And this very Root, though (as we said) it be poisonous, they cause their old, and almost toothless Women, for the better breaking and macerating it,<note place="margin">History of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>'s, pag. 29, 30, 31, 32.</note> to chew and spit out into Water. This Juice will, in a few hours, work and purge it self of the poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quality, affording them a Drink which they esteem very wholsome, and at the <hi>Barbado</hi>'s call <hi>Perino,</hi> and account it to be the likest in taste to our English Beer, of any of those many Drinks that are used in that Island.</p>
                  <p>This nasty way of preparing Drink, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> may seem strange to you, as it did to me when I first heard of it;

but besides the consenting relations both of French and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish concerning it, it may be confirmed by the strange asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Gulielmus Piso,</hi> in his new and curious <hi>Medicina Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siliensis,</hi> where, having spoken of several of the <hi>Brasilian</hi> Wines, he tells us, That they make Liquors of several Plants, besides the Root of <hi>Mandioca,</hi> after the same nasty manner. <hi>Idem fit</hi> (saith he) <hi>ex Mandioca, Patata, Milio,</hi>

                  <p>We have here in <hi>England,</hi> at the House of our experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Mint-master, Dr <hi>Gordon,</hi> tasted a Wine, which he made of that sort of Cherrys which are commonly call'd <hi>Morellos,</hi> that was, when we drank of it, about a Year and a half old, but it was somewhat sower, and needed Suger; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall rather take notice to you of my having since drunk Wine made of the Juice of good, but not of extraordinary Kentish Cherrys, which, with the help of a <hi>Tantillum</hi> of Suger added in the Fermentation, kept so well; that though

it were above a Year old when I tasted it, I found it a strong and pleasant Wine, not inferior to many Wines that are brought us from foreign parts.

                  <p>And in <hi>Brasil</hi> they likewise, as the same Author informs us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</note> make a Wine (unknown to most other Regions of the World) of the Fruit of <hi>Acaju,</hi> which yet, upon his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he much commends; telling us, That it is strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to inebriate, and may, he doubts not, be kept good many Years; and that though it be astringent, yet both in himself and others he found it diuretical.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Barbada</hi>'s they have many Drinks unknown to us; such as are <hi>Perino,</hi> the Plantane-drink, <hi>Grippo, Punch,</hi> and the rare Wine of Pines, by some commended more then the Poets do their Nectar; some of which we therefore make not, because the Vegetables whereof they are produc'd, grow not in these colder Climats: But others also they have, which we have not, though they are made of Plants to be met with in our Soil; as for instance, the drink they call <hi>Mobbie,</hi> made of <hi>Potato</hi>'s fermented with Water, which, being fit to drink in a very few days, and easie to make as strong almost as the maker pleaseth, would be of excellent use, if it were but as wholsome as it is accounted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56384:124"/>
Raisons, after a manner, which (when we shall elsewhere acquaint you with it) you will easily discern to be capable of much improvement from the knowledge of Fermentation. And indeed, by the bare fermenting of Raisons and Water in a due proportion, without the help of Barm, Leaven, Tartar, or other additament to set them a working, we have divers times, in a few days, prepar'd a good Vinous Liquor, which having for tryals sake distilled, it afforded us greater store, then we expected, of inflammable Spirit, like that of other Wine.</p>
                  <p>But I have sometimes wondered, that Men had no more curiosity to try what Drinks may be made of the Juices ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, by wounding or cutting off the parts of several Trees, and some other Vegetables: For that in the <hi>East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> their <hi>Sura</hi> is made of the Liquor dropping from their wounded <hi>Coco</hi> Trees, we have not long since out of <hi>Linscoten</hi> informed you.

                  <p>And that even in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Alimental Liquor, drawn by Trees from the Earth, may receive great alterations from them before it be quite assimulated by them, may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the practice of the <hi>Calabrians</hi> and <hi>Apulians</hi>; who, betwixt <hi>March</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> do by Incisions obtain from the common Ash Tree, and the <hi>Ornus</hi> (which many Botanists would have to be but a wilde Ash) a sweet Juice, so like to the Manna, adhearing in that Season to the Leaves of those kinde of Trees, that the Natives call it in their Language, <hi>Manna del corpo,</hi> or <hi>Trunk-manna</hi>; and least we should think they draw all this sweetness from the Soil of that particular part of <hi>Italy</hi> where they grow, you may be satisfied by the

                  <p>I had communicated to me, as a rarity, a secret of the King of <hi>Polands,</hi> which is said to do wonders in many Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, and consists onely in the use of the Liquor which drops about the beginning of the Spring, from the bar'd and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Roots of the Walnut-tree: but because I have not yet made tryal of it my self, I shall pass on to observe to you, that in some Northern Countries, and even in some parts of <hi>England,</hi> bordering upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> the almost insipid Liquor that weeps in <hi>March,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> out of the transversly wounded Branches (not Trunks) of the Birch-tree, is wont to be used by Persons of Quality as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative from the Stone; against which cruel Disease, <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> highly extols a Drink made of this Liquor and <hi>semen dauci,</hi> and <hi>Beccabunga,</hi> and I think not without cause. For not to mention all the commendations that have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me of it by some that use it, I have seen <hi>such</hi> strange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, frequently given among others, to a Kins-man of mine, to whom hardly any other Remedy (though he tryed a scarce imaginable variety) was able to give ease (and in whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sected Bladder, after another Disease had kill'd him, a Stone of many Ounces was found) <hi>that</hi> I usually every Spring take care to provide a quantity of this Water, with which alone, without the other Ingredients mentioned by <hi>Helmont,</hi> my Kins-man used to be relieved as long as he could keep it, which you may do the longer, by pouring upon the top of

it a quantity of Sallet Oyl, to defend it from the Air; and perhaps also by Distillation: By which (last named) way, I know an Ingenious Man that is wont to preserve it for his own use, and says, he findes it not thereby impair'd in virtue. But the most effectual way that ever I yet practiced, <hi>Pyrophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> to preserve both this and other Liquors and Juices, is dexterously and <hi>sufficiently</hi> to impregnate them with Fume of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which must be at divers, and <hi>often</hi> times as it were, incorporated with the Liquor by due agitation; the manual Operation belonging to this Experiment, I may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after have occasion to describe more fully, together with the particular Effects of it in several Bodies. And therefore it may here suffice to tell you, that if you practice it carefully, you will, perhaps, think your self oblig'd to thank me for the discovery of it, though a heedful Reader may finde it, not obscurely, hinted in <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Writings.</p>

                  <p>But I suppose you will think it high time for me to proceed to another subject; and indeed I should not have spent so much time in discoursing of Drinks, but that I am apt to think, that if there were greater variety of them made, and if they were more skilfully ordered, they might, by refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirits, and insensibly altering the mass of Blood, prevent and cure (without weakning or much troubling the Patient) almost as many Diseases as the use of our common, unwholesome, and sophisticated Wines is wont to produce.</p>

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:56384:126"/>For in Fermentation, the Sulphurous (as Chymists call them) the Active, and the Spirituous parts of Vegetables, are much better loosened, and more intirely separated from the grosser and clogging parts, in most Mixts, then they are by the vulgar ways of Distillation, wherein the Concrete is not open'd by previous Fermentation. And these nobler parts being incorporated with our Aliments, are with them received freely, and without resistance carryed into the mass of the Blood, and therewith, by circulation, conveyed to the whole Body where their Operation is requisite. And I remember, that discoursing one day with an eminently learned and experienced Physitian, of the Antinephritical virtue of our common wilde Carret-seed, fermented in small Ale; he smilingly told me, that he found its efficacy but too great: For having prescrib'd it to some of his rich Patients, who were wont frequently to have recourse to him in their Nephritical distempers, after the use of this drink for a pretty while, he seldom heard of them any more. And for your encouragement, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to make tryals of this nature, we will adde, That though the Seed it self be not over-well tasted, yet being fermented in a due proportion with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor (we used an Ounce and half of the Seed, to a Gallon of the Ale) the Drink compos'd of both tasted pleasantly, almost like Lemmon beer.</p>
                  <p>And that you may the less wonder at the efficacy of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Liquors, it is worth considering, what virtue is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the bare decoction of that Herb, which the <hi>French</hi> and we call <hi>Thé,</hi> or <hi>Té,</hi> which is much magnified here; and as far as my little experience in my self, and others (of which more hereafter) reaches, not altogether without cause: But among the <hi>Chineses</hi> and the <hi>Japonians,</hi> it is the common Drink of Persons of Quality, by whom it is so highly prais'd,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56384:126"/>
that the experienced <hi>Tulpius,</hi>

                     </note> in the new Edition of his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, tells us, That one pound of the Japonical <hi>T'chia</hi> (as the Natives call it) is not unfrequently sold for one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds of Silver; which is not to be wondred at, if they justly ascribe to it, that in those Countrys Men are not subject to the Stone, or the Gout, and if but one half of the Virtues he there attributes to it, be for the most part to be found in it.</p>
                  <p>I might, when I told you of the variety of Materials not used among us, have added one strange Drink, which a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, that a while since lived at in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> told me, he saw much used thereabouts: They make it of the raw Flesh of Goats, Capons, and the like, which, together with Rice and <hi>Molossos</hi> (or black course Suger) they put into a quantity of Water, and distil it in an Alim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick till the Liquor be stronger then Brandy (as they call common weak Spirit of Wine or of Lees of Vinous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors) And this <hi>Rack</hi> (as the extravagant Liquor is call'd) is often drunk in hot weather, and found very comfortable: those that use it, prizing it much, as supposing it draws a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive and cherishing virtue from the Flesh; as indeed, if any quantity of the nobler parts of that, do concur to the constituting of the Liquor, it may probably be, at least to divers Bodies, very wholsome in that Country, where they finde strong Drinks necessary to recruit their Spirits, exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the excessive heat of the Climate. As I remember, the experienced <hi>Bontius,</hi> in his <hi>Medicina Indorum,</hi> tells us, That the Merchants travelling through the scorching Deserts of <hi>Arabia, Persia,</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi>

                  <p>And of the great use, if not necessity of either Brandy,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56384:127"/>
or such other strong and Spirituous Drinks in the hot Climats of the <hi>Indies,</hi> divers intelligent Persons of our own Country, have, upon their own experience, sufficiently satisfied us.</p>
                  <p>Nor, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> is Natural Philosophy able onely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our Drinks, but the rest of our Aliments also: For not to mention, that Experience hath assur'd us, that by skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully contriv'd Ovens (wherein the heat plays every way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Bread, without yet suffering any of the smoke or steams of the Fire to come at it, and wherein what degree of heat you please may be continu'd from first to last) better Bread may be bak'd, then in our common Ovens, where the Bread rests upon the Harth, and the heat is continually decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Not to mention this, I say, Physiologie can inable us to confer a very grateful taste on very many of the things we eat, barely by a skilful and moderate untying and exciting the formerly clogg'd Spirits, and other sapid parts contain'd in them. It can teach us to make better Bread then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eaten: And by discovering to us a better Art of Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then <hi>Apitius</hi> and his Successors have left us, and by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting innocently sapid things, instead of those unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some ones, their deliciousness endears to Men; It can teach us to gratifie Mens Palates, without offending their healths: &amp; in preserving of fresh Meats, Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beyond their wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed seasons of duration, the Naturalists skill may perform much more then you will readily believe.</p>
                  <p>And yet to incline you not to be too diffident in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, let me inform you, That much hath been already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, as to the preservation of Aliments, even by those that have not troubled themselves to make Philosophical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after the Causes and Remedies of Putrefaction in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but onely have been taught by obvious and daily Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, that the Air doth much contribute to the corruption
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56384:127"/>
of some Bodies, and the exclusion of Air to the hindring it. I remember, the inquisitive and learned Mr. <hi>Borreel,</hi> assur'd me some while since, That he had in his Country, <hi>Holland,</hi> eaten Bisket that was yet good, after it had been carryed from <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> and brought back thence again (in which Voyage, between two and three Years are wont to be spent) And to confirm my conjecture of the way of preserving this Bread so long: He told me, that the curious Merchant whose it was, used no other Art, then the stowing his Bisket, well baked, in Casks exactly calk'd; and besides, carefully lin'd with Tin, for the more perfect exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Air. Adding, That to the same end the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets were so placed, as to leave as little room as possibly might be in the Cask, which also was not opened, but in case of absolute necessity, and then presently and carefully closed again.</p>
                  <p>I may elsewhere tell you of an eminent Naturalist, a Friend of yours and mine, that hath a strange way of preserving Fruits, whereby even <hi>Goof-berries</hi> have been kept for many Moneths, without the addition of Sugar, Salt, or other tangible Bodies; but all that I dare yet tell you, is, That he assures me his Secret consists in a new and artificial way of keeping them from the Air.</p>
                  <p>But it seems more difficult, as well as more useful, to be able to preserve Meat long without Salt; for 'tis sufficiently known to Navigators, how frequently, in long Voyages, the Scurvy, and other Diseases, are contracted by the want of fresh Meat, and the necessity of feeding constantly upon none but strongly poudred Flesh, or salted Fish; and therefore, he is much to be commended that hath first devised the way to keep Flesh sweet, without the help of those freeting Salts Men are wont to use to make it keep. This way is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56384:128"/>
known to some ingenious Persons in <hi>London</hi>: One of the most noted of whom, upon my conjecturing how it may be perform'd, confess'd to me, that I had hit upon the way in general: But the most satisfactory account I could get of it, was from an English Man, that lately practised Physick in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> who, finding I was no stranger to what I asked him about, told me freely, that he had seen both Goats-flesh, and Hens, so well preserved by this way, that though it were put up in the <hi>East Indies</hi> awhile before he came thence, yet he eat of it, and found it good and wholsome, between the Islands of <hi>Cape Verd</hi> (as the Sea-men call them) and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; so that this Meat-continued sweet above six Moneths, notwithstanding the heat and closeness of the Ship, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive heat they met with in their Passage under the Line, and consequently through the Torrid Zone: and that the way was onely this, That the Meat being well roasted, and cut in pieces, was carefully and conveniently ranged in a very close Cask, into which, afterwards, there was poured as much Butter melted, skimmed, and decanted from the grosser and ranker Parts, as would fill up all the intervals left between the several pieces of Flesh, and swim about them all, and thereby keep out the Air from approaching them; and then the Cask, being exactly closed, was stow'd up in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place in the Ship, and kept unopen'd till the Meat was to be eaten. And it must not be omitted, that the Relator, and others that had the care of making Provision for the Voyage, were fain, instead of Butter made of Cows Milk (which could not be had where they took in their Lading) to make use of that made of Goats, or Ews Milk, which is not (as the <hi>Indians</hi> make it) so good, and to whose rankness he ascribed that which he had observed in some of the Meat bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in it, which he thought might have been preserved <hi>longer,</hi>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56384:128"/>
and <hi>better tasted</hi> (for <hi>wholsome</hi> and <hi>incorrupt</hi> he said it was) in our <hi>European</hi> Butter, whose power to preserve Meat bury'd in it, after due Coction, hath been confirmed to me upon their own observation, by an experienc'd Officer of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Fleet, that had the over-sight of the Provisions, and by others that had opportunity to observe it.</p>
                  <p>But how much the Naturalists skill may advance the Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetical part of Physick, by enabling Men to make Aliments much lastinger then naturally they are, I must not here la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to convince you by other instances, that I may not anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate what we have elsewhere to acquaint you with, from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Experiments, and our own, about the conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bodies. Onely I shall at present tell you in general, That I hope there will be ways found out to preserve even raw Flesh it self (for of the keeping of roasted, we have just now given you an instance) with things that do not so much fret it, nor give it so corrosive a quality, when eaten, as our common Salt doth. For not to mention what several curious Persons have practised, of salting Neats Tongues with Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, which though done onely to make them look red, shews that a Body, not corrosive like common Salt, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Flesh: I have, for tryal sake, kept an entire Puppy of pretty bigness, untainted for many Weeks (and that in the midst of Summer) and that without slaying, drying (by Fire or otherwise) or so much as exenterating him, or cleansing him, or doing any thing towards the preserving of him, save the keeping him immersed in a well stopt Vessel, under Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine (from whose taste, I presume, Meat may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily freed by Water) and there seemed small cause to doubt, that the onely thing that hindred me from keeping him much longer, was the want of time to pursue the Experiment, and take notice of its success: For I remember, I have the same
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56384:129"/>
way kept a soft Substance, taken raw from an Ox or Cow, for many Moneths (if I mistake not, eighteen or twenty) and found no putrefaction or ill sent in the immersed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which, for ought I know, might have been preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved divers Years together the same way, or at least, by an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie improvement of this method, of which, as I lately inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, I intend you hereafter an account.</p>
                  <p>And I shall further adde on this occasion, That if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon <hi>Suger,</hi> which is (at least in these Western Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) but an almost recent discovery, and consider how many Bodies are with it, by Confectioners and others, not onely preserv'd, but rendred exceeding grateful to the taste; that single instance may suffice to make us think it probable, that expedients yet unthought of, may, by an insight into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be found out, for the preservation of Bodies; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if our ingenious Friend, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would shew us, how out of divers other Concreats, besides the Suger Cane, a Substance not unlike Suger (though of different taste, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the Vegetable that affords it) may, by a peculiar industry, be prepar'd: which, that you may not think unfeazable, let me mention to you (for perhaps he hath not yet taken notice of it) what even <hi>Indians</hi> have done of this nature. And first, let me inform you of what we are told by <hi>Linschoten</hi>

And he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56384:130"/>
farther added, That both he and others, had, in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> made such a Syrrup with the Juice of Water Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons.</p>
                  <p>Nor, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> is it onely by teaching Men to improve the wholesomness and tasts of the Aliments, or to keep them long uncorrupted, that the Naturalist may contribute to the preservation of Man's health: For from the ingenious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> in his <hi>Medicina Statica,</hi> we may be invited to hope, that there may be ways, as yet unthought of, to investigate the wholesomness or insalubrity of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as he, by the weight of Bodies, after having fed on such and such Meats, findes that Swines Flesh, Melons, and some other things that he names (in the third Section) do much hinder insensible Perspiration, and consequently are unwholsome; though, as I take it, it were not amiss, that before such Observations be fram'd into general and establish'd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorisms, they were carefully made in Bodies of differing Ages, Sexes and Complexions, and with variety of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances: But then again, presuming these Maximes to be judiciously fram'd, the same <hi>Statica Medicina</hi> makes it hopeful, that there may be unthought-of Methods found, whereby, by ways different from those formerly used by Physitians, a Man may be much assisted in the whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ordering himself, so as to preserve health, and to foresee and prevent the approach of many Distempers. And perhaps by such unthought-of ways, divers Paradoxes of concernment to Mans health may be made out, as the diligent <hi>Sanctorius</hi> to that Observation proposed in these words <hi>Semel aut bis in mense facto excessu in cibo &amp; potu, die sequenti,</hi>

For he may also devise means, whereby to judge of the qualities of Aliments, especially Drinks in their respective kindes; and likewise of the temperature of the Air in this or that place assign'd, we shall, in one of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Essays, describe to you a small slight Instrument, by the help of which, one that is acquainted with this or that particular sort of Wine, may give a near guess whether it be embased with Water or not. And whereas in most hot Countrys, where Water being the common Drink, 'tis of great concernments to Mans health to be able to make a good estimate of the salubrity of it; And whereas Physitians are wont to think Water <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the better and purer the lighter it is, this Instrument presently manifests, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble of weighing in Scales, what among any Waters propos'd is the heaviest, and which the lightest, and what difference there is of gravity betwixt them: And this dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may sometimes be so great, that I remember some of our English Navigators tell us, That upon bringing home a so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56384:131"/>
the <hi>English.</hi> And as the thickness or lightness of Waters may be thus presently discerned by this <hi>Hydrostatical</hi> way, so 'tis possible, by some Chymical Experiments, easily enough to discover some other qualities, wherein Waters, that are thought to be of the same nature, differ from each other; as we finde that very many Pump-waters will not bear Soap, as Rain-waters, and the generality of Spring-waters will do: some Water will not well dye Scarlet, or some other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar colour, because they are secretly imbued with some kinde of saline Substance, that hath an operation it should not have upon the Ingredients imployed by the Dyer. And I have sometimes discovered a latent Sea-salt in Water, where others suspected no such matter, by pouring into it a solution of good Silver, made in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi>: For as common Salt, as well as the Spirit of it, will precipitate the Metal out of such a solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the form of a white Calx; so it seem'd rational to conceive, that in case the Water I suspected had been imbued in its passage through the Earth with a saline quality, though not conspicuous enough to be taken notice of by the taste; these saline Corpuscles diffused through the Water, would, though faintly, act their parts upon the dissolved Silver, and accordingly I found, that upon the mixtures of such Waters, and the Metalline solution, there would immediately be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a kinde of whiteness (from some parts of the Metal precipitated by the Salt:) to avoid which, I have often been fain to use, in places where I met with such Waters, either Rain-water, or that which is freed from its common Salt, by a slow Distillation.</p>
                  <p>And as for the temperature of the Air, which is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be of exceeding great consequence, both as to health, and as to the prolongation of life; and which is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly yet of greater moment to both then most Men imagine,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56384:132"/>
the skilful Naturalists sagacity, if it were employed to that purpose, might probably finde divers ways of discovering the qualities, and consequently the salubrity and unhealthfulness of the Air in particular places. For the diligent <hi>Sanctorius</hi> (in the second Section of his <hi>Medicina Statica</hi>) teacheth us how to estimate the healthfulness and insalubrity of the Air, by the weight of those Mens Bodies that live in it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this (nice) way, we see, that by the late Invention of Weather-Glasses, 'tis easie to discern which of two Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Houses, and which of two rooms in the same House is the colder. And I remember, I have sometimes bethought my self of a slight way (to be mention'd in one of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Essays) by the help of which, it is not hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in which of two places proposed, the Air is <hi>caeteris pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> the dryer or the moister; And to give also some guess, both how much at the same time the Air of one place exceeds that of the other, and how the temperature of the Air chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in the same place at several times, either of those quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And that the differing operations of several Airs, upon certain sorts of Flesh hung in them, upon some fading co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, upon Bodies subject to gather rust, or to be tarnish'd; and in a word, upon divers other subjects, may be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable then Men seem yet to have taken notice of, I shall think it sufficient to have intimated in this place, being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to hasten to the following Essay (wherewith I am to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, what I have to offer to you concerning Physick) that I may have the more time to employ on it.</p>

in his Mouth? briskly answered, <hi>Let him die if he will, so he die secundum artem.</hi> I hope there are very few of this Man's temper, but it were to be wished, that there were few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Learned Men that think a Physitian hath done enough, when he hath learnedly discoursed of the seat and nature of the Disease, foretold the event of it, and methodically im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed a company of safe, but languid Remedies, which he had often before found almost as unable to <hi>cure</hi> the Patient, as unlikely to <hi>kill</hi> him. For by such an unprofitable way of proceeding, to which some lazy or opinionated Practizers of Physick (I say <hi>some,</hi> for I mean not <hi>all)</hi> have, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of its being safe, confined themselves; they have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their whole Profession too obnoxious to the Cavils of such Empericks, as he that (as the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> reports) was wont to say, Your <hi>European</hi> Physitians are indeed Learned Men, but they know not the particular Cures of Diseases; and (unreverendly enough) to compare our Physitians to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, who had the Keys of <hi>binding and loosing,</hi> and nothing else: Which brings into my minde, what Monsieur <hi>De Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sac</hi> relates (in his witty French Discourse <hi>of the Court</hi>) of a Physitian of <hi>Millain,</hi> that he knew at <hi>Padua,</hi> who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a Possession of his Science, and (as he said) <hi>The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Truth,</hi> did not onely not particularly enquire into the Cure of Diseases, but boasted, That he had kill'd a Man with the fairest Method in the World: <hi>E mort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> (said he) <hi>canonicamente, è con tutti gli ordini.</hi> And such Scoffs and Stories are readily enough entertain'd by the major part of Men, who send for Physitians, not so much to know what ails them, as to be eas'd of it; and had not rather been me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically kill'd, then Empirically cured. And it doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a little lessen even my esteem of the great <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s skill, to finde mentioned in his Writings so many of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56384:133"/>
of whom he concludes, that they dyed: And I had much rather, that the Physitian of any Friend of mine, should keep his Patient by powerful Medicines from dying, then tell me punctually when he shall die, or shew me in the opened Carcase why it may be supposed he lived no longer. But, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> my concern for Mankinde, and for the reputation of many excellent Physitians, whose Profession suffers much by the want of either Industry or Charity, in such as we have been speaking of, hath diverted me longer then I thought, from telling you, That I suppose it will not be very difficult to perswade you, that this so useful <hi>Therapeutical</hi> part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick is also capable of being much improved by a knowing Naturalist, especially if he be an intelligent and expert Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, as in this Essay we will suppose him.</p>

                     <p>SOme <hi>Paracelsian</hi> would, perhaps, set forth, how much more easie to be taken Chymically prepared Medicines are wont to be, then those loathsome and clogging <hi>Galenical</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Bolus</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are not onely odious to the Takers, but (which is much worse) are to many so offensive, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Patients cannot get them down, or the incensed Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack returns them, by Vomit, before they have stayed long enough in the Body to do any more then distemper it. But I shall not much insist on this, because I think wholesomness to be much more considerable in a Remedy then pleasantness: though, I confess, I could wish that Physitians were more careful to keep Patients from being almost as much troubled by Physick, as by the Disease, and to cure according to the old Prescription, not onely <hi>citò</hi> and <hi>tutò,</hi> but <hi>jucundè</hi> too:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56384:134"/>
Especially considering that, as we were saying, the loathsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of some Medicines maketh the Stomack reject them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can have performed their Operations. And it is, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, on this account as much as on any other, that at <hi>Oxford</hi> Learned &amp; Practical Physitians, of your Acquaintance, make very frequent use (on Patients not Feverish) of the <hi>resin</hi> of <hi>Jalap,</hi> barely drawn with Spirit of Wine; since as we have tryed six, eight or ten, or more Grains, of this almost insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Resin, being cleanly prepared, according to Art, and with a little <hi>Gum-tragacanth,</hi> and half its weight of powdred Cinamon, or some such thing, made up, may be taken in the Morning, in form of Pills, instead of a Potion; and is wont to evacuate plentifully enough, and yet gripe the Patient much less then common Purges. But, as I said, I shall not insist on this. I might better commend the usefulness of Chymistry to the <hi>Therapeutical</hi> part of Physick, from hence, That it is probable, that even emptying Medicines may, by the <hi>Spagyrists</hi> Art, be so prepared, as not onely to be less of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive then common Purges or Vomits in the taking, but to be less painful in the working: As I have often observed, both in my self and others, that upon the taking of the clear, and not loathsome Mineral <hi>Waters of Barnet,</hi> though the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine wrought with me ten or twelve times in a Morning, yet it did not either pain me, or make me sick, or disorder me for the remaining part of the day, any thing near so much as a common Pill or Potion that had wrought but once or twice would have done. And I shall elsewhere (God permitting) teach you a preparation of Silver, whereof about three or four Grains being made up (with any proper Conserve) into a little Pill, is wont to make a copious evacuation of <hi>Serum</hi> especially (in Bodies that abound with it) without making the Patient almost at all sick, or griping him: Insomuch that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56384:134"/>
I know some Persons, both Physitians and others, with whom though this Medicine work frequently in a day, and though (which is stranger) once taking of it will with some Persons work so for two or three, or more days successively, yet they scruple not to go abroad and follow their business; and some that take it, tell me, That when it works not with them (as for the most part, when it hath freed the Body from superfluous <hi>Serum,</hi> it will cease, and in some Bodies will scarce purge at all, it neither puts them to pain, nor makes them sick.)</p>
                     <p>And now I am speaking of the painless ways of relieving the sick, I shall adde, That there is another way, whereby 'tis to be hop'd, many Patients may be rescued from a great deal of pain, and that is by finding out Medicaments, that may in several Distempers, that are thought to belong pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly to the Chirurgions hand, excuse the need of Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Cutting, Trepaning, and other as well painful as terrible manual Operations of Chirurgery. <hi>Helmont</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Helmont, De Febri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> c. 14. See also the same Author in <hi>Tractat: quem vocat Arcana. Paracels: &amp; Lib. de Febr. Cap.</hi> 14.</note> That he knew a Country Fellow, who cur'd all fresh Wounds by a Drink made (as I remember) of burnt <hi>Tilia.</hi> I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd you in another Essay, of the Cure I observed to be made of the exulcerated <hi>Tumors</hi> of one sick of the <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> by the use of Beer, altered by a little Plant, that did not at all disturb the Taker. If we may believe, <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>'s and <hi>Paracelsus</hi>'s <hi>Praecipitatus Diaphoreticus,</hi> taken at the Mouth, doth cure, to use his own Words, <hi>Carcino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Lupum &amp; quodlibet Aesthiomenum cacoethes ulcus, sive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum sive internum.</hi> And if there be any truth in what hath been affirm'd to me by several Eye-witnesses, as well Physitians as others, concerning the <hi>Weapon Salve,</hi> and <hi>Powder of Sympathy,</hi> we may well conclude, That Nature may perform divers Cures, for which the help of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56384:135"/>
is wont to be implor'd, with much less pain to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, then the Chirurgion is wont to put him to. I know a very ingenious Man, that is Famous as well for his Writings as for a Remedy, wherewith he undertaketh to cure constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the exulcerated Cancers of Womens Breasts, without any considerable pain: But having not yet had opportunity to make tryal of that which I have lying by me, I shall onely tell you, he assures me, That his Medicine is indolent, and mortifies the ulcerous parts as far as they are corrupted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disordering the Party troubled with them; which I the less doubt, because, that (to adde thus much on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) partly by the colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of his Powder, and partly by his own confession to me, it seems to be a dulcification of <hi>Arsenick,</hi> first fixt with <hi>Nitre,</hi> and then carefully freed from its corrosiveness, by very frequent Distillations of fresh Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine. I shall ere long have occasion to teach you a Drink, whereby exulcerated (but not Cancerous) Breasts have been very happily cured. The learned <hi>Bartholinus,</hi> in his late Observations) mentions the cure of some hurts in the Head, done without Trepaning, in cases where that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable and tedious Operation is wont to be thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As for the terrible way of stopping the violent Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great Wounds, by seering the Orifices of the Vessels with hot Irons, it would be little needed, if we knew such Remedies as that which the Inquisitive <hi>Petrus de Osma,</hi> in his curious Letter to <hi>Monardes</hi> from <hi>Peru,</hi> mentions in this Passage,<note place="margin">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56384:135"/>
kinde of <hi>Fistula</hi> in his Breast, and having travelled from one Country to another, to consult with the ablest Chirurgions, was at length brought to that pass, that at a Consult they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, by opening his Breast, to try if they could track the winding <hi>Fistula,</hi> and save his Life: And as the Instruments, for this sad operation, lay upon the Table, another famous Chirurgion casually coming into the House, told the Patient that he had an art of curing <hi>Fistula</hi>'s without cutting them open, and without any considerable pain or trouble: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the rich Man offering him what he pleased for the Cure, the Chirurgion quickly perform'd his Promise, as the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent himself, who shew'd me his Breast, confess'd to me, and that by the use of an almost indolent Remedy, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd of the Chirurgion, and which by his favor came to my hands: And that even very ill-condition'd <hi>Fistula</hi>'s may be cured without Chirurgical Operations, by Medicines taken at the Mouth, I shall ere long have occasion to shew you by a notable Example.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time I shall adde, That a Man, whom I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you have often seen, having a while since received such a kick of a Horse, as made the Doctor and Chirurgion that tended him, to conclude the part gangrenated, and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents condition, by the accession of a violent Feaver, so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that they desired to meddle with him no longer; a large Dosis of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s Cordial, sent him by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lady you are nearly related to, not onely freed him from his Feaver, and the <hi>Delirium</hi> that attended it, but, to the wonder of all that observed it, restored the Limb that was concluded gangrenated to its former soundness.</p>
                     <p>And to bring credit to all these Relations, I shall crown them with that memorable Passage of <hi>Gulielmus Piso,</hi> of as great things that he saw done by the illiterate <hi>Indians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:

                     <p>ANd <hi>first,</hi> The skilful Naturalist, especially if a good Chymist, may much assist the Physitian to discover the Qualities of Medicines, whether <hi>simple</hi> or <hi>compound</hi>; That the Experiments of the Spagyrists may much contribute to the examining those many things themselves prepare, you will, I presume, easily grant: That also divers Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are of the nobler sort of Medicines, is sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed on all hands; and 'tis known too, that the Industry of Chymists hath produced some good directions towards the discovery of the Minerals predominant in divers Medicinal Springs: But I am much mistaken, if they have not left much for others to do, which may be easily done. And I scarce doubt, but that by the various ways that might be propos'd, of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what such Waters hold, and what saline or other Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are predominant in them, not onely the nature of those Medicinal Waters that are already used, might be more throughly understood; but undetected Properties, might in many others that are now not taken notice of, be discovered;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56384:136"/>
of some of which ways of examining Mineral Waters, I may elsewhere give you an intimation. And I have made several tryals that have, I confess, much inclin'd me to think, that the fault is rather in us, then either in Nature or Chymistry, that Men do not, by the help of Chymical Experiments, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover more of the nature of divers Medicaments, then hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they seem to have so much as aim'd at: For though the abstruse Endowments of Specificks will not, I fear, be learn'd in haste, otherwise then by particular Tryals and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations; yet many Simples have other Qualities, which seem chiefly to reside, though not in an Elementary Salt or Sulphur, yet in a part of the Matter that seems of kin to a Salt or Sulphur: such as sowerness, saltness, a caustick or a healing faculty, abstersiveness, and the like, upon whose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count such Remedies seem chiefly to work in a multitude of cases. And towards the Investigation of such Qualities, a Chymist may oftentimes do much, without making all his Tryals in humane Bodies. But though, to illustrate this matter, I have sometimes made several Experiments, yet not having now my Notes and Observations at hand, I shall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention a few things as they offer themselves to my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, reserving the more distinct handling of this subject to another opportunity: And the rather, because that till such <hi>Phaenomena</hi> have been more diligently observ'd, and reduc'd to their distinct sorts, I would have them look'd upon but as hints to further Enquiries, not as sufficient Authority to ground general Rules on.</p>
                     <p>There are some Plants, whose Juices, especially when the superfluous moisture is exhal'd or abstracted, will, some by the assistance of a gentle Heat and Filtration, and some, even of themselves, in time (which I remember hath in some suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent Plants amounted but to a very few hours) coagulate
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56384:137"/>
in part into a kinde of Salt, which, if you please, you may call Essential: And by this <hi>Nitro-Tartareous</hi> Salt (as it seems to be) those Vegetables, whose Juice affords it (such as are, if I mistake not their names, <hi>Parietaria, Borrage, Bugloss, &amp;c.)</hi> may be discriminated from those many others, from whence it is not (at least by the same way) to be obtain'd. And possibly also these Salts may, to a heedful Surveyor of them, appear to differ enough from each other in shape, taste, or other obvious Qualities, to deserve to be sorted into dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering kinds.</p>
                     <p>If likewise we compare the Essential Salts and Spirits of these Plants, with those of <hi>Scurvy-grass, Brook-lime,</hi> and other Vegetables that are counted <hi>Antiscorbutical,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in Volatile and Saline parts: And if we also examine other Plants, by divers Chymical Operations, and observe not onely their disposedness or indisposition to yield Spirits or Oyls by Fermentation, or without it; but those other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars wherein they will appear to agree with, or differ from each other: there is little doubt but such Tryals will make them discover, to a considering Naturalist, much of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Properties, and especially of such as depend chiefly upon the plenty or paucity of the saline, unctuous, sowre, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous, lazy, tenacious or volatile Parts.</p>
                     <p>It may be also observ'd, that the Infusion or Decoction of some Plants, as of <hi>Brazil, Senna, &amp;c.</hi> will be heighten'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a redish colour, by putting <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Salts, as of <hi>Tartar,</hi> or of Pot-ashes, in the Water that extracts their Tinctures: Whereas acid Spirits, at least some of them, will much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, if not destroy their colour; as a little <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> will immediately tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n a red Tincture of <hi>Brazil,</hi> made in fair Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, into a pale yellow: Whereas on the other side, I have observ'd, that a small quantity of a strong Solution of Pot-ashes,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56384:137"/>
drop'd into an Infusion of red Rose-leaves, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently turn'd it into a muddy colour, that seem'd to partake of green and blew, but was dark and dirty; whereas a little <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or good Spirit of Salt pour'd into the same sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Solution, did immediately turn it into a fine red, and so it would do to the muddy Mixture lately mention'd, if it were put to it in a far greater quantity. I observ'd also, that with a very strong (though clear and well filtrated) <hi>Lixivium</hi> of Pot-ashes, I could precipitate some pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ts of the Infusion or Decoction of red Roses, which grosser parts, when the Mixture was filtrated through Cap-paper, remain'd like a dirty colour'd (though somewhat greenish) Mud in the Filtre; the fluid and finer part of the Mixture passing through, in the form of a Liquor high coloured, almost like <hi>Muscadine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And on this occasion, I remember, that as Galls, a very stiptick Vegetable excrescence, will yield a Decoction, with which, and <hi>Copper is,</hi> the common Ink is made; so divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plants, of notably astringent parts, may be employed to the like use: For, by casting <hi>Vitriol</hi> into a Decoction ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Oaken Bark, or red Roses, or even a bare Infusion of either Log-wood, or <hi>Sumach,</hi> to name now no other Plants of the like nature, I have presently made a Mixture that might make a shift to serve for Writing Ink; but whether all stiptick Plants, or they onely, will with <hi>Vitriol</hi> make an Ink, I refer to further Enquiry: And as a Solution of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and the Decoction of the above-mention'd Plants, do precipitate each other to make Ink; so I remember I have try'd, that by dissolving the Crystals of pure Silver (made the common way with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or Spirit of <hi>Nitre)</hi> in a good quantity of fair Water, that the Liquor having no colour of its own, the colours it produceth in other Bodies may be the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, I found that I could with this Liquor precipitate out
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56384:138"/>
of the Infusions alone of several Vegetables, Substances dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringly colour'd, according to their respective dispositions: And so I have found, with less cost, that <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> which seems to be a kinde of <hi>Vitriol</hi> of Lead, whilst it lyes dissolved in the same Spirit of Vinager which extracted it from the Metal, being put to the bare Infusion of Log-wood, <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> red Roses (to name those I now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> I made tryal of) they will precipitate each other.</p>
                     <p>I might farther adde, That I have try'd that sulphureous Salts, such as Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> made <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> being drop'd into the expressed Juices of divers Vegetables, will, in a moment, turn them into a lovely Green, though the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables were of colours differing from that, and from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other (as I remember one of those Vegetables, in which I expected, and found that change, was of a fine Carnation) And I could tell you, that though it be disputed whether Quick-lime have any Salt dissoluble in Water, and of what sort it is, the <hi>Examen</hi> of that Question may be much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, by trying, as I have done, that the Water of Quick-Lime, well made, will precipitate a Solution of sublimate made in fair Water, and will presently turn Syrup of Violets (which is Blew) if well mix'd with it, into a fair Green. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments I say of this nature I might easily annex, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already set down divers of them in what I have written concerning colours, I shall refer you thither: And now onely adde this Observation, that the Investigation of divers Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Qualities, even of Animal Substances, may be much assisted by the Naturalist, especially a Chymist; as we elsewhere have by the Distillation of the <hi>Calculus humanus</hi> shewn, how much it differs from the Stones that are found in the Earth. And if you take those hard Concretions, found at certain times in the Heads of Craw-Fishes, that are wont

to be call'd <hi>Lapides Cancrorum,</hi> and commit some of them to Distillation, and infuse some in Vinager, and others in old Rhenish-Wine, or strong White-Wine, you will probably discover some thing of peculiar in the nature of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, of which I may possibly elsewhere make further men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you: And not onely so, but in some Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, you may, by fit Experiments, discover notable Changes to be made, and their Qualities to be much heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd, when the Eye scarce perceiveth any Change at all, as I have purposely observ'd, in keeping Urine in close Glasses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a moderate heat for many Weeks: For at the end of that time, the Virtues that depend upon its volatile Salt will be so heighten'd, that whereas upon putting Spirit of Salt to fresh Urine, the two Liquors readily and quietly mix'd, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Spirit upon digested Urine, there would present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ensue a Hissing and Ebullition, and the volatile and acid Salts would, after a while, concoagulate into a third Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, somewhat of the nature of <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi> And whereas the Syrup of Violets, formerly mention'd, being dissolv'd in a little fresh Urine, seem'd to be but diluted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; a few drops of the fermented Urine, temper'd with it, did presently turn it into a deep Green: And the same dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted Urine being drop'd upon a Solution of Sublimate made in fair Water, presently turn'd it white, by precipitating the dissolved Mercury. With what (various) success we have likewise made upon some other parts of a humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as well consistent as fluid, some Tryals, analogous to what we have recited of Urine, I may <hi>elsewhere</hi> perchance take notice to you: But of such kinde of Observations I must give you but this Hint at <hi>present.</hi>

I have sometimes won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that there hath been so little care taken by Physitians, and even by Chymists, to investigate the Qualities of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Earths, and those other resembling Bodies, that are, or may be, plentifully enough digg'd up in most Countries, though not the self-same in all; for however Men are pleas'd to pass them slightly over, as if they were but Elementary Earth, a little stain'd, or otherwise lightly altered: I have seen great variety of them, that have been digg'd sometimes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56384:139"/>
within the compass of a little spot of Ground: and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of divers of them, both as to colour, taste, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, and other Qualities, have been too great, not to make me suspect they were of very differing natures. And the true <hi>Bolus Armenus,</hi> and the <hi>Terra Lemnia,</hi> which is now brought us from the Island that gives it that name (mark'd with a Seal, which makes many call it <hi>Terra sigillata,</hi> though that name be for the same reason apply'd to the <hi>Terra Silesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and other Medical Earths) have been so esteemed, both by Ancient and Modern Physitians, as well against Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Diseases, and the Plague it self, as against divers other Distempers; that 'tis the more strange, that (since the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of those two Earths, that are now brought into our Countrys, have not, as the more skilful complain, the true marks of the genuine Earths, whose names they bear) Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians have not been more careful to try whether their own Countrys could not furnish them with the like, or as good, especially in regard some of the few attempts of that nature, that have of late times been made, may give them much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. For, not to believe the boasts of the <hi>Silesian Johannes Montanus</hi> (who passeth for the Inventor of the <hi>Terra Sigillata Silesiaca Strigoniensis</hi>) in the Writing he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished of the vertues of it, That 'tis Gold prepared and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted, by provident Nature, into an admirable Medicine; I finde that Learned Physitians prefer it before the <hi>Lemnian</hi> Earth, that is now brought from <hi>Turky</hi>: And the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced <hi>Sennertus</hi> gives it this commendation,<note place="margin">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56384:140"/>
that I had once brought me a certain Earth, by a Gentleman that digg'd it up in this, or some neighboring Country, which, though it seem'd but a Mineral Earth, did really afford, to a very expert tryer of Metals of my acquaintance, a not despicable proportion of Gold. They have also found in <hi>Hungary,</hi> an Earth, which they call <hi>Bolus Tockaviensis,</hi> which is affirmed by <hi>Crato</hi> (in <hi>Sennertus</hi>) to melt in the Mouth like Butter, and to have all the other proofs of the true <hi>Bolus Armenus,</hi> and therefore is, by that Judicious Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, preferred before the Modern <hi>Bolearmony,</hi> even that which was brought out of <hi>Turky</hi> to the Emperor himself; and he relates, not onely its having succeeded very well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Catarrhs,</hi> but his having experimentally found it of great efficacy in the Plague, that reign'd in his time at <hi>Vienna.</hi> To which I shall adde, That a very Learned and Successful English Doctor, now dead, did, some Years since during a great Plague that then rag'd in the City where he liv'd, finde a vein of red Earth, not very far from that Town, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd it with very good success in Pestilential Feavers, as I was inform'd by an Ingenious Friend of his, that us'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I remember also, the experienc'd Chymist <hi>Johannes Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola,</hi> in his Notes upon what <hi>Poppius</hi> delivers of <hi>Terra Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillata,</hi> after having much commended the <hi>Terra Silesiaca</hi> in divers Diseases, and equall'd it to the best of <hi>Turky,</hi> where he had travelled, relates one strange thing of it, with many Circumstances, and in a way as if he spoke upon his own tryal, namely, That the Spirit of <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> by which I think he means the <hi>Strigoniensis,</hi> doth, though slowly, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve Gold as well as an <hi>Aq. Regis,</hi> and that into a red Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whence in two or three days, the Gold will fall of it self into a very fine and subtil Powder. And the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56384:140"/>
tells us, That he hath seen another Earth digg'd at the <hi>Rheinstran,</hi> not far from <hi>Westerwaldt,</hi> which was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to white then to yellow, which is preferable to the <hi>Silesian,</hi> and gives more Salt then it, and dissolves Silver better then other <hi>Menstruums</hi>; since, as he saith, the Silver may thereby be easily made potable, and be prepar'd into a very useful Medicine for the Diseases of the Head. And for my part, I do not much wonder at the efficacy of these Earths, when I consider, that divers of them are probably imbu'd, as well as dy'd, with Mineral Fumes; or tincted with Mineral Juices, wherein Metals or Minerals may lie, as the Chymists speak, <hi>in solutis principiis</hi>; in which form, having never endured the Fire, many of their usefullest parts are more loose and volatile, and divers of their Vertues less lock'd up, and more dispos'd to be communicative of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, then they are wont to be, in a more fixed or coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated state, or when they have lost many of their finer parts by the violence of the Fire.</p>
                     <p>Besides, there are several Mineral Bodies, which though perhaps they may not be of themselves fit for the Physitians use, may, by addition of some other convenient Body, or by sequestration of the more noxious parts, or by some such other Chymical Preparation, as may alter the Texture of such Minerals, be rendred fit to encrease the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi> As I have known, that by a preparation of <hi>Arsenick,</hi> with Salt Peter, whereby some of the more volatile and noxious parts are driven away, and the remaining Body somewhat fixed and corrected by the <hi>Alcali</hi> of the <hi>Nitre</hi> it hath, by a farther dulcification with Spirit of Wine, or Vinegar, been prepared into a kinde of <hi>Balsamum fuliginis,</hi> which wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cured a Physitian of my acquaintance, as he himself

                        <hi>THirdly,</hi> And now, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that I am speaking of the service that the Naturalist may do Physick, I must not pretermit that he may assist the Physitian to make his Cures less chargeable: For though to cure cheaply, be not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in strictness, any part of the end of the Art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, which considers Mens Health, and not their Purse; yet it ought in Charity, if not also in Equity, to be the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the Physitian, especially when he dealeth with Patients that are not rich. For not now to say any thing of the Fees of Physitians, which in some places are not very moderate, 'tis certain that the Bills of Apothecaries, especially in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diseases, do often prove so chargeable, that even when the Remedies succeed, by that time a poor Patient is recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he is undone, and pays for the prolongation of his Life, that which should have been his lively-hood: Whence it comes to pass, that the more necessitous sort of People are either fain to languish unrelieved, for want of being able to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56384:143"/>
purchase health at the Apothecary's rates; or are deterred from applying themselves to the Physitian, till their Diseases have taken too deep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oot to be easily, if at all, eradicated: And this oftentimes, not more through the fault of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, then of the Doctor, who in his Presciptions might, for the most part, easily direct things that would be much more cheap, without being much less efficacious.</p>
                     <p>Now there are several Particulars, wherein it may be hop'd, that the Naturalist may assist the charitable Physitian to lessen the charge of his Patients.</p>
                     <p>And first, He may perswade the Physitian to decline that more frequent, then commendable custom, of stuffing each <hi>Recipe</hi> with a multitude of Ingredients: 'Tis not that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the practice of some Chymists, who too freely censure the compounding of Simples; for I know, at some times, a complicated Distemper requires in its Remedy more Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then are, perhaps, to be met with in any of the known Simples that the Physitian hath at command (though one and the same Simples may sometimes answer divers Indications; as a Plant that is hot and dry, may serve for a Distemper that is cold and moist:) And I know too, that in some cases to that Ingredient, that is as it were the Basis of the Medicine, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things must be added either to correct its noxious Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or to allay its vehemence, or to serve for a Vehicle to convey it to the Part affected, or to make it easier to be taken by the Patient, or to preserve it from corruption, or for some such like reason. But yet I think Physitians may well be more sparing, as to the number of the things prescribed, then most of them use to be, both to save charges to their Patients (upon which account it is that I here mention it) and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther considerations. For the addition of needless Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents adding to the bulk of the Medicine, makes it but the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56384:144"/>
more troublesom to be taken, and the more apt to clog the Stomack: And oftentimes the Efficacy of the more useful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, as well as their Quantity in each Dose, is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, by their being yok'd with those that are less appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, or less operative. Besides, it seems a great impediment to the further discovery of the Vertues of Simples, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found so many of them in Compositions: For, in a mixture of a great number of Ingredients, 'tis so hard to know what is the operation of each, or any of them, that I fear there will scarce in a long time be any great progress made in the discovery of the vertues of simple Drugs, till they either be oftner imployed singly, or be but few of them employed in one Remedy. And besides all this, whereas when one of these Mixtures is administred, the Physitian expects but such operations as are suitable to the Quality which he conceives will be predominant in the whole Compound; several of the Ingredients may have particular Qualities that he dreams not of, which working upon a Body, that the Physitian consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as subject onely to the Sickness he endeavors to cure, may therein excite divers latent Seeds of other Distempers, and make new and unexpected commotions in the Body. On which occasion I remember, that whereas Parsley is a very u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Ingredient of aperitive and diuretick Decoctions and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozems, a famous and learned Oculist tells me, he hath very often observ'd, That when he hath unawares, or for tryal-sake employ'd Parsley, either inwardly, or even outwardly to those that were troubled with great Distempers in their Eyes, he found the Medicines wherein that Herb was but one Ingredient among many, to cause either great pain or inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Eyes. In confirmation of which, I shall adde, that awhile after having a slight Distemper in my Eyes, I one day found it upon a suddain strangely encreased, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56384:144"/>
able to imagine whence these new Symptoms proceeded; till at length, recalling to minde all I had done that day, I remembred, that at Dinner I had eaten Sawce wherein there was a pretty deal of Parsley, mixt with other things. And whereas in divers of these Compositions some noxious Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients are allow'd, upon a supposition that their ill Qualities will be lost, by their being, as it were, tempered with the rest; though this may sometimes happen, yet it would be considered, that in Treacle (especially at one age of it) the <hi>Opium</hi> doth not, considering the small proportion of it to the rest of the Ingredients, loose much, if any of its power, by being mingled with sixty odde other Drugs, which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position possibly ow's much of its vertue to that little <hi>Opium.</hi> And perhaps one reason why those that accustom themselves to be ever and anon taking Physick, though they often escape dangerous Diseases (by preventing the accumulation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and taking their Sicknesses at the beginning) are yet almost ever troubled with one Distemper or other, may be, That by the multiplicity of Medicines they take into their Bodies, divers things are excited to disorder them, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise would have lain quiet. I am not ignorant that it may be alledg'd, That in compounded Medicines, as <hi>Treacle</hi> &amp; <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate,</hi> how many soever the Ingredients be, they do so clog &amp; temper one anothers activity in the composition, that there results from them all, one or more Qualities fit for the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians turn, and which is the thing he considers and makes use of. And I confess, that in some cases this Allegation doth not want its weight: For I consider, that a decoction of Galls, and a solution of <hi>Copperas,</hi> though neither of them apart be blackish, will, upon their mixture, turn to Ink: And that when Brimstone, Salt-Peter, and Coals are well mingled together in a due proportion, they make Gun-Powder, a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56384:145"/>
mixture, that hath Qualities much more active then any of the sever'd Ingredients. But I fear, that when a multitude of Simples are heap'd together into one compound Medicine, though there may result a new <hi>crasis,</hi> yet 'tis very hard for the Physitians to know before-hand what that will be; and it may sometimes prove rather hurtful then good, or at least by the coalition the vertues of the chief Ingredients, may be rather impaired then improved: As we see that crude <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> crude <hi>Nitre,</hi> and crude <hi>Salt,</hi> may be either of them safely enough taken into the Body in a good quantity; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of sublimate, consisting of those three Ingredients, a few Grains may be rank Poyson. As for those fam'd Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Mithridate, Treacle,</hi> and the like, though I cannot well, for the mention'd Reasons, commend the skill of those that first devised them, and though I think that when one or two Simples may answer the same Indications, they may for the same Reasons be more safely employed; Yet I would by no means discommend the use of those Mixtures, because long experience hath manifested them to be good Medicines in several cases. But 'tis one thing to employ one of these Compositions, when tryal hath evinced it to be a lucky one, and another thing to think it fit to rely on a huddle of Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, before any tryal hath manifested what kinde of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound they will constitute. And, in a word, though I had not the respect I have for <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> and other famous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors that devised the Compositions, whereinto Ingredients are thrown by scores, if not by hundreds, yet however I should not reject an effectual Remedy, because I thought that it proved so rather by chance, then any skill in the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: And I think a wise Man may use a Remedy, that scarce any but a Fool would have devis'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:56384:145"/>Another thing, upon whose account the Naturalist (whom we here suppose an expert Chymist) may assist a Physitian to lessen the expensiveness of his Prescriptions, is by shewing, That in very many Compositions, several of the Ingredients, and oftentimes the most chargeable, whether they be proper or no fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Disease, are unfit for the way of management prescrib'd, and consequently ought to be left out. I need not tell you, that since Chymistry began to flourish amongst us, very many of the Medicines prepared in Apothecaries Shops, and commonly the most chargeable, are distill'd Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Spirits, and other Liquors: And he that shall survey the Books and Bills of Physitians, shall finde, that (very few perhaps excepted) the most usual Prescription is to take such and such Ingredients (for the most part numerous enough) and pouring on them either Water or Wine, if any Liquor at all, to distil them in <hi>Balneo,</hi> rarely in Ashes or Sand. But I confess I have not without wonder, and something of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, seen in the Prescriptions of Physitians, otherwise emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently Learned Men, and even in the publick Dispensatories, I know not how many things ordered to be distill'd, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in <hi>Balneo,</hi> which in that degree of heat will yield either nothing at all, as the fragments of Precious Stones, Leaves of Gold, prepar'd Pearl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or if they do yield any thing (for that hath not been yet, that I know of, evinced) do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably yield but a little nauseous Phlegm, or at least some few loose parts, far less efficacious then those that require a stronger heat to drive them up: such are Sugar, Raysins, and other sweet Fruit, Bread, Harts-horn, Flesh prepar'd by Coction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which though wont to be thrown away with the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> oftentimes there retain their pristine Texture a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d Nature, or at least are almost as much more considerable, then that which they yielded in Distillation: as a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56384:146"/>
boyl'd Capon is, then the Liquor that sticks to the Cover of the Pot. And though as to some of these Ingredients it may be thought that they may yield even in <hi>Balneo</hi> some of their useful parts, yet this can, with any probability, be suppos'd but of some of such Ingredients: And even as to them it is but suppos'd that they may yield Something in so milde a heat, and how that Something will be qualified, is but presum'd: at least, by the Analogy of the Experiments vulgarly made, there seems so small cause to exspect, that these more fix'd Ingredients will adde half so much to the vertue of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as they will to the cost; especially since though it could be prov'd, or were probable, that fix'd Substances may communicate their vertues to Wine or Water, yet it would not follow that those impregnated Liquors, distilled in <hi>Balneo,</hi> will carry those vertues with them over the Helm. All which I have more largely prov'd in another Discourse, where I shew both that the nobler parts of many Ingredients wont to be distill'd in <hi>Balneo,</hi> do commonly remain in the <hi>Caput Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi> and that 'tis very unsafe to conclude always the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of distill'd Liquors from those of the Concrets that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them.</p>
                     <p>But there is another way of putting unfit Ingredients in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Medicines, by confounding those in one Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, though perhaps they might apart be properly enough employed, do, when mixed, destroy or lock up the Vertues of one another; and of this fault, even famous Chymists themselves are but too often guilty. I know not how many Processes I have met with, wherein saline Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, of contrary natures, are prescrib'd to be mingled, as if because they were all of them saline, they must be fit to be associated; whereas 'tis evident to any Man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hat consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as well as employs the Operations of Chymistry, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56384:146"/>
there are scarce any Bodies in the World betwixt which there is a greater contrariety, then betwixt acid Salts: and as well those that the Chymists call volatile, as the Spirits and Salts of Harts-horn, Blood, Flesh and the like, as those others which are made of Incineration, as Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and of all burnt Vegetables. So that oftentimes it happens, that by an unskilful Mixture, two good Ingredients are spoil'd; as when Vinegar, Juice of Lemmons, Juice of Barberies, and the like, are prescrib'd to be distill'd with other Ingredients, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Salt of Wormwood or some other Plant makes one, for then the <hi>acid</hi> and <hi>alcalizate</hi> Salts, working upon one another, grow more fix'd, and yield in <hi>Balneo</hi> but a Flegm: and so Spirit or Urine, which is highly volatile, and Spirit of Salt, which is also a distill'd Liquor, being mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will, by their mutual Operation, constitute a new thing, which in such a heat as that of a Bath, will yield a Flegm, leaving behinde the nobler and active Parts concoagulated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a far more fix'd Substance, much of the nature of <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi> And indeed where Salts, especially active ones, are made Ingredients of Mixtures, unless they be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and judiciously compounded, it often happens that they spoil one another, and degenerate into a new thing, if they do not also spoil the whole Composition, and of divers use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ingredients compose one bad Medicine.</p>

                     <p>ANother way by which the Naturalist (skill'd in Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry) may help to lessen the chargeableness of Cures, is by shewing, that as to divers costly Ingredients, wont to be employ'd in Physick, there hath not yet been sufficient proof given of their having any Medical Vertues at all, or that at
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56384:147"/>
least as they are wont to be exhibited, either crude, or but slightly prepared in <hi>Juleps, Electuaries, &amp;c.</hi> there is not any sufficient evidence to perswade us, that their efficacy is as much greater, then that of many cheap Ingredients, as their price is. I am not altogether of their minde, that absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject the internal use of Leaf-Gold, Rubies, Sapphyrs, Emerauds, and other Gems, as things that are unconquerable by the heat of the Stomack: For as there are rich Patients that may, without much inconvenience, go to the price of the dearest Medicines; so I think the Stomack acts not on Medicines barely upon the account of its heat, but is endow'd with a subtle dissolvent (whence so ever it hath it) by which it may perform divers things not to be done by so languid a heat. And I have, with Liquors of differing sorts, easily drawn from Vegetable Substances, and perhaps unrectified, sometimes dissolv'd, and sometimes drawn Tinctures from, Gems, and that in the cold. But though for these and other Considerations, I do not yet acquiess in their Reasons, that laugh at the administration of crude Gems, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ridiculous; yet neither am I altogether of their Adversary's minde. For though I deny not that the Glass of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which looketh like a kinde of Gem or Ruby, will easily enough impart to Liquors an emetick Quality; yet I know too, there is great odds betwixt Ruby's and other Gems (which will endure vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fires, and remain undissolved in divers strongly corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Liquors) and the Glass of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which is a Body so far less compact and fix'd, that Spirit of Vinegar it self will work upon it, and a strong Fire will, in no long time, dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate it into smoke. But that which I chiefly consider on this occasion, is, That 'tis one thing to make it <hi>probable,</hi> that 'tis <hi>possible</hi> Gold, Ruby's, Sapphyrs, <hi>&amp;c. may</hi> be wrought upon by a humane Stomack; and another thing, to shew both that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56384:147"/>
they <hi>are wont</hi> to be so, and that they <hi>are</hi> actually endow'd with those particular and specifick Vertues that are ascrib'd to them: Nay, and (over and above) that these Vertues are such, and so eminent, that they considerably surpass those of cheaper Simples. And I think, that in Prescriptions made for the poorer sort of Patients, a Physitian may well substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue cheaper Ingredients in the place of these precious ones, whose Vertues are not half so unquestionable as their Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>What strange Excellency there may be in the <hi>Aurum Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi> made by a true <hi>Adeptus,</hi> or by a Possessor of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor <hi>Alcahest,</hi> I shall not now dispute, not knowing what powerful and radical Dissolvents the profound skill of such Men (if any such there be) may furnish them with, to open the Body of Gold. But as for the attempts and practices of the generality of Chymical Physitians to make Gold potable, besides that, their attempts to make their Solutions volatile, succeed so seldom, that even Learned Physitians, and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, have pronounced the thing it self unfeasible; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I should much doubt whether such a potable Gold would have the prodigious Vertues its Encomiasts ascribe to it, and expect from it: For I finde not that those I have yet met with, deliver these strange things upon particular Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments duly made, but partly upon the Authority of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Books, many of which were never written by those whose Names they bear. And others, I fear, commend <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> prepared after another-guess manner then that we are now speaking of, partly upon a presumption that if it be made volatile, it must be strangely unlock'd, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to a meer Spiritual Nature; and partly upon rational Conjectures (as they think them) drawn from the nobleness and preciousness of Gold. But for my part, though I have
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56384:148"/>
long since bethought my self of a way, whereby I can, in a short time, and a moderate Fire, make my <hi>Menstruum</hi> bring over cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e Gold, in quantity sufficient to make the Liquor look at the first or second Distillation, of a high golden co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; yet finding that I could, by an easie Art, quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover out of this volatile Liquor, a corporal and malleable Gold, I dare not brag that my Tincture (as an Alchymist would call it) must needs do strange feats, because there is so noble a Mettal brought over in it. And if this or other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi> prove good Medicines, it would be further enquired, whether the Vertues may not in great part be rather attributed to the <hi>Menstruum,</hi> then the Gold (that requiring a very subtile Liquor to volatilize it) or to the association of the Corpuscles of the Gold, with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Particles of the <hi>Menstruum,</hi> into a new Concrete, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering enough from Gold, though never so well open'd. And as for the nobleness and pretiousness of this Metal, That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Estimation of Men, whence in <hi>America</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> that abounded with it, had not such a great value for it; And in divers Countries, at this day, it is postponed to Iron or to Copper, and hath rather a Political (if I may so speak) then a Natural Vertue. Nor will it follow, that because it is the fixedst and pretiousest of Metals, that therefore it must be an admirable Medicine: For we see that Diamonds, though they be the hardest of Bodies, and very fix'd ones, and in much greater esteem, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> then Gold, are yet so far from being accounted highly Medicinal, that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly (though, perhaps, not so deservedly) reckon'd among Poysons. But I see I have digress'd, That which I chiefly aim'd at, being to inculcate, that whether Gold and Gems, and the like pretious Ingredients, may be good Medicines or no, 'twere a good work to substitute cheap ones for the poorer
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56384:148"/>
sort of Patients; and that Physitians are much to blame, who prize Simples, as Drugsters do, according as they are brought from remote Countries, and are hard to be come by, and cannot imagine that what doth not cost much Money in the Shops, can do much good in the Body; as if God had made Provision onely for the Rich, or those People that have Commerce with <hi>China</hi> or the <hi>India's</hi>: whereas indeed it may oftentimes happen, that what the Chymists call their <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> and perhaps throw away as an useless <hi>Terra Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata,</hi> may have as great Vertues as those nobler Parts, as they call them, which they have extracted from it; and a desp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Soot is generally look'd upon as so vile a thing, that we are fain to hire Men to carry it away; and yet, as I elsewhere shew that 'tis a Body of no ignoble Nature, so I must here tell you, that 'tis no unuseful one in Physick. And not to mention that <hi>Riverius</hi> commends it crude, to the quantity of a Drachme, in Plurisies: I have try'd, with the Spirit of it well drawn, some things, that make me look upon it as a considerable Liquor. And I know by their own confessions, that some Medicines, even of eminent Physitians, that pass under other Names, have the Spirit of Soot for their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Ingredient. I knew, a not unlearned Emperick, who was exceedingly cry'd up for the Cures he did, especially in difficult Distempers of the Brain, by a certain Remedy, which he call'd sometimes his <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> and sometimes his <hi>Panacaea</hi>; and having obtain'd from this Man, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of a Chymical Secret of mine he was greedy of, the way of making this so celebrated Medicine, I found that the main thing in it was the Spirit of Soot, drawn after a some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unusual, but not excellent manner; in which Spirit, Flowers of <hi>Sulphur</hi> were, by a certain way, brought to be dissolv'd, and swim in little drops that look'd of a golden co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>

                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:56384:150"/>You will easily grant, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that there are not any Medicines to be taken into the Body, more cheap and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible then the Excrements of Men and Horses, and then Insects: And yet that even these want not considerable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Vertues, we elsewhere shew. And (not to meddle with such nasty things as the grosser sort of humane Excrements, though they outwardly apply'd, either in Powder or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, do sometimes perform strange things) the Juice of Horse-dung, especially of Stone-horses, being strongly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd (after the Dung hath been awhile steeped in Ale, or some other convenient Liquor, to facilitate the obtaining the Juice and to afford it a <hi>Vehicle</hi>) doth oftentimes so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully relieve those that are troubled with the stoppage of Urine, with Winde, Stitches, and even with Obstructions of the Spleen and Liver, that You, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> and I, know a great Lady, who though very neat, and very curious of her Health, and wont to have the attendance of the skilfullest Physitians, scruples not, upon occasion, to use as I have known her do, in Silver Vessels, this homely Remedy, and prefer it to divers rich Cordials, and even to what some Chymists are pleas'd to call <hi>Essences</hi> or <hi>Elixirs</hi>: And with the same Remedy very many poor People were cur'd of the Plague it self, when it lately swept away so many thousands in <hi>Ireland</hi> (and the Doctors with the Patients) as I was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd by a Person who cur'd so many, as to invite men to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themselves that assistance, by refusing the Party the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to leave the Town. But (to adde that upon the by) this Person, in exchange of a Secret of mine, confess'd to me, That the <hi>Arcanum,</hi> which had cur'd such numbers, and to which the Juice of Horse-dung was a <hi>Succedaneum,</hi> was onely a good Dose of the Powder of fully ripe Ivy-berries, which did usually, as also the Horse-dung, work plentifully

                     <p>The Medical Vertues of Man's Urine, both inwardly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and outwardly apply'd, would require rather a whole Book, then a part of an Essay to enumerate and insist on: But referring you to what an industrious Chymist hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy collected touching that subject, I shall now onely adde, That I knew ancient Gentlewoman, who being almost hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to recover of divers Chronical Distempers (and some too of these abstruse enough) was at length advised, instead of more costly Physick, to make her Morning-draughts of her own Water; by the use of which she strangely recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is, for ought I know, still well. And the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is not disdain'd by a Person of great Quality and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that You know; and that too, after she hath travelled as far as the Spaw for Her healths sake. And I remember on this occasion, that passing once through one of the remoter Parts of <hi>England,</hi> I was visited by an Emperick, a well-wisher to Chymistry, but a Novice in it, who pressing me, to communicate to him some easie and cheap Preparation, that he might make use of among the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56384:151"/>
cured so many with it, especially of Plurisies (a Disease fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and dangerous enough in that Country) that this slight and seemingly despicable Remedy had already made him be cry'd up for a Doctor, and was like to help him to a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Subsistence.</p>
                     <p>Great store of healthy Mens Blood is wont to be thrown away, as altogether useless, by Chirurgions and Barbers, that let Men Blood (as is usual in the Spring and Fall) for prevention of Diseases; and yet from a Man's Blood skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prepared, though without addition of any thing, save Spirit of Wine to keep it at first from putrifying, may be easily obtain'd a Spirit, and volatile Salt, that have much the same Vertues, with those of the newly mention'd Spirit of Urine, but more noble (as far as I can guess) then either that, or even Spirit of Harts horn, as having perform'd in Consumptions, Asthma's, and other obstinate cases, such things as I, as well as others, could not but admire.

                     <p>I shall adde but one Instance more, of the efficacy that may be found in the most obvious and abject Creatures; and this Instance is afforded me, by those vile Insects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called in English, Wood-lice, or Sows, and in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>Millepedes,</hi> which I have often both recommended to others, and taken my self: What their Vertue is against the Stone, the World hath been informed by <hi>Laurembergius,</hi>

who hath published a Narrative, how by the use of them he was cured, even of the Stone in the Bladder; and he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to use them by credible information, that others had been cured of that Disease, by the same Remedy. And of late Years, in <hi>England,</hi> an Emperick being much resorted to, for the relief he gave in that tormenting Sickness, a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, famous for his Learned Writings, wondering at what was done, was very curious (as himself afterwards told me) to finde out the Emperick's secret, and at length was so indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious as to discover, That 'twas a slight preparation of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepedes.</hi> But my having found them in my self very diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and apertive, is not that which chiefly recommends them to me; For I knew, and liv'd in the same House with a pious Gentlewoman, much better skill'd in Physick, then her Sex promised, who having lost the use of one Eye by a Cataract, and being threatned by the Oculists with the speedy loss of the other, especially in regard of her being very aged and corpulent, she nevertheless did, for some Years, to my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, employ her Eye to read and work with, without finding, as she told me, any decay in it, or any encreasing danger of a suffusion: And she assured me, that her Medicine was to bruise first five <hi>Millepedes,</hi> then ten, then fifteen, then twenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (daily encreasing the number by five, till it had reach'd, if I mistake not, fifty or sixty) in White-wine (or Small-ale) and to drink upon an empty Stomack, the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly express'd Liquor; And when I desired to know how she came by this Specifick, she answered me, That having made enquiries among all those, both Oculists and others, that she thought might assist her against so sad a Distemper, she was advised to the use of <hi>Millepedes,</hi> by a Woman, that not onely much magnified their vertue in such cases as hers, but assured her (if I much mis-remember not) that she her self

I shall now onely subjoyn, as a further proof of the great Vertue that may be even in vile and costless Insects, and that without any elaborate or Chymical Preparation, this memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Story; That after all the tryals I had made about these <hi>Millepedes,</hi> I met with a yong Lady, who by divers strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly winding and obstinate <hi>Fistula's,</hi> that had made themselves Orifices in many places of her Body, was not onely lam'd, but so consum'd and weakned, that she was scarce able to turn

her self in her bed; and this, notwithstanding the utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors of the eminentest Chirurgions, both English and Foreigners, that could be procur'd: But when both the hopes of her Friends, and those that endeavored to cure her, were lost, she was in a short time not alone freed from her <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stula's,</hi> but recovered to a thriving condition of Body, by the frequent use of an internal Medicine, which, as both her Parents and the Person that taught in them informed me, was onely a Drink (to be taken twice or thrice a day) made of a small proportion of a couple of Herbs (very common, and not much more likely to do Wonders in this case, then Worm-wood and Mint) and of Three hundred of these <hi>Millepedes</hi> well beaten (when their Heads are pull'd of) in a Mortar, and tunn'd up with the Herbs, and suspended in four Gallons of small Ale, during its fermentation. The wonderful efficacy of this Medicine in this and many other cases, which by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this Cure were related to me, being almost wholly ascrib'd to the <hi>Millepedes,</hi> by the Illustrious Imparter of it, whose leave I have not yet, by naming him, to disclose, that this is the Secret He makes use of.]</p>

                     <p>ANother way there is whereby the Naturalist may assist the Physitian to make the <hi>Therapeutical</hi> part of Physick less chargeable, and that is, by shewing those that are wont to employ most Chymical Remedies, that much of the cost and labor in many cases might be spared. I am not altogether of their minde, that indiscriminatly cry down Chymical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations as excessively dear: For of many of those that seem very dear, when bought by the Pound or the Ounce, a Dose may be cheap enough; as if for instance, an Ounce of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56384:153"/>
of Gold and <hi>Mercury</hi> cost ten times its weight of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, under which rate I have bought it of honest Men, that make it themselves, yet that Ounce containing 480 Grains, (of which three or four may be a Dose) a taking of this dear Powder, may cost far less then a Dose of many <hi>Galenical</hi> Medicines, where the quantity that is taken at once, makes up what is wanting in the costliness of the Ingredients. But though this be the case of <hi>some</hi> Chymical Remedies, yet we must not deny, that <hi>many</hi> others are chargeable, and though perhaps not more so then many <hi>Galenical</hi> ones employ'd for the same purposes: Yet if those be dearer then they need be, that grievance ought to be redress'd in Chymical Medicines, how justly soever the same thing may be imputed to <hi>Galeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> ones.</p>
                     <p>Now there are two Particulars, wherein the Chymists, and those Physitians that imitate them, are wont to be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in reference to this matter; The one, their employing Chymical Preparations on all occasions, even where Simples or slight Compositions might serve the turn: and the other is, Their making many of their P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eparations more laborious, and consequently more chargeable then needs.</p>
                     <p>As for the first of these: 'Tis known there are divers Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, and others that practise Physick, who so dote upon the Productions of their Furnaces, that they will scarce go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to cure a cut Finger, with less then some <hi>Spagyrical</hi> Oyl or Balsam: And in slight Distempers have recourse to Chymical, and perhaps to Mineral Remedies, which being, for the most part, such as vehemently alter the Body, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by heating and drying it, they do often more harm then good, when employed in cases that need not such active Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. And methinks those that practise, as if Nature presented us nothing worth the accepting, unless it be cook'd
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56384:153"/>
and perfected by <hi>Vulcan,</hi> might consider, That <hi>Paracelsus</hi> himself oftentimes employeth Simples for the cure even of formidable Diseases. And though for particular Reasons I be incl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nable enough to think, that such searching and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Remedies, as may be so much of kin to the Universal Medicine, as to cure great numbers of differing Diseases, will be hardly obtain'd without the help of Chymical Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and those perhaps of Minerals: Yet as to most parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diseases, especially when not yet atriv'd to a deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble height, I am apt to think, that either Simples, or cheap, or unelaborate <hi>Galenical</hi> Mixtures, may furnish us with Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificks, that may perform much more then Chymists are wont to think, and possibly be preferable to many of their costly <hi>Magisteries, Quint-essences</hi> and <hi>Elixirs.</hi>

                        <hi>Helmont</hi> himself, a Person more knowing and experienced in his Art, then almost any of the Chymists, scruples not to make this ingenious Confession: <hi>Credo</hi> (saith he) <hi>simplicia in sua sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitate esse sufficientia, pro sanatione omnium morborum</hi>: And elsewhere he truly affirms, That there may be sometimes greater Vertue in a Simple, such as Nature affords it us, then in any thing that the Fire can separate from it. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the specifick Properties of divers, if not most Simples, are confounded and lost by those Preparations, wherein that Texture, which is the foundation of those Properties, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther destroyed by the Fire, or chang'd by the taking away of some of the Parts; or the adding of some other Substance to it, with which compounded, it may constitute a new thing. The more Judicious of the Chymists themselves do several of them now acknowledge, that the bare reducing of Pearls to fine Powder, affords a Medicine much richer in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Pearls, then the <hi>Magistery,</hi> prepar'd by dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in acid Spirits, and precipitating them with Oyl

of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and afterwards scrupulously edulcorating them. And one may easily observe, that by making the <hi>Magistery</hi> of Harts-horn the same way, the Vertues seem to be more lock'd up then they were in the crude Horn, which may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough impart its Vertue in the Body, since fair Water will reduce a good part of it into a Jelly; whereas the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistery</hi> remains a fix'd Powder, not easily dissoluble, even in acid <hi>Menstruums</hi>; and, which thrown upon hot Iron, will scarce send forth that stinking Smoak, which argues the avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the saline and sulphureous Parts.

                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:56384:154"/>But I consider further, that as oftentimes those I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning with make use of Chymical Remedies, when much more easily parable ones may suffice; so in divers cases, where Spagyrical Medicines are proper enough, their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of them are more tedious and expensive then is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. There are more then a few who seldom prescribe, and seldomer esteem a Chymical Process, that is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in less then many Weeks; as if a Chymical Medicine, like an <hi>Embryo,</hi> must needs be an Abortive, if it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in less then so many Moneths. And as if in Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Vertue depended less on the skilfulness, then the elaboratness, they seem to estimate the efficacy of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by the time and pains requisite to prepare them, and dare not think, that a Medicine can quickly cure, that was not long a making; as indeed theirs (especially those where Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hobations and Digestions, till they have such and such effects upon the Matter to be wrought on by them, are prescrib'd) are many of them far more toilsom and tedious, then those that have but read such Processes, without working them, are apt to suspect. And this is the humor of divers, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to those stable Medicines, that ought always to be found ready in Apothecary's Shops, but even as to those that are design'd for particular cases, and perhaps acute Diseases; in which Emergencies, if a Physitian had no other Remedies then those he must make according to such Processes, it would, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> fear, too often happen, that before the Medicine could be ready, the Patient would either be past the need of it, or past the help of it. And that which oftentimes encreas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the tediousness of Chymical Processes, is the unskilful Prescriptions of those that devise them. 'Tis not unusual in Chymists Writings to meet with Processes, wherein the Matter to be prepar'd, is expos'd to I know not how many
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56384:155"/>
several successive Operations: But if you should ask why such a thing should be, for instance, rather precipitated, then exhal'd <hi>ad siccitatem,</hi> or why such and such an Operation is to be us'd after such another, rather then before it; nay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if one should demand why some of those Operations should be used at all, the Devisers of those unskilful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses would possibly assoon be able to finish their Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to give a satisfactory answer. Nay, sometimes they lengthen their Processes by Operations, so injudiciously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd, that they cross one another; And the Chymist vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself, and the Matter he works upon, to leave it at last no better, if not a worse, Medicine then he found it; of this we have already given an instance in the common <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisteries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I lately met with another Example of it, in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of a Famous, Modern Chymist, where to purifie the fix'd Salts of Vegetables, to the height, after I know not how many Solutions, Filtrations and Coagulations (which alone would abundantly serve the turn) he prescribes the dissolving them in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi>; after which, he saith, they will become very pure and chrystalline, and not so easily resoluble in the Air: Of which I make no doubt, for divers Years before I met with this Process, I have, with the fix'd Salts of more then one kinde of Vegetable, by joyning them with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and after awhile exhaling the superfluous moisture, made good inflammable <hi>Salt peter</hi>; by which you may easily guess, how judiciously the solution in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is prescrib'd onely as a further depuration, and how fit such Authors are to be credited, when they ascribe to these Chrystalline Salts the several Vertues, (&amp; those improved too) of the respective Vegetables, from which the <hi>Alcalies</hi> were obtain'd. And indeed, as to those exact Depurations, which some Chymists
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56384:155"/>
so strictly require in all their Preparations, though their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses be oftentimes hereby made incredibly tedious, I will willingly allow, nay I assert, that in some cases, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the making of powerful <hi>Menstruums,</hi> which by their activeness and penetrancy, are to unlock other Bodies, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists do rather erre in making their Depurations less exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site then they should, then on the other hand: Yet in many other cases, such exact refining and subtiliation of a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is not so necessary as they imagine; and sometimes too, may do more harm then good, by sequestring those parts of a Simple, as <hi>faeces,</hi> which concurr'd with the finer parts to that determinate Texture, whereon the specifick Vertues of it did principally depend; but of this more elsewhere. And therefore I shall here present you with two or there Instances, to shew you, That Remedies, at least as noble as such vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Chymical ones as are more tedious and costly, may be prepar'd in a shorter time, and cheap enough to be fit for the use of the Poor.</p>
                     <p>And to comply, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> with your curiosity, to know the Preparations of those Chymical Medicines, that I do the most familiarly employ, the three following Instances shall be of such, namely, The <hi>Flores Colchotaris,</hi> The <hi>Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum sulphur is crassum,</hi> and, The <hi>Essentia Cornu cervini,</hi> that you may see what slight and easie Preparations afford the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, whose Effects you have so often heard of, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so seen.</p>
                     <p>The first of these, is the same Powder, which passeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Ens Veneris,</hi> which appellation we gave it not out of a belief, that it equals the Vertues ascrib'd by <hi>Helmont,</hi> to what he calls the true <hi>Ignis Veneris,</hi> but partly to disguise it a little, and partly upon the account of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion whereon it was first found out, which was, That an
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56384:156"/>
Industrious Chymist (whom you know) and I, chancing to look together upon that Tract of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s, which he calls <hi>Butler,</hi> and to compare it somewhat attentively with other Passages of the same Author, we both resolv'd to try, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Medicine, somewhat approaching to that he made in imitation of <hi>Butlers</hi> Stone, might not be easily made out of calcin'd Vitriol; And, though upon tryals we found this Medicine far short of what <hi>Helmont</hi> ascribes to his, yet find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it no ordinary one, we did, for the Minerals sake 'tis made of, call it <hi>Ens primum Veneris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Preparation, in short, is this: Take good <hi>Dantzick</hi> Vitriol (if you cannot get <hi>Hungarian</hi> or <hi>Goslarian</hi>) and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine it till the <hi>calx</hi> have attain'd a dark red, or purplish co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, then, by the frequent affusion of boyling, or at least warm Water, dulcifie it exactly; and having freed it as well as you can from the saline parts, dry it throughly, and after mix it exquisitly, by grinding, or otherwise, with an equal weight of pure <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> very finely powdered. Put this Mixture into a glass Retort, that may be but a third part fill'd with it, and subliming it in a sand Furnace, by degrees of Fire, for ten or twelve hours, towards the latter end en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing the Fire, till the bottom of the Retort (if you can) be brought to be red hot: That which is sublim'd must be taken out, and if it be not of a good yellow, but pale (which usually happens for want of an exact commistion of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients) it may be return'd to the residue, mingled better with it again, and subli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>'d once more: The yellow, or red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish Sublimate may be sublim'd a second time, not from the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> but by it self; but if you re-sublime it oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, you may, though you will think that strange, impair the Colour and the Sublimate, instead of improving them. The Dose is from two or three Grains, to ten or twelve (in some
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56384:156"/>
Bodies it may be encreas'd to twenty or thirty, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) in distill'd Water, or small Beer, or other convenient Vehicles: It may be given at any time upon an empty Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, but I most commonly give it at Bed-time. It works, when it works sensibly, by Sweat, and somewhat by Urine. That it is a potent Specifick for the Rickets, I think I scarce need tell <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

I give it also in Feavors, and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, to procure sleep, which it usually doth where 'tis wanting: In the Head ache likewise, in which, if the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease be inveterate, the Remedy must be long continued; with the like admonition it hath done Wonders, <hi>in suppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Mensium obstinata</hi>: In the Worms it hath sometimes done strange things; and for provoking of Appetite, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not that I have either taken or given it without suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: And though I seldom take (for I often give more) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two or three Grains of it at a time, yet in that small Dose it usually proves Diaphoretical to me the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>But the Experiments we have had of the several Vertues and Efficacy of this Medicine, would be here too tedious to recite; and therefore I shall now pass them by, though, if you require it, I shall not be backward to set you down, by way of observations, most of the cases wherein I or my Friends have given it, and of the principal Cures that have been performed by it: In the mean time, because this exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Colcothar,</hi> being given in so small a Dose, may prove, if it be rightly and dexterously prepar'd, what <hi>Helmont</hi> saith of his imitation of <hi>Butlers</hi> Drif, <hi>A Medicine for the Poor,</hi> and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56384:157"/>
yet requires more care, not to say skill, to Prepare it well, then upon the bare reading of the Process you will imagin, I shall to gratify your Charity annex to the end of this Essay, (for to insert them here would make too prolix a Digression) as many of the Particulars relating to the Preparation of it as I can readily meet with among my loose Notes, And least you should think me a Mountebanck for want of knowing in what sense it is, that I commend this and the other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Medicins, I shall likewise to those Observations sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn a Declaration of my meaning in such particulars, and of the sense, wherein I desire you should understand what you meet with in the Praise of Remedies either in this Essay or any other of my Writings, which I hope it will be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to give you this Advertisment of once for all.</p>
                     <p>The next Medicine I am to mention to you is the <hi>Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Sulphuris</hi> which being made but with gross Oyls drawn by Expression may be called <hi>Crassum</hi> to distinguish it from the common and thinner Balsom of Sulphur, that is made with the Distil'd Oyl or Spirit of Turpentine.</p>
                     <p>This Balsom is made in an Houre or less, without a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, onely by taking to one part of good Flower of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, foure or five times as much (in weight) of good expressed Oyl, either of Olives or Nuts, or Poppey-seeds, and boyling the former in the latter in a Pipkin half fill'd with both, till it be perfectly Dissolv'd into a Blood-red Balsom. But as easy as this Preparation seems (and indeed is) to them that have often made it, it will not at first be so easie to make it right; For the Fire which ought to be of well kindled Coals, must be kept pretty quick, and yet not over-quick, least the Oyl boyle over, or doe not well Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Flowers of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but turn them with its self into a Clotted and almost Liver-colour'd Masse: And to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56384:157"/>
these Inconveniencies, and the adustion of the Matter, speciall care must be had to keep it constantly stirring, not only whil'st the Pot is over the Fire, but after it is taken off, till it be quite Cold. You may if you think fit Dissolve this simple Balsom in Chymicall Oyl of Anny-seeds, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Essential Oyl like to advance its Efficacy in this or that particular Distemper: But those Oyls being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very hot, I most commonly Prescribe the Balsom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out those Additions, especially if long Digestion have som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lessened the Offensiveness of the smell, which though no peculiar fault of this Preparation being common to Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Medicins is yet the chief Inconvenience of it. I will not too resolutly affirme that this is the very <hi>Balsamum Sulphuris Rulandi</hi> of which that Author relates such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things in his Centuries; but if it be not the same, tis so like it, and so good, that I doubt not but by perusing those Centuries, you may find divers uses of it, that I have not made tryall off: And in Coughs, old Strains, Bruises, Aches, (and sometimes the Incipcent fits of the Gout it self) and especially Tumors, some of your friends can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that it doth much greater things then most Men would expect from so slight and easy a Preparation; And indeed greater then I have seen done by very costly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Balsoms and Oyntments, sold in Apothecaries Shops: And in those Observations, I lately told you you might command, you will find that this Balsom outwardly applyed, hath cured such obstinate Tumours, as Men either knew not what to make off, or what to doe with them, of which skilful Physitians, to whom I gave it to make tryal off in difficult cases, can bear me witness; Though it ought sufficiently to endear this Balsam to us both, that it was the Meanes of rescuing your Fair and Vertuous Sister <hi>E</hi>: from

a dangerous Consumption. In outward Applications it is to be well warm'd, and to be chaf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>'d into the part affected, which should be afterwards kept very warme, or else Lint dipped in it may be kept upon the place. Inwardly some drops of it may be given at any time, when the Stomach is not full; either rol'd up with Sugar, or mingl'd with any convenient Vehicle. But as for the Particulars that concern the Preparation of this Balsam, you will find, those I can readily meet with among my loose Papers, annex'd with the Notes concerning <hi>Ens Veneris</hi> to the end of this Essay.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I shall now proceed to mention the third Medicine, which you have often heard off, under the name of <hi>Essence of Harts-horn</hi>; but which is indeed onely the Simple, but well Purify'd and Dephlegm'd Spirit of it. And though Men are pleased to imagin by the Effects this Remedy often produces that I have some Mysterious or ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate way of Preparing it, yet to deal ingenuously with you, the chief thing I have done to bring it into credit, is the teaching some Physicians and Apothecaries a safe and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy way of making it: For whereas before those that went about to Distil it, commonly used, as the Apothecaries are wont to doe in what they make of the same Matter, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings or Raspings of Harts-horn, and Distil'd it with a strong and naked Fire, the fugitive and subtle Spirits were wont to come over in that plenty, and with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t impetuosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to break the Glasses to pieces, whereby Apothecaries and even Chymists were discouraged from drawing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and they not having it in their Shops, its Vertues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unknown: Whereupon considering that if it were onely broken on an Anvil into pieces of about the bigness of ones litle finger, besides that this way of comminution
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56384:158"/>
would be far less chargeable then Rasping, the fumes would not be driven out so fast, and considering too, that a violent Fire was requisite, not to Distil the subtle Spirit, but to drive over the Grosse and heavy Oyl; I thought it was needless to take paines to force that over, which not being (that I observ'd) used in Physick, would but cost me further pains to seperate it again: And therefore, trying to Distil Harts-horn, in naked Retorts, placed but in Sand, I found I could Distil two or three pound at a time, and obtain from each of them, almost, if not quite, all the Spirits and Volatile Salt, which I afterwards separated from the redish and lighter Oyl, and freed them from Phlegm and Feculencies by a couple of Rectifications, made in tall Glasses, and with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gentle heats: (commonly of a Lamp Furnace) The <hi>Dose</hi> may be from eight, or ten Drops of the Spirit, or Graines of the Salt, to six times the quant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty of either, in warm Beer, or any Vehicle that is not acid, except Milk. Finding it to be a Medicine of an attenuating, resolving, and Diaphoretical Nature, and one that much resists Malignity, Putrefaction, and acid Humours (whence being mingl'd with Spirit of Vinager, and the like soure Juyces, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes their acidity.) I direct it (<hi>Praemissis Universalibus)</hi> in Feavers, Coughs, Pleurisies, Obstructions of the Spleen, Liver, or Womb, and principally in Affections of the Brain, as Stoppages of the Head, Feaverish <hi>Deliriums,</hi> and even <hi>in Phrenitide.</hi> And since I wrote a good part of this Essay, I had an Experiment of it in a Child, who being, by many violent Convulsion fits, reduc'd to a desperate condition, was recovered by one Dose of five or six Drops of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s Spirit, that I sent it. 'Tis true that I have another Medicine, that is more elaborate and costly, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly bears the name of <hi>Essentia Cornu Cervi,</hi> which I
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56384:159"/>
more value then this; But I cannot communicate that, without prejudicing a third Person, and an excellent Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist who makes a great advantage of it. But this I can tell you, that most of the Cures, for which my Preparation of Harts-horn hath had the good fortune to be esteem'd, have been performed with the above describ'd Simple Spirit and Salt, with which some skilful Physitians, and other Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Persons, who had it from me, have within these few Years sav'd so many Lives, that I am enclined to think, I have done no useless piece of Service, in bringing so happy a Medicine into Request, especially with those that have skill and opportunity to make better use of it then I. But, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I find I have detained you so long with so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix a Mention, of the three above describ'd Remedies, that I should think it requisite, to make you a solemn Apologie; but that I hope your Charity will as well invite you to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the fault, as mine induc'd me to commit it.</p>

                     <p>A Fourth way of lessening the Charges of Cures, may be this; That whereas the dearness of very many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicins proceeds from the Chargeableness of those Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Operations, whereby they are wont to be Prepar'd, 'tis to be hoped that a greater measure of skill in Physiology, and other Experimental Learning, will suggest cheaper and better ways of doing many things in Chymistry, then are, as yet, usually practis'd.</p>
                     <p>And those thrifty Expedients, I conceive, may be of several kinds, of which I shall at present mention, and that but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siently, three or four.</p>
                     <p>And first, I doubt not but Chymists may be taught to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56384:159"/>
make better Furnaces, for several purposes, then those that have been hitherto most us'd among them: For profess'd Chymists, having been for the most part unacquainted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with many other parts of Learning, and particularly with the Mechanicks, their contrivances of Furnaces and Vessels have been far enough from being as good as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Mechanicks and dexterity in contrivances might, and, I doubt not, hereafter will, supply them with; whether as to the saving of Fuel, or to the making the utmost use of the Heat afforded by the Fuel they do employ, or as to the intending heat to the height, or as to the regulating of heat at pleasure.</p>
                     <p>'Tis somewhat wonderful, as well as pleasant, to see how many Vessels may be duely heated by one Fire (perhaps no greater then common distillers employ to heat one Vessel) if the Furnace be so contriv'd, as that the Flame may be forc'd to pass in very crooked and winding Channels, towards the Vent or Vents, and the heat may be skilfully conveyed to the several parts of the Furnace, according to the Exigency of the work it is to do: And as for the intention of heat, I remember I have had odde effects of it, by the contrivance of a certain Furnace, that held but very few Coles, and to which I us'd no Bellows. But though by this way I could vitrifie sometimes the very Crucibles, and though possibly I could, with a slight alteration, melt down the sides of the Furnace themselves; yet a Disciple of <hi>Cornelius Drebell,</hi> and a very credible Person, assur'd me, That he knew a way of Furnaces that was yet fitter to bring heat to the <hi>superlative</hi> Degree: and that he himself, the Relator, could, by the meer force of Fire in his Furnace, bring <hi>Venetian Talk</hi> to flow; which is more, I confess, then ever I have been able to do either in mine, or those of the Glass-house. But Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56384:160"/>
hath assured me, 'tis easie to make a Furnace give that heat as expeditiously enough, and in other respects very conveniently to <hi>Cupel</hi> both Gold and Silver, without the least help of Bellows: That also Furnaces may be so ordered, as that the heat may be better regulated, then That in our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ones, I may elswhere shew you cause to believe: And in the meane time I sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll only tell you, that I look upon the skill of intending and remitting heat at pleasure, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the being able to keep a gentle heat long and equal as a thing of much greater moment, both as to Physick and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, then Chymists are wont to think (the powerful effects of constant and temporate heats, being as yet known to few save those that have made tryal of them) And with Lamp Furnaces, well ordered, divers things may be done in imitation of nature; some friends of mine having, as several of them assure me, in such Furnaces, brought Hens egges to manifest Animation. That also Furnaces may be so built, as to save much of the Laborants wonted attendance on them, may appeare by the obvious invention of <hi>Athanors</hi> or Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces with Towers, wherein the Fire is for many Hours, (perhaps for twenty-foure or forty-eight) supply'd with a competent proportion of Coales, without being able to burne much faster then it should: And that in many cases the labour of Blowing may be well spar'd, and the annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Mineral fumes in great p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rt avoyded, by an easie contrivance, is evident by those Furnaces which are blown by the help of a Pipe, drawing the Air, as they commonly speak, either at the top, as in <hi>Glaubers</hi> fourth Furnace, or at the bottom, as for want of room upwards, I have sometimes tryed: To which may be added, that the casting of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56384:160"/>
cheap and expeditious way of preparing some Minerals, though his method of making Spirit of Salt in that Furnace would not succeed, according to his promise with me, and some of my acquaintance. And there are other more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Contrivances, by casting some things upon the naked Fire, which invites me to expect, That there will be several good Expedients of employing the Fire to Chymical operations, that are not yet made use of, nor, perhaps, so much as dream'd of.</p>

                     <p>But for Materials that are cheap, and to be distill'd in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, as Woods, Harts-horn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the way is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis'd, and is, as we may elsewhere have occasion to shew, capable of improvement; though in many cases this kinde of Vessel is inferior to those tubulated Retorts, that were of old in use, and mentioned by <hi>Basilius Valentinus,</hi> and from which <hi>Glauber</hi> probably desum'd that which we have been speaking of. The utility of the way of sealing Glasses her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically, and of the Invention that now begins to be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of stopping the Bottles, that contain corrosive and subtle Liquors with Glass-stopples, ground fit to their Necks, instead of Corks, together with some other things, not now to be mention'd, keep me that I scarce doubt but
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56384:161"/>
that if we could prevail with the Glass-men and the Potters, to make Vessels of Glass and Earth exactly, according to directions, many things in Chymistry might be done better and cheaper then they now are; and some things might be then done, that with the forms of Vessels now in use cannot be done at all. And if that be true which we finde related in <hi>Pliny,</hi> and with some other Circumstances in <hi>Dion Cassius,</hi> of a more ingenious then fortunate Man, who, about his time, was put to death for having made malleable Glass, as the truth of that Story, if granted, would shew the retriving that Invention, a thing not to be despair'd of: So he that could, now Chymistry is so cultivated, finde again the way of making Glass malleable, would be, in my Opinion, a very great Benefactor to Man-kinde, and would enable the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> as well as the Chymists, to make several Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which at present are scarce practicable; And some Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists would perhaps think this attempt more hopeful, if I tell them first, that I remember <hi>Raymund Lully</hi> expresly reckons it among three or four of the principal Vertues he ascribes to the Philosophers Stone, that it makes Glass mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable; and then, that an expert Chymist seriously affirm'd to me, that he met with an <hi>Adeptus,</hi> who, among other strange things, shew'd him a piece of Glass, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator found, would endure and yield to the Hammer: But what my own Opinion is concerning this matter, and what are the (uncommon) Inducements I have to be of it, I must not here declare.</p>
                     <p>And on this occasion, I remember I have seen an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tin, or Pewter, for the drawing of Spirit of Wine (which you know is one of the chargeablest things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chymistry) so contriv'd, that whereas in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way much time, and many rectifications, are requisite
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56384:161"/>
to dephlegm Spirit of Wine; one distillation in this Vessel will bring it over from Wine it self, so pure and flegmless, as to burn all away. And I remember, that the ancient French Chymist, in whose Laboratory I first saw one of these Instruments, told me, That 'twas invented, not by any great Alchymist or Mathematician, but by a needy <hi>Parisian</hi> Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion. And now I speak of Spirit of Wine, I shall adde, That as the charges of Chymistry would be very much less<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if such ardent Spirits could be had in plenty, and cheap; so I think it not improbable, that in divers places there may be found, by Persons well skil'd in the Nature of Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, other Vegetable Substances far cheaper then Wine, from which an inflammable, and saline Sulphureous Spirit, of the like vertue for dissolving resinous Bodies, drawing Tinctures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be copiously obtain'd: For not only, 'tis known, that Sydar, Perry, and other Juyces of Fruits will afford such a Spirit; and that most Graine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, not very unctuous, as Barley, Wheat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will do the like; but other Berries that grow wild, as those of Elder, will yield a Vinous Liquor. And in the <hi>Barbada's</hi> they make a kind of Wine, even of Roots, (I mean their <hi>Mobby,</hi> which they make of Potatos; as I have also, for curiosity sake, made Bread of the same Roots) nay, even from some sorts of Leaves, such a Liquor may be obtain'd: For I have observed Roses well fermented, to yield a good Spirit very strongly tasted, as well as inflammable. And as to the Preparing of pure Spirit of Wine it self, I know wayes (and one of them cheap) that may exceedingly shorten the time, and pains of dephlegming it; but that being to be done otherwise, then by any peculiar contrivance of Furnaces or Glasses, I reserve it for a fitter place, in one of the following Essays.</p>
                     <p>And as more expedient and thrifty wayes, then the vulgar
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56384:162"/>
ones, of making Chymicall Furnaces and Vessels, may be devis'd; so 'tis to be hoped that a skilful Naturalist may find cheaper waies of heating the Chymists Furnaces, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling in his Vessels (either by finding combustible Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, not formerly in use in the places where we work, or by making those already imployed fitter for use) by bringing them, by some cheap alterations, either to give a greater, or a more durable heat, or to be less offensive by their smoak or smells; or else by discovering some cheap way of doing, in some cases, without Fire, what was wont to be done by it.</p>
                     <p>We see that in some places, especially here in <hi>England,</hi> where Char-coale was only burnt in Furnaces, Pit coale is substituted in its room; and at this Day there are several of those that make <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> in great quantities, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stil it with such Coales, which cost nothing neer so much as those made of Wood. And experience hath inform'd me, that even in other sorts of Furnaces, the same Fuel may be imploy'd, provided the Barres of the Grates be set wider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, and a little Char-coale be mingled with it for the better kindling; and since of late Years Pit coale have been found in several places among us, where they were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly known to be, it seems not improbable, that many other Countries may afford Chymists, and the rest of their Inhabitants the like advantage, if search were duely made, by boring of the ground, by the observations of the Waters, and the Steames of places suspected, and by other waies of inquiry that a skilful man might direct; But because the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Smoak of Pit-coale, uses to be very offensive, and the smaller Coales easily run through the Grates, and because of other inconveniences, there hath been a way found out of charring these Coales, and thereby reducing them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56384:162"/>
coherent Masses, of a convenient bigness and shape, and more dry and apt to kindle; and these though, quantity for quantity, their price be little inferiour to that of Char-coale. Yet those that consume great proportions of Coales, tell me they finde them almost as cheap again, in regard they will not only last much longer, but give (especially near at hand) a far more intense heat: And therefore it must be a very useful thing to Chymists, to shew a way of charring Sea-coales, without the help of those Pots, which make them of the price they now beare. And that it is not only possible, but very easy, I could quickly shew you, if it would not prejudice an industrious Laborant, whose profession being to make Chymicall Medicines in quantity, obliges him to keep great and constant Fires, and did put him upon finding a way of charring Sea-coale, wherein it is in about three houres or less, without Pots or Vessels, brought to Char-coale; of which having, for curiosity sake, made him take out some pieces, and coole them in my presence, I found them upon breaking to appeare well charr'd, and much thereof in shew not unlike a Marchasite. And that which was very convenient in this Contrivance was, that whil'st the Pit coale was charring, it afforded him a very intense heat to melt or calcine the Minerals, he had occasion to expose to it: And he confest to me, that by this Method, he saved three parts in foure of the Charges the keeping such great and constant Fires, with common Char-coale, would cost him. In <hi>Holland,</hi> likewise, they have a way of charring Peat, (which is a combustible Turfe, that they dig under Ground) and a skilful Distiller, that much employ'd it, commends it to me, as a very good Fuel, even for Chymical Fires; which I therefore mention, because the way of charring Peat, is not yet brought into several Countries, where Peat is dig'd up:
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56384:163"/>
And probably, it would be found in divers Regions, where 'tis yet unknown, if due search were made for it. To which I may adde, that 'tis not unlike, that some Countries may afford such combustible Materials, fit for Chymical Furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as have not, as yet, been so much as nam'd by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralist's; as I remember I have seen, and had, a sort of Coales, some of which look'd like Marchasites, that burn'd clear with a good Flame, and had this convenient quality, for the Chymist's use, that they were not apt, like the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pit-coales, to stop the Grates with their Sinders, but burnt to whitish Ashes almost like Char-coale made of Wood; and yet gave so great a heat, that an Industrious Chymist of my acquaintance, who kept many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly at work, found it worth while to have them brought him, above a daies journey, on Horses backs.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis not impossible, that when Men grow better Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalist's, they may find waies, of exciting heat, enough for many Chymicall operations, without the help of Fire; and consequently, without the consumption of Fuel. We find that by the attrition of hard Bodies, considerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heat may be produc'd, not only, in combustible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, as Wood, and the like, (which would therefore be improper, to be here insisted on) But in others also, and particularly in Iron and Steel, one may by attrition soon produce a smart heat, as you may quickly try, by nimbly Filing a piece of Iron, with a rough File; or swiftly rubbing, though but for a few minutes, a thin piece of Steel against a Board. And whether some contrivance may not be found, by the help of cheap Engines mov'd by Water, or otherwise, to produce a durable heat in Iron Vessels, fit to digest in, we may elsewhere have further occasion to consider; But this is known, that from some succulent Plants, a Liquor may be
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56384:163"/>
drawn, only by exposing them in Glasses, purposely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to the Beames of the Sun. And there is nothing more common, then for Chymists to make their Digestions by the warmth of Hors-dung, whereby they might also (as some Analogous tryals incline me to think) conveniently enough, Distil some fermented Liquors; especially, if the way were improv'd by the skilful addition of Quick-lime, and seasonable aspersions of Water. And I doubt not but many cheap Materials might, by a few tryals, be found, whereby portable digesting Furnaces, without Fire, (if I may so call them) might be made, without the ill smell and nastiness, which discommends the use of Hors-dung. For not only we see, by what happens in the Spontaneous hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Malt, and some other familiar substances, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably most sort of Graines, and Berries, fit for Fermentation may be brought to yeeld, for a good while, a heat great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to putrifie, or digest with: But I have, several Years agoe, by many trials found; that I could, by invironing Glasses with refuse Hay well press'd down and equally wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted throughout, produce for divers daies such a heate, as made me decline the employing of Hors-dung; and yet (which is the chiefe thing for which I mention this) the quantity of Hay was so small, that in all my trials I found not, that the Hay did of it self, though kept close enough, take Fire; as else is usuall in Ricks of Hay not sufficiently dried, where the quantity, and consequently the weight, that presses the lowermost parts close together, is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                     <p>But further, in divers operations, where an actual Fire is requisite, it may be hop'd that Knowing Men, may discover waies of saving much of the Fire, and making Skill perform a great part of the wonted office of heat. To obtain the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56384:164"/>
Spirit of fresh Urine, you must Distil away near nine parts of ten, which will be but Flegm, before the Spirit or Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt will (and that scarce, without a pretty strong heat) regularly rise. And there are several Chymist's that, to this day, make use of no better way of Distiling Urine; But he that knows, how Putrefaction opens many Bodies, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily save himself the expence of so much Fire: For if you let Urine stand well stop'd, for eight or ten Weeks, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and Spirituous parts will so extricate themselves, that the Spirits that before staied behind the Flegm, will now, even with the gentlest heat, rise up first, and leave the Flegm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. And on this occasion I shall teach you, what I do not know to have been mention'd by any Writer; namely, That even of fresh Urine, without Digestion or Putrefaction, I can, by a very cheap and easie way, make a subtle and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrant Spirit, ascend, first, even in a gentle heat; And I am wont to do it only by pouring Urine, how fresh soever, upon Quick-lime, till it swim some Fingers breadth above it, and then distilling it assoon as I please. But I did not find, upon many trials, that this Spirit, though even without Rectification very strong and subtle, would Coagulate Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, like that of putrified and fermented Urine; though, perhaps, for divers other purposes it may be more powerful.</p>
                     <p>And here I shall advertise You, that whereas I just now took notice, that there was a pretty strong Fire requisite to force up the Salt of unfermented Urine, out of that part, which after the abstraction of the Phlegm, remains of the consistance of Honey; trial hath inform'd me, That the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt may out of the thick Liquor be obtain'd, better and more pure, with ease, and with a, scarce credibly, smal heat; barely, by tempering the Urinous extract with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56384:164"/>
quantity of good Wood Ashes, whereby (for a reason elswhere to be consider'd) the volatile part, of the Salt of Urine, is so free'd from the grosser Substance, that with strange facility it will ascend, fine and white, to the top of very tall Glasses. But of the differing Preparation of Urine, more perhaps elswhere. I now proceed to tell you, that I think it not unlikely, that even Bodies, which are more gross and sluggish, may by the affusion of such <hi>Menstruums,</hi> as humane Industrie may find out, be far more easily, either, volatiliz'd or unlockt, then common Chymists are wont to think. For I know a Liquor, not very rare among Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist's, by whose help I have, often enough, distill'd Spirit of Nitre, (whose distillation requires much about the same vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of Fire, with that of <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi>) even in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t of Sand, and without a naked Fire. This Spirit may easily enough be brought over, even in a Head and Body; and, for a Wager, I could obtain a little of it without any Fire or outward heat at all. And I remember, also, That hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once digested a certain <hi>Menstruum,</hi> for a very short time, upon crude <hi>Antimony,</hi> and abstracted it, in a very gentle heat, of Sand; the Liquor, not only, brought over some of the <hi>Antimony</hi> in the form of red Flowers, swiming in it, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited other parts of the Mineral, with it self, in the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Liquor, but the gentle heat raised to the top of the Retort, divers little Masses of a substance, that were very transparent, like <hi>Amber,</hi> which were inflammable, and smelt, and burnt blew, just like common <hi>Sulphur</hi>; And yet the <hi>Menstruum,</hi> which was easily again recoverable from the <hi>Antimony,</hi> was no strong Corrosive, tasting, before it was pour'd on, not much unlike good Vinager.</p>
                     <p>But besides all the wayes, above mentioned, of saving the Chymist, either, Time, or Fire, or Labour; I dispair no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:56384:165"/>
that divers others, yet unthought on, will be in time found out by the Industry of skilful Men, taking notice of the nature of things, and applying them to Chymical uses; as we see, that by Amalgamations with <hi>Mercury,</hi> the calcination of Gold, and Silver, may be much easyer perform'd, then by a long violence of Fire. And, (if it be true, what <hi>Helmont,</hi> and <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> tell us of their immortal Liquor <hi>Alkahest</hi>) Medicines far nobler, and otherwise more difficult to make, then those hitherto in use among the Chymist's, may be Prepar'd with greater ease, and expedition, and with far less expense of Fire, then the nature of the Mettals, and other Concretes, to be open'd by it, would let a vulgar Chymist suspect. However, I see no great cause to doubt that there may be <hi>Menstruum's</hi> found that will much facilitate difficult Operations, since not to mention again the Liquor, I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told you, would work such a change on Nitre (and, I might have added, on some other compact Bodies) 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like, there may be <hi>Menstruum's</hi> found, that will not be so spoyl'd by a single Operation, made with them, as our vulgar saline Spirits are wont to be. For I have try'd that a <hi>Menstruum,</hi> made by the bare distillation of good Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrease, will not only draw, as I have formerly told you, a Tincture of Glass of <hi>Antimony,</hi> or perform some other like Operation for once, but being drawn off from the dissolved body, or the extraction, will again serve, more then once, for the like Operation upon fresh Materials.</p>
                     <p>The fifth, and last way, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that I intend to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of lessening Chymical expenses; is, That the Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists may probably find out wayes of preserving some Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Medicins, either longer or better, then those wayes that are usual. But of this preservation of Bodies, being like, as I formerly intimated, to have elsewhere further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56384:165"/>
to Treat; I shall now only say, That the purified Juyces, liquid Extracts, <hi>Robs,</hi> and other soft Medicaments, made of Plants, may be Conserv'd far cheaper, aswel as bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then with Sugar (which clogs most Mens Stomacks, and otherwise disagrees with many Constitutions) in case <hi>Helmont</hi> say true, where he tells us, That for a small piece of Money, he can, for I know not how long, preserve whole Barrels of Liquor. And a way he intimates, of fuming li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> I have allready told you, is a very good way of keeping them uncorrupted; provided, that (though he prescribes it not) they be six or seven several times (seldomer or oftner, according to the quantity or nature of the Liquor) well impregnated with that embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Smoak; to which purpose it is convenient to have two Vessels, to poure from one to the other, that whil'st the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is shaking in the one, the other may be well fill'd with Smoak; whereto I shall only subjoyn this secret, which a friend of mine, practises in preserving the fumigated Juyces of Herbs (as, I elswhere inform you, I do to preserve other things) with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> success that I have somewhat wondred at; which consist's, in adding to the thick Liquor, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, a due, but small, proportion of the white <hi>Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> (which I often elswhere mention) made of the pure Spirits of Wine and Urine.</p>
                     <p>But I have made this excursion too prolix, and therefore I shall only adde as a general admonition, that we are not, by the common practice of Vulgar Chymist's, to estimate what Knowing Naturalist's, skill'd in Mechanical contrivances, may be able in time to do, towards the making of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Remedies, as well more <hi>cheap</hi> as more <hi>effectual</hi>; and, indeed, to make them more <hi>effectual,</hi> is the best way to make them more <hi>cheap.</hi>

                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:56384:166"/>For, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> after all the wayes, that I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, whereby the charges, of the <hi>Therapeutical</hi> part of Physick, may be lessned; I must advertise you, both, That I make no doubt but there may be divers others found, which either through want of skill or leasure I have pretermitted, and that I have not yet named the principal of all; which is, That the deep insight into Natural Philosophy may qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie him that hath it by several wayes, and especially by discovering the true Causes and Seats of Diseases, to find out such generous and effectual Remedies, (whether Specificks, or more Unive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I am assur'd, partly, by the Patient her self, and, partly, by those that gave her the Medicine, That though it had scarce any other sensible Operation upon her, and did not make her sickish, especially, when she slept upon it; Yet, after the first day she took it, she never had but one Fit. And this Remedy, an ancient Gentleman, who, being casually present when she suddenly fell down as dead, gave it her, profess'd himself to have constantly cur'd that Disease with it, when he could procure the right Simple, which is here exceeding scarce.

from severe and competent Inductions, as we have elswhere endeavoured, more particularly, to manifest. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till the Principles of Chymistry be better known, and more solidly establish'd, we must expect no other, then that very few vulgar Chymical Remedies should be of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest sort; and that in the Preparation of many others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable errours should be wont to pass unheeded; and faults, gross enough, be apt to be mistakenly committed.

                     <p>And, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> if You will not dis-believe a Person for whom You have so just an esteem, as You have for that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, and Experienc'd, <hi>Monsieur L. F.</hi> who was the French Kings Chymist, when You knew him at <hi>Paris</hi>; I can, present You with a yet Nobler instance, to perswade You; That, if skill be not wanting, a single Herb, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence of Fire, may, by other wayes then are in use among Chymists, be easily enough brought to afford Medicines, endow'd with some Nobler Vertues, then any of the most compounded, costly, and elaborate Medicines, whether Minerals or others, that are to be met with among Vulgar Chymists. This Efficacious part of the Plant, whence 'tis obtain'd, <hi>Paracelsus</hi> call's the <hi>Primum Ens</hi> of the Plant that yeilds it; But though, indeed, I have found the way of Preparing it much plainer, and better deliver'd, then is usual in his Writings, at the end of his Book <hi>De Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novatione
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56384:169"/>
&amp; Restauratione</hi>; Yet I freely acknowledge, That, I should scarce have thought it worth the Trial, if it had not been for what the Experienc'd Chymist, above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, affirmed to me, upon his own Observations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, partly, because I am not wont to be forward so much as to try long Processes upon <hi>Paracelsus</hi>'s credit, and partly, because what he call's <hi>Sal Solutum</hi> seem'd to me somewhat ambiguous; since, in the same Page teaching to draw the <hi>Ens Primum</hi> of Gold and <hi>Antimony,</hi> he makes not use of Sea-salt, but of (a Salt of an incomparably high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Nature) his <hi>Sal Circulatum</hi>; and in the Processe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly preceeding ours, to make the <hi>Ens Primum</hi> of <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds,</hi> he Prescribes the Calcining them in <hi>Sale Soluto,</hi> which agrees far better with his <hi>Sal Circulatum</hi> then with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Solution of Sea salt, which seems very unlikely to be able to Calcine and, as he sayes it must, dissolve <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds.</hi> But the way, that our French Chymist told me he us'd, was in substance this: Gather, in a convenient season and time of Day, Baulm for instance, or some other fit Herb, (for experience hath taught, both him and me, that all Herbs are not fit, by this way, to be reduc'd into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors) and having beaten it well, in a marble Morter, to a soft mash, plac'd in a Bolt-head hermetically seal'd, to Digest forty dayes in a Dunghill or some analogous heat; then, opening the Vessel, take out the Matter, which will be far more Liquid then before, from which, having sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the grosser parts, You must Digest it in a gentle Bath, that the yet remaining grosser parts may subside; to which, being filtrated. You must, according to him, (for I find not that <hi>Paracelsus</hi> requires it) joyn the fixed Salt, of the grosser parts above mention'd, dry'd and calcin'd. To this, Prepar'd Liquor, You must adde equal parts of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56384:170"/>
Liquor of good Sea-salt well purifi'd, and then melted, and suffered to run <hi>Per Deliquium</hi>: This Liquor, being also seal'd up in a convenient Glass, must be expos'd to the Sun for about six Weeks; at the end of which time there will swim at the top of it, the <hi>Primum Ens</hi> of the Plant in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid form, transparent, and either green or red, or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of some other Colour according to the Nature of the Plant. And though <hi>Paracelsus</hi> prescribes but Celandine, and Baulm, to be us'd, Yet having enqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r'd of our Chymist, he told me, he had made such <hi>Prima Entia</hi> of <hi>Scrophularia,</hi> and, as I remember, of one or two other Herbs. But that which makes me thus, particularly, take notice of these kind of Medicines, is, That not only <hi>Paracelsus</hi> ascribes to the <hi>Primum Ens</hi> of Baulm, (or Celandine) the power of reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating them that use so much of it in good Wine as will give it a Tincture, early every Morning; till, first of all, the Nailes of their Fingers, then those of their Toes, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Hair, and Teeth, fall off, and, lastly, the Skin be dri'd and exchang'd for a new one: But Your ingenious acquaintance assured me several times, and once, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a famous Physitian, and another <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> to whom he appeal'd, as knowing the truth of what he sayed; That an intimate Friend of his, whom he n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56384:170"/>
and being in no need of such Physick; But having given of the same Medicated Wine, for ten or twelve Dayes, to a Woman that serv'd in his house, and was neer seventy years of Age, without letting her know, what he expected it should do, Her <hi>Purgationes Menstruae</hi> came upon her again in a sufficiently great quantity, to fright her so much, that he durst prosecute the Experiment no further. And when I ask'd, why he made no triall upon Beasts? It was answer'd, that though he had but little of the Medicine, yet he put apart an old Hen, and moistning her food with some drops of it for a Week, about the sixth day she began to moult her Feathers by degrees, till she became stark naked; but before a fortnight was past, she began to regain others, which when they were come to their full growth, appear'd fairer, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter colour'd then the first; And he added, That besides that, her crest was rais'd, she also laid more Egges, then she was wont. And as to the <hi>Primum Ens</hi> of the greater <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phularia,</hi> by the relater himself, though he ascrib'd not to it any renovating power, as to that of Balm or Celandine, yet he assured me, he had found it enobled, by other great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Vertues. But of this kind of Preparation, I might ere now, possibly, have been able to give You a better account, if in my trials about them, I had not met with some unhappy accidents, which I hope my next attempts will es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: which if they do, I may possibly, with an account of them, send You one of some attempts to prepare the like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines another and shorter way, together with a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and others deservedly call such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents as the abovemention'd change of Nailes Hair, and even of Teeth a reall renovation or rejuvenessence.]</p>

And upon occasion of this odde prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> I shall adde that, Since Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience shewes us, by what is daily done in Chymicall Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratories, that upon the operation of the fire upon several Concretes, substances of Nature oftentimes very differing both from the body that afforded them, and from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may be obtain'd; as the Oyles, and fixt Salts, even of cold Plants or Hot: Since also, by the mixture of active Bodies new Concretes, endow'd with new qualities, may be produced; as we see that <hi>Saccharum Saturni</hi> emergeth from the conjunction of Lead, with the Acid Salt, distill'd Vinegar; and Since too the same Concrete, according to the differing manners, after which 'tis handled, may acquire differing Qualities, as is clear in the various Medicines, afforded us by Quicksilver, and by Antimony, according as each of them is order'd; I cannot but think, that if Chymistry did no more then assist us, by the resolution of bodies, to extricate their more active parts, and, partly by such resolutions, and partly by associating bodies together, to alter the former texture of Natures Productions, or present us with new Concretes of new Textures; by this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56384:172"/>
very means, if men want not Curiosity, and Industry to vary and prosecute experiments, there must necessarily arise such a store of new and active Medicines, that in all probability, many of them will be found endow'd with such Vertues, as have not been, at least in that degree, met with in the usuall Medicines, whether simple or compound, to be bought in Apothecary shops; and consequently, even without any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table discovery, or improvement of Principles, Chymists, (even as matters now stand with them) may considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly adde to the Pharmaceutical part of Physick. But if the Operations of Chymistry were seriously enquir'd into, and throughly understood, I make little doubt, but by a skilfull application of them, and especially by a <hi>series</hi> of them, in a rationall and orderly way, succeeding one another, there may be found out a great many preparations of Remedies, both very differing from the common ones, and far more noble then they. And to make this seem probable, I need but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat some of the examples formerly mention'd; To which I shall adde now, that Experience has inform'd me there is a way, whereby firmer consistent substances, belonging to the bodies of Animals, may without the addition of any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous matter, and without any violence of heat, be reduced almost totally into Liquor, and if I much misremember not, these Liquors without any violence of heat, afford their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous and Saline parts, in a very gentle heat, and that before their Flegme. And I must peculiarly inculcate this, That if we had but a few potent Menstruums, to dissolve and unlock bodies with, I scarce know what might not be done in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry. But when I speak of noble Menstruums, I mean not such as work like the generality of Corrosives, and the like Acid or Saline Liquors, which work but upon few kinds of bodies, and soon coagulate, or exantlate themselves
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56384:172"/>
by working, and thereby become unfit for future operations; but I mean such as either are separable with all their efficacy from the dissolv'd Body; as is said of the <hi>Alkahest,</hi> or such Saline or other piercing Liquors, as not being precisely either Acid, Urinous, or Alcalizate can resolve a great variety of Concretes, without haveing their Vertue, I say not impair'd, but destroy'd thereby; and unlock Minerall bodies, far more then vulgar Menstruums, (as for instance by volatilizing them, or else making them irreducible, or working the like grand changes in them:) and if it be not quite separated from the dissolved Body, is yet so friendly to Humane Nature, as to be free from either fretting, or other such dangerous and offensive Qualities, and rather to be of it self a powerfull Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. I should therefore exhort both You, and such other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious persons, as wish the advancement of Chymistry, and Physick, (I might possibly adde Natural Philosophy too) to apply their Chymical attempts, chiefly to the finding out of Noble Menstruums, for by being possessor but of one of these, a Man may be able to doe a great number of things, that otherwise are not to be performed; As one of our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Goldsmiths, by the bare knowledg he hath of <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis,</hi> can make many useful Experiments, about Silver, and Gold, that before that Menstruum was found out, all the Men of his profession in the World, were never able in many ages to compass.

But I consesse this may be rather a volatile Salt of Tartar, then Salt (that is Alcali) of Tartar made volatile, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the principal thing I mention it for, is to shew you, that Tartar it self, by an unusual way of management, may be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this I can tell You, that an ingenious acquaintance of mine, whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding my wonted distrusts of Chymists, I durst credit, affirm'd to me, that he had himself seen a true and real <hi>Sal Tartari volatile</hi> made of Alcali of Tartar, and had seen strange things done with it, insomuch that he believ'd most of the things, that <hi>Helmont</hi> delivers of it. For my part I am inclin'd to think, that Salt of Tartar may be made volatile, (whether in the form of a Sublimate or a Liquor) by more wayes then one, though not all of them neer equally good: and whereas one of the best (if not the very best) of the wayes of volatili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing it, seems to do it principally with Spirit of Wine, and the great difficulty of that way consists in bringing this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to associate with the salt: I have seen Salt of Tartar of my own, brought to that passe, which great Virtousi have long in vain attempted to bring it unto, namely, to flow rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily upon a red hot Iron, and also to take fire, and burn with a conspicuous flame, besides that when it had been dry'd by a smart fire to drive away any parts that did not firmly adhere to it, it would yet readily dissolve in high rectify'd Spirit of Wine, which you know Salt of Tartar will not otherwise do; not to mention the change of its Alcalizate taste, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lesser alterations; but what I can further say of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I must not declare in this place.</p>

(Acid as <hi>Aquafortis</hi> Urinous, as the Spirits of Blood, Urine, and other Animal substances, nor Alcalizate, as Oyle of Tartar <hi>Per deliquium</hi>) I shall assure you, that to my own knowledg there is in the World a kind of Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum, that consists of a pure Chryst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And whereas the vulgar Saline Menstruums, (which alone seem to have been known to <hi>Sala</hi> and <hi>Billychius</hi>) are so specificated, if I may so express it, that what an Acid Menstruum dissolves, an Alcalizate, or an Urinous will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, <hi>&amp; è converso</hi>; And whichsoever you choose of these three sorts of Menstruums, one of the other two will disarm, and destroy it.

And indeed the Physitians Art is so difficult, and a man must know so many things to be, though not tolerably, yet perfectly skilld in it, that it may without disparagement to Physitians, be thought yet capable of being improved, if not of being reformed. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> begins his Aphorismes with a complaint, that Life is short, but the Art long.

have observed, the Method of some of the most reputed Doctors in <hi>England</hi> (which yet, I think, is at this day as well stored with Learned Men of that profession, as any part of <hi>Europe</hi>) not only very differing, but repugnant to each other; I suppose we may without disrespect to their profession, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the most of them about those cases, about which they are reduced to disagree so much among themselves. And it would be worth an impartial disquisition, whether, since the <hi>Methodus medendi</hi> ought to be grounded on and accommodated to the Doctrine of Diseases, the new Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical discoveries formerly mention'd, and others not yet publish'd do not by innovating divers things in <hi>Pathology,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire some alterations &amp; amendments in the <hi>Methodus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi?</hi> But in this particular, I dare yet affirme nothing, and therefore shall proceed to observe to you, that the unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual efficacies of new remedies, may probably make the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of curing more compendious, because (as I lately also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated) one Medicine may be so richly Qualified, as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer several intentions, which in the common way, require diversity of Helps and Remedies. Thus, for instance in the Cure of the Kings-Evil, by the received Method, the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian must propose to himself several scopes (suited to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral indications) and prosecute them successively with distinct and appropriated Remedies. But I have (as I formerly also told you to another purpose) known a single Specifique Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, given only in small Beer, in not very many daies, without any sensible Evacuation, wast the peccant humor, appease the pains (which before were very great) and discusse the unbroken Tumours, and heal the broken ones. Thus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the known Method, the great Remedy in Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies is copious Blood-letting, which is strictly prescribed even to Aged persons and teeming Women, by the famou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56384:176"/>
of our Practitioners, and, I confess, not irrationally, where the Physician is furnisht but with vulgar Remedies: and yet by some <hi>Helmontian</hi> Medicines, we have known Plurisies cured even in young men, without Phlebotomy, and our selves some while since made a succesful trial of that Nature in a young Gentleman not unknown to you, which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not, with <hi>Helmont,</hi> to reject or so much as to dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> in this disease (for so it be moderate and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Experience shewes it frequently proves useful) nor as if we had observed all <hi>Helmonts</hi> boasted Remedies (though for the most part good ones) to be constantly succesful; but to give you an instance of the truth, of what I was saying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That new and more generous Remedies may so far alter the received <hi>Methodus Medendi,</hi> as to make divers of its prescriptions unnecessary. Of this truth, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instance might be afforded us by the Rickets, a new and abstruse Disease, at least as is supposed, and sometimes so stubborn, that one of the famousest Physicians in <hi>Europe,</hi> (whom I think I need not name) hath not been able of late to cure it in several of his own Children. And yet I suppose you may have heard that Excellent Person your Mother, several times mention her having performed divers cures (some of them improbable enough) of this Disease, barely by that slight preparation of <hi>Colcothar,</hi> lately taught you, and presented Her by us; And by which (we having made and distributed, at Her desire, a considerable quantity of it) seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Persons have freed Children from that disfiguring Sickness: Of which, but few Moneths since, your little Cousin <hi>D.</hi> being sick almost past hope, vvas a while since brought out of danger, by Gods blessing upon some of the same Remedy, wherewith we presented her Mother, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our perswasions to try it on her own Child, as she
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56384:177"/>
had successfully done on the Children of divers others. And yet this Remedie (to adde that upon the By, in favour of something to be said anon) works almost insensibly, save that in many bodies it is, especially at first, diaphoretique. And this property of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56384:179"/>
that he speaks upon his own experience; That he had a Ring made of a Metalline substance, by him called <hi>Electrum,</hi> (which, by his description, seems to be a mixture of all the Mettals joyn'd together under certain Constellations) which was of far greater Vertue then this of <hi>Helmont</hi>; For, <hi>hoc loco</hi> (sayes he) <hi>non possum non indicare admirandas quasdam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res virtutesque electri nostri,</hi>

And to this we may adde, the strange Cures mention'd by <hi>Kircherus</hi>; and confirmed to me, by a Learned Eye witness, to be frequently performed of very dangerous Diseases, in that Cave, neer <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Patients being exposed stark naked, and tyed Hand and Foot, upon Beds of Straw; and being by the <hi>Sulphureous</hi> vapour of the place and sometimes their own fear, cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a sweat, are lick'd well by a great number of peculiar kind of Serpents that inhabit that <hi>Grotta.</hi> Moreover, We oftentimes see Agues Cured by Amulets and Applications

For I consider that, in some of them, the subtle Corpuscles, (which seem to insinuate themselves into the Pores of the Body, and into the Mass of Blood, with little or no alteration) have much the like Operations with the Body whence they exhale, taken in at the Mouth. As we see in some Preparations of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which have like Vertues, inwardly given and outwardly applyed; and more manifestly in <hi>Cantharides,</hi> which I have found, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal application, to work strangly upon the Bladder, as that they excoriated it when taken into the Body; &amp; yet more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly in <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> which by inunction may be made as well to Salivate, as if it were swallow'd down. And an eminent Physitian lately complain'd to me, That washing a Childs scabby Head with a Decoction of Tobacco, to kill and dry up the Scabs, the Boy was made thereby both
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56384:180"/>
sick and drunk: And Learned Men assure us, That, by some <hi>Catharticks</hi> outwardly applyed, those may be purg'd that will not swallow Physick. But other Medicines there are, which, before they get into the Mass of Blood, are much alter'd; either in straining through the Flesh and Membranes of the Body, or in the Digestions they pass through in the Stomack, and elsewhere: And these may have very differing Effects, inwardly given and outwardly applyed; as, in the formerly mention'd instance of Hops, Currans and Salt, neither any of the Ingredients inwardly given, nor the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath been (that I know of) noted for any Febrifugal Vertues. So likewise Turpentine and Soot that inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken are good for quite other Diseases, (as Plurisies, and Obstructions of the Kidneys) outwardly applyed are the main Ingredients of <hi>Pericarpiums,</hi> extoll'd against Agues. And <hi>Mille-folium</hi> or <hi>Yarrow,</hi> besides the Vertues it hath inwardly against Diseases of quite other Natures, being worn in a little Bag upon the tip of the Stomack, was (as Himself confess'd to me) the Secret, against Agues, of a great Lord, who was very curious of Receipts and would sometimes purchase them at very great Rates; And a very famous Physitian, of my acquaintance, did since inform me, That he had used it with strange success. I know also a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happy Physitian, who assures me, That he hath very often cured, both in himself and others, the Chilblains when they come to be broken, by barely strowing on the sore parts the fine powder of Quinces thinly slic'd and dryed. And who knows what unexpected Operations divers other Bodies may have, when outwardly applyed, if various Trials of that Nature were skilfully made; especially, since we see that (for reasons elsewhere to be considered) some Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies seem to have quite contrary Operations, when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56384:180"/>
applyed and inwardly taken. For we see that Spirit of Wine does, in several cases, allay the inflammation of the external parts, which given inwardly, would quickly inflame the body.

But though, as to any outward Vertues of the same Powder, Physitians and Chymists are wont to be silent, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it may have very great ones, as well as quite differing from those it has, being taken at the Mouth.

And the same Physician assures me, that with the like Remedy he has found a strange effect in Venereal Ulcers.

(and the Disease is too unfrequent, to give occasion to have the Remedy often tried) And the Physitian adds, that one of those Patiens tels him, (the Physitian) That though her infirmity were occasion'd by a <hi>Laceratio Vesicae,</hi> yet the

Upon so severe an examination of the Symptoms made by himself, in his own House, that if, notwithstanding his solemn Professions of veracity, he mis-relate them not, I cannot wonder he should confidently impute so prodigious a Disease to some supernatural cause. But though the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, with its various Circumstances, be very well worth your perusing; yet that, for which I here take notice of it, is, what he adds about the end of it, concerning his having cured her, after he had in despair of her Recovery sent her back to her Parents, by an outward Medicine, namely, an Ointment which he found extoll'd against Pains produc'd by Witchcraft, in a Dutch Book of <hi>Carrichter</hi>'s: (where also I remember I met with it set down a little differently from what he delivers) Of which wonderful Ointment, the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that he found so extreamly difficult to procure, namely, The Misseltoe of Hazel, being in <hi>England</hi> not so rare, but that I have more then once got it, and found it, as he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, very green, and (what he mentions not) extreamly bitter, I could wish that those that have the opportunity would make tryal.

                        </gap>rs, and our Author relates of it, a Learned Physitian did highly commend it to the Judicious <hi>Gregorius Horsius.</hi> And though, if we allow it to cure bewitch'd Patients, the vertue that may be in external Remedies, will be made so much the more
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56384:183"/>
conspicuous; yet supposing the Diseases to be, though strange, yet but natural, we cannot but allow that there may be a wonderful efficacy in an outward Remedy, since it was able, onely by anointing the Joints, and those pained parts with it, to cure a radicated Disease, attended with such wonderful and horrid Symptoms. And after this it may seem but little, what else would appear a strange thing, which <hi>Helmont</hi> affirms of a Plaister he had,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Helmont, de febr.</hi> cap. 14. <hi>vers. finem.</hi>
                        </note> wherewith he tells us, That he safely cur'd hundreds of <hi>Quartans,</hi> even Autumnal, without relapse: elsewhere he saith, That he made this Plaister, for by the Circumstances I presume he means no other, <hi>of a few resolving and abstersive things</hi>; and adds,<note place="margin">

                        </note> That it never fail'd him, but onely that in fat Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons it succeeded more slowly. And yet in these, and the like ways of curing Diseases, though approv'd, if not also commended, by eminent Physitians both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, there is no sensible evacuation made of peccant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which perhaps materially remain in the Body, and may, by the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of these Remedies, be deprived of their former Qualities, and made so far obsequious to nature, that she is able, if need be, to ease her self of them by Sweat, Urine, or undiscerned transpiration.</p>
                     <p>And that the peccant Humors remaining for awhile mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially in the Body, the Disease may sometimes be removed, may appear by the Cures which we see now and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of Agues by suddain frights; by which no discernable evacuation is made of Humors, though probably some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable change be thereby produced in the temper of the mass of Blood, or in the Texture of the Morbifick Matter: (as Physitians call it) As seems probable both from divers other things mention'd here and there in this Essay, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly from the lately recited Passage of <hi>Helmont,</hi> where
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56384:183"/>
he takes notice of the rectifying of the peccant, and, by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rejected Blood, without any sensible evacuation upon the wearing of His Ring. I knew a Gentleman, a strong and a resolute Man, who had been long a Souldier, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the highest sort of Military Employments; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which, he was strangely fearful of Rats, and could not endure the sight of them: This Gentleman, having been long troubled with an obstinate <hi>Quartan,</hi> and travelled with it into several Countries, without being able to finde any Cure for it, coming at length accidentally and suddenly into a place where a great Rat was in a corner, whence he could not flie from the Gentleman, he furiously leap'd upon him (yet without biting him) and thereby put him into a fright,<note place="margin">

And the experienced <hi>Salmuth</hi> tells us a pleasant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, of one who was cured even of the Gout by a fright. For this Man having his Feet and Hands covered with a Poultis, made of Turneps, Flower and Milk, and being left in his Chair in a low Room, was, whil'st his Servants were all gone into the Garden, assaulted by a Sow, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Door open, and invited by the smell of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plasm, came to devour it; and striving to do so, flung the sick Man and the Chair to the Ground, and put him into such a fright, that our Author tells us, That that very Day his Pains decreased, and continued lessening by degrees, till at length they wholly left him, without ever returning to trouble him again. There are divers Instances that discover what great changes may be produced in the Body, without taking in any thing visibly at the Mouth. And on the other side a good Air alone doth often, in Consumptions and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diseases, perform what hath in vain been expected from the use of emptying Physick. It were to be wished that we

A great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Lady (a near Kinsvvoman, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> of yours and mine) and very far from credulous, confess'd to me, as did her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants also, that with the above mentioned Remedie of Ashes and Urine, she was not only once cured of the Yellow Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, by a Friend of hers that had observed, that she had been fruitlesly vexed by a Tedious course of Physick, prescribed by the famousest Doctor then in <hi>England</hi>; but that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards relapsing into that same Disease she had cured her self by the same Remedy. I remember, that being some years since brought almost to the brink of the Grave by a suddain effusion of Blood within my Body, from which without a signal mercy of God, I should not have recovered, among other men skilled in Physick that came to assist me, in that danger, I was visited by a Galenist of much repute, whose pale looks inviting me to enquire what it was that ailed him, he answered me, That he had not long before been despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately sick of an obstinate <hi>Marasmus,</hi> which notwithstanding all the Remedies he could use, did daily so consume him, that he appeared but a Skeleton, whereupon having found the uneffectualness of ordinary Remedies, and being hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of being relieved by them, he resolved to try a Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick Medicine, which I remember my self to have met with in <hi>Hartman.</hi> He took then an Egge, and having boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it hard in his own warme Urine, he with a Bodkin perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

the shell in many places, and then buried it in an Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil, where it was left to be devour'd by the <hi>Emmets,</hi> and as they wasted the Egge, he found his distemper to lessen, and his strength to encrease, insomuch that he now conceived his Disease to have quite left him.</p>
                     <p>The Experienc'd <hi>Riverius</hi> in his last Observations (new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publish'd since his Death) has two notable Examples to our present purpose. For <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                     <p>BUt you will now perhaps demand, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> how the Naturalist, as such, can contribute to the Credit or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the mentioned ways of curing Diseases, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the wonted weakning and painful Evacuations? In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Question, I must put you in minde, That it would be no new thing for Naturalists, not professedly Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians, to treat of this subject; and that the Naturalist may afford good Hints to the Practitioner of Physick, both upon divers other accounts already touch'd upon, and by trying on Bruits variety of hitherto untryed Medicaments or Remedies, and by suggesting to him both the Events of such Tryals, and also what hath been already observed about the cures of the Diseases incident to Beasts. For though (as we formerly told you) there are some things that are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Poysonous, as others not equally Safe, to Man and to <hi>some</hi> Bruits; yet there are other Beasts, especially Dogs and Monkeys, whose Bodies are, by many Poysons, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almost like those of Men: And since according to the old Rule, <hi>Periculum faciendum est in vili animâ,</hi> many things may be very well tryed on such Creatures, that we dare not at first venture to try on Men. We may give Dogs Poysons, onely to try the Vertue of our Antidotes; and we may give them Wounds, to make tryal of the efficacy of the Weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salve and Sympathetick Pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them into the Weapon-salve; which for that very use, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, some of them are wont to carry about them in Silver Boxes. When Oxen, and such-like Cattle, are troubled with that Disease which makes them continually turn about in one place (and is therefore called <hi>The turning Evil,</hi> or <hi>Sturdy)</hi> a common Remedy here in <hi>England,</hi>

And in imitation of these, 'tis likely that divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Experiments, of good use in Chirurgery, may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered for the relief of Man, without Endangering him in prosecuting such Discoveries. And to say nothing of the known practice of splaying Swine and Bitches; In the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood of a Country House of mine, in the West of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and probably in divers other parts, some experienc'd Shepheards have an odde way of castrating male Sheep, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Lambs, when they are grown so old that 'tis thought dangerous to geld them the common way. A Servant of mine that deals much in Cattle, and had lately divers Sheep swigg'd (as they call it) after this manner, tells me that is thus done: The Beast, on whom the Operation is to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56384:191"/>
being held by a strong Man with his Belly upwards, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other strong Man draws a string, as firmly as he can (tying it with a knot or two, to prevent its yielding or slipping off) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Testicles, as if he meant by drawing that string, to cut them off; and then anointing the part with a little fresh Butter, or some such like thing, he lets the Ram goe to feed; which for the most part (notwithstanding the anguish of this Ligature) he will begin to do in a short time: And within two or three days, the Testicles being, by the strict Ligature, denyed the Nutriment and Spirits that were wont to be conveyed to them will grow so rotten as either, together with the string, to fall off, or be very easily pull'd off, sometime stinking very rankly like Carrion. And even among those things that are already practised by Farriers, Shepherds and Graziers there are many such things as we have newly mentioned, which may serve either to enrich or illustrate the way of curing humane Bodies: Their ignorance and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousness, together with the liberty and meaness of those Creatures they physick, gives them leave to venture on any thing, having made them try upon Horses and Cattle, many such things as Physitians dare not try upon Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And among those many extravagant things, some, as it oftens happens, have succeeded so prosperously, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be considered by the skilfullest Physitians; Some of whom might, without disparagement to their Profession, do it an useful piece of service, if they would be pleased to collect and digest all the approved Experiments and Practices of the Farriers, Graziers, Butchers, and the like, which the Ancients did not despise, but honored with the Titles of <hi>Hippiatrica</hi> and <hi>Veterinaria</hi>: And among which, if I had leisure, divers things may be taken notice of, which might serve to illustrate the <hi>Methodus medendi.</hi> As to give you but

one Instance which lately occurred to me, The Usefulness of letting Blood in some cases, Which is so severely condemned by many Chymists, and the efficacy of a small, if seasonable, Evacuation, which can scarce be conceiv'd to do more then alter the course of the Blood, may be illustrated by the Staggers in Horses, and the Cure of it. For I have seen a Coach-horse, ready to drop down dead of his Disease upon the High-way, by having his Gums rubb'd with the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whip till the Blood appear'd, relieved almost in a moment so much, that though he were not well able to stand before, yet he was immediatly able to go on, and draw the Coach with his fellows.</p>

                     <p>THe next thing we are to observe to you, <hi>Pyrophilus</hi>; and on which its nature and importance will engage us somewhat long to insist, is this, That the Handling of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical matters was Antiently thought to belong to the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralist; as we are clearly informed by the judicious <hi>Celsus,</hi> in that memorable Passage, where speaking of the <hi>Origin</hi> of Physick, <hi>Primo</hi> (saies he) <hi>medendi scientia Sapientiae pars habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur</hi>;<note place="margin">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56384:192"/>
that I should perhaps be obliged to exceed the limits of an ESSAY, if I should in this Discourse insist on every thing, upon whose account the Naturalist may assist the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, if he be barely a <hi>Medicus</hi> to cure Diseases, which that you may the more readily believe, I shall Select and prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute some of these things in the remaining part of this ESSAY.</p>
                     <p>And first I shall represent to you on this subject, That the account upon which Physitians are wont to reject, if not, deride the use of such Specificks, as seem to work after a secret and unknown manner, and not by visibly Evacuating peccant humours (or by other supposedly manifest qualities) being generally this, That they see not how the promis'd Effects can well be produced by Bodies, that must work after so peculiar and undiscerned a manner; This being, I say, the great thing that hinders Physitians from endeavouring to find, or, so much as, being willing to make use of Remedies of this sort, the Naturalists may do much towards the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of this Impediment, by shewing out of such things as may be met with or performed within the Macrocosme, That such, or at least as strange operations as are ascrib'd to these Specificks, are not without Example in Nature; and consequently ought not to be rejected, barely as being impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible. And indeed the Physiologie, wherewith Physitians as well as others are wont to be imbu'd in the Schools, has done many of them no small Disservice by, accustoming them to grosse apprenhensions of Natures wayes of working. Whence it comes to passe, that not a few ev'n Learned Doctors will never expect, that any great matter should be performed in Diseases, by such Remedies as are neither ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the sence, nor Evacuate any grosse, or at least sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible matter. Whereas, very great alterations may be
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56384:193"/>
wrought in a Body, especially if Liquid, as is the Blood and peccant Humour, without the Ingresse or Egresse of any visible matter, by the intestine commotion of the parts of the same body acting upon one another, and thereby acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a differing Motion, Location (if I may so speak) or Figure, which, with the other Qualities and Effects resulting thence, may alter the motion and Texture of the Liquor, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by produce great changes in the Body that Harbours it. How much an unperceiv'd recesse of a few subtile Parts of a Liquor may alter the Nature of it, may be guess'd at, by the obvious change of Wine into Vineger; wherein upon the Avolation (or perhaps but the misplacing) of so little of the Spirituous and Sulphureous part, that it's Presence, Absence, or new Combination with the other Parts is not discernable to the Eye, the scarce decreased Liquor, becomes of a quite differing Nature from what it was. And though in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> this Degeneration be not wont to be so suddenly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by reason of the coldness of the Climate, yet in hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ies the change is much more speedily made. As in <hi>Brasil,</hi> the above mentioned <hi>Piso</hi> informes us, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Juice of the Suger Canes, which by Coction, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this I find confirm'd by a Modern and applauded <hi>French</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his Description, of some parts of the West <hi>Indies,</hi> inhabited by his Nation: And relations of the same sort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the hasty sowring of some other Liquors in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> I have had from our <hi>English</hi> Travellers and Planters. And in the East-<hi>Indies, Linschoten</hi> tells us of a change much more suddain: For speaking of the formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd

And that even very hurtful Liquors (and why not then some peccant matter in the body?) may after the like manner change their Nature may appear by what we have formerly mentioned, and is unanimously affirm'd by credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Writers of several Nations, concerning the juice of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioca,</hi> which being Poyson,<note place="margin">

That also by the bare Ingresse of some Subtile and not visible Matter, such intestine Commotions may be excited in Liquors, may appear by the sowring which has been often observed upon great Thunders to happen, not onely to wines, but to other Vinous Liquors also, as I lately received from a great Master of variety of Liquors, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint that by some Thunder, which happen'd here a few weeks since, almost all the Beer and Ale in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was spoil'd. And I remember, that when I return'd out of <hi>Italy</hi> thorow <hi>Geneva,</hi> there happen'd in that place an Earthquake, upon which, the Citizens complaind, that much of their wine was sowr'd, though I that lodg'd in the highest part of the Town, saw nothing to make me believe, that the bare Succussion of the Earth was capable to produce so great and suddain an alteration in the Wine.</p>
                     <p>That such invisible Corpuscles may passe from <hi>Amulets,</hi> or other external Remedies into the Blood and Humours, and there produce great changes, will scarce seem improbable to him that considers how perspirable according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> a living body is, and that Vegetable and Animal Body's, whose Texture is more loose and open, may well be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to send forth Expirations, since even divers Minerals are

found to do the like; as may appear by the odorable steames of rub'd Brimstone, and Amber, by the Corpuscles, which performe the Magnetick Operations, by the Emetick Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity imparted to Liquors by the Glasse of Antimony, and by <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> barely infus'd in them, without sensibly loosing any thing, either of their bulk or weight; and by the vertue of killing Wormes, wherewith Wine, and even Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has been, not only by <hi>Helmont,</hi> but by divers other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians observed to be enrich'd, after a Quantity of <hi>Quicksil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> has been for some Houres sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For we find the most fluid Body of Quicksilver <hi>has been</hi> sometimes, (I say sometimes) and therefore <hi>may,</hi> without sensible increase of <hi>Bulke,</hi> be coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by a Metalline Exhalation so, as to be cut like Lead, and to retain that solidity, 'till by some Art or other it be reduc'd to its pristine Fluidnesse. You may be inclin'd to think, that the hard and solid Body of Iron has a permanent alteration made in it's Texture, if you hold a Needle during a competent time neer the Pole of a Vigorous Loadstone without touching it. For the Magnetical <hi>Effluvia</hi> (as may very probably be conceiv'd) will so dispose the parts of the nearest extream of the Needle, as that they shall admit the steames that come from one of the Poles of the Load-stone, and not those that come from the other: whereas by skilfully holding it to the contrary Pole of the same Stone, the internal Pores, and consequently the Texture of the Needle, will presently be quite otherwise disposed in reference to the Magnetical <hi>Effluvia</hi>; as we more fully declare in another ESSAY, where we shall, I suppose, also perswade you, that the Effects of the Load-stone are performed by subtil Bodies issuing from, or passing through it. What
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56384:195"/>
we have in a former discourse told you concerning our having at pleasure changed the Poles of a Load-stone, by help of the Magnetica <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Earth, may let you see that in Stones, also such alterations are possible to be made. And in the next ESSAY save one, we shall give you another Instance, pertinent to our present purpose. For if you heat a slender piece of Steel (as a graver, or the like) red hot, and suffer it to cool leisurely in the Air, it will continue flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough, and of so soft a Texture, that you may easily make impressions on it, with any hardned Steel: But if, instead of cooling it thus slowly, you knock it into such a dry Body, as we shall there name to you, it will immediately grow so hard, as to be brittle. Which alteration, whether it be resolved to proceed from the particular <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Body, into which it is knocked, or barely from the ingresse of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscles of Cold; (if any such there be) it will be however an Instance not unfit for our purpose. And those <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that are conversant in Glass houses, may easily observe, that Glass acquires a more or lesse brittle Texture, according as (to speak in the Glass-mens language) it is baked. For if after Glasses are blown, they be quickly carried into the open Air, they are wont to be much more subject to break, then those, that after they are fashioned are placed in a kind of very long Oven (which is wont to be built over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of the like to which we may elsewhere give you Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, in some other Concretes.

A greater proof of the power of Steams upon the Body may be taken from the propagation of Infectious Diseases, which being conveyed by insensible <hi>Effluvia,</hi> from a sick into a healthy Body, are able to disorder the whole Oeconomy of it, and act those sad Tragedies, which Physitians do so often unsucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully indeavour to hinder. But you will cease to doubt, that Corpuscles, though so small as to be below the sense, should be able to performe great matters upon humane Bodies; if you consider what alterations may be therein produced by the bare actions of the parts upon one another. This may appear by the effects of several Passions of the mind, which are often excited by the bare, if attentive, thoughts of absent things. In obstinate grief and Melancholy, there is that altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in the disposition of the Heart, and perhaps some other parts by wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The bare remembrance of a loathsome Potion, does of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes produce in me (and I doubt not, but the like thought may have the like Operation in many others) a Horror, attended with a very sensible Commotion of divers parts of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56384:196"/>
my Body, especially with a kind of convulsive motion, in or about the Stomack. And what power the Passions have to alter and determine the course of the Blood, may appear yet more manifestly in modest and bashful persons, especially Women, when meerly upon the remembrance or thought of an unchast, or undecent thing, mentioned before them, the motion of the Blood will be so determin'd, as to passe suddenly and plentifully enough into the Cheeks (and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times other parts) to make them immediatly wear that livery of Vertue (as an Old Philosopher styl'd it) which we call a Blush. And even by joy, if great and sudden, I not long since saw in persons of both Sexes, not only the Cheeks and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, but it left (as to the Lady) even the Neck and Shoulders Died of that Colour. And that Passions, may not only alter the Motion of the Juyces of the Body, but likewise make some separation and evacuation of them, may appear in grief, which is wont especially in Women to make all the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requisite to weeping: whereby oftentimes a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of Briny Liquor, is excluded at the Eyes, under the forme of Tears, by which divers (especially Hysterical) Persons are wont to find themselves much refreshed, though with some it fares otherwise in teeming Women. Also that vehement desire we call Longing, may well be supposed to produce great alterations in the Body of the Mother, which leaves such strange and lasting impressions upon that of the Infant; since 'tis the Mother only, and not at all the Infant that conceives those importunate desires.</p>

                     <p>THere are many Instances to be met with in Physitians Books, to shew that Imagination is able so to alter the Imagining person's Body, as to work such a disposition in the Spirits, Blood and Humors of it, as to produce the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Disease that is excessively feared. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that soon after the last Fair Lady <hi>R.</hi> Died of the Small Pox, I chanced to meet one of her Sisters with her Mask on amongst some other Persons of High Quality, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to see her sit Maskt in such Company, her Husband (who was present) told me, That his Wife having been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily brought to Bed some while before her Sister fell sick; he had carefully kept the knowledg of her sicknesse from his Wife; least the kindnesse that was betwixt them two might prejudice her in the condition she was in, but that after, a while a Lady unawares making mention in her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of her Sisters sickness, she immediatly fancied, That she should have it too, and accordingly fell sick of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring Disease, whose Marks obliged her for a while to weare a Mask. Nor is it in Women only, but even in Men, that conceit may produce such real and lasting effects. For many authentick Histories record examples of those in whom excessive Grief or Fear has made such a change in the Colour of their Hair in a Night, as Nature would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have scarce made in divers Years. And I remember, that being about four or six Years since, in the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> there was an <hi>Irish</hi> Captain a man of middle Age and Stature, who coming with some of his followers to render himself to your Uncle <hi>Broghill,</hi> who then commanded the English Forces in those parts upon a publick profer of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56384:197"/>
to the <hi>Irish</hi> that would then lay down Arms, he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually in a suspicious Place, met with by a party of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> and intercepted. And my Brother being then absent, upon a designe, he was so apprehensive of being put to Death, by the inferiour officers, before your Uncles returne, that that Anxiety of mind quickly changed the Colour of his Hair after a peculiar manner: of which I being then at that Castle of your Unkles whereunto he was brought) had quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notice given me, and had the Curiosity to examine this Captain, and found that the Hair of his H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ad, had not (as in the instances I had met with in Histories) uniformely chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged its Colour, but that here and there certain peculiar Tufts and locks of it, whose <hi>Bases</hi> might be about an inch in <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter</hi> were thus suddenly turned White all over: the rest of his Hair (of which you know the <hi>Irish</hi> use to weare good store) retaining it's former Reddish Colour.</p>
                     <p>[You will mistake my design <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> if you conclude from what I have said, concerning the Power of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> to work upon the Body that I am either so much an <hi>Helmonti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> as to condemne the Use of all those Remedies that make such more grosse Evacuations (if I may so call them) as are made by Vomit, Seige, and the like; or that I would have you, or am my self so credulous, as to believe all the Vertues that are, ev'n by Eminent Writers ascribed to the Remedies called Specificks: For (to mention here but this) we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that the hopes built upon ev'n excellent Specificks, unlesse they be of such a resolving and abstersive Nature, as to be able to make way for themselves into the Recesses of the Body are oftentimes disappointed, where some Emetick or Cathartick Remedy has not been first us'd to free the Stomack and Guts from those viscous Humours, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the first passages much enervate the Vertue of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56384:198"/>
Remedy, if they do not altogether deny it accesse to the innermost parts of the Body. That then which I aim at, is first to keep you from being prejudiced by the Confidence of some Learned Doctors, who laugh at the very name of Specificks, and will not allow any Disease to be curable, but by visible Evacuations of store of what they call peccant Matter; And next to give you cause to think that such Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificks, as men of judgment and credit do recommend upon their own Experience ought not to be rejected without Trial, upon the bare account of their not being either Lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative or Vomitive, Sudorifick, or Diuretical; Nay, nor so much as for this, that they are not endow'd with any Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Degree of any manifest Quality, such as Heat, Cold, Drinesse, Odor, Tast, Astriction and the like; nor able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance to work any considerable alteration in a healthy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body. For I consider the Body of a living man, not as a rude heap of Limbs and Liquors, but as an Engine consisting of several parts so set together, that there is a strange and conspiring communication betwixt them, by vertue whereof, a very weak and inconsiderable Impression of adventitious matter upon some one part may be able to work on some other distant part, or perhaps on the whole Engine, a change far exceeding what the same adventitious Body could do upon a Body not so contriv'd. The faint motion of a mans little Finger upon a small piece of Iron that were no part of a Engine, would produce no considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Effect; but when a Musket is ready to be Shot off, then such a Motion being applied to the Trigger by vertue of the cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with great noise throw's out the ponderous Leaden Bullet with violence enough to kill a Man at Seven or Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot distance. And that also the Engine of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body is so fram'd, as to be capable of receiving great alterations from seemingly slight Impressions of outward Objects, upon the bare account of its particular contrivance, may appear by several instances beside those which may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this Argument in the foregoing part of this ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAY. When a man goes suddenly out into the Sun, it often happens, that those beames which light upon his Head, and would not in so short a time have any discernable effect on the least Hair of it, do allmost in a moment produce that strange and violent motion in the head and almost all the Body, which we call Sneezing. Men that from the top of some Pinacle or other high and steep place do look down to the bottome of it are at first very apt by the bare prospect, (which yet convey's nothing into the Body but those images, if yet there intervene corporeal ones in sensation of visible Objects that enter at the Eye) to become so giddy, that they are reduced to turne away their Eyes from the Praecipice for fear of not being able to stand upon their Leggs. And many that look'd fixedly upon a Whirle poole, or upon a very swift stream have had such a Vertiginous Motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by impressed on their Spirits, that they have been unable to keep their Bodies upright, but have fallen into the Water they gazed on.

upon my self when I had a mind for healths sake to be put into a fit of Sea sicknesse. If a person be very Ticklish and you but gently stroke the Sole of his Foot with the top of a Feather, that languid Impression on the bottome of the foot shall, whether he will or no, put all those Muscles and other parts into motion, which are requisite to make that noise, and to exhibite that shape of the Face (so farre distant from the feet) which we call Laughing; and so the gentle Motion of a straw tickling the Nostrils is able to excite Sneezing.

The smoak of burnt feathers, or Tobacco blown upon the face of an Hysterical Woman, does oftentimes almost as suddenly recover them out of Fits of the Mother, as the odour of per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56384:201"/>
thrown upon a Pan of Embers, plac'd just under the Patient, who is to continue in that posture, and to receive the Fume as long as he can endure it without too much fainting. And when I mention'd one of the Cures that was thus perform'd, to one that is look'd upon as a Master of Chymical <hi>Arcana</hi> against Diseases; he preferr'd before it (as he saies upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) the shavings of Harts-horn us'd after the same manner, and the Remedy seems not irrational. But if in this distemper, the Actual heat applied to the abovemention'd parts of the Body concurre not to the Effect, we may too, warrantably enough, adde that Cures may be perform'd by far more minute corpuscles then those of smoke, insinuating themselves from without into the Body. For I know a very dextrous Goldsmith, who, when he over heats himself, as he often unawares does at hammering of Plate, is subject to fall into Gripings of the Belly, which lead to Fluxes; but his usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and ready Cure is, assoon as conveniently he can, to heat his Anvil, and sit upon it for a great while together, heating it hot again if there be need. But to return to our Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Smoaks, 'tis known that some find more good against the Fits of the Colick, by Glysters of the Smoak of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> then by any other Physick they take; so that I know wealthy persons, that relying upon the benefit they find by this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, have left off sending for their Physitians to ease them of the Colick.

And I remember, that lately I met with a Gentleman curious and intelligent, who, as himself assur'd me, was by the Scurvy and ill condition'd Ulcers, and other obstinate distempers brought so low, that he was scarce able to turn himself freely in his Bed, and thereupon resolv'd against taking any more Physick, partly out of despair of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and partly out of wearinesse of the tedious courses of Physick the Doctors had in vain made him passe thorow: But that some o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>ANd since we have represented a humane Body as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, we shall adde, That it may be altered both for the better and for the worse, by such bare motions or impulses of external Bodies, as act but in a gross and confessedly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical manner: For 'tis known, that out of such speedily killing, unless seasonably remedy'd Distempers, as Fits of Swounding, Patients of either Sex are often recovered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inward Medicine, by being barely pinch'd in several places. I, that have endured great and dangerous Sicknesses, have scarce ever found any so violent for the time, as that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the bare motion and smell of a Ship and Sea Air hath put me into, especially in rough weather, till I was somewhat accustomed to Navigation; and yet this violent and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sickness, as it was not produced by any peccant Humor in the Body, so it was quickly removed by the Air, and Quiet of the Shore, without the help of Physick. And the like may be observed more suddenly in the newly mentioned Instances of those in whom, as the bare agitation of a Coach will produce such violent Fits of Vomiting and such Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that I have known some of them apprehend they should presently die; so the bare cessation of that discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing motion soon relieved them. We see in our Stables, what operation, the currying of them carefully, hath upon

                     <p>I Might also, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> confirm what I told you, when I said, That Sickness may produce such an alteration in the Fabrick of the Body, as to make it capable to be very much affected, as well for the better as for the worse, by such things that would not scarce at all affect it if it were sound, from the consideration of those many and strange <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>Peculiarities,</hi> to be met with in some Persons in Sickness and in Health. For though many of these differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween healthy Men, are not likely to be greater then may be observ'd between the same Man when well, and himself as the Oeconomy of his Body may be dis-compos'd by some Distemper; yet we often see, that some Persons have the Engine of their Body so fram'd, that it is wonderfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered by such things as either work not at all on others, or work otherwise on them: as it is common enough for Men to be hugely disturb'd, and some of them to fall into Fits of trembling or swooning, upon the sight or hearing of a Cat. And to such an affection I know a very eminent Commander obnoxious, Your late Unkle, the last Earl of <hi>Barrymore,</hi> a very gallant Noble Man, and who did his Country great Service in the Irish Wars, had the like apprehension for <hi>Tansey.</hi> I cannot see a Spider near me, without feeling a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table commotion in my Blood, though I never received harm from that sort of Creature, and have no such abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring against Vipers, Toads, or other venomous Animals. You know an excellent Lady (marryed to a Great Person that hath more then once govern'd <hi>Ireland)</hi> whose Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to Hony, which is much talked of in that Country, hath display'd it self upon several occasions: notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:56384:205"/>
which, her experienc'd Physitian imagining that there might be something of conceipt in her Aversion, took an opportunity to satisfie himself, by mixing a little Hony, with other Ingredients, of a Remedy which he applyed to a very slight and inconsiderable cut or scratch, which she chanced to get on h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The same excellent Lady, I remember, complained to me, That when she was troubled with Coughs, all the Vulgar, Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Pulmoniack Remedies did her no good, so that she could find relief in nothing but either the Fume of powdred Amber, taken with convenient Hearbs in a Pipe, or that <hi>Balsamum Sulphuris</hi> which we have already taught you in this Essay.</p>
                     <p>[I know a Person of Quality, tall and strongly made, who lately asked my Opinion, Whether, when he had need of Vomit, he should continue to make use of Cauphy, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it wrought so violently with him: This gave me the occasion, as well as curiosity, of enquiring particularly both of Himself and his Lady, concerning this odde Operation of Cauphy upon him; and I was told, That an ordinary Wine-glass full of the usual warm decoction of Cauphy, boyl'd in common Water, was wont, within about two hours, to prove emetick with him, and before Noon did give him eight, ten, or sometimes twelve Vomits, with so much violence, that he was less affected by the infusion of <hi>Crocus metallorum,</hi> or other usual emeticks, and therefore was deliberating whether he should not change Cauphy for

And you may remember, that the same Author formerly told us, in effect, that as great and salutary changes may be produced even in humane Bodies, where he relates, That he had known those that had eaten several sorts of Poyson, Snatch'd, in a trice, from imminent death, by onely drinking some of the Infusion of the Root he calls <hi>Jaborandi</hi>; and this, after I know not how many <hi>Alexipharmaca</hi> and <hi>Theri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal</hi> Antidotes had been fruitlesly administred.</p>
                     <p>You will perchance tell me, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that these three or four last Instances are of Poysonous Distempers and their Antidotes; not of ordinary Diseases, and their Specifick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. But to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s I have a double Answer: and First, Many of those Distempers that proceed from Poyson, are really Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and both call'd by that Name, and treated of, as such, by Physitians. And indeed they may well look upon them but as Diseases, exasperated by a virulent Malignity, which yet appears to be not always easily distinguishable from that of Diseases that proceed not from Poyson, by this, That other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Physitians of Princes and great Men, if after having
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56384:207"/>
considered all the inward Parts of their dis-bowell'd Patients, could not so often doubt and dispute, as they do, whether or no Poyson were accessary to their death. And <hi>Piso</hi> (who learn'd divers of their detestable Secrets from the <hi>Brasilians</hi>) relates, That some of them are so skilful in the cursed Art of tempering and allaying their Poysons, that they will often hinder them from disclosing their deleterial Nature for so long a time, that the subtle Murtherers do as unsuspectedly as fatally, execute their Malice or Revenge. These Diseases indeed are wont to differ in this from Surfeits, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling ordinary Diseases; that in the one, the venomous matter that produceth the Disease, is at first much more small, then in the other the morbifick Matter is wont to be. But the activity of this little quantity of hostile Matter doth make it so pernicious, that the Disorders it produceth in the Body, being much greater then that of ordinary Sicknesses is; the cure of such Distempers is the fitter to manifest how powerfully Nature may be succour'd, by Remedies that work not by first or second Qualities, since such are able to deliver Her from Diseases heightned by a peculiar and venomous malignity.</p>
                     <p>To this first I shall subjoyn my next, which is, That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Passages of the former Discourse (especially what we have related concerning the cure of Agues, of the Rickets, and of the Kings-Evil) may satisfie you, That even of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diseases (some at least) may be as well cured by Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks, as those produced by Poyson are by Antidotes.</p>
                     <p>You may also say, <hi>Pyrophilus, But what if a recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>First, That though it is better for a Patient to be cured by a rashly an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ter having done all that his Art prescribed to save him, deserves more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation then he th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nceth to cure his Patient by an irrational course. And therefore in such a case as you put, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I think the Physitian ought to be very well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the matter of Fact, before he venture to try such a Remedy, especially if more ordinary and unsuspected means have not been imploye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56384:209"/>
and keeping them from those effectual Courses, whereby they may potently <hi>alter</hi> the Engine of the Body; and by rectifying the Motion and Texture of its Parts, both consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent and fluid, may bring Nature to their bent, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom Her to such convenient Courses of the Blood and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juices, and such fit times and ways of evacuating (what is noxious or superfluous <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> as may prevent or cure divers stubborn Diseases, more happily then the vulgar Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodists are wont to do.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, it is scarce to be expected, that till men have a better Knowledg of the Principles of Natural Philosophy, without which 'tis hard to arrive at a more comprehensive Theory of the various possible causes of Diseases, and of the contrivance and uses of the parts of the Body, the Method which supposes this Knowledg should be other then in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things defective, and in some erroneous, as I am apt to think, the vulgar Method may be shewn to be as to some particular Diseases. Of this I may perhaps elsewhere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you more particularly with my suspicions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall now only mention the last Observation of this kind I met with, which was in a Gentleman, You and I very well know, who being for some Months much troubled with a difficulty of breathing, and having been unsuccesfully treated for it by very Eminent Physitians, we at last suspected, that 'twas not the Lungs, but the Nerves that serv'd to move the Diaphragme and other Organs of respiration, upon whose distemper this suppos'd <hi>Asthma</hi> depended, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly by a taking or two of a Volatile Salt of ours, which is very friendly to the <hi>genus Nervosum,</hi> he vvas quickly freed from his trouble some distemper, which afterwards he was fully perswaded did not proceed from any stuffing up of the Lungs. To be short, how much esteem soever
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56384:209"/>
we have for Method, yet since that it self and the Theories whereon men ground it, are, as to divers particular Diseases, so hotly disputed of; even among Eminent Physitians, that in many cases a man may discerne more probability of the successe of the Remedy, then of the truth of the received Notion of the Disease; In such abstruse cases me-thinks it were not amiss to reflect upon that reasoning of the auncient Empericks (though on a somewhat differing occasion) which is thus somewhere express'd by <hi>Celsus: Neque se dicere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silio medicum non egere, &amp; irrationabile Animal hanc artem posse praestare, sed has latentium rerum conjecturas ad rem non pert nere; Quia non intersit, quid morbum faciat, sed quid tollat.</hi> And as the controverted Method in the abovemention'd Diseases is not yet establish'd or agreed on in the Schools themselves, so divers of those that are wholly strangers to those Schools, do yet by the help of Experience and good Specificks, and the Method their Mother-wit does, according to emergencies, prompt them to take, perform such conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cures, that <hi>Piso</hi> sticks not to give this Testimony to the utterly Unlearned <hi>Brasilian</hi> Empericks. <hi>Interim,</hi>

                     <p>This I have made out to some ingenious Men, by shewing, that though Sallet Oyl be generally reputed to consist of Fat and Unctuous Particles, and therefore to be a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sister of Corrosion; yet it containes in it sharp and piercing parts, which meeting with a disposed subject, do more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully operate then the more purely Oleaginous ones. As we endeavoured to evince by keeping for a short while in a gentle warmth, some pure Oyl-Olive, upon a quantity of Filings of ev'n crude Copper: For from them the Liquor extracted an high Tincture betwixt Green and Blew, like that which such Filings would have given to Distill'd Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which according to Chymists Notions obtains that Colour, by making with its Acid and Corrosive Salt a real solution of some part of the Copper, as may appear by the recoverablenesse of the metal out of it. Another proof or two of the Acrimony of some of the parts of Oyl we may elswhere give you. But now we shall rather confirme our Answer to your Question, by two or three Examples of Cures perform'd by unlikely Remedies.</p>
                     <p>I went once to visit an Ingenious <hi>Helmontian,</hi> whom I found Sick on his Bed, and having by the Symptomes of his Disease, discern'd it to be a <hi>Pleurisy,</hi> I talk'd with him of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably opening a Veine, but he was resolv'd against it, and told me he would cure himself by a remedy, which at first seems as likely to encrease such a disease as Phlebotomy is to cure it, namely by the use of Helmonts <hi>Laudanum Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum</hi> which in effect did in three or four daies cure him, and since he without Blood letting cur'd some others with it; which I the lesse wonder at, because of my having observ'd

                     <p>I have oftentimes seen Coughs strangly abated by the use of a Remedy, which I have not long since told you, how I prepare: and with which (I remember) in a pretty Child you (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) know, and who is now very well, I was so happy as to represse in a few Houres a violent Cough, that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her with Speedy Death, and yet this Medicine has so eminent a saltnesse, that the Tongue can scarce suffer it; and how much the use of Salt things is by many Physitians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem'd in Coughs (and indeed in many cases not without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) I need not tell You.

melted, and mingled, in a certain proportion to make it fit to be taken, in a Pipe, with beaten Amber or a Cephalick Herb. The particular circumstances of his Method, I cannot now set you down, not having by me the Paper wherein they were Noted, but if I mistake not the Herb, with which he mingl'd the Brimstone or Flower of <hi>Sulphur</hi> was Coltsfoot or Betony; and I well remember, that what he look'd upon as the chief and specifick Remedy in his way of curing, was the smoak of the <hi>Sulphur</hi>; the other ingredients being added, not so much for their being proper enough for the Disease, as their helping to fill the Pipe, and thereby to allay the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, wherewith the Smoak, if afforded by a Pipe fill'd with Brimstone alone, would be qualify'd.

Now we know that Physitians generally, and in most cases justly, forbid Acid things to those that have exulcerated or tender Lungs, and how highly Acid and piercing the Smoak of <hi>Sulphur</hi> is, the Chymists can best tell you, who by catching it and condensing it in Glasses shap'd almost like Bells obtain from it that very corrosive Liquor, which readily dissolves Iron, being the very same that is commonly call'd <hi>Oleum Sulphuris per campanam,</hi> and yet it seems that either the Theory of Consumptions is misunderstood, or
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56384:213"/>
that the drying quality of the Sulphureous steam, and its great power to resist putrefaction, and as it were embalm the Lungs and season the Blood are considerable enough to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the Harm which its Acidity may do.</p>

And I remember also, That some years since I had occasion to give it to the Wife of a very ingenious Physitian, of whom the Midwives and her Husband almost despair'd, and (as she afterwards told me her self) each Dose made her throwes (which before had left her) returne, and at length she was safely delivered she scarce knew how. But I found double the Dose prescrib'd by <hi>Helmont,</hi> requisite to be used at last; and that the quantity of a Walnut of the Powder of these Livers given in Rhenish or White-wine, and when the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack was most empty, was no more then such a case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>

To take unsalted Butter, and boil it gently 'till a pretty part were consum'd, Skimming it diligently from time to time, whil'st it stands over the fire, and of this Butter melted, to give now and then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable quantity, according as the Patient is able to bare it. A Remedy which at the first proposal may seem more likely to put a man into a Flux then to cure him of one. And yet the same Remedy which he suppos'd to benefit by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating the sharp humours and preserving the Entrals from their Corrosion was afterwards much commended to me by

                     <p>I Should not here, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> adde any thing to what I have allready said above in favour of the use of even odde Specificks, but that finding at every turn, that the main thing, which does (really or in pretence) prevail with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Learned Physitians (especially in a famous University You have visited abroad) to reject Specificks, is, That they cannot clearly conceive the distinct manner of the Specificks working, and think it utterly improbable, that such a Medicine which must passe through Digestions in the Body, and be whirl'd about with the Mass of Blood to all the parts, should, neglecting the rest, shew it self Friendly to the Brain, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or the Kidnies, and fall upon this or that Juyce or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, rather then any other.

For I confesse, that to me, even many of the vulgar Operations of common Drugs seem not to have been h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>therto intelligibly explain'd by Physitians, who are yet, for ought I have observ'd, to seek for an account of the manner, how Diureticks, how Sudorificks, how Sarcoticks, and how many other familiar sorts of Medicines, which those that consider them but slightly are wont to think they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand throughly, perform their operations. Nay, I much question, whether the generality of Physitians can yet give us a satisfactory account, why any sort of Medicine purges in general: And he that in particular will shew me, where either the Peripatetick or Galenical Schools, have intelligibly made out, why <hi>Rhubarb</hi> does particularly purge Choler, and <hi>Senna</hi> more peculiarly Phlegm, <hi>Erit mihi magnus Apollo.</hi> For I see not how from those narrow and barren Principles of the four Elements, the four Humours, the four first Qualities (and the like;) Effects, far lesse abstruse then the Operations of Purging Medicines, can satisfactorily be deduc'd. Nor can I find, that any thing makes those Physitians, that are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Philosophy that explains things by the Motions, Siz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="282" facs="tcp:56384:215"/>But (which is the next thing I have to represent) if we duely make use of those fertile and comprehensive Principles of Philosophy, the Motions, Shapes, Magnitudes and Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Minute parts of Matter, it will not perhaps be more difficult to shew, at least in general, that Specificks may have such Operations, as are by the judicious and experienc'd ascrib'd to them, then it will be for those that acquiesce in the vulgar Principles of Philosophy and Physick, to render the true Reasons of the most obvious and familiar operations of Medicines. And though the same Objection that is urg'd to prove, That a Specifick cannot befriend the Kidnies, for Example, or the Throat, rather then any other parts of the Body, lies against the noxiousness of Poysons to this or that determinate part; Yet experience manifests that some Poysons do respect some particular part of the Body, without equally (if at all sensibly) offending the rest: as we see that <hi>Cantharides</hi> in a certain Dose are noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Kidnies and Bladder, Quicksilver to the Throat, and the glanduls thereabouts, <hi>Strammoneum,</hi> to the Brain, and <hi>Opium</hi> to the Animal Spirits and <hi>Genus Nervosum.</hi> And if You call to mind, what we have formerly deduc'd to make it out, That a Humane Body is an Engine, and that Medicines operate in it as finding it so; we need not think it so strange, that there being many Strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if I may so call them, of differing Textures, such as the Liver, Spleen, and Kidnies, and perhaps divers local Ferments residing in particular parts, and a Mass of Blood continually streaming through all the parts of the Body, a Medicine may be quickly by the Blood carried from any one part to any other, and the Blood, or any Humour mingl'd with it, may be as easily carried to the Medicine, in what parts soever it be,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56384:215"/>
and the Remedy thus admitted into the Masse of Blood, may in its passage through the Strainers, be so alter'd, either by leaving some of its parts there, or by having them alter'd by the abovemention'd Ferments, or by being associated with some other Corpuscles, it may meet within its passage; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Size, or Figure, or Motion of its small parts may be chang'd, or in a word it may by some of those many other waies, which might, if this ESSAY were not too Prolix already, be propos'd, and deduc'd, receive so great an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in reference either to some or other of the Strainers, or other firmer parts of the Body, or to the distemper'd Blood, or some other fluid and peccant matter, that it needs not seem impossible, That by that time the Medicine (crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd as it were into Minute Corpuscles) arrives at the <hi>part</hi> or <hi>humour</hi> to be wrought upon, it may have a notable Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration there. I mean <hi>Part as well</hi> as <hi>Humour,</hi> because the Motion, Size, or Shape of the Medicinal Corpuscles in the Blood, though not by sense distinguishable from the rest of the Liquor they help to compose, may be so conveniently qualify'd as to shape, bulk, and motion, as to restore the Strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to their right Tone or Texture, as well as the Blood to its free and Natural course, by resolving and carrying away with them such tenacious matter, as stuff'd, or choak'd up the slender passages of the Strainer, or at least Straitned its pores, or vitiated their Figure; And the same Sanative Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscles may perchance be also fitted to stick to, and thereby to strengthen such Fibres of the Strainers, or such other fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parts of the Body, as may need congruous Corpuscles to fill up their little unsupply'd C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I see not why it should be more inconceivable that a Specifick should have a peculiar Vertue to free the Body from this or that peccant Humour, and a benign congruity to the distemper'd Spleen or Liver, then that some Cathartick should purge Electively, and some Antidotes have peculiar Vertues against such Poysons, whose Malignity particularly invades the Brain or Kidnies, or some other determinate part: the former of which the Physitians, we reason with, scruple not to teach; and the latter of which is taught us not by them only, but by Experience too.</p>

                        <hi>France,</hi> who, many Years ago following the Wars in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> fell into a violent Distemper of his Eyes, which, in spight of what Physitians and Chirurgions could do, did in a few Moneths so increase, that he lost the use of both his Eyes, and languish'd long in a confirm'd Blindness; which continued till he heard of a certain Emperick at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> commonly known by the name of <hi>Adrian Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker</hi> (for indeed he was a Glasier) who being cry'd up for prodigious Cures he had done with a certain Powder, this Colonel resorted to him, and the Emperick having discours'd with him, undertook his Recovery, if he would undergo the torment of the Cure; which the Colonel having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to do, the Chirurgion made him snuff up into each Nostril, about a Grain of a certain <hi>Mercurial</hi> Powder, which, in a strangely violent manner, quickly wrought with him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all imaginable ways, as by Vomit, Siege, Sweat, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, Spitting and Tears, within ten or twelve hours that this Operation lasted, making his Head also to swell very much: But within three or four days after this single taking of the Drastick Medicine had done working, he began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover some degree of Sight, and within a Fortnight attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to such a one, that himself assur'd the Relater, He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was so Sharp-sighted before his Blindness. And the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later assured me, that he had taken pleasure to observe, That this Gentleman, who is his familiar Acquaintance, would discern Objects farther and clearer then most other Men. He added, That <hi>Monsieur de Vatteville</hi> told the Relater, he had purchas'd the way of making this Powder of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and had given it to an eminent Chirurgion, one <hi>Benoest</hi> (an Acquaintance of the Relaters) by whom he had been cured of a Musket-shot that had broken his Thigh-bone, when the other Chirurgions would have proceeded to amputation;

and that this <hi>Benoest</hi> had with this Powder, administred as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is related, cur'd a Gentlewoman of a <hi>Cancer</hi> in the Breast.

But in what other stubborn and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Cases they use this Powder, I do not particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. The Preparation of it, which a Chymist did me the favor to tell me by word of mouth, as a thing himself had also made, was in short this: That the Remedy was made by precipitating Quick-silver, with good Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, and so making a <hi>Turbith,</hi> which is afterwards to be dulcified by abstracting twenty, or twenty five, times from it pure Spirit of Wine, of which fresh must be taken at every abstraction. But I would not advise you to recommend so furious a Powder to any, that is not a very skilful Chymist and Physitian too, till you know the exact Preparation, and particular uses of it; the reason of my mentioning it here, being but that which I expressed at the entrance upon this Narrative.]</p>

too much confine our hopes, when we think, that one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Remedy can scarce be effectual in several Diseases, if their causes be supposed to be a little differing. For, the <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of Diseases is not, I fear, so accurate and certain as to make it fit for us to neglect the manifest or hopeful Vertues of noble Remedies, where ever we cannot reconcile them to that <hi>Theory.</hi> He that considers what not unfrequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in distempered Bodies by the <hi>Metastasis</hi> of the Morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique matter (as for instance, how that which in the Lungs caused a violent cough removed up to the head may produce (as we have observed) a quick decay of Memory and Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination, and a Palsie in the Hands and other Limbs) may enough discerne that Diseases that appear very differing, may easily be produced by a peccant matter of the same nature only variously determined in its operations by the constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the parts of the body where it setleth: and consequently it may seem probable to him, that the same searching Medicine being endowed with qualities destructive to the texture of that Morbifique matter, where ever it finds it, may be able to cure either all, or the greatest part, of the Diseases which the various translation of such a Matter ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, it oftentimes happens that Diseases, that seem of a contrary nature, may proceed from the same cause variously circumstantiated; or (if you please) that of divers Diseases, that may both seem primary, the one is but Symptomatical or at most Secundary in relation to the other; as a Dropsy and a slow Feaver may, to unskilfull men, seem Diseases of a quite contrary nature, (the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reputed a hot and dry, the other a cold and moist Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) though expert Physitians know they may both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the same Cause, and be cured by the same Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: And in women experience manifests, that a great variety

of differing Distempers, which by unskilful Physitians have been adjudged distinct and primary Diseases, and have been, as such, unsuccessfully dealt with by them, may really be but disguised Symptomes of the distempers of the Mother or <hi>Genus Nervosum</hi>; and may, by Remedies reputed <hi>Antihyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,</hi> be happily removed. To which purpose I might tell you, <hi>Pyro.</hi> That I, not long since, knew a Practitioner, that with great success used the same Remedies (which were chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Volatile and Resolving Salts) in Dropsies, and in (not, Symptomatical, but) Essential Feavers. And our selves have lately made some Experiments of not much unlike na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with a preparation of Harts-horn, of equal use in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Coughs, both of them primary. I might on this occasion recur to divers of the Remedies formerly mentioned in several places of this Essay; since divers of them have been found effectual against Diseases, which, according to our common Theory, seem to be little of kin one to another: And by telling you what I have observed concerning the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious operations of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s <hi>Laudanum,</hi> of our <hi>Ens Veneris,</hi> and even of a Medicine devised by a Woman, the Lady <hi>Kents</hi> Powder, I might illustrate what I have lately delivered: But it is high time for me to pass on to another Subject; and therefore I shall rather desire you, in general, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether or no several Differing Diseases, and ev'n some commonly supposed to be of contrary natures, be not yearly cured by the <hi>Spaa waters</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>

No, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> without peremptorily assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, I have but barely represented the Notions I have mention'd concerning the <hi>Methodus medendi,</hi> as things probable enough to deserve to be impartially considered; That in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which Usefulness, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> if I have in any considerable measure been so happy as to make out, I shall not think the time (and much less the pains) I have bestow'd upon that Theme, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spent. For, I must confess to you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that to me it seems, that few things ought more to endear to us the Study of <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> then that (according to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Sentence of our <hi>Celsus, Rerum Naturae contemplatio,</hi> saith he, <hi>quam vis non faciat Medicum, aptiorem tamen Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinae reddit</hi>) a deeper insight into Nature may enable Men to apply the Physiological Discoveries made by it (though some more immediately, and some less directly) to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and Improvement of Physick.</p>
                     <p>And I well enough know, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that if instead of Writing this Essay to such an one as You, I should Write it to the more critical and severer sort of Readers, they would be apt to think both that it is impertinent for me, who do not

profess to be a Physitian, to treat prolixly of Matters Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal; and that it may appear somewhat below me, in a Book, whose Title seems to promise you Philosophical Matters, to insert I know not how many Receipts: But I shall not scruple to tell such a Person as <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> That since my Method requir'd that I should say something to you of the <hi>Therapeutical</hi> part of Physi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

And as for the inserting of Receipts, even in Books of Philosophical Subjects, I have not done it altogether without example. For not onely <hi>Pliny,</hi> a Person of great Dignity as well as Parts, and Friend to one of the greatest <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, hath left us in a Book, where he handles many Philosophical Matters, store of particular Receipts; but our great Chancellor, The Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> hath not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to Record some. And as for that Industrious Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to Experimental Knowledge, the Learned and Pious <hi>Mersennus,</hi> his Charity made him much more fearful to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the doing what good he could to others, then to venture to lessen his Reputation by an <hi>Indecorum,</hi> that in a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Book, and in a Chapter of Arithmetical Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, he brings in not onely a Remedy against the <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipelas,</hi> but even a Medicine for Corns, where he tells us, That they may be taken away, by applying and daily renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ten days, or a fortnight, the middle Stalk that grows between the Blade and the Root (for that I suppose he means by the unusual Word <hi>Thallum</hi>) of Garlick, bruis'd. Nor is
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56384:224"/>
it without Examples, though somewhat contrary to my Custom in my other Writings, that in this, and the four precedent Essays, I have frequently enough alledged the Testimonies of others, and divers times set down Processes or Receipts, not of my own devising. For even among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and learned Physitians, scarce any thing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, then on Subjects far less of kin to Paradoxes, then most of those I have been discoursing of, to make use of the Testimonies and Observations of other approved Writers, to confirm what they teach. And not now to mention the voluminous Books of <hi>Schenkius</hi> and <hi>Scolzius,</hi> that famous and experienc'd Practitioner <hi>Riverius</hi> himself, hath not been ashamed to publish together a good number of Receipts, given him by others, under the very Title of <hi>Observationes communicatae</hi>: And <hi>Henricus ab Heer,</hi> hath, among his <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servationes oppido rarae,</hi> divers Receipts that came from Mountebancks, and even Gypsies. And therefore I hope that you, who know that it is not after every Body that I would so much as relate an Observation, or mention a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, as thinking them probable, will easily excuse one that hath much fewer Opportunities then a profess'd Physitian to try Remedies himself; if treating of Subjects not so fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, I choose to countenance what I deliver by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of skilful Men, and if I scruple not to preserve in these Papers some not despicable Remedies, as well of abler Men as of my own, that otherwise would probably be lost. But of this Practise I may elsewhere have occasion to give you a more full Apology, by shewing how much it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the enriching and advancement of Physick; an Art, with whose praises I could long entertain You, if I were at leisure (and durst allow my self) to exhaust common places.</p>

                        </gap> challenge from him, that I wonder not so much at those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Heathens, that being Polytheists and Idolaters, thought themselves oblig'd, either to refer so useful an Art as that of Physick, to the Gods or God-like Persons; or to adde those, that excell'd in so noble a Faculty, to the number of those they worshipp'd. For my part, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> a very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and sickly Constitution of my own, much (impair'd by such unhappy Accidents as Falls, Bruises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) hath, besides (as I hope) better motives of Compassion, given me so great a sense of the uneasinesses that are wont to attend Sickness, that I confess, if I study Chymistry, 'tis very much out of hope, that it may be usefully imploy'd against stubborn Diseases, and relieve some languishing Patients with less pain and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then otherwise they are like to undergoe for Recovery. And really, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> unless we will too grosly flatter our selves, we can scarce avoid both discerning and deploring the ineffectualness of our vulgar Medicines, not onely <hi>Galenical,</hi> but Chymical; (for an active Body may yet be but a languid Remedy.) For besides that many that recover upon the use of them, endure more for Health, then many that are justly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd among Martyrs, did for Religion; Besides this, I say, we daily meet with but too many in the case of that bleeding Woman, mention'd in the Gospel, of whom 'tis said, That she had suffer'd many things of many Physitians,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mark</hi> 5.26.</note> and had spent all that she had, and was nothing better'd, but rather grew worse. And therefore I reckon the investigation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging of useful Truths in Physick, and the discovering and recommending of good Remedies among the greatest and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56384:225"/>
most extensive Acts of Charity, and such, as by which a Man may really more oblige Man-kinde, and relieve more distressed Persons, then if he built an Hospital. Which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will not think rashly said, if you please but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how many the knowledge of the Salivating, and other active Properties of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and of its enmity to putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Distempers springing thence, have cur'd of several Diseases, and consequently how many more Patients, then have recover'd in the greatest Hospital in the world, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to <hi>Carpus</hi> and those others, who ever they were, that were the first discoverers of the medical efficacy of <hi>Quick-sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> And for my own particular, <hi>Pyroph.</hi> though my Youth and Condition forbid me the practice of Physick, and though my unhappy Constitution of Body, kept divers Remedies from doing me the same good they are wont to do others; yet having more then once, <hi>prepar'd,</hi> and sometimes occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally had opportunity to <hi>administer,</hi> Medicines, which God hath been so far pleas'd to bless on others, as to make them Relieve several Patients, and seem (at least) to have snatch'd some of them almost out of the jaws of death; I esteem my self by those successes alone sufficiently recompenc'd for any toil and charge my Enquiries into Nature may have cost me.

                     <p>I Scarce doubt, but it will be exspected that I should annex to the foregoing Treatise, those Receipts and Processes, which seem to be here and there promis'd in it; But I desire it may be considered, that some Passages, which an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive Reader may have mistaken for absolute Promises, are indeed but Profers conditionally made to a particular Person, and so not engaging me, till the condition (which was his desiring the things mention'd to him) be on his part perform'd. And as for the other things, which every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may suppose to be promis'd Him, I have at hand this general excuse, that at least I promis'd nothing to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; whatever promises I may have made in the foregoing ESSAYES, having together with them been address'd to a private Friend. And I have two or three special Reasons to insist on this Excuse, for divers of my choicer Books and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, having not long since unhappily miscarried through the negligence of some Men, or the Fraud of others, it is not now possible for me to retrieve some of the things I was Master of, when I promis'd them. And then to revise care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully all the Papers that remain in my hands of Affinity with the past Treatises, would take up more time then is allow'd me by other Studies and Employments, which I think of greater moment, or at least wherein I am much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, then to give this Book at present a full or accurate APPENDIX.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:56384:228"/>But though I might upon these and other Reasons wholy excuse my self from the trouble of adding any Appendix; yet because the communicating of good Medicines, is a work of Charity, and those unpolish'd and immethodical Notes that may perchance disparage an Author, may yet relieve many a Patient, I am willing to do what my occasions will permit, and finding among my Papers many loose Sheets, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Spirit of Harts-horn, Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> written divers years since to a Friend, I choose rather to publish them just as I find them with <hi>Pyrophilus</hi>'s name, employ'd in conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent places, and to adde some unpromis'd Receipts, instead of those that are lost, then be altogether wanting, to what may be expected from me. I know that what I deliver concerning some of the following Preparations may by severer Criticks be thought somewhat unaccurate, and I confess I am of that mind my self. But meeting with these Collections in loose Sheets among my old Papers, I must either publish them as I find them, or take the pains to Polish and Contract them, which would require more time, then I can at present afford them. And much less can I stay to subjoyn the Histories of the particular cures perform'd by the Medicines, whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations I set down, though divers of them would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps appear inconsiderable. But if I find by the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these Papers, that it will be worth while to revise or enlarge them, I may, God permitting, be invited to do it, and either supply the things, that are here deficient out of After-observations) or Papers now out of the way, or make amends for their omission in substituting better things.</p>
                     <p>It will not at all surprize me if some Readers think me too prolix in delivering the preparations of Harts-horn, <hi>Ens Veneris</hi> &amp;c. with such particular and circumstantial Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. But my design being to gratifie and assist those
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:56384:228"/>
that would make and use the Remedies I recommend: The Experience I have had, of the difficulties most men find in the preparing things by the Direction of Chymical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses not very expresly set down, makes me apt to hope, that (I say not the great Physitians or Chymists, who may if they please, leave them unperus'd; but) those for whom I principally intend my Directions will think my having made them so particular a very excusable fault. And I make the lesse difficulty to suffer such things as perhaps I judg to be in comparison of others, but trifles to passe abroad, because finding of late Years, that many Persons of Quality of either Sex, who scarce read any other then English Books, have (as I hope) out of Charity or Curiosity or both, begun to addict themselves to Chymistry, and venture to be tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with Spagirical Remedies, it may not be unseasonable to supply them with some Preparations, that may both save them time and charges, and put them upon the use of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which without being languid, are, if any thing discreetly given, safe and innocent, and wherein a little Error, either in the making or the administring will be far lesse prejudicial to the sick, then if it were committed in the more vulgar (oftentimes, either falsly or obscurely prescrib'd) preparations they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>THe great benefit that has redounded to many patients, from the use of the <hi>Silver Pils,</hi> here briefly mention'd, and commended, invites me to communicate as a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing, the preparation of them, of which I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the Inventer; having divers years since, learnt it by discoursing with a very Ancient and experienc'd Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, whose name that I do not mention, will perhaps seem somewhat strange to those Readers that have observ'd me not to be backward in acknowledging my Benefactors in point of Experiments, and therefore I hold it not amiss to take this opportunity of declaring once for all, that twere oftentimes more prejudicial then grateful to one that makes an advantage by the Practise of Physick, to annex in his life
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56384:230"/>
time his name to some of his Receipts or Processes; because that when a Man has once got a repute, for having a Specifick in any particular Disease or Case, his Patients, and their Friends will hardly forbear to apply themselves to him for that Medicine, though the same Medicine, but not known to be the same, should be made use of by a stranger, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged in a Printed Book. Most Patients being not apt to rely upon Medicines, that come onely that way recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; whereas if it were known that the Printed Receipt is the self same, which the Physitian employs, not only other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians would quickly make as much advantage of it as he, but many Patients would think themselves by that disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very dispens'd with, in point of good husbandry, from going to any Physitian at all, as knowing before hand the best pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription they are like to receive from him. The <hi>Process</hi> of the <hi>Pilulae Lunares</hi> is this;</p>
                     <p>Take of the best refined Silver as much as You please, dissolve it in a sufficient quantity of cleans'd spirit of Nitre or <hi>Aquafortis,</hi> then evaporating away the superfluous moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, let the rest shoot into thin Chrystals; these you may in some open mouth'd Glass place in sand, and keep in such a degree of Heat, that by the help of very frequently stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, the greatest part of the more loose and stinking Spirits of the <hi>Menstruum</hi> may be driven away, and yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Chrystals not be brought to Flow: These Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stals of Silver you must counterpoise with an equal weight of Chrystals of Nitre; and first dissolving each of them apart in distill'd Rain-water, You must afterwards mingle the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and abstract or steam away the superfluous moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, till the remaining Mass be dry, which you must keep in an open Glass, expos'd to such a temperate heat of Sand, that the Matter may not melt (which you must be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:56384:230"/>
of) and that yet the adhering corrosive Spirits of the <hi>Menstruum</hi> might be driven away. And to both these ends You must from time to time stir the Mass, that new parts of it may be expos'd to the Heat, and new ones to the Air, till you cannot descry in the remaining white Powder any offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive scent of the Spirit of Nitre, or of the <hi>Aqua-Fortis.</hi> And lastly You must take the Crum of good White-bread, made with a little moysture into a stiff Past, and exactly mingle with the newly mention'd Magistery or Powder as much of this Past, as is necessary to give it the consistence of a Mass of Pills, which you may thence form at pleasure, and preserve in a well stopp'd Glass for use.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>NB.</hi> First the Silver employ'd in this Operation, ought to be very pure and more exquisitely refin'd, then much of that is wont to be, which here in <hi>England</hi> is bought for fine Silver; for if the Copper wherewith Silver-Coyns are wont to be alloy'd, be not carefully separated upon the Cupel, it may, being turn'd by the Acid <hi>Menstruum</hi> into a kind of Vitriol, when it is taken into the Body, either provoke Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, or otherwise discompose it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, The Spirit of Nitre, or (which in our case comes almost to one) the <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> that is us'd about this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, ought to be clear'd, as our Refiners phrase it, before the Silver be put in, for (as I elsewhere Note) in Salt Peter, there is oftentimes an undiscerned Mixture of Sea-salt, whose Spirit coming over in Distillation with that of the Nitre, is apt to precipitate the Silver, which the Spirit of Nitre has dissolv'd. This I take to be the Reason of that practise of the best Refiners to purifie their <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> by casting in some small piece of Silver, that they may afterwards secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put into it greater Quantities of the same Mettal to be dissolv'd. For the Saline Spirits fall to the bottome, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56384:231"/>
with the corroded Silver, which they precipitate as long as there is any of these Saline Spirits left in the <hi>Menstruum,</hi> which after this may be decanted clear; and though you had put a little more Silver then needed to it, it neither does harm, nor is lost, the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> preserving none unprecipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but what there were no more S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>line Spirits to work upon, so that the superfluous Silver put in is already dissolv'd to Your hand.</p>
                     <p n="3">3dly, The dry Mixture obtain'd from the Solutions of Chrystals of Nitre and Chrystals of Silver, must be often stirr'd, and kept longer in the Sand, before all the offensive Spirits will be driven away, then till Experience had inform'd me, I did imagine.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If the Chrystals of Silver be considerably Blew or Green, 'tis a sign the Silver was not sufficiently purg'd from Copper, else the Mixture we have been spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of, will look of a White, good enough. And possibly 'twas by reason of the not being careful to take sufficiently Refin'd Silver, and of the not knowing how to improve the Chrystals of Silver, by the addition of those of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and especially how to free them from the stinking and Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Spirits of <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> that it is come to pass, that though there be in some Chymical Writers, Processes not very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like this, yet the Chrystals of Silver have been censur'd and laid aside as not alwaies safe even by those, who otherwise much magnifie the Efficacy of those they us'd.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, When You are about to make up this Mixture with the Crum of Bread into a Mass, and so into Pills, 'twill not be amiss to dispatch that work at once, for usually it leaves an ugly Blackness on the Fingers, that cannot under divers daies be gotten off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:56384:231"/>Sixthly, In taking of the Pills care must be had, that they be sufficiently lapp'd up either in a Wafer wetted with Milk, or the Pulp of a Roasted Apple, or some such thing, that they may not touch the Palat, or the Throat, because of the extreme and disgusting bitterness, which is to be met with in the Chrystals of Silver, and which is not the least thing, that with nicer Persons does Blemish these Pills.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, The Dose is somewhat uncertain; because they work much according to the Constitution of the Body, and especially according as it abounds with Serous Humours; Wherefore 'tis adviseable to make the Pills of the size of very small Pease, of which one given at Bedtime, is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Dose for some Bodies, others will require two; and in some we must ascend to three; and if the Patient be Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> be otherwise much molested with serous Humours, it is observable that sometimes one Dose will work two Daies, or four Daies, (may be five or six) successively, but yet moderately and usually, without weakening the Patient, in proportion to such copious Evacuations.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, Besides the Dropsie, wherein we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd this Remedy as a Specifick, it often proves very avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable in other Cases, wherein Men are troubled with Serous Humours. But the first distempers, which I heard it Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified for, were those of the Head, and <hi>Genus Nervosum</hi>; and a great <hi>Virtuoso</hi> of my acquaintance that inherits a Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Palsie, has several times told me, that if when he begins to find himself disordered, he take a Dose of these Pills, he is thereby constantly reliev'd. But of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cases, wherein we have had opportunity to take notice of their Effects, we have not now, but may perchance another time have leisure to entertain You.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="316" facs="tcp:56384:232"/>Lastly, That skilful and succesful Chymist D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

What this so extoll'd Remedy will perform I know not, having never made trial of it, nor thinking it very likely, that a bare Alcalizate Salt should have such <hi>Specifick Vertues,</hi> nor is it requisite I should insist on it, being here to discourse to You of the distill'd Liquors of Soot, in prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of which design, let me tell You, that <hi>Hartman</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the administring of the Spirit from six to ten Grains,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:56384:235"/>
of the Oyl from two to three drops in Wine, or any other convenient Vehicle, and concerning the Oyl he adds, That if three Drops of it be given in Vinegar to an almost gasping Man, he will be thereby wonderfully refesh'd, and as it were reviv'd, to which he annexeth this Prognostick, that if the Remedy produceth Copious Sweats, it will recover the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; but if not, he will Die.</p>
                     <p>That this spirit of Soot describ'd by <hi>Hartman</hi> may be a very good Medicine I am very apt to think; but because 'tis not a meer spirit of Soot, but a mixt one of Spirit of Wine, and spirit of Soot, we have rather chosen to proceed with the Soot (of Wood) without addition, both as to the distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it, and the ordering of the Distill'd Liquors, after the manners to be mention'd ere long, when we shall acquaint You with our preparations of Blood and Harts-horn, which if You please to apply to Soot, You may save Your self, and me, the labour of Repetitions. Yet it may be not amiss to advertise You here of two things: the one, that if You employ very good and fat Soot, and fill up the Retort with it to the Neck; You must be very careful to encrease the Fire orderly, and but by moderate Degrees, or else you may chance to make the matter Boil over out of the Retort into the Receiver, as it lately happen'd to us, when having warily order'd the Fire for several Houres we thought our selves past any such danger; And the other, that as to the Medicinal Vertues of the spirit, and salt of Soot, I shall not now particularize them, partly that I may save time, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because they may be well enough gather'd from their affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the Volatile salts and spirits of animal substances hereafter to be treat'd of, and from what I shall have occasion to say, of the perfuming of the salt of Soot towards the close of this APPENDIX.</p>

There will first come over (after perhaps a little Phlegm) Spirit, either accompanied or closely followed by a copious volatile Salt, fastning it selfe to the sides and top of the Receiver; and much about the same time there will also come over an Oyl, or two, or more (for I have not observed the oleaginous part to come constantly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly after the same manner) the Receiver being taken off, all that it contains may be poured together into a convenient Vial, to be therein digested for a Moneth, if you please: or otherwise without that previous digestion, you may wash down the volatile Salt, adhering to the sides of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, with the Spirit and Oyl well shaken about it, and pour altogether into a large Glass Funnel well lined with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper, first moistned with the Spirit or fair Water, through which the Spirit and as much of the volatile Salt, as it and the Phlegm can dissolve, will pass first, leaving the Oyl be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them in the Paper, which must be seasonably set aside, or else the Oyl also, though more slowly, will pass through the Filtre: The Phlegm, Salt and Spirit, must be rectified with a very gentle heat, so often, till the Phlegm be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly separated, and they leave no <hi>faces</hi>: The Oyl also may be rectified two or three times from its own <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> calcin'd, or else from Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> to deprive it of its muddiness.

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:56384:239"/>
and Spirit together, in one of the highest and slenderest Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies I can get, that the Phlegm might not be able to ascend easily into the Head, and that the volatile Salt may be the better separated: Then in a very gentle heat (I most use that of a Lamp Furnace) there will ascend a pure white and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt, adhering to the cheeks and nose of the Glass-head, which if I desire by it self, I sweep it away before the Spirit begins to rise; but most commonly I suffer the Distillation to proceed, and the ascending Spirit to carry down part of the volatile Salt into the Receiver, and so I continue the same degree of heat, till there arise so weak a Spirit that it plainly begins to dissolve the volatile Salt: Then shifting the Receiver, I reserve the strong Spirit and volatile Salt by themselves, and take the succeeding weaker spirit by it self also; to which, if I please to fortifie it, I adde as much of the volatile salt, formerly reserved, as it is able to dissolve. In the bottom of the Cucurbit or Vial, there will remain a phlegmatick kinde of Liquor, which usually contains some of the salt or spirit, and sometimes too (which is somewhat odde) some of the oleaginous part of the Blood, which did not before appear to have been associated with the spirit, and to have passed through the Filtre with it. This nauseous Liquor may be kept by it self till you have a sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it, to be worth the trouble of severing from it the nobler parts: The spirit and salt above-mentioned may be again rectifyed, <hi>per se,</hi> with the like gentle heat as before, so often, till they leave behinde them no <hi>faeces</hi> nor Phlegm at all. But this is requisite to be done onely when to master some stubborn Disease, the Medicine is to be exalted either to its supreme, or at least to some approaching degree of Purity and Efficacy, for otherwise so exquisite a Depuration is not always necessary.</p>

                           <pb n="331" facs="tcp:56384:239"/>6. As for the Oleaginous part which the Fire forceth out of Blood, my Observations of it hitherto have so little agreed, that, I dare as yet speak but haesitantly concerning it. For sometimes but one Oyl hath been drawn over, sometimes two: And I remember, last Year, a parcel of Blood, that was kept in a Dung-hill for many Moneths, yielded us a blackish and muddy Oyl, a purely red one, and another of pale Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber colour, which would not mingle with the darker; of each of which sorts I yet reserve some by me. This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may possibly proceed partly from the previous prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or unpreparedness of the Blood, and partly from the various administration of the Fire employed to distil it. But for the most part we find these Animal Substances (if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Fire be orderly administred, and the heat sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended towards the close of the Distillation) to yield a double Oyl: the one more light and pure, which swims up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spirit; the other more muddy, adust and ponderous, which sinks to the bottom of it. The use of these Oyls hath, by reason of their Fetidness, been by most Authors absolutely rejected; and even those few that do not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reject them, forbid their inward use, and allow them to be but externally employed: But considering, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> how much of the efficacy both of Plants and Animals is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to reside in their oleaginous part, it seem'd not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to me, that these Oyls might deserve a better usage, then either to be wholly thrown away, or confin'd to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward services; and therefore having not long since given a Friend of mine some pure yellow Oyl of Man's Blood, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in Spirit of Wine, to try upon a Patient of his, sick of a Hectick Feaver (in which Disease I had seen the Spirit of Blood very successful) within a few days he brought me wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

our Medicine (that I may not conceal from you that Circumstance) in <hi>Balsamus Samech,</hi> made with spirit of Vinegar instead of spirit of Wine; the remaining part of this yellow mingled Oyl I keep yet by me, to make further tryals with it. And that such Oyls may not be lost, I have been attempting (for I am yet upon my tryals) several ways to make them serviceable. Some of them that are of a more pure and defecated nature, I have (which is not unworthy your noting) found capable of readily uniting with Spirit of Wine, with which they may be allayed at pleasure: In others I have separated the finer and more volatile part, by drawing them over with a very gentle heat in a Retort half full of Water, which will carry over the lighter part of the Oyl with it into the Receiver, wherein the Oyl will swim upon it, and may be afterwards sever'd from it by a Separating Glass, or any other convenient way (but I fear that this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, though it finely clarifie Oyls, may rob them of the best part of the Efficacy they may perchance derive from the latent admixtion of somewhat of the volatile Salt:) at the bottom of the Retort there will remain a dark and thick sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, whose nature I have not yet had opportunity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into. Out of some Oyls (drawn from unprepared Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials) which would not dissolve in spirit of Wine, I have, by digestion with spirit of Wine, drawn much of the scent and taste; the spirit probably imbibing some of the finer parts of the Oyl, or else associating to it self some volatile salt that yet lay lurking in it: For sometimes I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Oyls, after long keeping, to let fall a volatile salt undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them before. Having also sometimes mingled the heavier and lighter Oyls of the same Body with dephlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted spirit of Wine, and in a low Retort drawn over what will rise in a very gentle heat (inferiour to that of a <hi>Balneum</hi>) I
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:56384:240"/>
have found the Spirit of Wine to carry over with it so many of the more subtle and active parts of the Oyl, that it was more richly impregnated therewith, then you will be apt to expect. But of what use this oleaginous Spirit may be in Physick, I have not yet had time to consult Experience, which I hope will, ere long, teach me better ways of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the rejected Oyls we have been speaking of, then are those almost obvious ones hitherto mentioned, wherein I am very far from acquiescing; especially, since I cannot but suspect that such active Parts of such Concretes, would be found very capable of a great Improvement, if we were as skilful to give it them.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The Terrestrial Substance that remains after the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors are drawn of, if the Blood have been duely prepared, affords but so inconsiderable a quantity of fix'd Salt, that unless the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> be exceeding copious, the <hi>Alkali</hi> will hardly be worth extracting: Besides that, if it could be obtain'd in a not despicable quantity, I should, what ever is pretended, very much doubt whether it would be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with very extraordinary Vertues, the violence of the Fire usually depriving fix'd Salts of the specifick Qualities of their Concretes: and even in the first Salt of Serpents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, I have not discerned other, Then the wonted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Salts.</p>

Because you may sometimes not have the leisure to wait six Weeks for the Preparation of Blood; and because oftentimes the occasion of using the Medicines we have been describing, may be so hasty and urgent, that unless some speedy course to relieve them be taken before the Physick can be prepared, the Patients will be dead. I think it not amiss, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to advertise You, That though without any previous Preparation of Blood you should immediately
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:56384:241"/>
distil it, provided an orderly gradation of heat be carefully observed, it will yield you a reddish Spirit, and (besides an Oyl or two) a volatile Salt; which being rectified, are so little inferiour, in any Properties discernable by the smell or taste, to the Salt and Spirit of predigested Blood, that 'tis very probable their Efficacy will emulate, though not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether equal that of the more laboriously prepared.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. And because it is difficult to get the Blood of healthy Men, and perhaps not so safe to use that of unsound Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and because many have a strong Aversion, and some an Insuperable, though groundless abhorrency, from Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines made of Mans Blood, I have thought it not amiss to try whether that of some other Animals prepared the same way, might not afford us as hopeful Medicines: And because the Blood of Deer is chiefly (and perhaps not causlely) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Authors, we have handled it according to the foregoing Process, and thereby obtained of it a Spirit, and Salt, and Oyl, whose penetrancy, and other resemblances, makes us hope that they may prove good <hi>Succedanea,</hi> in the defect of those Analogous Remedies (drawn from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Materials) which we have been treating of.</p>
                        <p>And to this let me, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> on this occasion, annex this Advertisement, That though in these Papers, and what I have further written of Preparations of this nature; I name not any great number of Concretes, as having drawn their volatile Salts and Spirits, yet I have endeavored in these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses to give You in the Instances I insist on, so much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Examples, that either by the Processes therein set down, or by Analogy to them, You may, I suppose, be directed with the help of a few tryals, to obtain the volatile Salts and Spirits of most Concretes that belong to the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Kingdom, and that are capable of affording any. For

by the method we prescribe, a little vary according to the exigencies of particular Bodies to be distill'd, we have drawn the Spirits, Salts and Oyls of Sheeps-blood, Eels, Vipers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the latter of which yield a Salt and Liquor, which in <hi>Italy,</hi> by divers Learned Men, is superlatively extoll'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Obstructions, foulness of the Blood, and I know not how many Diseases proceeding from these two general Causes. And though I dare not deny that divers of those Praises may be well enough deserv'd, by the Remedies to which they are ascribed, yet I am not apt to think them much superior to the generality of volatile Salts: And even the Spirit and Salt of Sheeps-blood it self, did, by their pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trancy of taste and fugitiveness in gentle heats, promise little else Efficacy then those others so much celebrated Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>

Nor is it onely by being administred it self, that one of this sulphureous and subtle kinde of Spirits may become a good Remedy, but also by its being made a <hi>Menstruum</hi> to prepare other Bodies: For it will extract Tinctures out of several sulphureous and resinous Concretes, whose finer parts, by being associated with so piercing a <hi>Vehicle,</hi> may probably gain a more intimate admission into the Body, and have their Vertues conveyed further then otherwise they would reach. And a Learned Doctor, to whom I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended such kinde of Remedies, confessed to me, That by the bare extractions of appropriated Vegetables themselves, with Spirit of Urine, he perform'd no small matter. But one difficulty You may meet with in drawing the Tincture of Minerals, and other very compact Bodies, even with good Spirit of Urine.

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:56384:243"/>
seemingly Pestilential Symptomes, was reduc'd to take some of this Medicine out of the Vessels before the due time, and upon the use of it found as he told me an almost immediate Cessation of those dreadfull symptoms, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t not of the Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse they had produc'd. This first prosperous Experiment, emboldned us to give our Remedy the Title of <hi>Primum ens Veneris,</hi> which, for brevities sake, is wont to be call'd <hi>Ens Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris,</hi> though I am far from thinking, that it is the admirable Medicine to which <hi>Helmont</hi> gives that name, at least if his <hi>Ens Veneris</hi> did really deserve half the praises by him ascrib'd to it. But such as Ours is, I shall now (as time and my yet incompleat Trials will permit) acquaint you with that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of it, which (among some others) we are most wont to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, as the most easie, simple, and genuine.</p>
                     <p>Take then of the best <hi>Hungarian,</hi> or if you cannot procure that of the best Dantzick, or other good Venereal Vitriol, what quantity you please, Calcine it in a strong fire, till it be of a dark Red, Dulcifie it by such frequent affusions of hot Water, that at length the Water that hath pass'd through it, appear full as tastless, as when it was pour'd on it. Let this thus exquisitely dulcified <hi>Colcothar,</hi> when it is thorowly dry, be very diligently ground with about an equal weight of good <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> and let this mixture be put into a Glass Retort, and either in as strong a heat as can conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be given in Sand, or els in a naked fire, force up as much of it as you can to the Top or Neck of the Retort, and this Sublimation being ended, out of the broken Retort (laying the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> aside) take all the Sublimate, and grind it well again, that if in any part the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> appear sublim'd by it self, it may be reincorporated with the <hi>Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar,</hi> Resublime this Mixture <hi>per se</hi> in a Glass Retort as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and if you please you may once more elevate this second
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:56384:243"/>
Sublimate, but we have not found That allwayes needful. And for the better understanding of this Process, be pleas'd to take notice of the following Particulars.</p>
                     <p>First, We have alwaies preferr'd such Vitriol as abounds with Copper, before our common English Vitriol, about the making of which, those that keep the Copper as work at <hi>Detford</hi> are wont, as themselves have upon the place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me, to use good store of Iron to increase the quantity of their Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If You be unwilling to loose the Phlegm, Spirit and Oyl of that Vitriol with which You design to make <hi>Ens Veneris,</hi> You may distill them away in an earthen Retort, or one of Glass well coated. But though it be well known that the distillation of Oyl of Vitriol requires a very intense and lasting Fire (so that unlesse you have need of the Liquors, the best way will be without any Ceremony to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine the Vitriol in a naked Fire and open; yet afterwards it will be for the most part requisite further to calcine the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> in an open Vessel. For you must take notice, that unless the Vitriol be very throughly calcin'd, it will be very troublesome for you to dulcifie it, and sometimes we have observ'd that the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> which look'd Red, and seem'd indifferently well calcin'd, hath been, almost like Crude Vitriol dissolv'd in the fair Water which was pour'd on it to dulcifie it. The weight of the <hi>Calx</hi> in reference to the Vitriol, of which it was made, we cannot easily determine, but we have sometimes found it necessary to reduce the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol to lesse, perhaps much lesse then half its weight to make it fit for Dulcification.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Water that hath been pour'd on the first and second time to edulcorate, the calcin'd Vitriol, may be filtrated and steamed away, till it come almost to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:56384:244"/>
of a Syrrup or Honey, and then may be put into a cold place to shoot; for after this manner we have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had many very regularly figur'd Chrystals or Graines of Salt, I say sometimes, because sometimes also you may find it necessary to abstract all the Water, to obtain the Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Salt of Vitriol, which we have known us'd as a good Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and which <hi>Angelus Sala</hi> none of the least sober of the Chymical Writers doth highly extoll as an excellent Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in his <hi>Ternary of Vomitive Remedies,</hi> where he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth at large of the Vertues of it, and the way of administring it. And of this Salt, as Chymists are pleas'd to call it, we have had out of calcin'd <hi>Copper as</hi> a very great quantity, and have sometimes observ'd it to have been almost as deeply colour'd as the Vitriol it self was before Calcination.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, We several times tryed to sublime dulcified <hi>Colcothar</hi> with <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> in Retorts and Urinals plac'd in Sand, but whether by reason of the fixedness of the <hi>Colcothar,</hi> or because the Furnace we were fain to use, though no very bad one, was none of the best, we never could that way obtain any considerable Quantity of the desir'd Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and that which did ascend was but of a faint colour: wherefore, unlesse you have an extraordinary good Sand Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, if you will make use of Glasse Vessels, which is the cleanliest way, You will find it expedient to sublime Your <hi>Colcothar</hi> in coated Retorts with an open Fire, except you have the Dexteritie to sublime in a naked Fire with Glass, Retorts uncoated, which we have divers times seen perform'd by heating the bottome of the Retort by degrees, and then placing it upon Embers, with Coales round about it, but to be kindled at a distance from it; for if this course be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully follow'd, the Retort will be so well neal'd, before it be reduc'd to endure any intense degree of heat, that after a
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:56384:244"/>
while You may safely lay thorowly kindled Coales, not onely round about it, but upon the top of it, (which needs not to be done, till towards the end of the Operation) and thereby drive most of the Sublimate into one lump, and into the Neck of the Retort. And by this way you may sublime without any Furnace upon a bare Hearth, but if you desire to give a more intense heat, you may lay first some warm ashes in an ordinary Iron pot, and having with them, and a few small Coals well kindl'd, neal'd your Retort, you may afterwards prosecute the Sublimation in the same Pot, which being once throughly heated it self by the Fire, will afterwards conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably increase the heat of it.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Though it be most commonly requisite to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sublime the Sublimate, that comes the first time up, that the Salt and <hi>Colcothar</hi> may be more exquisitly mix'd, yet as far as we can guesse by some trials, it will not be expedient to resublime it above once (or at most) twice. For in those Trials we have found the <hi>Ens Veneris</hi> oftener resublim'd of a paler colour, then that which was resublimed but once. And <hi>(N B.</hi>) perhaps, by further sublimations, the Salt instead of being more intimately united with the <hi>Colcothar,</hi> may be almost totally sever'd from it, according to what we elswhere in other cases declare.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Of these Sublimates, that which hath the highest Colour, seems to be the best, as being most enrich'd with the <hi>Colcothar,</hi> from whence the rednesse proceeds. But at the first Sublimation I have often observ'd a pretty part of the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> to come up first white by it self, especially if it had not been very diligently mix'd with the <hi>Colcothar.</hi> But at the second sublimation the Ingredients (which we have sometimes almost totally forc'd up without leaving a <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> in the bottom of the Retort) will be more
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:56384:245"/>
accuratly mix'd, and the Sublimate will appear Yellow, and perhaps Reddish, of which sort we have sometimes had, when the Operation hath been very carefully manag'd.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, How great a proportion of the Ingredients committed to Sublimation, will arise in the form of <hi>Ens Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris,</hi> we dare not precisely define, but a Sublimate amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the fourth part of the whole Mixture, you will scarce, if you work skilfully, faile off.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, We sometimes made a Sublimate of equal parts of pure <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> and Salt of Tartar, both of them very throughly dry'd (for else they will be apt to yeeld rather a Spirit then a Sublimate,) well ground together, and so sublim'd; And with this Sublimate instead of Simple <hi>Sal Armoniak</hi> we intended to make <hi>Ens Veneris,</hi> but by some intervening Accidents and Avocations we were not able to perfect the Experiment, of which we nevertheless think it fit to give You this hint, because of the great Efficacy, which an excellent Physitian of my acquaintance, to whom I gave some of it, assures me he has found in it against Obstructions and some Distempers that are wont to spring from them.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, When you are about to make Your first Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate, You may if You please, lute to the Retort, whereinto You put the Ingredients, a small Receiver to catch the Liquor that oftentimes comes over. For that Liquor, though you will very seldome get much of it, yet may be worth your preserving, by reason of the Volatile and Urinous Salt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it will sometimes so abound, that it may passe for a weak Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tenthly, The <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> that remains after the first Sublimation, may be put into a clean Glass, and set in a Cellar, where it will run <hi>Per deliquium,</hi> into a thick and high
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:56384:245"/>
colour'd Liquor, very richly impregnated (as we elsewhere manifest on another Occasion) with the somewhat opened body of <hi>Copper,</hi> from whence if half those praises be true, which even the best Chymists are pleas'd to give to <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> it may be very well concluded to have deriv'd no small Vertues against Ulcers, and divers other Affections, which we are not here to insist on.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, We have sometimes doubted whether or no our <hi>Ens Veneris</hi> did really contain any thing of <hi>Cypreous</hi> or <hi>Colcotharine</hi> in it, partly, because of the fixedness or slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishnesse of <hi>Colcothar,</hi> and of the <hi>Copper</hi> therein contain'd; and partly because, that if <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> be two or three times sublim'd by its self, its Flowers frequently enough will ascend Yellow, like the paler sort of <hi>Ens Veneris.</hi> But first, that <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> is capable of carrying up even fix'd and sluggish Bodies seem'd probable to us, partly upon our incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating and subliming it with finely powder'd Coralls (from which, though but very little of it ascended, yet some of that little was no lesse red, then the Coralls themselves before their being beaten) and partly upon our subliming it from <hi>Copper,</hi> both Crude and Calcin'd, since of either of those Bodies it carry'd up a little with it, as appear'd by the Blew Colour of some parts of the Sublimates.</p>
                     <p>And secondly, that the reddishnesse of our <hi>Ens Veneris</hi> proceeded partly, if not altogether from the <hi>Colcothar,</hi> seem'd probable to us, not onely by the tast, and some other Properties of it, but also by this, that having knowingly committed the first sublimate to a Fire too weak to resublime it; and having after some Hours, taken the Vessel out of the Sand, we found that the Fire, which we suppos'd was not strong enough to carry up the whole Matter, had rais'd the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> to the upper part of the Urinal in Flowers,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:56384:246"/>
that were either White, or but of a pale Yellow; whereas the remaining part of the Mixture, that lay in good quantity in the bottome of the Vessel, was of a deep Red, and a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it of about the bigness of a large Pease, being cast upon glowing Coales, and nimbly blown with a pair of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, colour'd the Flame with a somewhat greenish blew like that, but more faint, which we elswhere have observ'd to proceed from the well opened body of Copper.</p>
                     <p>But those Trials I confess would rather increase my Doubts then lessen them, because in our <hi>Ens Veneris</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is not Blew, but Reddish, if I did not consider, that <hi>Colcothar</hi> is a body that consists of some other matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides common Copper (as it is also far more difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, though but in part, into a mettal then is vulgar calcin'd Copper) and consequently when Corpuscles of differing Natures are by the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> elevated together, that which is not Metalline, may with the assistance of the Fires O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration alter the Nature of what is, and thereby produce a Colour differing from Blew. But to dispatch what ever fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trials shall inform us, touching this Question, whether or no any true and reducible Copper do make an Ingredient in our <hi>Ens Veneris,</hi> yet there being in <hi>Colcothar</hi> other parts as well as those, that by Fusion you may reduce into a pure Mettal, and our Remedy seeming by its Somniferous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to partake of them, it will not be necessary to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Medicine a Right to the Appellation I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly choose of <hi>Flores Colcotharis,</hi> that in it there is something of the <hi>Colcothar</hi> carry'd up, though possibly the quantity be but small, and not all reducible into a Metalline form, but perhaps the Question is not worth a longer Debate, it being sufficient to excuse the name, and recommend the thing to such a Person as You, that <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lcothar</hi> is employ'd
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:56384:246"/>
in the making of it, and that the thing prepar'd is a noble Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and hath some of the great Vertues ascrib'd to Vitriol; whether that Mineral be an ingredient of it or no.</p>
                     <p>The Dosis of <hi>Ens Veneris</hi> may be very much vary'd; To little Children, we give sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three Grains for many nights together, as we find them able, without inconvenience, to bear the Operation. To persons of ripe Years we commonly administer four, five, or six Grains at a time. But one, to whom we have given quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of it to ly by him, tells us, That he hath taken to above thirty Grains at once without any inconvenience. We are wont to give it in two or three Spoonfuls of Sack, or other Wine, if the Constitution of the Patient, or the Nature of the Disease do not forbid it, and in such cases we give it in any Cordial Liquor, that is temperate, or any other convenient Vehicle.</p>
                     <p>To Children it may be given in Beer, or Ale, or clear Posset-drink, but not in Milk. If the Patient hath supp'd at a seasonable Hour, we commonly administer it, when he is going to sleep. It works for the most part by sweat and a little by Urine, but more by sweat at the beginning, then after the body is us'd to it, yet to some bodies it proves so Sudorifick, that two Grains or lesse of it, have often made me sweat. That it hath once prov'd Emetick I have heard, but never observ'd it my self to provoke Vomits.</p>
                     <p>As for the Medicall use of <hi>Ens Veneris,</hi> divers great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians will perhaps think it were not despicable, though it were no other then oftentimes to prove a safe and moderatly somniferous Medicine in Feavers, without having any thing in it of <hi>Opium,</hi> whose Narcotick power they find as difficult to correct, as it oftentimes proves dangerous, when being not well corrected, it is administred without very great Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection.

                     <p>HArts-horn, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> is a Heteroclite Body in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which hath but few resemblers in the universe, for it grow's to a considerable bulk like a Vegetable, and is (unlike most other Hornes of Animals) at certain set Periods of time, deciduous, and though it be of a Bony substance, yet that middle part of it which differs from the rest in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, does (at least in grown Hornes) much more resemble the pith of some Plants then the Marrow of Bones: and yet this Plant-Animal (if I may so call it) does, when skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expos'd to the Fire, afford the same differing substances, with the Blood, Flesh, and other parts of Animals. 'Tis no wonder therefore, if Physitians and Chymists have hoped to find extraordinary Vertues in so extraordinary a Subject, of which we shall passe by the Usual Preparations as not so pertinent to our present design, insinuating only in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, That though even the more Vulgar Preparations, as well as that which Physitians have been pleased to call Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical, afford us Medcines not despicable; yet these are much inferiour to those Remedies wherewith dexterous Distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are capable of presenting us; and certainly if we allow of the Chymical Theory, (whose Truth in these Papers I
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56384:247"/>
question not) Harts-horn being generally acknowledged to be endued with properties very friendly to our Nature, and even those wayes of preparing it wherein the nobler and more active parts are not truly freed from those cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some ones that fetter them, and hinder them to display their powerful energies, proving yet oftentimes not unavailable; The Spirit and Salt of Harts-horn would be in more request, were not Men deterred from making tryals of it, partly by the over-apprehended unpleasantness of the smell, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the difficulties commonly met with in its distillation; the latter of which Deterrements hath so frighted even Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists from distilling this Cordial Substance, that we have very rarely seen any, either Spirit or Salt of Harts-horn, save what our selves have been reduced to prepare.</p>
                     <p>There are three ways proposed by the Authors I have met with, to distil Harts-horn: The one in coated Glass Retorts; the other in Earthen ones; and the third in <hi>Glaubers</hi> second Philosophical Furnace.</p>
                     <p>In the first of these ways, some very skilful Distillers that have often practised it, have so complained of their frequent breaking their Vessels by the copiousness and impetuosity of of the Fumes that rush out of the Matter, when it once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be prest with a considerable heat, that I confess to You ingeniously, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> they have hitherto frighted me from making tryal of that way, though I see no very great reason why, by a slow and regular gradation of the Fire, the mischances incident to this way of distillation may not (at least most commonly) be avoided.</p>
                     <p>To distil the Matter we discourse of in Earthen Retorts, is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> way then the former, if the Earth be close and good, and have been sufficiently bak'd; as we finde in the right <hi>Hassian</hi> Retorts, wherein we have known the Operation
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:56384:248"/>
proceed very prosperously, though a considerable quantity of the Matter hath been distill'd at once; but the Retorts made of Earth that is spongy or any other ways unfit, or in whose baking Fuel hath been spared, are commonly (as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath informed us) improper for this service, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are easily broken: Besides that, it is much to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all Retorts made of Earth, except it be extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compact and baked, are apt to imbibe the more subtle and more penetrant parts of Harts-horn, and other volatile Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances distill'd in them; which we have observed in some, wherein the Matter hath transudated quite through the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Retort, and been manifestly discernable on the out-side of it.</p>
                     <p>The third way of distilling Harts-horn, is performed by the Instrument described by <hi>Glauber,</hi> in his second Philosophical Furnace: But neither is this way without its Inconveniencies; for besides that, if the Earth whereof the Vessel to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed is made, be not of very good and well baked Earth, it will be apt to crack, in so violent a Fire as is requisite in this way of Distillation, or else it will imbibe part of the finest Spirit it should transmit into the Receiver: And besides that, it is difficult to work long this way, without letting some of the active part of the Spirit escape between the wide Orifice of the Retort and the Cover: Besides these Inconveniencies, I say, it is to be feared that the Matter being to be cast imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into the Vessel, made red hot before-hand, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a stronger <hi>Empyreuma</hi> or Impression of the Fire, then it would do in the ordinary way of Distillation, wherein the Fire being orderly and successively increas'd, much of the Spirit and Salt comes over into the Receiver, before that last degree of Fire is administred; which is requisite chiefly to force over the more fluggish and heavy Oyl, which therefore (to speak
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:56384:248"/>
congruously to the most receiv'd Theory of Distillation) sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors much more of the Fire, and is grown almost infamous for its adustion.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding these Inconveniencies, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> we have found these Retorts of <hi>Glauber</hi>'s not unserviceable, when we have had occasion to Distil considerable Quantities of such Materials, as were not so pretious, as to make the loss of a part of what they were to afford us considerable.</p>
                     <p>And this Advertisement may take place, especially if you take along with you, what we have declar'd, touching the Ways we substitute to avoid as much as may be, the newly objected Inconveniencies. But having in other Papers taken notice particularly enough of the Ways we mean, I shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to mention them in this place, though one of them may easily be made applicable, as Experience hath assur'd us, even to ordinary Retorts; for 'tis not difficult to apply to <hi>These,</hi> the perforated Receivers, which being almost of the shape of Pears, open at both ends, by holes of about two or three Inches Diameter (according to the capacity of the Vessel) may be with greater facility taken asunder and made clean; and may, by the convenient Insertion of their Extremities into one another, be easily luted together (in a level) two, three, or as many of them, as necessity shall require; and then provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there be applyed to the remoter extremity of the last of them, some convenient Vessel open but at one end, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers will very seldom break: The Fumes that come over too copiously to be contain'd in one of them, passing freely thence into the second or the third (for we very rarely exceed three in all) which will be manifestly cool, and so, speedily turn into Liquor, the Fumes it receives, whil'st the first Recipient is perhaps hotter then the Hand can endure: But of these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Contrivances, elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="350" facs="tcp:56384:249"/>Now whereas <hi>Glauber</hi> prescribes to mingle with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still'd Liquors of Harts horn rectified Spirit of Wine, to wash out the volatile Salt, and directs the Distilling again of both those Spirits (of Wine and Harts-horn) together; his method of proceeding may be justly question'd: For first, dephlegm'd Spirit of Wine will not so readily, in the way he supposeth, dissolve the volatile Salt of Harts-horn; And next, the Spirit this way drawn is not a simple Spirit of Harts-horn, but a compounded Liquor of the Spirit of Harts-horn, and that of Wine; the latter of which may possibly, in divers cases, rather impair then improve the vertue of the former. For Spirit of Harts-horn, by reason of its opening and resolving, as well as Cordial Vertues, is safely and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully given in Feavers, wherein it is not observed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the Blood, whereas Spirit of Wine in such cases is counted dangerous. And this brings into my thoughts a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry questionable Preparation of the Experienc'd and Ingenious <hi>Hartman,</hi> who much extolls, for the Worms in the Stomach, Spirit of Harts-horn in general, but especially that which he is pleased to call <hi>Essensificated</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pract. Chym.</hi> p. 190.</note> as himself expounds it) with which its own fix'd Salt, extracted with some conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Water, and its volatile duely depurated, have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved and united. For first, The fix'd Salt of Harts-horn hath been perhaps never yet prepared by any Man; and if Harts-horn doth yield a fix'd Salt (as I dare not absolutely deny, but that out of many Pounds a few Grains may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted) it may well be doubted whether that Salt be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with specifical Vertues: And next, The Spirit of Harts-horn, if it be well dephlegm'd, will not (for ought I could ever finde) dissolve its own Salt, unless assisted by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal warmth of the Ambient Air; Insomuch that I usually keep the Spirit and Salt in the same Vial, where they remain
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:56384:249"/>
unmix'd; and the Spirit that will dissolve any of its owne Salt I account not sufficiently dephlegm'd, but to have yet an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous alloy whereby the Salt is imbibed. And I remember that having once exquisitely rectified some Spirit of Harts-horne, and closed it up in a Viall, after divers months it let fall a considerable quantity of Volatile Salt, so far was it from being able, without the help of some peculiar way, to have dissolved more, had I cast more into it. I deny not that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Harts-horn may, by the mediation of heat, be brought to take in some of the Salt of the same Body, but of what use this violent Impregnation of the liquor can be, unlesse it be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly administred, I do not yet understand, having often seen the Spirit let fall againe in the cold, the volatile Salt it had dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the assistance of heat.</p>
                     <p>And having thus, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> laid before you the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we have met with in the above-mentioned waies of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Spirit of Harts-horne proposed by Authors (neither of which we would yet have you altogether reject) I must acquaint you with our having attempted a fourth way, which when the matter to be distilled is not very much, I choose rather to practise then any of the other, as hitherto seeming more safe and free from inconveniences. Take then (for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) two pounds of Harts horne broken on an Anvill into pieces, each of about the bignesse of ones finger (for if it be rasped there is danger that it should emit its fumes too plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully at once) and put it into a strong glasse Retort uncoated, big enough to containe at least twice as much matter; Set this in Sand, and fit to it a pretty large and strong (either single or double) Receiver; then give a slow fire for three, foure, or six houres, to send away first the Phlegme, and more fugitive parts of the Spirit; then encreasing the fire, but warily, and gradually for divers houres, drive over the Spirit (which is
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:56384:250"/>
wont to drop downe somewhat tincted) and the more volatile parts of the Salt; and at length intend your fire till the bottom of the Retort be glowing hot, and heap also at last quick coals upon the sand round about the Retort to give, as it were, a fire of Suppression, and so force over the more sluggish remaining parts of the Salt, and with it the Oyl: all which are to be afterwards proceeded with, according to the Directions given concerning the Spirit, Salt, and Oyl of Mans Blood: which having bin sufficiently insisted on before, will not (I suppose) need to be repeated now. Only it may not be impertinent to advertise you. 1. That we have more then once had the bottom of the Retort melted, yet not broken, the melted glasse being supported by the substrated sand. 2. That sometimes in Filtration, some of the thinner parts of the Oyl have unperceivedly passed through the paper with the Spirit, and Salt, and have not been discovered, but by Rectification, wherein I have almost admired to see the Oyl with a gentle heat of a Lamp ascend to the top of a very tall head and body; touching which circumstance it may yet be further enquired, whether it proceed barely from the volatilnesse of the Oyl it selfe, or also from its being carryed up by the Salt and Spirit wherewith it was associated. 3. That by this way of distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation we usually have out of a pound of Harts-horne between foure and five ounces, (seldome or never so little as foure, and often nearer five) of volatile Salt, Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, Oyl, and Flegme; (of the last of which, if the Harts-horne be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, there will be no great quantity) and when we distill'd two pound of the matter at a time, we found the operation to succeed altogether as well, and to yeeld us a fully propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable quantity of Liquor.</p>
                     <p>The vertues of the Spirit and Salt of Harts-horne, which differ not much in Dose, or Efficacie, are probably very great
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:56384:250"/>
in divers distempers, wherein we have yet made no tryall of them. For they are considerable in resisting Putrefaction, comforting nature, opening Obstructions, mortifying the the Acidities it meets with in the blood, and, by rendring that volatile, promoting its Circulation, we have knowne conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects of it in Feavers, Plurisies, Obstructions of the Mesentery, and Spleen; and chiefly (which perhaps you will think strange) in Coughs and Distempers of the braine, and nervous parts; in so much that I have by Gods blessing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times stopt very violent (but not inveterate Coughs) with this medicine in a few houres. And prescribing it to one who was almost daily assaulted with Epilepticall fits, a few <hi>Doses</hi> of it did in a pretty while at first make his fits come but seldome, and after not at all: But whether he be perfectly cured not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard of him of late, nor having had oportunity to make further tryall of the medicine in that disease, I am not certain. Wee prescribed it likewise, not long since, to a Person who had long lain both distracted, and almost bed-rid, and was in a short time strangely reliev'd by the use of it, though not perfectly cur'd (perhaps because the Patient tooke but little of the medicine, we being then not well stored with it;) and on some that have been by Feavers rendred stupid, it hath had very eminent Operations: but for a further account of its vertues, I must referre you to the particular Narratives, I may when wee meet, give you, by word of mouth: and till then it may suffice to tell you that it workes chiefly by Sweat (and somewhat by Urine) without being observed to leave behind it such heat as divers Sudorificks are wont to do: only there must be care not to administer it when the <hi>Primae viae,</hi> and passages are too much stuff'd and choaked up by grosse Humours, lest by agitating the blood, and putting it into a nimble Motion, it occasion greater Obstructions. The Dose
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:56384:251"/>
is from five drops, or graines to a drachme (ten or fifteene drops are wont to make mee sweat) in Wine, <hi>Carduus Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus</hi> water, or any vehicle appropriated to the disease; onely taking care that nothing acid be administred with it, because Acid and Sulphureous Salts mortifie, and disarme one another. <hi>Hartman</hi> commends it against the wormes of the stomacke, against which it may very probably be available, by reason of its penetrant, and saline nature, and its emnity to Putrefaction: <hi>Glauber</hi> writes that the Oyl rectified from Salt of Tartar, cares Quartanes, and inward wounds, and cures the paines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Falls, Contusions, &amp;c. being administred from six to twenty drops to a patient placed in his bed to sweat after it: but of this my Experience will not enable mee to say any thing. And I feare <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that I have already too long entertained you about Harts-Horne: and yet I feare too, that you expect that before I forsake this Subject I should say something to you concerning a much controverted particular relating thereunto. The Inquiry is, Whether or no, when it is distill'd, the Salt dispose it selfe in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver into the figures of Harts-horne, the Affirmative is maintained by many Chymists, and a friend of mine who is very severe, and not at all credulous, having assured mee that he himselfe had observed the inside of his Receiver over-laid with such figures or hornes, I dare not deny, but that acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally the particles of the volatile Salt may sometimes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent as well the shape of Harts-hornes, as of divers other things. But for our parts having severall wayes, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently distilled that matter, we could never see the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Saline Harts-hornes so clearely as we thought wee saw cause to esteeme that those who affirm'd they constantly saw them so distinctly lookt through the spectacles of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest Imagination: not to mention that it is the usuall
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:56384:251"/>
method of nature in Salts to make the bigger Concretions of the same figures with the smaller graines, as we observe in Nitre, Rock-allum, &amp;c. And the graines of the Salt of Harts-horne, though I have attentively enough consider'd their shapes, I remember not ever to have observed of a figure like that of the hornes they came from: but it is the nature of volatile Salts to fasten themselves to the Receiver in various figures, according as the degree of fire that urges them up, and other concurrent circumstances do chance to exact; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonantly hereunto we have often observed the volatile Salt of the same Harts-horne to be very variously figured in the same Receiver: and I remember that not long since subliming some volatile Salt of Urine, it adher'd to the upper part of the vessell in figures, much liker Harts-hornes, then ever I had seene their volatile Salt make up; so that unlesse wee will merrily say, that the man whose urine was distill'd, had hornes given him by his wife, wee must acknowledge that nature seemes to give her selfe liberty to play in the Configuration of volatile Salts, and that casualities have no unusuall influence on them; or to speake more properly, that the various degree of Fire, the differing copiousness of the Fumes, and many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening accidents do keep those Configurations from being constantly regular; and I remember that a while since filtring through Cap-paper a Tincture of glasse of Antimony, made with Spirit of Vinegar and Spirit of Wine, almost according to <hi>Basilius</hi>; the matter which remained in the paper (which was placed in a glasse funnell, and was of the same shape) did of it selfe, when it began to grow dry, cleave into the figures of trees, whose trunkes, greater boughs, and smaller branches, were both for their shape, and proportion, as lively represented as if they had been drawne by the curious pensill of some skilfull Painter; which paper I shewed to some persons
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:56384:252"/>
that beheld it not without wonder, and for ought I know I am yet able to shew it you; nor is this the only instance I could give you if need were, if I had not trifled too long all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to manifest at present, that, now and then, Chance may make Nature seem to emulate Art.</p>
                     <p>But as long as I have dwelt, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> on this Subject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I passe to another; I must not forget to advertise you, that in case Stags Horns cannot be procured for the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the above mention'd Remedies, you may without much disadvantage substitute Bucks-horns in their stead; for almost all the trialls we have had opportunity to make of the Medicines we have been lately discoursing of, have been made with Remedies whereto Buck-hornes afforded Materialls.</p>
                     <p>I had almost forgot, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to tell you, That to keep the rectify'd Spirit of Harts-horn, Blood, or the like, is more uneasie, then any thing but trial would make one think; and yet to keep the Volatile Salt is more difficult, then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Spirit; for more then once, when I have kept these fugitive animal Salts by themselves, they have penetrated the Corks, and scarce left me in the well stopp'd Glasses any footsteps of their having been there, and therefore those Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists that are not strangers to these Salts, have taken much pains to no great purpose to keep them from Avolation, some of the recentest and ingeniousest are wont, that they may mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate their uncurb'd wildness, to pour on them as much of some such Acid Spirit, as that of Salt of Vitriol <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as will produce any manifest conflict with the Volatile Salt, never considering, that as this course doth indeed devest them of their fugacity, so it doth in effect devest them of a great part of their Nature, and consequently of their peculiar Vertues. For I have elswhere shewn, that the Saline Corpuscles, obteinable by the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:56384:252"/>
Fire from Urine, being united with a sufficient proportion of Spirit of Salt, will cease to be what they were, and with the Saline parts of the Acid Liquor, will make up a kind of <hi>Sal-Armoniack.</hi> But 'tis easier for me in this our case to shew that another mans Expedient is not good, then to substitute a good one, especially in this place, where for some Reasons I must not set down, the way that I the best approve of, onely I shall tell You, that my way long was, nor do I yet despise it, to preserve volatile Salts in their own rectify'd Spirit, which swimming over them, kept them from the immediate contact of the Air, and preserv'd them so well, that by this means I have secur'd even small parcels of the fugitive Salt of humane Blood for many Years.</p>

                     <p>The Spirit of Salt-Armoniack, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> hath such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ascribed to it by Chymists, that, if I should conclude these Papers touching Spirits of an Urinous nature, without saying something to you of that, you might think I had left the considerablest of them unmentioned; but as I the rather acquaint you with the little I know of it, because, though I have met with divers Authors that extoll it, I have scarce met with any that teaches intelligibly, and candidly how to prepare it, which perhaps most of them did not know themselves, so I hope you will exact an accurate account of it the lesse rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because I can present to you but little on that Subject, besides the few Observations wherewith my own Curiosity has supplyed me; having scarce ever (to my knowledge) seen any Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> save what my own Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces have afforded me, and therefore without presuming to set down solemne processes about a subject, wherein I have found a small variation of Circumstances hinder the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made on it from producing uniform effects, I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self to give you as true an information as my memory will afford me of a few of my proceedings with this nice Salt, and the successes of them: only premising in a Word, that by <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> I here mean the Factitious and Venal, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of Urine, Soot, and Sea-salt.</p>
                     <p>And first, according to the way proposed by <hi>Glauber</hi> (in the second part of his Philosophicall Furnaces) we distilled it out of an open retort (with a Cover to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ap on and take off as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion requires) with a mixture of <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> and once we, that way, obtained a quantity of Liquor, which seem'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:56384:253"/>
strong, but before we could make any trials with it, the Viall that contained it having bin accidentally broken, we lost the opportunity of satisfying our selves of the efficacy of it: and having not long since attempted to make such a Spirit the same way, there came over indeed a Liquor which seem'd to be the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> but when we came to Rectify it in a gentle heat, the greater part of it to our wonder, coagulated in the Retort, whereinto it was put to be distill'd, into a perfect <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> (a pretty quantity of which I yet keep by me) and thereby betray'd the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Liquor to have been little else then the <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> it self, forced over by the violence of the Fire, without having suffer'd any separation of its Ingredients. Nor is it by us alone, that the Process set down by <hi>Glauber,</hi> hath been unprospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously attempted, and yet perhaps it might have constantly enough succeeded with him, and the difference of the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> (in which we have observ'd much disparity accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the places it comes from) may have produced the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of variety of Successes.</p>
                     <p>We also attempted to distill a Spirit from <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> (to pretermit divers other trials) by mixing it with equall parts of Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> but in this experiment we met with variety of success, for having exquisitely incorporated the two Salts by the help of a little fair Water, we have divers times had the upper part of the receiver (carefully luted on to a somewhat large retort) all candy'd over on the inside; with Volatile Salts of severall shapes, and the Liquor after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards forc'd over hath sometimes remained long enough in the forme of a very subtle and penetrant spirit, and sometimes again, it hath in the very receiver almost totally coagulated it self into a lump of Chrystalline Salt; and when we had mixt the Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> without any Water
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:56384:254"/>
or other moisture at all, our successes have been very like those above mentioned. Upon this occasion I dare not omit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting you with an Experiment, which yet I learn't not upon this occasion, Take of pure Salt of Tartar and of good <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> equal parts (let them be both very dry, or else you may loose your labour) and grind them very accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, though you be deterred from continuing that toyl, by a very subtle and fetid Urinous steam, wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale from the mixture; these Salts being thus exquisitely incorporated, you must put them into a large Glass Retort, to which you may fit a Receiver to catch a fetid Liquor that sometimes we have observed to come over; then admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string by degrees a very strong Fire, the top and Neck of the Retort, will be lined with a pure white Sublimate, which seems to partake as well (though nothing neer so much) of the Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> as of the <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> and of it's Qualities, and yet to differ from either; and though this Sublimate be far enough from being the true Volatile Salt of Tartar so highly extolled by <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> yet it is no ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble Medicine in obstructions, and some other distempers: And I remember one of the most expert Chymists I know, having made trial of some I presented him, told me he found such effects of it, as made him divers times very pressing and sollicitous for more. The Fetid Liquor that will come over we have found sometimes to be very little, and at other times much more copious, without being able to discern clearly whence the disparity proceeded; and the <hi>Caput Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi> remaining in the Retort, by Solution, Filtration, and Coagulation, affords a pure Salt of greater Diureticall effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then almost any I have hitherto met withall: Another way by which we attempted to obtain a Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi> was by accurately mixing two parts of it, with three
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:56384:254"/>
or foure of Quick-lime, whose vertue had not bin impair'd by being exposed to the Air, this mixture being distilled in a Retort, placed in sand, with a strong fire afforded us (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with some dry Sublimate in the neck of the Retort, and as I remember a little volatile Salt in the Receiver) a very strong and yellowish Spirit, so exceedingly penetrant, and stinking, that 'twas not easie to hold ones nose to the open mouth of the Vial wherin 'twas kept, without danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing struck downe, or for a while disabled to take breath, by the plenty and violence of the exhaling Spirits: But the Liquor forced over by this method, though exceeding vigorous as to its Qualities, was inconsiderable, as to its Quantity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee now chuse to vary a little this way of proceeding, and and let the Quick-lime ly abroad in the open Air; (but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from all other moisture, except that of the Aire) for divers dayes, in which time the imbib'd humidity of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Air would in some degrees slake it, and make it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what brittler then it was before, and the Lime thus prepared, being mingled with Salt-Armoniack, and distilled in all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances after the former manner, afforded us a Liquor so copious, and yet so strong, that we hitherto acquiesce in this way of distilling this wild Salt, as the best we have yet met with. But note, that, we used towards the latter end to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the fire to that degree, by heaping up Coales on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Retort, that, the mixture in the Retort hath been brought to flow. Note also, that though even the Spirit thus drawne persevered long in the forme of a Liquor, yet yesterday coming to looke upon a Viall of it, which we reserved, to try what effect time would have on it, we found that about a fourth or fifth part of it had spontaneously co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated it selfe into exactly figured graines of a Chrystalline Salt, the Liquor swimming above it, retaining, neverthelesse,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:56384:255"/>
a very strange subtlety: Which Observation concording with divers others makes mee apt to doubt, whether or no this so celebrated Spirit of Salt-Armoniack be really much, if at all, other then the resolved Salt of Urine, and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The great vertues, and uses of Salt-Armoniack, especially in Physick, I cannot now stay to treat of, but you will find them largely enough set downe by <hi>Glauber</hi>; whose Encomiums neverthelesse, must not be all adopted by mee, who in this place mention the Spirit of Sal-Armoniack, but as a Medicine that is neer of kin, and may serve for a <hi>Succedaneum</hi> to the Spirits of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne, Urine, Blood, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But although the last mentioned way, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> be the least imperfect one we have hitherto met with, of distilling Salt-Armoniack, yet because you may sometimes need a Spirituous liquor impregnated with the activest parts of that noble concrete when you want either Retorts to distill in, or Furnaces capable of giving strong fires, I dare not omit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that, we have sometimes drawne over such a liquor of Salt-Armoniack after the following manner.

as may fill up a fifth or sixth part of the vessell, and water it very well by degrees with the former Solution of the Salt-Armoniack, and immediately clap an Alembick on the Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and fasten a Receiver to the Alembick, closing the joynts very acurately, and from this mixture, by the gentle heat of a Bath or a Lamp, you may obtaine a Liquor that smels much like Spirit of Urine, and seemes to be much of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and this volatile liquor being once or twice rectified <hi>per se,</hi> with a very mild heat, growes exceeding fugitive and penetrant, and workes by Sweat, and a little, perhaps, by Urine; and I remember that when I first made it, having been induced by some Analogicall Experiments, I had formerly made, to give it to one that had a patient troubled with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly violent Cough, I had an account quickly brought me, that he not slowly, but wonderfully mended upon the very first or second Dose; and indeed the tryalls that have hitherto been made of it, make mee hope that it will prove little inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in efficacy to the other above mentioned more costly Spirits, scarce any of which being preparable by so safe, and compendious a way, if this Medicine emulate them in vertue, the Easinesse of the preparation (wherein little time needs be spent, and lesse danger of breaking vessels incurr'd) will much endear it to me. But, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> because I would assist You to make variety of Experiments about Volatile Salts, and because diverse tryals may be more conveniently made, when the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Corpuscles are in a dry form, then when they are in that of a Liquor; I will take this occasion to mention to You a way by whose Intervention a change on the fixt body em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about the newly mentioned Experiment, hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afforded mee store of volatile Salt. This way was only to mingle exquisitly a quantity of Sal-Armoniack, with about thrice its weight of strong Wood-ashes. For the Spirit that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:56384:256"/>
we this way drave out of a Retort plac'd in Sand, did quickly in the Receiver Coagulate into a Salt; and this Method was again experimented with like successe. And the Salt thus made we found so extreamly subtile and volatile, that it seem'd to be much of the same Nature with that of Urine, and if it be indeed, (as probably 'tis) onely the Volatile Salts of the Urine, and perhaps also of the Soot, whereof the <hi>Sal-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack</hi> consists, this may passe for a more compendious way of obtaining such Salts, then others that are hitherto wont to be practis'd amongst Chymists. But I will not undertake that this way of obtaining rather Salt then Spirit shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly succeed, Yet if you find it do not, I shall not perchance refuse You a better way. But if you could devise a Method (which possibly is not unattainable) of bringing over into a Spirit, not the bare Urinous and fuliginous Ingredients of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> but the whole Body, it may be, you would have a <hi>Menstruum</hi> that would make good, if not surpass even <hi>Renanus's,</hi> and <hi>Glaubers</hi> Elogies of the Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack.</hi>

                     <p>The affinity betwixt Volatile Salts and Sulphurs, doth, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> as well as your Curiosity invite me to acquaint you, with some of the Trials we have made about the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of Sulphureous Fetid Liquors, which I am the more inclined to do, because, though I find mention made of some of them in Chymical Books, yet they are there delivered with so little Incouragement, amongst many other processes of which it appears not that the prescribers made trial, that when I had distilled some of those Sulphurs, divers expert Chymists were very desirous to have a sight of them to satisfy themselves that such Liquors could be so prepared. The way of making the common Balsam, or Ruby of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> is too well known to need to be long insisted on. Onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                        </gap> this Balsam which is indeed in some cases no despicable Remedie, is by vulgar Chymists, according to their custome very highly extolled, and sometimes employed in Distempers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, wherein instead of performing the wonders by them expected, its Heat doth more harm, then its drying and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samick properties do good: but yet apparent it will be, by what we shall say anon, that by this preparation, the Body of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is somewhat opened, and therefore (as we said) in some cases the Ruby of <hi>Sulphur</hi> may prove no ineffectual Remedie, which may probably be improved if it be prepared by bare Digestion in a very gentle heat, by which course we have prosperously prepar'd it, though not in so short a time, when we made it not in order to some other Medicine.</p>
                     <p>To Volatilize the <hi>Sulphur</hi> thus Resolved we took the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam made the former way in a few Houres, and putting it in a Retort, either with, or without fair Water, which is supposed to help to carry up the superfluous Oyl, we placed the Vessel in a Sand Furnace, and with a gentle heat drawing off as much of the Oyl of Turpentine as would in that heat come over, we shifted the Receiver, and carefully luted on the new one; and lastly, giving Fire by degrees, we forced over a Liquor of a deep and darkish Red, extreamly penetrant, but of a smell

so sulphureous and diffusive of it self, that it was scarce to be restrained by Corks, and was by great odds stronger then that of the Rubie before distillation.</p>
                     <p>The like Experiment we tryed in a Glasse head and body placed in Sand, and through that way, likewise we obtained a Volatile Balsam of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> yet we found it too inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to be equallable w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Authors also prescribe the making a volatile Balsam of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> by driving over, after the above mentioned manner, a Solution of Flower of Brimstone in Linseed Oyl, and this Remedy they highly extoll; but though it may probably prove a good Medicine, yet since they commend it but by conjecture, and not upon Experience, I see no great reason why it should be preferable to the other; for we find that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd Oyles are much more apt to receive an offensive <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreuma</hi> then Oyl of Turpentine, which being much more volatile then they, requires nothing neer so violent a heat to make it ascend; and unless it be found, that the Sulphureous particles are able to mitigate the corrosive ones, the distilled Liquor of an express'd Oyl may prove noxious in the Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For by purposely (for trials sake) distilling Oyl Olive, by it self, though not in a naked Fire, we obtained a Liq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There is another way of preparing a Sulphureous Balsam, to which <hi>Penotus</hi> no ignoble Chymist, ascribes such stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:56384:257"/>
Vertues, that though I have not yet made trial of it in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, yet I dare not leave it altogether unmentioned; the process being briefly but this. Take good Balsam of <hi>Sulphur</hi> made with Spirit or Oyl of Turpentine, and having freed it from its superfluous Oyliness pour on it well deplegm'd Spirit of Wine, and therewith draw by affusion of new Spirit as often as need requires a sufficient quantity of a Red Tincture, which by filtration and abstraction <hi>in Balneo</hi> must be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a Balsamick consistence; this Liquor you may if you please by degrees of Fire drive through a Retort placed in Sand, and thereby obtain a volatile Balsam of very great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrancy, and probably of no small efficacy; but the Trial I have made of this process, gives me occasion to advertise You;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That unlesse your Balsam be reduced to a stiffe thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese, and almost to drinesse it self, the Operation will hardly succeed, we having fruitlesly digested for some months Spirit of Wine upon Balsam, whose consistence was somewhat too Liquid.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That as soon as the Spirit of Wine is sufficiently Tincted, it ought to be Decanted, and succeeded by new, left by too long digestion, instead of heightning its Tincture, it let fall that which it hath already acquired.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That upon a very slow abstraction of most of the Tincted Spirit in a digesting furnace, we once found the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Liquor not to be in the forme of a Balsam, but to consist partly of Spirit of Wine; and partly of a seeming distinct Oyl, whereinto the Sulphureous Tincture was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The Balsam of <hi>Sulphur</hi> thus made without Distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on seems likely to be an innocenter and nobler Medicine then the common Ruby of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> made with a hot and ill scented Oyl of Turpentine: and by this preparation may also appeare
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:56384:258"/>
the truth of what we formerly said, when we told you, that the body of the Sulphur was opened by Solution in Oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Liquors, for out of the common thickned Balsam, as you may be informed by this processe, well Rectified Spirit of Wine will, in a short time, extract a blood red Tincture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by long digestion of Spirit of Wine alone upon pure, but undissolved, flowres of Brimstone, we could not discerne any change of colour in the <hi>Menstruum</hi>; though I dare not deny the possibility of what some Authors affirme, who write, that Spirit of Wine very excellently Dephlegm'd, will in time, of it selfe draw a Tincture from flowers of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which Tincture they yet pretend not to make of a higher then a Lemmon colour. And by the way let mee tell you, that our red tincture formerly mentioned is (if it be well made) so strong of the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that probably it would make a very penetrant, and effectuall outward remedy in Aches, and divers other cold distempers of the nervous parts; for it hath been already found, that good Spirit of Wine alone is one of the powerfullest Fomentations in divers cases of that nature; (inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it hath been sometimes found to arrest the spreading Mortification of Gangrenes;) and therefore being so richly impregnated with <hi>Sulphur</hi>: which is even without the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of so subtle a vehicle very available in many dissaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the <hi>Genus Nervosum</hi>; 'tis probable that the skilfull association of two such active remedies may produce conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Effects.</p>

Lady, to whom I prosperously prescribed it against a great Tumor in her neck, which was supposed to be the beginning of the Kings-evill; But this Tumor was recent enough, which circumstance I thinke fit to specifie, because I feare that if the Scrophulous Tumor had been inveterate, the successe would not have been so good. Inwardly the chiefe Use we made of it hath been in Coughs and Distempers allyed thereunto; but its Balsamicall nature, making it both healing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistive (if I may so speake) of Putrefaction, makes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that its Vertues may be more extensive; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I remember that a while since a friend of mine tryed it with wonderfull success <hi>in mictu sanguinis ferè deplorato,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first by a gentle heat reduced it to such a Consistence, as allow'd him to make it up into Pills. But of the particular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, wherein our Remedy hath been succesfull, no more at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; We shall rather subjoyn, That though this have been the way which we have the oftenest employ'd in the making of the Balsam, yet we must not conceal from You, that we have divers times met with Accidents, which frustrated our endeavours and expectations. For if the fire administred be too languid, the Solution of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> by the Oyl proceeds not well, and on the otherside have found, that not only a strong heat is apt to burne the matter, or to make the Oyl boyl over, and perhaps take fire, but even that upon a very little excesse in the degree of heat, the Oyl and <hi>Sulphur</hi> would, before it could be expected, degenerate together into a heavy and vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Lump (almost of the colour of the liver of an Animall) which coagulated Matter prov'd afterwards exceeding difficult to be by the affusion of fresh Oyl dissolved and reduced to a due consistence. Wherefore we tryed to prepare this Balsam by putting the proportion of Ingredients formerly mention'd into a strong Urinall, which we placed in Sand, and making
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:56384:260"/>
under it no more fire then was sufficient to make it slowly worke upon the Flowers, (which did often during their Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make a crackling noise,) we continued the Operation for divers (perhaps many) houres, at the end of which we found the <hi>Sulphur</hi> dissolv'd, and the mixture reduced to a Balsamick colour and consistence. So that if you distrust your dexterity to prepare this Balsam by the former way with a naked fire, we must advise You to make use of this latter way, as that which is the safer, though it be the longer way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Nay when we had leisure enough, we did for tryalls sake, prosperously attempt the Solution of Flow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, with common Oyl by the far gentler heat of bare Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, and by that meanes obtained a Balsam perfectly free from adustion, but of somewhat too liquid a consistence, which may be easily remedied by the mixture of powder'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorice, Sugar, or any other such convenient Concrete. We must also advertise you that this Balsam may also be prepared with Oyl of Nuts, of Poppy seeds, of <hi>Hypericon,</hi> instead of Oyl-olive, or any other exprest Oyl, appropriated to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular distemper against which the Physitian intends to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the remedy, only care must be had, that the Specifick qualities of the Oyl be not so fugitive, as to be destroyed by the Ebullition requisite to the making of the Balsam, which if it be to be enrich'd with specifick vertues in relation to any particular disease, may perhaps be best prepared by the last mentioned way (of digestion) wherein the subtle Spirits that impregnate the Oyl are not in such danger to be dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the fire.</p>
                     <p>The knowingest Chymists themselves (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) are wont so much (and perhaps not altogether undeservedly) to to extoll the efficacy of Antimony, that we were thereby invited, besides divers Preparations of it for internall use, to
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:56384:260"/>
attempt the making of some remedies of it, that might also be externally applicable; and in prosecution of this designe, we found that by boyling foure or five fingers height of good Oyl of Turpentine upon very finely powdered Antimony, put with the Liquor into a strong Glasse Urinall, placed in Sand, the Oyl after some houres would grow exceeding high Tincted; and being gently in in great part abstracted, would leave behind it a body of a Balsamick consistence, and a deep rednesse; which may, I presume, be applyed to resolve, and discusse hard Tumours, and remedy divers other outward Evils, with more effect then the simple Balsam of common <hi>Sulphur</hi> formerly described. And from this Antimoniall Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam abstracted to a st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ffer consistence, we found that Spirit of Wine would draw a Tincture, which I likewise suppose might prove a very powerfull Fomentation; though the Spirit we used (perhaps because it was not sufficiently Dephlegmated) did not in a few dayes attaine to more then a very pale red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:) but this Tincture being slowly freed from the most part of the Spirit of Wine, became of the consistence of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what liquid Hony, and of a deeper colour, thereby affording us a purer Balsam; which we have not yet, (being hindred by some accidents) attempted to bring over the Helm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. Nor did we here desist, but by divers tryals found that the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Balsam, above mentioned, being put into a Retort, placed in Sand, and pressed by degrees of fire, would at length emitt Steams, which would condense in the neck of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, and fall thence into the Receiver in sanguine drops: this volatile red Balsam (especially if by this volatilization the Antimony have lost its Emetick property) we cannot but think endowed with more then ordinary Vertues, outward and perhaps inward too; considering the great penetrancy of the Liquor, and the Energy of the Minerall, with whose
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:56384:261"/>
subtle parts it is richly impregnated, if it consist not mainly of them. But we are yet in prosecution of this Preparation, and therefore till we have seen how far we are like to improve this Remedy, We shall forbear any further mention of it espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since we have already in this very Paper, given you as we suppose, sufficient proofe, that We are more sollicitous for your Satisfaction and proficiency, then for our owne Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, (of being a severe Critick in estimating of Medicines) For otherwise we should not have been so indiscreet, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with any Preparation, of whose medicall Vertues we have not yet made much tryall, whilst we are not destitute of other remedies, whose efficacy hath been manifested to us by Experience. But we have often observed, that divers usefull Chymicall Preparations are mentioned so obscurely, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligibly by the Authors that write of them, or else are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any particular, or encouraging note of Distinction mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst a crowd of other Processes, some of which have perhaps already been found to be false, or triviall, and others of which may be rationally enough distrusted; that most Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and Chymists themselves, are deterred from attempting to prepare those remedies, not so much because they seem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to prove confiderable, as because they are afraid that the Processes are false, or fraudulently set downe, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that concretes of such a Consistence, Colour, Scent, and other obvious qualities, as are ascrib'd to the Remedies proposed, are not preparable by the publish't Directions. And that you might see, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> what discouragements I have met with even from Artists themselves to keep mee from trusting to Printed Chymicall proeesses, I thinke it not amisse to mention here a memorable passage of the famous, and experienced <hi>Alexander Van Suchten,</hi> who is reported to to have gotten more by the practice of Chymicall Physick

then any of the Contemporary professours of it; for he to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of his Booke of the secrets of Antimony (of which he clearly discloseth not any in that Treatise,) gives this account of his Crypticall way of writing; <hi>Quod in hoc Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatu nullum</hi> Recipe <hi>proposuerim ob id factum est, quod vos seducere nolo,</hi> Recipe <hi>enim illa seducunt juniores Medicos: sed neque à</hi> Theophrasto <hi>ullum</hi> Recipe <hi>Scriptum est, quod ad Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinam, quin occultum seusum habeat, &amp; in quo nihil vel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit, vel abundet; &amp; hoc non fit sine magnis causis.</hi> Wherefore make account, that besides that <hi>such</hi> changes of the qualities, of Bodies, may afford much light to Naturalists, he doth Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists no useless piece of service, that acquaints them with the success of the nobler sort of processes mentioned in Authors, though he should give them little or no account of the Vertues of the Remedies prepared by those Processes; but this I hope is not altogether our case, for besides that our Observations are likely to save You much trouble, and perhaps some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and mis-adventures, besides that (I say) we have had oportunity to observe such eminent effects of severall of the volatile Liquors described in these Papers, as may justly give us promising! Expectations of the Properties of the rest, which are in their obvious qualities so neer of kin to them. And this sort of Medicines having been found sometimes to do wonders, and generally to be safe (which of a few of the known operative, and not Specifick Medicines can be truly affirmed) I not apt to thinke, that he that shall bring these Remedies in spight of their ill Scent, into the good opinion of Physitians, may make no inconsiderable number of Patients beholden to him.</p>
                     <p>I should not, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> proceed to make You repent Your Curiosity to know my thoughts of the Urinous, and Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Remedies it hath hitherto made me treat of, were it not,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:56384:262"/>
that there yet remaines something to be said, without which, all that hath been said, will scarce signify very much towards the effectuall recommending of those medicines to Your esteem and practise.</p>
                     <p>For I do not ignore, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that not only the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Galenicall Physitians, but divers of the more eminent, and judicious of the Chymists themselves, have been pleas'd to condemne the internall use of Liquors driven through a Retort, by the violence of fire, upon the scores of their being offensively Empyreumaticall, and Stinking; among which sort of Liquors I cannot expect, that our Spirits of Blood, Harts-horne, &amp;c. will escape the being reckon'd. But forasmuch as the prosperous Effects I have had oportunity to see, of divers Remedies of that Nature, have given mee for them rather an esteem, then either a detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or contempt; I suppose it may prove no unseasonable piece of Justice to the Spirit of Blood, and the other Noble, though fetid Remedies I have been setting you down; nor no unserviceable piece of Charity to Men, if in this place, and once for all, I spend some lines in endeavouring to rescue these criminated Medicines from the great Prejudice they suffer under, and from a reputation, which whilst it renders them more odious then even their smell can do, is likely to make men deny themselves the benefit of them.</p>
                     <p>I might <hi>here</hi> on this Occasion call in Question, whether not only Galenists, but even many Chymists themselves, be not somewhat more afraid, then they need be, of what they call <hi>Empyreuma.</hi> But I will suspend <hi>a while</hi> that Question, and at present confess to You, that I have sometimes doubted whether or no that stink which is generally call'd by the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention'd name, do alwayes, and necessarily proceed from the Impressions of a violent fire. For to make a pure Spirit,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:56384:262"/>
and Salt of Urine, there needs nothing, but to let it in a well stopt vessel putrifie for a competent time (as we elsewhere teach) in a Dunghill, or any resembling warmth, (and that it selfe, perhaps, is not necessary to its Putrefaction;) and then to draw off an eight or tenth part of the Liquor that first ascends by the gentle heat of a Bath. By which, or by the yet milder warmth of a Lamp-furnace, it may be sufficiently rectified, and brought to yield, besides the Spirit, good store of Salt. And since the Spirit thus made differs so little in Smell or Tast from those of Blood and Harts-horne, that most mens Noses are not criticall enough to distinguish them, (and We have sometimes taken pleasure to make Chymists themselves to mistake the one of those Liquors for the other.) It seems worth considering, whether or no the fetid and urinous Tast and Smell, which in these Spirits is said to be Empyreumati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and to proceed from the Adustion of the fire, be not the Genuine Tast and Odour of the Spirituous and Saline particles of the mixed Bodies themselves, which they would manifest if they were copiously extricated, (to speakin the Kings language) separated from the other <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Ingredients</hi> &amp; associated into one Body, though without the violence of the Fire. For to distill the Spirit of putrified Urine, wherein the like Smell and Tast are eminent, there needs (as we said) no greater heat, then that of a Lamp-furnace, or of Hors-dung, (since in the latter of these only, Urine too long kept, and but negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently stopt, hath been observ'd to have lost its volatile Salt and Spirit, before it was taken out of the Hors-dung. And such a H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:56384:263"/>
Body, by the convening (if I may so speak) of such Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles disengag'd from those other parts which clogg'd or imprison'd them, without any Empyreumaticall Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from any violent externall Heat, may appear by the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Oyles of Spices. For though though they be usually drawn by Chymists and Apothecaries, by the help of Water in Limbecks; and though they have by us been drawn after another manner (which we may elswhere teach You) with a much gentler heat (sometimes not not exceeding that of an ordinary <hi>Balneum)</hi> yet these well Dephlegm'd Liquors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining so well the Genuine Taste and Smell of the Concretes they were drawn from, that they pass unaccus'd of Empyreume, are some of them much stronger and hotter then the Spirit or Salt of Mans Blood, or of Harts-horn: As may appear especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Oyl of Cinnamon, which if pure, is more pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trant and fretting, then any thing but tryall could easily have perswaded mee. And lest you should object, that the Fire doth considerably contribute to the strength of these Liquors, otherwise then by disengaging the Particles they consist of from the unactive parts of the Concrete, and assembling them together, I must advertise You, that I have observ'd little less Heat &amp; Penetrancy then in diverse of these, in some Liquors separated without the assistance of Distillation: As for Instance, in the purer sort of the true Peruvian Balsam, and in another kind of natural Balsam, almost of an Amber colour, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to an Eastern Prince) who carried it up and down with him as a Jewel) whose Domesticks at his death sold it, whereby I came to procure some of it, and found cause to wonder at its strength both upon the tongue, and in its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. But granting, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that the Volatile Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies treated of in these Papers, may have their offensive Smell and Taste imputed to the Fire, yet perhaps Physitians
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:56384:263"/>
would more slowly, and more tenderly censure the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies in question for their Empyreumaticall stink, if they did but consider, that they themselves scruple not to use (to name those among many others) <hi>Senna</hi> and Scammony, though the former be wont to gripe the Guts, and the latter have an Acrimony, Heat, and Mordacity so unkind to to the Bowels, that a few grains exceeded in the Dose turnes it into poyson; because the ill Qualities of these Medicines, may by proper Correctives be somewhat mitigated, and the Good they doe, doth more then countervaile the Inconveniencies that attend the use of them. For the very same Considerations, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> will be applicable to the excuse of those fetid Medicines, for which we Apologize: For though the <hi>Empyreuma</hi> or Impression of the fire, for which they are rejected, be the Quality, whose absence from them were very desirable, yet may that <hi>Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuma</hi> by dextrous Preparations be in some measure corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted (insomuch that I have known highly rectified Spirits of Urine, by being digested for divers months in an exquisitely stopt Glasse, brought to be of a Scent, which to mee seem'd scarce at all stinking, and to others even pleasant) and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice that may be justly fear'd from what remains, is advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously recompenc'd by the benefits accruing from the efficacy of their more friendly Endowments. And in effect we find, that the Dogmatists themselves are grown not to scruple the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring the Spirit of Salt, though extorted (if it be of the best) by a much greater stress of Fire, then is requisite to the Distillation of any of the Medicines we defend. And not only the famous <hi>Riverius</hi> (as we have elswhere noted) extolls the Spirit of Tartar, and Soot, which are yet sufficiently fetid and Empyreumaticall, but severall other (and among those some of our eminent English) Physitians frequently use, and commend the Oyl of <hi>Guajacum</hi> forced through a Retort.
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:56384:264"/>
And no less do divers learned Doctors esteem, and employ the Empyreumaticall Oyl of Amber: Though (to note so much by the way) That be in divers cases far inferiour to the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt, which (if the fire be skilfully administred) may at the same time, and by the same Operation be obtained. This Salt, besides the Efficacy ascribed to it in the Convulsions of Children, having been lately found by Experience to be an excellent Medicine against the Epilepsies, even of well grown Persons, being administred in the Dose of not above a Scruple, or halfe a Drachm, in a due Quantity of Peiony water, or some other proper Vehicle.</p>
                     <p>And on this occasion You may also be pleased to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that foliated Gold, is ordinarily and without Scruple em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by Physitians, not only to cover Pils, but as a main In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient (though how properly I define not) of severall of their richest Cordiall Compositions extant in Dispensato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and yet to how great a fire Gold is wont to be exposed before it be melted out of the Oare (wherein 'tis usually (at least as far as we have observ'd) blended with other Metals, and Minerals) and to Purifie it upon the Cupell either with Lead or Antimony: he that is unacquainted with the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mineralists, and the Art of Refiners, will not easily imagine. And, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to satisfie You yet farther, that the strong Impression of Fire in the Medicines, doth not alwaies make them so noxious as they are commonly reputed; let mee desire you to take notice, that there is scarce any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament more generally given, and applauded, even by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall Physitians then Steel, which is often administred in Substance, made up with other Ingredients, into the Form, either of Pills, or Electuaries. And yet we have wondred to see what great Fires, and violent Blasts of huge Bellows moved by Water-engines, are used to melt Iron first out of the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:56384:264"/>
Stone; and if it be to be farther refined into Steel (much of that us'd in Physick being factitious) a new violence of the Fire is requisite: And though after all this to make astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Crocus Martis per se</hi> (which is accounted one of the best preparations of it) they are wont to keep <hi>Mars</hi> (as the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists speak) amidst reverberated flames, or in some glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Furnace for many houres, yea sometimes for divers dayes; Yet this Medicine is with more successe then Scruple daily administred by learned Physitians, in Dysenteries, Fluxes, and other distempers where astriction is required. And 'tis somewhat Strange to mee, that the having been expos'd to no greater a Fire then is requisite to distill Spirit of Blood, or of Harts-ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as for the unpleasantness of the Smells of our Spirits of Blood, Harts-horn, &amp;c: besides that, to very many Persons there is no Odour so loathsome, as that of a Potion. We find that the Galenists themselves scruple not in the Fits of the Mother (which y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him in by Urin, That <hi>it Smells well from what thing soever it comes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> if Your Nostrils were so nice, that they must needs be comply'd with, though with the hazzard of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Vertues of the Salts they are offended with, I Could propose an Effectuall Expedient to gratifie them; and being now invited by so pressing an Occasion, I shall not scruple to annex something of it, and tell You, that if we may judge of the Vertues of the Spirit and Salt of Soot (which I am wont to make without addition) by their sensible Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: they must be much of kin to those of the Spirit of Harts-horn, and of Urine; (though these be animall Substances.) And therefore having elswhere more particularly, and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Experiments declared the affinity between these Salts in divers regards; it will not, I presume, be look'd upon as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usefull or unseasonable Hint, if I give You a summary, though but imperfect, Account of what I remember my selfe to have done, in order to the freeing of the Volatile Salt of Soot, from that very offensive Smell, which may possibly make many, even of those that need them, abominate those Medicines, how Piercing and Noble soever, which it Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misheth. The Process is as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Take a Quantity of well Deflegm'd Spirit of Wine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the Quantity of Salt, whose Odour You desire to correct; into this Spirit drop as much Oyl of <hi>Rhodium,</hi> or of any other Odoriferous Chymicall Oyl, as will suffice to make the Liquor as strongly Scented as You desire it: shake the Oyl, and Spirit well together, and if they were both well made, the latter will imbibe the former, and sometimes be thereby turn'd into a whitish Substance; with which if it smell not strong enough of the Oyl, You may by Agitation incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate more Oyl, and if You judge the mixture too strong al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:56384:265"/>
You may dilute it at pleasure, by the affusion of more Spirit of Wine. This done put the Salt of Soot into a Bolthead, or Glass Egge (according to the Quantity that You intend to sublime,) furnish'd with somewhat a long Neck or Stem, and afterwards powring on leisurely Your Odoriferous Liquor, You may with it wash down the Salt that is wont to stick in the Neck of the Glass. After this you must very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully stop the Vessell with a Cork, and store of hard-wax, if you cannot conveniently, make use of an exacter way of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it. This Glass You must place in a Lamp furnace, or some other, wherein You may give a very moderate heat, for that will suffice to elevate to the neck and upper part of the Vessell the pure white Salt of Soot, imbued (at the second time, if not at the first) with the Scent of the Odoriferous Oyl, which You imploy'd about the Preparation.</p>
                     <p>This Experiment, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> may prove of that Use in Physick, that it may deserve as well for its Nobleness, as the watchfulnesse, which is requisite in him that makes it, to be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated by the ensuing</p>

                        <p n="1">1. Then it is requisite that the Spirit of Wine be very good, For that which is not sufficiently Dephlegm'd, will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Nor would every Chymical Oyl, although it were well scented, be fit for this Preparation for divers of them as Oyl of Turpentine, and Oyl of Amber will not sufficiently mingle with Spirit of Wine, unlesse they be previously subtiliz'd after a peculiar manner.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Proportion betwixt the Spirit of Wine, and the Oyl that it is to be dissolv'd in, 'tis not easie to determine; for a lesser Quantity will suffice of some Oyl's, then of other. And the Proportion of them must be vary'd, according as You
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:56384:266"/>
would have the sublim'd Salt to participate more or lesse of their Odour, and other Qualities.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Great diligence must be us'd in closing the top of the Glass, because of the great fugacity, and subtilty of the Salt, whose Avolation is to be prevented: But then much greater care is to be had, that the Heat be not too stoong, but as equal as may be, and much inferiour to the Moderate heat of an ordinary Chymicall <hi>Balneum.</hi> For 'tis scarce Credible how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily this unruly Salt will be excited either to make an escape at the mouth of the Glass, or to break it in pieces. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member among such other Accidents which have befallen us in the Preparation of this Odoriferous Salt, that having once set some of it to sublime from a perfum'd Chymicall Oyl, though though we administred so gentle a heat, that we thought the Vessel out of all danger of being broken, or found open: Yet in a short time the fugitive Salt did with a great noise blow out the Cork that was waxed to the top of the Vessel, leaving in the bottom not a limpid Oyl, but a Liquor of a red colour, and a Balsamick Consistence. But if the Glass be wide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to allow these fumes competent Roome, and if the heat be warily administred, the Sublimation may be well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough perform'd.</p>
                        <p>Of the Medicinall Qualitiy of this Aromaticall Salt, <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> we have not yet had opportunity to make tryall, but some esteem may be made of them by calling to mind the Vertues of the simple Salt of Soot, and considering the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Liquors, from which in this Our Preparation it hath been Sublim'd. The Principall, if not the only thing, that seems to be fear'd, is, that the Salt of Soot being it selfe hot, and Chymicall Oyles being for the most part eminently so too, our Salt may prove unfit for Men of Hot and Cholerick Complexions, and in such distempers, as proceed from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:56384:266"/>
of Heat. But then it may be considered in the first place, that the Salt of Soot, being of an extreamly apertive, resolving, and Volatile Nature, and carrying up with it in Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation only the more fugitive parts of the Liquor from which it is sublim'd; It is very likely that the heat produc'd by a Medicine, which by reason of its fugacity would stay but a very short time in the Body, will not be so lasting as that of ordinary Sudorificks, which are neverthelesse often admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred with good Success, even in hot Diseases.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That there are divers Bodies and Distempers, wherein Remedies may be the more proper, for their being somewhat hot, and Experience shewes, that in Dropsies (to mention now no other Diseases) these Volatile Saline Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that set the Blood a whirling and powerfully promote its Circulation, may prove very availeable.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The Heat that may be fear'd upon the use of our Salt, may be either prevented, or at least moderated by the seasonable use of such cooling Remedies, as may be no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Operation of this Salt, and yet no friends to the Distemper, against which it is administred;</p>
                        <p>And Lastly, Supposing that the inconveniencies procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from this Heat were not to be altogether avoided, yet the advantageous efficacy of so powerful and searching a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, may very much outweigh that Inconvenience; And ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Other instances of this Nature You may meet w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>fficulty, in Pills and other Medicines, to use the Chymical Oyl, either of Cloves, or of Nutmegs, or even of Cinnamon. And some of our emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentest English Doctors, as I lately noted, have not scrupled of late Years, to use the strong and fetid Chymical Oyles of Amber and of <hi>Guajacum</hi> (and the latter of these in large Doses) whereas in our Preparation, onely the finest and most Aromatick parts of the Oyls, seem to be associated with the fuliginous Salt, since the Oyl remaining after the Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has been observ'd to be thick and ropy almost like a Syrrup.</p>
                        <p>But whether or no this Aromatick Salt be a safe Medicine in all Hot Bodies and Diseases, it seems very probable, that it will prove a very powerful Remedy in those Distempers for which it it proper. For first, whereas Spagyrists have with much study, but without much success, endeavour'd to emak Oyls capable of being mixt with other Liquors, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving them of their oleaginous form, in which <hi>Helmont</hi> himself complains that they are offensive; we have by our Preparation their finest parts associated with the penetrant and volatile Salt: by whose assistance they are not only fit to communicate their Vertues to Liquors, but assisted to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate exceedingly; and perchance also, thereby to obtain such an accesse to the innermost parts of the Body, as is seldome allow'd to Vegetable Medicines. Secondly, We may have by this Preparation one of the most noble and volatile Salts of the World, not onely free'd from its stink, but imbu'd with the Odour, and perhaps divers of the Vertues of what Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Oyls we please. And since these Chymical Oyls are by Chymists and Naturalists thought to contain the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and active parts of the Vegetables whence they have been destill'd; And since also the Salt of Soot sublim'd from
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:56384:267"/>
them, carries up with it the finest parts of these Oyls, why may it not be hop'd, that no small number of distinct Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be afforded us by this single Experiment? These Remedies too may be the more acceptable both to Physitians and Patients, because they have not in them any thing that is Mineral, and notwithstanding their great Penetrancy and Efficacy have in them nothing of Corrosive, as many of the Saline Remedies prescrib'd by Physitians in their Dispensato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And thirdly, That the Salt of Soot thus sublim'd may be also enrich'd with the <hi>Sulphur</hi> or Balsamick part of the Spirit of Wine, which was employ'd about its Preparation, may appear probable enough to him, that shall examine, by his tast and otherwise, such rectify'd Spirit of Wine as has had a sufficient quantity of Volatile Salts sublim'd from it. And how Balsamical a substance is diffus'd through pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, may be guess'd at by the great change which is made in the Caustick Salt of Tartar, when it is so dulcify'd as to make that Excellent Medicine, which <hi>Helmont</hi> extolls against inward Ulcers, and calls <hi>Balsamus Samech</hi>; which if one had the abstruse Art of so preparing the Salt and Liquor, as to fit them for Conjunction, might be made onely by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling very frequently pure Spirit of Wine from very fine Salt of Tartar. For by this means the fix'd Salt, retaining the Sulphureous Salt or Balsamick parts of the Spirit of Wine, (as may appear by the Aquosity of the Liquor that comes over the Helm in this Preparation) is thereby so depriv'd of its caustick tast, that when it will rob no more Spirit of Wine, but suffer it to be drawn off a strong as it was pour'd on, it will easily in a moist place run <hi>per deliquium,</hi> into a liquor not of a Caustick, but Balsamick (and as it seem'd to us a pleasant) Tast.</p>

For he must have been extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily happy, or very m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ch unacquainted with the Practise of Physick, that has not found, that even those Medicines which are most celebrated by the best Authors, both Galenical and Chymical, do sometimes prove ineffectual as well as often prosperous, and the Remedy prescribed by the same Physitian to twenty Patients sick of the same Disease, has more then once been Observed, though it have succeeded in nineteen, to fail in the twentieth. And indeed the Causes of Diseases, the Constitution of Patients, and the Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Distempers are so very various, intricate, and obscure, that it is extreamly difficult even for the most knowing and experienc'd Physitian to make an accurate, and constant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in the Therapeutical part of Physick; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently such Experiments are much lesse to be expected
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:56384:269"/>
from Me, whose Condition as well Disabilities forbid me to make the Practise of Physick my businesse, and allow me onely to administer it occasionally, either to my own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Acquaintance, or to such poor people as are not able to gratify Physitians, or such as I meet with where there are not any: And thereby I am reduced to learn the Vertues of divers of the Remedies I have prepared by very few or none of my own immediate Trials, but the Relation of Physitians, who do me the Favour to administer them for me. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though I ende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>vour to put them into the hands of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as well as ingenious men. Yet not being allowed to be my self a constant eye-witnesse of the Effects they produce, I must here for all these reasons solemnly professe to you, that as I do not set down Medicinal Experiments, with the same positivenesse that I do Physiological ones, so I do not intend to venture the repute of being a faithful Relator of Experiments, upon the successe of any Medicinal Receipt or Processe.</p>
                     <p>Yet in the next place I must tell You, that You would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps do Me but right, to think not only that the Chymical preparations of Remedies are, if you understand them aright, candidly set down, though the Vertues ascribed to them do not constantly upon all Trials display themselves; but that I have not rashly and inconsiderately, or upon uncertain Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors recorded the vertues of particular Remedies, which may be good, though they be not infallible. It being sufficient to make a Medicine deserve the Title of Good, that it be often (in some degree at least) succesful, though now and then it prove not availeable, especially if it be otherwaies so safe and innocent, that even when it proves not prosperous, it weakens not nature, nor is otherwise noxious; And we must nor, <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophilus</hi> be so timid as to suffer our seves to be perswaded,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:56384:269"/>
that if a patient miscarry after the use of the Remedies, the fault must necessarily belong to the exhibited Medicine. For oftentimes Nature will in spight of Remedies make a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastasis</hi> of the peccant matter, and so empair the Condition of the patient; and much oftner before death, the Conflict of struggling Nature, and the conquering Disease doth manifest it self in horrid and dreadful Symptomes, which some envious or ignorant Doctors (for the more learned are wont to be more equitable, and lesse partial) injuriously impute to the Chymical Remedy, given before the appearing of those Symptomes, never considering that the like Accidents are wont to attend dangerous Diseases, and dying persons, where Galenicals Remedies onely, and no Chymical ones at all have been administred. And that divers of the most eminent, and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>thodical of our Modern Physitians scruple not to use fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently both <hi>Crocus Metallorum, Merc. Dulcis,</hi> and some other Chymical Remedies, and to impute the miscarriages of the Patients that use them to their Diseases, though not many years, since all the frightful Symptomes accompanying the dying persons to whom they had been exhibited, were confidently imputed to those Medicines. To which let me adde, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that oftentimes it may be very just to prize an Empirical Remedy more then a Galenical, though the Methodist and the Empirick have each of them by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Remedies, performed cures of divers patients in the same Disease; <hi>partly</hi> because Empirical Chymists are seldome resorted to but in desperate cases, or till Nature be almost spent, either by the violence of the Disease, or the unprospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous operation of the Medicines employed to remove it; and <hi>partly,</hi> because the Methodist helps his Remedies by premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the wonted Evacuations (by Vomit, Seige, or by Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy) by varying them according to Emergent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:56384:270"/>
by skilfully and seasonably administring them, and by strict rules of Diet; whereas the Empirick oftentimes useth but a single Remedy, and usually without premising gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evacuations, exhibits it not to the greatest Advantage in relation to time, and other circumstances, and is much more indulgent to his patient in point of Diet: So that when an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirick, and a rational Physitian do both in several patients Cure for instance the same Plurisie, the Disease may be very often judged to have been removed in one of the Patients chiefly by the Physitian, and in the other by the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I must advertise You, that though I mention more Chymical remedies then Galenical, yet it is not out of any partial fondnesse of the former, and much lesse from any undervaluation of the latter, but <hi>partly,</hi> because Chymical processes being wont to be more unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, or obscurely set down by Authors then Galenical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, I thought it might save You some labour to receive from me a frequenter account of those, then these; and <hi>partly,</hi> because in many Chymical preparations, divers considerable Changes being to be wrought upon the Concretes to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by them, there is oftentime so much of Philosophy to be learn'd by such Processes, that the successe of them may prove instructive to you, though it should acquaint you with their Truth only, as they are Chymical preparations, and not as they are Medicinal Receipts. But otherwise I love to look upon both Chymical and Galenical Remedies, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial eye, and think that neither the former ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised for the latter, nor the latter for the former; for as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Remedies have commonly the advantages of being more durable, lesse clogging by their quantity, and lesse nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seated by Patients; so Galenical Remedies have when they
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:56384:270"/>
are of equal Efficacy, the Advantages of being more cheap, (at least quantity for quantity) more procurable, and sooner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. And such is the variety of Cases arising from the variety of Constitutions and Distempers, that in some of them the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sort of Remedies may be more proper; and in others, the latter may seem requisite; and in some also both sorts may alternately be so useful, that neither of them can well be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth place, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> let me advertise You, that divers Chymical Remedies, and some Specificks also which are not Chymical, have seem'd upon triall lesse effectual then indeed they are, because they have been tryed by such Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians as weaken their Efficacy by not administring them as they should. For some Physitians will never exhibite a Chymical Remedie, till the Patients strength hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most tired, if not quite spent with the unprosperous use of divers other clogging and debilitating Medicines. Others are so diffident of Chymical Remedies that they never dare to exhibite them in a full Dose, nor by themselves, but will blend a small quantity of a Chymical Medicine or a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick with other Ingredients, which either constitute with it a Medicine of new qualities resulting from that mixture, or at least much clog or enervate the activity and vertue of the Chymical or Specifick Ingredients: by which, even in so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable a Dose, these distrustful Doctors d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that great matters should be performed. Of which inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious way of administring the Remedies I recommend to you <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I do not causelesly desire you to beware; as I may hereafter have occasion to shew you by particular instances of the Reasonablenesse as well of this Advertisement as of the others which I either have given You, or shall give you in this and other Papers. And another sort of Physitians there is
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:56384:271"/>
who are of so despondent and rather partial an Humour, that if a Chymical Remedie or a Specifick do not presently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the hop'd-for Cure, though they find that even upon their disadvantageous manner of administring it, it doth good; yet they will quickly desist from the Use of it: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth not do Wonders, they will not scruple to affirm that they have tried it and found it do nothing; whereas they are wont to continue their own Courses of Physick without discouragement, though it be usually some weeks before the Patient find any good by them, and oftentimes (as numbers of the printed Observations of Physitians as well as daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience testify) the patient is by the tedious Course of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick he has gone through very little better'd, if not much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd. Which I speak, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> not with an Intention to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage Physitians in general, the most learned and ingenious of them being free enough from the Partiality I here take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, but to keep good Remedies from being disparaged by the envious or unskilful trials of bad Administers: And though indeed some Chymists are so vain-glorious or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary, as to promise that the Operation of their Remedies should be as well suddain, as effectual; yet if the Medicines themselves be found availeable, although not swiftly so, that flownesse ought to make us but condemne the Boastings of the man, not reject the use of the Remedies.</p>
                     <p>And in the last place, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I must Advertise you, not to expect that every one of the Remedies I commend should be Physick and Physitian too; I mean, that it should of it self suffice to performe the Cures of those Diseases against which it is commended. For Medicines are but Instruments in the hand of the Physitian, and though they be never so well edg'd and temper'd require a skilful hand to mannage them; and therefore I cannot but admire and disapprove their
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:56384:271"/>
boldnesse that venture upon the Practise of Physick, wherein it is so dangerous to commit Errours, barely upon the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of having good Receipts. For though by Conversation with eminent Physitians I have found the learnedest of them to disagree so much about the Nature and causes of Diseases, that I dare not deny but that he may prosperously practise Physick that either ignores or dissents from the received Doctrines of the Schooles concerning the causes of Diseases, and some other Pathological particulars; yet I cannot but dislike their boldnesse who venture to give active Physick, either in intricate or acute Diseases without at least a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity of knowledg in Anatomy, and so much knowledg of the History of Diseases, as may suffice to inform them in a competent measure what are the usual Symptomes of such a Disease, what course nature is wont to take in dealing with the peccant matter, and what discernable alterations in the Patients Body do commonly forerun, and thereby foretel, a <hi>Crisis,</hi> or otherwise the good or bad event of the Disease. To all which is to be added some tolerable measure of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, not only of the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> and the chief waies of compounding several ingredients into Medicines of several Formes and Consistencies, as circumstances may require; but also of the orderly and seasonable administration of the helps affordable by them. These particulars, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> might easily be enlarged on, but having neither the leisure nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to handle them commonplace-like, I shall only give you this account of my requiring in the Profess'd Practiser of Physick some knowledg both of the <hi>Materia medica</hi> and the Method of compounding and administring Remedies, that (excepting perhaps the <hi>Arcana majora</hi> as Chymists call them) even the best Medicines by being unseasonably or preposterously administred, especially in acute Diseases
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:56384:272"/>
where Nature's motions are to be diligently watcht, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded, may do a patient as much harm as the orderly and skilful administration of them can do him good. And that he that has nothing but one good receipt for a Distemper, and knowes not how to vary it by adding, omitting, or substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting other parts of the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> as urgent occasion shall require, may oftentimes find himself reduced either to suffer his Patient to languish helpless, or to venture by curing him of one Disease to cast him into another. For sometimes the Patients constitution makes the Medicine prescribed by the Receipt unfit to be administred; and sometimes too, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease for which the Receipt is proper, is in the Patient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with some other Distemper which may be as much encreased by the Specifick, as the other Disease may be less<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. I know for instance some eminent men that are wont to Cure very stubborn Venereal distempers, by a Chymical preparation (which some of themselves have been pleased to disclose to me) of the <hi>Indian</hi> Plants, <hi>Sarsaparilla, Guaiacum, &amp;c.</hi> But if these men met with Patients, such as those which <hi>Eustachius Rudius</hi> mentions himself to have often met with, who upon the use of the least quantity of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> though corrected with cold ingredients, were wont to be presently affected with such sharpnesse of Urine, and Inflammation of the parts, to which Urine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>elates, as hazarded their lives; they would be reduced, as well as our Author confesseth himself to have been, to have recourse to <hi>Mercurial</hi> or other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. To which we may adde, that the use of <hi>Sarsaparilla,</hi> and <hi>Guajacum</hi> is generally forbidden by the warier sort of Physitians, in those Patients, whose Venerial Distempers are complicated with heat or Inflammation of the Kidnies or Livers. And sometimes also it happens, that the very outward forme of the Medicine prescribed by the Receipt is not fit,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:56384:272"/>
or perhaps possible to be administred. For not to mention that divers Patients can retain no purgative Physick exhibited in the form of a Potion; and some others are as apt to Vomit up whatever is given them in the form of Pills, not to insist on this I say, I shall content my self to relate to You a memorable Case that hapned a while since to a Physitian of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He was called to a lusty young Woman, who upon an accidental but violent Cold was suddenly taken with such a Constriction of the Parts inservient to Speech and Deglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, as made her altogether unable either to speak or swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any thing at all; and having thus continued some daies in spight of Glysters or other Remedies prescribed by a very Learned Physitian, and in spight of Endeavours to excite Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, by making Her hold emetick things in her Mouth; the poor Woman was in great danger (when my acquaintance came to her) of perishing for hunger: what in this case could be expected from the best Remedies that must necessarily be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in at the Mouth? Wherefore the Physitian finding her yet strong enough, and without Feaver, and yet her case al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most desperate, did as judiciously as luckily prescribe a Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, wherein to ordinary Ingredients were added (as himself a very few daies after told me) about four <hi>ounces</hi> of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> with an advise that it should be kept in as long as possibly She could, and by this Medicine. Nature being sufficiently irritated, there quickly followed upon it some violent Vomitings, and upon them a liberty both of Swallowing and Speaking. [And since this a young Gentleman and Fellow-traveller of mine, had the Organs of deglutition so strangely weakned without any manifest cause, that though he were able to make me a Visit, and acquaint me with his Case, yet he was very apprehensive, he should in a very few Dayes be starv'd, and being unable to swallow
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:56384:273"/>
Remedies, had quickly perish'd in despight of the <hi>Arcana Majora</hi> themselves, had he been master but of such of them as (like those wont to be magnify'd by Chymists) must be taken into the Body; if a very happy Physitian to whom I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him, had not by a very Efficacious and Specifick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine externally to be apply'd, seasonably rescued him from so unusual and desperate a Case.] But, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> as I would not upon the score of good Receipts have the Physitians skill despis'd, or thought uselesse; so I wish that the Physitians skill may not make him despise good Receipts; For we have often seen (especially in outward affections) not onely Empericks and Chirurgeons, but even Ladies and old Wives, with a lucky composition prescribed by a Receipt, performe more constant and easie Cures of the particular Distemper, for which that Receipt is proper, then even Learned Physitians by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, though pompous and Artificial Prescriptions. And the illustrious Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> (one of the most judicious Naturalists that our Age can boast,<note place="margin">

And in the same Tract just before He comes to enumerate <hi>Paracelsus</hi>'s Arcana, <hi>Concedo,</hi> saith he, <hi>Universales aliquot Medicinas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Helmont. in Arcan. Paracels. pag. in</hi> 790.</note> 
                        <hi>quae sub unisono Naturae longe gratissimo, insensibiliter post se vinctum educunt hostem, cum egregia Organorum depuratione, Concedo pariter appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas aliquot quo universalis amplitudinem in specificis morborum directionibus amulantur.</hi> And among those <hi>Arcana</hi> themselves that is ranck'd but in the second place, of which he gives this Characters: <hi>Sequitur dein Mercurius Vitae, Stibii proles inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gri, quae omnem morbi nervum penitus absorbet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And because another <hi>Arcanum</hi> does not so powerfully renovate, as that last mention'd, and two more; He allowes to those three others the precedencies of that whereof He yet saith: <hi>Quarto loco est Mercurius Diaphoreticus, melle dulcior &amp; ad ignem fixus, solis Horizontis omnes proprietates habet: perficit enim quicquid Medicus &amp; Chirurgus possint optare sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendo.</hi> But because, that any Medicines should be qualify'd to deserve such superlative Encomiums, may seem a thing fitter to be wish'd then credited, I would not disswade You till the Chymists Cures have made good their Masters brags, to be altogether of our Authors Mind, who somewhere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses: <hi>Se morbum non dinguere, si Remediis</hi> (sure he speaks of such Remedies as he thought he had) <hi>sit summa bonitas.</hi> But yet you may perchance ascribe much more even to Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies far inferiour to the <hi>Arcana Majora,</hi> in the cases wherein they are most proper, then many are willing to believe. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I have sometimes observ'd with wonder, that an
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:56384:274"/>
Excellent Person (whom I need not name to You) cures the Rickets generally in Children of several Ages and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions without having hitherto fail'd (as she professes) in any one, by prescribing no other Remedy then the single use of the above describ'd <hi>Colcotharine Flowres,</hi> which I presented Her; and which a couple of Physitians also, to whom I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them, tell Me, They have try'd in the same Disease with the like success, as this Lady hath hitherto met with. And I remember that eminently Learned and experienc'd Physitian Dr <hi>G. Boat,</hi> (of whose skill both your Excellent Mother and You have had good Proof) solemnly assur'd me, as I elswhere also note, That he knew a Physitian who constantly cur'd within two or three Fits all Agues, whether recent or radica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in Persons of all Ages, Sexes, and Complexions, indiscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately with one single outward Application to the Patients Wrists; but that this Envious Doctor would never part with it to our Friend, or any else, no not upon his Death-bed: onely Dr <hi>Boat</hi> discovered, That Spiders or something com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from them were main Ingredients of his <hi>Pericarpia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed there are certain Preparations and Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Remedies so lucky, and whose Successe doth so much exceed Expectation, and the Efficacy of common Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; that the same Physitian, whose they are, may upon several Occasions prescribe an Hundred others, each of which he may think as rational as any of those, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless shall be all of them much inferiour thereunto. And therefore I wonder not that the most Learned of the Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dists themselves have much valued and celebrated some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Processes and Receipts, as here amongst us (to mention no others) the Famous S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Theodore Mayerne,</hi> was wont almost in all Obstructions, Cachexies, and Hydropicall Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to magnifie and use that peculiar Salt of Steel of his,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:56384:275"/>
which he was pleas'd to call <hi>Anima hepatis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to these Domestick Instances (which I might easily accumulate) of the esteem eminent Physitians have made of Receipts, I might adde very many Forreign ones. Nay <hi>Galen</hi> himself, who has so copiously treated of the <hi>Materia medica,</hi> and the <hi>Composition of Medicaments,</hi> though he were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expert at drawing up Receipts, doth yet in his Book <hi>De Compositione Medicamentorum,</hi> and elsewhere transcribe, and sometimes commend (and mention his having us'd) divers of the Compositions of Auncienter Physitians, and especially magnifies <hi>Andromachus</hi> His Treacle.</p>
                     <p>I might, <hi>Pyroph:</hi> here mind You, That we see that Chymistry, as Incompleat as it yet is, has been able so much to improve the preparations of Remedies, as to afford us some, which are so Innocent as well as Efficacious, that in the Diseases they principally respect, they require not, as of Necessity, neer so much of Theorical skill, as others do in the Administer; I might likewise take notice, That Experience also teacheth, especially by what we see perform'd by the <hi>Spaa,</hi> and some other Mineral Waters, that one Medicine <hi>may</hi> be so richly endow'd, as to be more Effectual against several differing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, then even the better sort of oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I might further represent as some thing that makes yet more to my present purpose, that though every Body can advise his sick Friends to an Air that is famously healthful, if there be any within a convenient Distance from them; Yet there are some Aires so eminently good, and that not upon the Account of any one Predominant Quality that makes them opposite to a Disease springing from its contrary, but f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of differing Ages and Complexions: as Navigators observe in the Isle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Helen</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and some other <hi>Europaeans</hi> in their passage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> often leave without Physitians great numbers of Sick, whom they find for the most part recover'd at their return. And that sometimes ev'n the acutest Diseases may by the Sanative Steams that inrich the Air be cur'd almost in a trice is assur'd by those that have liv'd in grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> who have affirm'd to me, what the Learned <hi>Prosper Alpinus,</hi> who so long practis'd Physick there, assures Us, That upon <hi>Nilus</hi>'s beginning to over flow, though in the Heat of Summer, there ensueth a suddain Recovery of those multitudes of Persons of differing Ages, Temperatures, Sexes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which there happen at that time to ly Sick of the Plague. These things I say, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> and more I might adde, to what You may find dispers'd here and there in the ESSAYES which this Paper accompanies towards the inferring that we should not hastily conclude it <hi>Impossible</hi> that there May be found such Medicines as may be more then particular and Specifick Remedies without requiring the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a great physitian. But to draw at length to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, I shall rather Summe up my present thoughts of this Matter Thus.</p>
                     <p>Ordinary Receipts without an Ordinary Measure of skill in Physick are not rashly to be rely'd on, especially in Acute Diseases; where by giving Medicines otherwise innocent enough, to loose the opportunities of administring proper ones may be v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry prejudicial, and where sometimes the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral seasons of the Disease do require such differing Remedies if they be but Ordinary ones, that a Medicine proper enough for the Disease at one season of it may do Mischief at another: But if indeed there be Noble and Extraordinary <hi>Arcana,</hi> that work rather by strengthning and restoring Nature, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:56384:276"/>
or otherwise destroying the peccant Matter they find any where in the Body, then by irritating and weakening Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or putting Her as it were to a troublesome Plunge; the use of such Remedies may deserve to be a little otherwise consider'd, as that which may not Ordinarily (for I say not Ever) require more Instruction then may be afforded to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons not Indiscreet by such Directions and Cautions as may be Divulg'd, or otherwise Communicated, together with the Remedies themselves: As we sometimes see that by the help of such Instructions unlearned Persons and ev'n old Wives do with some one Soveraign Plaister, Balsam, or other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Remedy, Cure many and various Tumors, Ulcers, and other Sores in Persons of differing Sexes, Ages, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions. And because You will easily grant that this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample does farre lesse accomodate our present purpose then does the Case it self, as I just now put it, I hope You will allow me to represent further, That at least it seems not so Rational to judge of all the Remedies that Art improving Nature can afford us by those that are hitherto in Use either among Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodists or Vulgar Chymists, but rather to think that the Nobleness of Remedies will be advanc'd according as the Art of preparing them shall be promoted; and that it tis not so safe and easy, positively to determine the Efficacy of the former, otherwise then in Proportion to the Discoveries we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to in the Latter.</p>

In the mean time he gave them Diet that was most Nourishing.

Besides it is altogether drying, and therefore I should not despair that it, being hung about Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Necks, might cure the Falling-sickness in them. I truly saw a Lad, that sometimes would be eight whole Moneths free from the Falling-sickness, and then, when by chance this fell from off his Neck, he became immediately surprized with a Fit; and again, hanging another Root in its place, he would continue well: Therefore, for Experiment sake, I thought good to take it again from his Neck, which when I had done, and found that the Lad fell into his former Convulsions, we took a great piece of a green Root, and hung it about his Neck, and from that time He continued well and felt no more Convulsions. It was therefore most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either that certain parts did exhale from the Root, and were drawn into the Body by Inspiration, which did so work
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:56384:281"/>
