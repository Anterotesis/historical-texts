            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NEver any Pieces more <hi>wanted</hi> ſo great a Name, as your Lordſhips, to cover their faults, if the <hi>Compoſition</hi> of them is ſurvey'd, nor more <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd</hi> it, if the <hi>Nobility</hi> of their Subjects is conſider'd, than theſe <hi>Eſſays,</hi> which now beg your Lordſhips Protection. If the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement</hi> of them reſembled the <hi>Matter</hi> they are employ'd about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might appeal to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Judgment, as a <hi>Critick,</hi> not fly to your Goodneſs, as a <hi>Patron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

defects of theſe <hi>Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> ſo am I equally ſenſible that your Lordſhips Writings and Worth have gain'd you ſuch a ſettled Eſteem amongst all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>whoſe Eſteem is valuable, that if it is poſſible to guard an ill Writer from his just Doom, your Lordſhips <hi>Character</hi> may enſure him. And certainly if any faulty Performances carry their excuſes along with them, theſe may lay claim to Pardon, ſince they are wholly deſign'd to promote <hi>Truth, Virtue,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> how defective ſoever they are on other regards. Even the Imperfections of them may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be uſeful, as Nature ſerves her ſelf of the moſt contemptible <hi>Means</hi> to bring about wonderful <hi>Ends;</hi> for by not appearing ſuch, as ſo good Themes would ſuggeſt to Perſons of excellent

Parts, they may provoke them to draw their more artful Rens in ſo juſt a Cauſe, and to ſubſtitute better <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> in their places, and to reſcue theſe illuſtrious Subjects from ſo rude Hands as mine, by employing their ſucceſsful Wits in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. It will be Felicity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for me, if I can ſo far contribute towards producing a good Writer, as to be his Foyl, and to <hi>ſhew</hi> that in others, which I cannot make my ſelf.</p>
            <p>I hope theſe Exercitations will not be look'd on as quite uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, tho' ſomething of the ſame kind with moſt of them, has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly appear'd in ſeveral Languages. For ſome of the Arguments, I think, are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely old, and tho' their <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is ſometimes ſo, yet the <hi>Form</hi> or Dreſs is always new.

It may often be as hard to trace from whence the Materials were taken, as in a Wine-Veſſel, to ſhew from what Grape each drop of Wine was preſs'd.</p>
            <p>In one or two of theſe <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes</hi> I have had Authors of note in foreign Languages in my view, which are ſo well known, that it is ſuperfluous to name them.

            <p>If the Opinions which I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are rather thoſe of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, than modern Writers, it is becauſe I look upon <hi>thoſe</hi> to have greater ſtrength than <hi>theſe,</hi> and in divers places the <hi>latter</hi> to have only tranſcrib'd the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> tho' neither are our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writers paſt by without conſideration.</p>
            <p>If I differ from great Men in ſome Punctilio's, I believe it is generally where I can produce others of equal remark, of my Sentiments; and I deſire to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my Diſſent with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable deference and regard, and to pay the utmoſt Honour to thoſe admirable Perſonages, whom I am ſo bold as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict. Notwithſtanding which I am very willing to ſubmit all
<pb facs="tcp:62708:5"/>
to riper Judgments, declaring that I make theſe <hi>Attempts</hi> publick, more with a <hi>deſire</hi> to invite others to inform me, than with the <hi>preſumption</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming others.

            <p>As to the time of giving theſe <hi>Eſſays</hi> light, it cannot be ill choſen, when our Eſtabliſhed Religion is attack'd by <hi>Scepticks, Deiſts,</hi> and others of that Rank: and therefore, as in a publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, every perſon is commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put himſelf into a poſture of Defenſe; and if the dumb

This <hi>Divine Word,</hi> or Chriſt Incarnate, is by St. <hi>John</hi> call'd <hi>God;</hi> not as <hi>Smalcius</hi> imagins, <hi>becauſe</hi>

And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Standard of Divinity, they too might put in their pretenſions to it, in ſome meaſure, as well as our Saviour. Nor is the <hi>Divine Word</hi> ſtyl'd <hi>God, becauſe he was born after a Divine</hi>

                  <hi>Innocence.</hi> For from whence does this Innocence ariſe, but from an uniform Obedience to the Will of God? But now if to obey God, makes the Perſon obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable of being call'd <hi>God,</hi> the holy Angels, who always preſerv'd the moſt exact conformity to the divine Will, may as juſtly challenge the divine Attributes, as our Saviour. So that by <hi>God</hi> is meant, <hi>God</hi> by Nature and Subſtance: <hi>God,</hi> who had a Subſiſtence, and that Subſiſtence from his Father, of whom he was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from all Eternity, and was Himſelf <hi>Eternal God.</hi> So that the ſence of the words will be, that the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>divine Word</hi> which aſſum'd Fleſh, is <hi>God;</hi> not by Office, or any other foreign denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by Nature, Eſſence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In order to prove which, I ſhall</p>
               <p>Firſt, Shew that the Nature and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is truly Divine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall reflect on the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of any Aſſertion different from this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62708:10"/>The Nature and Eſſence of Chriſt is truly Divine, 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Becauſe he is juſtly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with Divine Worſhip; and 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Co-partnerſhip with God the Father in thoſe actions, which could only be perform'd by his ſubſtantial union with the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Nature of Chriſt is truly Divine, becauſe he is juſtly honour'd with Divine Worſhip. For if nothing can be honour'd with Divine Worſhip, but <hi>God</hi> himſelf, and if Chriſt is honour'd with ſuch a Worſhip, it follows, that Chriſt muſt be truly <hi>God.</hi> But nothing can be worſhip'd with Divine Worſhip, but <hi>God</hi> himſelf. For every act which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies an Honour peculiar to <hi>God,</hi> ſignifies alſo an Excellence, which belongs to none but him; and to aſcribe Divine Honour to any Object, is at the ſame time to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute Divine Perfections to it. The Command of worſhiping the Lord our <hi>God,</hi> and of ſerving him only, was not a <hi>Temporary Command, which,</hi> as ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,<note place="margin">Volkel. de ver. Rel. l. 5. 6. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>oblig'd purely under the Old Teſtament;</hi> but is a ſtanding Rule for Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, under the Goſpel, as well as under the Law. For our Saviour did not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62708:11"/>
any Branch of the Law, but what was meerly Typical. But how could a Precept for Divine Worſhip be a Type? What could it repreſent, or figure out in the Evangelical Occonomy? But 'tis far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reply'd, That in worſhiping Chriſt, <hi>we worſhip the Father by whom he was endued with ſuch a Power, and that this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Worſhip of God, and of Chriſt, That the Worſhip of the former is circumſcrib'd and bounded within Himſelf, whereas that of the batter is only relative;</hi> or as others term it, <hi>God is worſhip'd as</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jo. Lud. Wolzogen on</hi> Matth 4. 10. <hi>p.</hi> 189.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſupreme cauſe of All things, as the firſt Author of our Salvation; but Chriſt only as the Means which God had appoinied to bring about that miraculous Work.</hi> But this way of reaſoning does not only conclude for the worſhiping of Chriſt, but of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extraordinary Inſtrument of Man's Salvation. The Apoſtles themſelves, on this account, might have been ador'd as well as their Divine Lord and Maſter. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> was not juſtly acquainted with the Privileges annex'd to his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when he reprimanded the devout Centurion, for <hi>falling down at his feet, and worſhiping him.</hi> The chief Objection which can be form'd againſt this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62708:11"/>
is, That <hi>Angels have had Divine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Smalc Hom.</hi> 1. <hi>in</hi> 1 Job.</note> 
                  <hi>Worſhip paid them by the Patriarchs, and therefore Divine Worſhip may be given to others beſides God.</hi> To this the Orthodox<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Junius, Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi> and others.</note> reply, and even the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves grant, that theſe Angels were <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Meſſias</hi> himſelf. That he on ſome great deſign aſſum'd an Angelick Form, as he did afterwards for Man's Salvation an Human Nature; and therefore the paying of Divine Worſhip to Him, was no alienation of it from God. But upon a due enquiry, it will appear, that this is more than the Orthodox ought to have ſaid, or than the <hi>Socinians</hi> had reaſon to have allow'd. For theſe Celeſtial Beings mention'd in Scripture, if ever, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were not always the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but ſometimes at leaſt, as they are expreſl, <hi>Angels.</hi> For as the Meſſias never <hi>took on him the Nature of Angels;</hi> ſo neither did he, in all theſe places of Seripture, their Appearance. For the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> with a great deal of Elegance and equal Paſſion, recommending the Virtue of Hoſpitality, in alluſion to theſe Texts of Scripture, ſays, That ſome of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs in practiſing it, had <hi>entertained Angels unawares.</hi> But would not his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62708:12"/>
have had much more force, as well as beauty, if they had entertain'd God, or the Meſſias himſelf unawares? What cauſe had he to diſſemble the dignity-of the Perſon, who vouchſafed to viſit theſe hoſpitable Roofs, and do an injury, if not to the Truth, at leaſt to his Subject? But to return: Why ſhould this Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was paid to the Angels, be any thing more, than a Civil Honour and Deference, expreſt indeed after an extraordinary manner, on account of the greatneſs of the Perſons, and the glorious import of their Meſſage? So that from hence cannot be deduc'd any Worſhip due to Angels; nor have we hence any reaſon to conclude, that any thing is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd, beſides <hi>God</hi> alone. As it is thus plain, that <hi>God</hi> only is to be worſhip'd, ſo is it equally ſo, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be honour'd with Divine Worſhip. For it is made part of the terms of Salvation, to worſhip him <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> for <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call upon the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Where <hi>Lord</hi> can only be apply'd to our <hi>Saviour Jeſus;</hi> and not to <hi>God</hi> the Father, ſince it agrees only to Him, who, in the former part of the Diſcourſe was, by the Apoſtle, ſtyl'd a <hi>ſtumbling ſtone,</hi> and a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62708:12"/>
                  <hi>rook of offence,</hi> which cannot fute with God the Father, who was own'd by all Nations, without the leaſt ſcruple. And it is farther to be obſerv'd, that theſe words are cited from the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> where the word <hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>Jehovab, God</hi> by Nature, Being and Eſſence; not a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inveſted with Divinity, according to the new fancy of our Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſhers in moſt of his Epiſtles with this Prayer, full of Charity, <hi>Grace to you, and Peace from God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſts;</hi> combine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jeſus</hi> with <hi>God</hi> the Father, which had been the higheſt injury to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, had the latter only been a Creature, how exalted ſoever his Rank might have been, to have jointly petition'd him, to have given <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> to the Saints. And tho' to this it is return'd, That St. <hi>John in the Revelation might, by the ſame reaſon, be ſaid to pray to the ſeven Spirits which were before the Throne of God, and ſo have equal'd them with God:</hi> Yet this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection will rather ſupport our Reaſons, when we conſider, that by the <hi>ſeven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> are to be underſtood the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and its ſeven-fold Gifts, as they are brancht out by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> into
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62708:13"/>
                  <hi>The Spirit of Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge, of Piety, and of Fear of the Lord.</hi> For otherwiſe why ſhould St. <hi>John</hi> place any other <hi>Spirits</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Why ſhould he omit the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>Giver of Grace,</hi> and addreſs himſelf to Angels, who are but <hi>Miniſtring Spirits?</hi> So that this, inſtead of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing what was before laid down, will be a new Inſtance of joyning no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with <hi>God,</hi> but what is <hi>God.</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, St. <hi>Stephen, a Man full of Faith and the Holy Ghost,</hi> recommends his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as equal to the Father of Spirits, with this ſolemn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</hi> And tho' to this it is reply'd, That <hi>this act of St.</hi> Stephen'<hi>s can be no Precedent to us, becauſe he ſaw the Heavens open'd, and the Son of Man ſtanding at the right hand of God;</hi> yet why ſhould the ſight or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of the object of our Adoration, make it more or leſs adorable? <hi>God,</hi> tho' <hi>He is a God who hides himſelf;</hi> who, tho' He inhabits Regions of Eternal Light, is inviſible to our Eyes of Fleſh; yet is He ſtill to be worſhip'd with the moſt humble Devotion. And as long as we are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62708:13"/>
convinc'd by Faith, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ready to ſuccour us in our Neceſſities, and give us what we ask, we have reaſon enough to Pray to Him, tho' there is no miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous opening of the Heavens, nor the glorious Scene withdrawn, to diſcover <hi>the Son of Man ſtanding at the right hand of God.</hi> Farther, At the <hi>Name of Jeſus</hi> is not <hi>every knee to bow, of things in Heaven, and things under the Earth?</hi> Are not <hi>all the Angels to worſhip him?</hi> So that ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be worſhip'd but <hi>God,</hi> and Chriſt is to be worſhip'd, it follows, that Chriſt is <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to make a ſhort Reflection on what has been ſaid on this <hi>Argument.</hi> There is no occaſion to prove, to the ſtrict Followers of <hi>Socinus,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> ought to be worſhip'd; for they are as zealous Patrons of his <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as they are arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Underminers of his <hi>Divinity.</hi> For<note place="margin">Socin. ad Praefat. Vu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jek. p. 8. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. 1624.</note> 
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> expreſly <hi>Excommunicates all thoſe, who denied our Saviour's Worſhip.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that <hi>If Chriſt is not to be invok'd, then is he Chriſt only in Name.</hi> That <hi>ſuch</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Praefat. ad Reſponſ. F. David.</note> 
                  <hi>a Notion is a manifeſt tendency to Judaiſm, and to exalt</hi> Moſes <hi>above</hi> Chriſt. That<note place="margin">Tom. 1. pag. 656.</note> 
                  <hi>they who are againſt the Worſhip of Christ, cannot be Chriſtians; becauſe, tho' they dare</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62708:14"/>
                  <hi>not openly, yet do they really deny Jeſus to be Christ.</hi> But that which made it neceſſary in this Argument, to inſiſt on the <hi>Worſhip</hi> due to Chriſt, is the Poſition of the modern <hi>Socinians,</hi> who finding how hard it was to reconcile the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of a <hi>God Made,</hi> with the Divine Prohibitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Idolatry, have thrown off our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's <hi>Worſhip,</hi> with his <hi>Divinity.</hi> I ſhall only quote the words of one of their own Party. <hi>There are,</hi> ſays he, <hi>no acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>Milbourne, p.</hi> 50.</note> 
                  <hi>requir'd to be paid to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but ſuch as may be paid to a Civil Power, to a Perſon in high Dignity and Office, to Prophets and Holy Men, and to ſuch as are actually poſſest of the Heavenly Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</hi> But to proceed,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt, or the <hi>Word</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> becauſe of his Co-partnerſhip with <hi>God</hi> the Father in thoſe Actions, which could only be perform'd by his Subſtantial union with the Divine Nature. Theſe Actions are, the <hi>Creation of the World,</hi> the <hi>Inſpiration of the Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing all power in Heaven and in Earth; Raiſing the Dead out of their Graves, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them according to their Works;</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the World.</hi> Firſt, Chriſt is <hi>God</hi> becauſe of <hi>His Co-partnerſhip with God the</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62708:14"/>
                  <hi>Father in the Creation of the World.</hi> For to Create is an act proper to the Deity; <hi>For he ſpake and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood faſt; He hath made the Earth by his Power, he hath eſtabliſhed the World by his Wiſdom, and hath ſtretched out the Heavens by his Diſcretion.</hi> Nor had he any Creature to aſſiſt him in his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Production; for <hi>He is God, even he alone, he made Heaven and Earth.</hi> But 'tis very plain that all things were Created by Chriſt. <hi>For all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made, that was made. He was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Socinians</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this Creation, not of the Moſaick forming every thing out of Nothing, but of the New Goſpel-Creation, by which the Reaſonable World (if we may ſo ſtyle it) was put into a capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering its original Rectitude and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs. But this is a forc'd ſence, and quite different from what the ancient Fathers underſtood the words in. Nay, the very <hi>Arians</hi> themſelves apply'd them to a proper Creation; and to obviate the ſtreſs of them, made Chriſt God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, or ſubſervient Power only in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62708:15"/>
the Creation. But as to the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſence, if <hi>Creation</hi> in theſe places is wholly Figurative and Metaphorical, why may it not be ſo in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> too? Why may not the Creation of the viſible Heavens and the Earth, in the Old Teſtament, be no more than the Foundation of the Jewiſh Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; ſince it is own'd, that by <hi>New Heavens and new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs,</hi> in the New, no more is underſtood than a renew'd ſtate of things under the Goſpel? Why ſhould <hi>the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which was upon the face of the Earth,</hi> ſignifie more than that State of ſpiritual Darkneſs, which blinded the whole World before the Moſaick Law?

of Creation, St. <hi>Paul</hi> remarks to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians,</hi> that <hi>By Chriſt were all things cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they are Thrones and Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers.</hi> Where it is to be obſerv'd, firſt, That <hi>All in Heaven and Earth,</hi> things void of Reaſon, and ſo not liable to <hi>Error</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> and ſo uncapable of this New Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, were made by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, That <hi>Dominions and Powers,</hi> Angels, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad,</hi> were form'd by him: But the <hi>Good</hi> had no need of this New Goſpel-Creation.

not be Creators; but that they, and the whole World were made by <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit, Three Perſons and One God.</hi> So that this place can never be underſtood of this New Creation, or Goſpel Renovation.

               <p>Secondly, Becauſe he <hi>Inſpir'd the Holy Prophets.</hi> For he <hi>by whom the Prophets ſpake,</hi> was <hi>God.</hi> For the Word which came by them was the <hi>Word of the Lord;</hi> and the Scriptures which they wrote, is ſaid to be <hi>given by Inſpiration of God.</hi> For <hi>Holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But he who ſpeaks by the Holy Ghoſt, ſpeaks by the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> the Son, as well as by the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> the Father.

               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is <hi>God,</hi> becauſe of his <hi>Exerciſing all power in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> For the Government of the World is a Branch of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. <hi>He rules over all Kingdoms of the Earth.

Chriſt</hi> therefore muſt be <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Chriſt is God,</hi> becauſe <hi>He is to raiſe the Dead from their Graves to Life and a new State.</hi> For none but <hi>He</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62708:17"/>
                  <hi>who breath'd a living Soul into us,</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it. None but One, whoſe Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is infinite, who knows every Atome of our Bodies, every Duſt and Particle which belongs to us. He who is conſcious what Duſt appertains to each Body, what Body to each Soul. None but One, whoſe Power is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded as his Knowledge; in regard of whom all Creatures muſt ſuffer and do what he will have them. Who can ſummon and re-aſſemble our ſcatter'd Atomes from the Earth, and from the Waves, and reconcile our long eſtrang'd Parts to their ancient familiarity. Whoſe Voice can awake the ſleepers of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Years, ſome to <hi>Peace and Joy,</hi> but ſome to <hi>Miſery and everlaſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</hi> But Chriſt is the <hi>Perſon who muſt raiſe the Dead. For the Dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live. All that are in the Graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done Good unto the Reſurrection of Life, and they that have done Evil unto the Reſurrection of Damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Chriſt is God,</hi> becauſe <hi>He ſhall Judge the World.</hi> For it is neceſſary for him who ſhall Judge the World, that he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62708:17"/>
ſhould be intimately acquainted with the Conſciences of all Mankind; that all their Thoughts ſhould be <hi>laid naked and open to his view,</hi> and that all the devices of their Hearts ſhould be manifeſt to him. But none beſides <hi>God</hi> can have ſuch a Knowledge as this: for <hi>Lo! he that declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkneſs; the Lord, the God of Hoſts is his Name.</hi> But <hi>Christ is ordain'd by God to be Judge of the Quick and Dead;</hi> and <hi>to this end Chriſt both died, roſe, and revived, that he might be Judge both of the Dead, and the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and ſo for that reaſon muſt be <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>He who ſhall deſtroy and change the World, who,</hi> in the Prophet's Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>ſhall roll the Heavens together as a Scrowl, the Heavens, which like a wide ſtretched Scrowl, are written over with beauteous Characters by God's own hand; he is God.</hi> For this is one of the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Actions of <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>he ſhall deſtroy the Heavens. For as a Veſture ſhall he change them, and they ſhall be changed.</hi> But <hi>Volkelius</hi> owns, that our Saviour has ſuch a power, and <hi>that he ſhall roll them up together like a Scrowl, and burn</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62708:18"/>
                  <hi>them.</hi> And therefore on that account muſt be <hi>God;</hi> which may be farther made out:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the ill Conſequences of the contrary Aſſertion. For how open does the <hi>Socinian</hi> Chriſt lie to the Exceptions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſort of <hi>Deiſts,</hi> who own a <hi>God,</hi> a Providence, and a future State; and to any who maintain the Unity of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> yet deny the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> And is it not very ſutable for the <hi>Jews</hi> to reaſon againſt Chriſtianity, from the <hi>Socinian</hi> Principles, after this method?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We are convinc'd from Scripture, that there is but one <hi>God;</hi> we know that there is no other beſides him, or with him: for <hi>Who is God ſave the Lord, and who is a Rock ſave our God?</hi> But now you introduce one Jeſus as <hi>God,</hi> who was neither <hi>God</hi> from Eternity, nor by Nature and Eſſence. This new, this cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated God, we look upon as a Fiction; we can pay him no Homage, no Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, till we have renounc'd <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and offer'd violence to the Principles of Reaſon, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion. Farther, our God has
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62708:18"/>
taught us by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that <hi>He even he is the Lord, and beſides him there is no Saviour;</hi> and this is ſpoken Prophetically with regard to the times of the Meſſias. How then can we own this Jeſus for our Saviour, who is by Nature different from <hi>God?</hi> We are commanded to <hi>worſhip the Lord our God, and to ſerve him only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> How then may we worſhip and ſerve Jeſus, who is a God different from the God of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> How can we give him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Honour with the <hi>Lord Jehovah,</hi> without provoking his Wrath, and forcing him to repeat all thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions on us, which our Fathers juſtly ſuffer'd?

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62708:19"/>
Has not God taught us to addreſs to him alone in the time of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and promis'd his ſuccours to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage our Prayers? Can we then pray to <hi>your Jeſus,</hi> whom you your ſelves deny to be the true God of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> The Scripture threatens, that <hi>Gods which have not made the Heavens and the Earth, even they ſhall periſh from the Earth, and from under the Heavens.</hi> Can we then honour him for <hi>God,</hi> who was ſo far from <hi>making the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> that he himſelf had no Being when they were form'd? Or can <hi>God</hi> at the laſt Day be angry at us, for not receiving and worſhiping him as <hi>God,</hi> who according to <hi>Scripture,</hi> was to <hi>periſh from the Earth, and under the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens?</hi> Laſtly, The Idea, which we have and always had of God, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him to our Minds, as <hi>preſent every where, Omniſcient</hi> and <hi>Almighty.</hi> If therefore he, who is offer'd to us to be worſhip'd under theſe Ideas; is not God by Nature he is to be look'd on as a ſtrange God. How can we then aſcribe theſe Attributes to <hi>your Jeſus,</hi> whom you deny to be God by Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out laying out ſelves under the guilt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62708:19"/>
of worſhiping ſtrange Gods? If you reply, <hi>That the Miracles perform'd by your Chriſt are Motives ſtrong enough to juſtify his Worſhip, and that the mighty Works which he did, prove that he was cloath'd with ſuch a Divinity as might deſerve Honours more than human.</hi> To this, not we, but our God himſelf ſhall anſwer, that <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet, and give you a ſign or a wonder, and the ſign or the wonder come to paſs whereof he ſpake unto you, ſaying, Let us go after other Gods, and let us ſerve them; Thou ſhalt not hearken unto the words of that Prophet.</hi> Such a Prophet as this we look on <hi>your Jeſus</hi> to be; his Miracles of this falſe nature; becauſe they tend to bring us off from the Worſhip of the true <hi>God,</hi>
                  </q> to give part of it to him.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould make ſuch an Apology as this for the not worſhiping and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> I cannot ſee what a Denier of his Eſſential <hi>Divinity</hi> could reply to it. It ſeems to be exactly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd in every part, and each Concluſion drawn from their own Principles. Either they muſt wholly denie his Worſhip, and ſo make him a Pure Man; or if he is to be worſhip'd, they muſt grant, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62708:20"/>
he is God by Nature and Eſſence. <hi>If I am God where is my Worſhip,</hi> does not hold with greater force againſt the irreligious deſpiſers of God's Service, than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of it would do againſt our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, <hi>If I am to be worſhip'd I am God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſumm of all is, That Chriſt, or the <hi>Word</hi> Incarnate, is <hi>God;</hi> not becauſe <hi>whatſoever appear'd in his Prophetick Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was full of Divinity,</hi> not becauſe <hi>he was born after a divine manner,</hi> not becauſe <hi>he was taught by God,</hi> not becauſe <hi>he was endued with Divine Innocence,</hi> but on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Divine Nature and Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which was prov'd, becauſe <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is worſhip'd is God,</hi> and that Chriſt is to be worſhip'd; and ſecondly, by reaſon of his <hi>Co-partnerſhip with God the Father in Divine Actions;</hi> ſuch as are, <hi>The Creation of the World, the Inſpiration of the Prophets, the Exerciſing of Divine Power, the Raiſing the Dead, the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Deſtruction of the World.</hi> And in the Second General were ſhewn the ill Conſequences which may be drawn from the contrary Poſition. So that even the Being and Unity of a God are not clearer Articles of Natural Religion, than the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> of the Reveal'd.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THE Apoſtle had in the former Chapter diſcover'd the inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of a ſtate of Sin with that of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that the pretences of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling <hi>fellowſhip with God</hi> with <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in darkneſs,</hi> was the greateſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that could heighten any Impiety. That it was <hi>a making God a Liar,</hi> and was a poſitive denial of Actions to be ſinful, which he had by the moſt expreſs Laws and Sanctions declar'd and enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch. He then ſhews that the trueſt Teſt of, and the ſecureſt Method to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62708:21"/>
to a perfect State, was to <hi>walk in the Light as God is in the Light,</hi> to partake with Chriſt of his Graces, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him in his Purity. That this was the only ſign of the real and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feign'd <hi>Gnoſtick;</hi> and that we might hence meaſure our Knowledge of God, by our keeping his Commandments. But that if we ſhould fall into any Sin, the way to remove it, was not by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we have not ſinn'd; that either our Natures are ſo pure, that they change every thing we do into acts of Piety, or at leaſt that God is willing, out of his favour to us, to overlook our Tranſgreſſions: but that it was our Duty to confeſs our Offences, to acknowledge our Danger, and to flie to God for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don upon Repentance. And then he comes to ſtate the nature of Remiſſion, that it was nothing elſe but the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour's Satisfaction, or Propitiation for Sin, to the Penitent: which Propiriation was ſufficient in its nature and force to artone for Sin, and in its extent and compaſs to reach to all the Crimes of Mankind. For—<hi>He is the Propitiation for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62708:21"/>Propitiation is the reconciling of an offended Party to him who has injur'd him, by performing ſome Act by which his diſpleaſure may be remov'd. And as it is ſpoken of our Saviour, it intimates, That he has done ſomething ſo grateful to God, that on conſideration of this, God is willing to take Man again into his favour; to forgive him his Sins, and to beſtow thoſe Bleſſings on him, which were doe only to his Innocence. By Sins are underſtood, firſt, Our inclinations and tendencies to Sin, and then Our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary breaches of God's Laws in their utmoſt extent, with all thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which may either heighten or leſſen their guilt. For Offences in this latitude, and for Crimes in this compaſs, is our Saviour a Propitiation.</p>
               <p>From the words I ſhall ſhew, That Chriſt is a true and complete Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Sin: Where I ſhall enquire,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> How Chriſt is a Propitiation; and then</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the manner of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Propiriation. That it was wrought
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62708:22"/>
by procuring our Sins to be forgiven, is granted on all ſides; but after what manner our Sins were remov'd, is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly diſputed. Which Conteſt being manag'd by the Followers of <hi>Socinus</hi> on one hand, and by thoſe who juſtly ſtyle themſelves <hi>Orthodox</hi> on the other; I ſhall in order to a due determining of this Matter prove, firſt, That Chriſt did not propitiate for, nor remove Sin, after any of thoſe methods or ways which <hi>Socinus</hi> contends for, nor that any of them can amount to a Propitiation; and next, I ſhall ſtate the true Means by which he did really take our Sins away, and propitiate for them. Firſt then, Chriſt did not propitiate for Sin after any of thoſe ways which <hi>Socinus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for, nor can any of them amount to a Propitiation. He did not propitiate for Sin, by <hi>barely laying down his Life to</hi>

                  <hi>Remiſſion might be purchas'd;</hi> nor <hi>by gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or acquiring a Right and Power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Sin, with which he was not inveſted before;</hi> nor <hi>by meerly leading a Life of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Obedience and Submiſſion to the Will of God, which ſhould be a Pattern to all his</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62708:22"/>
                  <hi>Followers, and by the imitation of which they ſhould certainly procure Remiſſion;</hi> nor laſtly, <hi>was it the Death of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd only as a ſtrong and active perſwaſive to perform thoſe Terms, which are neceſſary to the taking away of Sin, which wrought this Propitiation.</hi> Not any of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, nor all of them united, how far ſoever conducing to apply this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, were the thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Chriſt did not propitiate for Sin, by <hi>barely laying down his Life to confirm, or bear witneſs to that Doctrin, in which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin was contain'd.</hi> For this makes the Death of Chriſt rather a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, or an Effect of this Remiſſion, than the efficient Cauſe on Producer of it. For the Exiſtence, or the Being of any thing, is the Cauſe, as well as the Meaſure of the Teſtimony, and not the Teſtimony the Cauſe of the Exiſtence. Therefore if Chriſt's Death was only a Teſtimony to that in which Remiſſion of Sins is included, it has no ſhare in it. A Teſtimony in proportion to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Worth of the Teſtator may give Light to thoſe who are ignorant, or Conviction to thoſe who doubt of any Matter; but can contribute nothing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62708:23"/>
of reality to the thing it ſelf. But it is plain from Scripture, that Chriſt's Death did really, effectively and antecedently work to the Remiſſion of Sins. And that <hi>we have Redemption in his Blood, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sins. That the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all Sin; and that without ſhedding of Blood there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi> Therefore this <hi>ſhedding of Blood</hi> muſt be ſomething more than a bare Teſtimony to the Doctrin, in which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Forgiveneſs, Cleanſing from Sin,</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion</hi> are imply'd; muſt be the very Conveyer of theſe Bleſſings to us, without which we had been <hi>ſtill in our Sins,</hi> and under an indiſpenſible obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Puniſhment for them. For at this rate the Blood of the Martyrs might pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify us from Guilt, as well as that of our Saviour, ſeeing that that too was ſpilt as a Teſtimony to the ſame Doctrin. Nay, their Blood was on this account a more full and extenſive Teſtimony to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, even than his; becauſe, when our Saviour died, tho' the Morals of the Chriſtian religion were brought to their perfection, yet there was ſomething farther to be added as Objects of Faith and Belief, which were not yet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62708:23"/>
as our Saviour's Reſurrection from the Dead, and Aſcenſion into Heaven. Now to theſe our Saviour's Death could bear no Teſtimony, as being reſults from it, and tranſacted after it; but the Death of the Martyrs ſtill ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd and ſettl'd this fundamental Truth of Chriſt's being riſen again, which by being eſtabliſh'd it ſelf, confirm'd all the reſt. Now <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf freely owns, that the Reſurrection of our Saviour is a neceſſary Article of our Belief, and an eſſential Principle of our Religion. Nay, this is almoſt the only one of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianian</hi> Creed which regards our Saviour. And <hi>Socinus</hi> applies Remiſſion of Sins to this, rather than to our Saviour's Death; becauſe that the Hopes of that glorious State of which our Saviour took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, upon his Reſurrection, have the ſtrongeſt Influences to reform our Lives; which Reformation is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately attended with the Remiſſion of Sins. So that the force of the Argument will be this, That if all that our Saviour did towards Remiſſion of Sin, was only giving Teſtimony by his Death to that Doctrin in which Remiſſion was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; then the Primitive Martyrs, who
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62708:24"/>
bore witneſs to this Doctrin by laying down their Lives for it, when it was advanc'd to a fuller extent, did more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, at leaſt equally co-operate to this Forgiveneſs. But ſince this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is never attributed to any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of theirs, it follows, That our Saviour made his Propitiation by ſome other act than this of Teſtifying. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as the reaſon why our Saviour was put to Death, was not his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Forgiveneſs of Sins,</hi> but his <hi>declaring</hi> himſelf the <hi>Son of God;</hi> ſo that which he atteſted by his Death, was rather his own Divinity, than the Truth of what he had before taught. But granting that it might be one of the leſs principal Deſigns of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Death, to give Sanction to his Doctrin by his Blood, yet this could not perform it ſo ſutably and ſo complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as his Miracles did; which were fully adapted to this purpoſe, and to which he addreſſes, as to the exact ſtandard by which his Doctrin might be examin'd. 'Tis true, that to die for a Man's own Sentiments, is a bold and a gallant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, and a ſufficient warrant, that he himſelf believes what he ſays; but this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62708:24"/>
is not ſecurity enough for me to aſſent to his Tenents; becauſe he may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the Truth of that, which he himſelf is very conſcientiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of. For as Falſhood may be maintain'd with equal warmth and zeal as Truth, ſo may it be ſuffer'd for, with reſembling Patience. But when Miracles are once brought to ſecond a Doctrin, theſe ſilence any farther doubts; I yield, I am convinc'd: for theſe are either contrary to the Laws of Nature, or above them, and ſo are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted by God himſelf, who will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exerciſe his own Power, nor dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it to any other, to ratify a Lie, or grace an Impoſtor. So that ſince our Saviour's Miracles were more proper, more clear and viſible Teſts of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin than his Death, if his Propitiation, or what he did towards the aboliſhing of Sin, conſiſted only in bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Doctrin, it might rather be deriv'd from theſe, than from his Blood; which is a Paradox which hitherto has never been advanc'd.</p>
               <p>To proceed: This Propitiation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt in <hi>Chriſt's meerly gaining or purchaſing, by his Death, a Right or Title</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62708:25"/>
                  <hi>to forgive Sin.</hi> For our Saviour did not purchaſe any ſuch Right by his Death, becauſe he was inveſted with it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſuffer'd; and when a Perſon is once legally poſſeſt of any Right, he needs no ſubſequent act to appropriate it more cloſely to him. But that our Saviour had ſuch a Right before his Crucifixion, is plain, as from ſeveral other places of Scripture, ſo from that inſtance of his <hi>Healing the ſick of the Palſy;</hi> where he Prefaces his miraculous Cure with that comfortable Declaration of, <hi>Son thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> And leſt it might be urg'd, That this was only a removing of his temporal Puniſhment, it is very apparent that our Saviour diſtinguiſhes between theſe two Acts, by ſubjoyning the other Command of, <hi>Son take up thy bed and walk,</hi> which had been utterly needleſs, if the former words had implied a Cure of his Diſeaſe. Nor can it be ſhewn, That Propitiation for Sin can coincide with a Right of forgiving Sin; for the former pre-ſuppoſes an offended Party, which muſt be ſatisfy'd; an offending one, which is of it ſelf unable to attone its Anger; and laſtly, a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator or Sequeſter, to finiſh the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62708:25"/>
So that three Terms are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make up an entire Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but a Donation (and a gratuitous Remiſſion is nothing elſe) is only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two, where there are no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable Hindrances or Lets, why the Donor ſhould not ſuffer his Bounty to ſtream freely out towards the Indigent, without any third Perſon to interpoſe for him, or to bear his Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Farther: Neither did Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiate by <hi>meerly giving us an Example of Obedience, which if we tranſcribe, we ſhall aſſuredly have our Sins pardon'd.</hi> For how much ſoever our Saviour's Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be ſerviceable to our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it can have no regard to our Pardon. For if we can work out our own Pardons, by an exact and unerring Imitation of our Saviour's Obedience, the exactneſs of which muſt conſiſt in gaining the ſame Ends, by the ſame Means; then did our Saviour at this rate, by his own Obedience, work out a Pardon for himſelf, or elſe he could be no Precedent for us. But he did not purchaſe any Pardon for himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he never ſtood in need of any; never tranſgreſs'd the Law at any time,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62708:26"/>
nor had any occaſion of having it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd with on his account. Tho' <hi>He was number'd with Tranſgreſſors,</hi> yet it was only in their Puniſhment, not in their Crimes. Tho' <hi>His Soul was made an Offering for Sin,</hi> yet was it <hi>for our Tranſgreſſions that he was wounded, and bruiſed for our Iniquities.</hi> So that tho' by keeping cloſe to our Saviour's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, we may be Holy as he is Holy; yet cannot we by this procure our own Pardons for former Sins.</p>
               <p>To cloſe all: <hi>The Death of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd only as a Motive to an Holy Life, and as inſpiring into us the Hopes of a future State of Glory, and ſo perſwading us to perform what is neceſſary to Remiſſion,</hi> cannot be the Propitiation expreſs'd in the Words. For what force could the diſgraceful and bloody Death of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Perſon, and of one who had made it his Buſineſs to <hi>go about doing good,</hi> have, to convince Men, That God was a Rewarder of Virtue and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity? Would it not rather diſcourage Men from the practice of Perfections, which were crown'd indeed but with Thorns, and whoſe only Exaltation was on the Croſs, to make them more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62708:26"/>
Inſtances of Woe and Infamy? <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf foreſaw the power of this Objection, and to evade it, he has recourſe to the little Sophiſtry of ſaying, that <hi>Indeed there was no great Efficacy in the Death of Chriſt, to be an Incentive to a good Life, and ſo to make way for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but that there was in his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſcenſion into Heaven, which were Conſequents of his Death; and that the Glories of that Kingdom he then took poſſeſſion of, carry the ſtrongest Rhetorick in them, to move us to abandon our Sins, and lead Lives of Righteouſneſs.</hi> This is a miſerable way of reaſoning. For would the Scripture apply the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo often, and ſo expreſly, to the <hi>Death,</hi> the <hi>Blood,</hi> the <hi>Sufferings of Chriſt,</hi> if it was all this while his Reſurrection which effected the Remiſſion of Sins? Nay, Does it not oppoſe the Benefits flowing from the Reſurrection, to thoſe reſulting from the Death of our Lord, informing us, that <hi>Chriſt died for our Sins,</hi> but that <hi>he roſe again for our Juſtification?</hi> How then can theſe Acts in all regards be coincident, be the ſame? His Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection indeed was a Confirmation, a Juſtifying to the World, That he had

by his Death purchas'd Remiſſion of Sins to the Penitent; but it neither was the Remiſſion it ſelf, nor any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd to it, more than by begetting in us a Faith in his Death and Merits.</p>
               <p>The ſumm of what has been ſaid, is, That Chriſt did not propitiate for Sin <hi>By dying to bear witneſs to his Doctrin;</hi> becauſe then his Death would only have been a Teſtimony of his Propitiation, and not the Thing it ſelf: Nor <hi>By gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a power to forgive Sin;</hi> becauſe he had This before he died: Nor <hi>By ſetting his Life out to be an Example to his Followers;</hi> becauſe this Example has no force to purifie and abſolve from Sins, at leaſt from paſt Sins: Nor, laſtly, did his Death conſider'd <hi>as a Motive to an holy Life free from Sin;</hi> becauſe Chriſt's Death ſimply and abſtractedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, as the Death of a Juſt Man, without its effect of actually removing Sin, is not ſuch a Motive. As to the <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi>'s method of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> which<note place="margin">
                     <hi>W. Penn's</hi> Chriſtian Quaker, <hi>p.</hi> 102.</note> they reſolve only into a <hi>ſpiritual ſhedding of the blood in their Hearts;</hi> 'tis a chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this comfortable Doctrin wholly into an Allegory, and a ſubſtituting an imaginary phantaſtick Saviour inſtead
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62708:29"/>
of a true one. And as none of theſe ways ſingly takes away Sin, ſo neither do they all of them combin'd: For the reſult of them all is this, That God ſent Chriſt into the World to live a Life of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and to die an ignomimous Death; only to be a more ſucceſsful. Inſtrument to reform the Sinner, and to prevent Sin for the future. But if Chriſt did nothing but this, How could his Merits reach to Sins committed before this Repentance or Reformation? Theſe would ſtill lie open to the Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, to the Wrath of that God, who has too high a reſpect for his own Laws, to ſuffer any breach of them to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſh'd; but will certainly revenge them either on the Sinner himſelf, or at leaſt on his Proxy. And tho' the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould at length correct his ways, yet what compenſation would this be for his former Violations of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God? Would this be any thing elſe, but beginning to do that at laſt, which he was always oblig'd to do? So I ſhall proceed to ſtate the true Means by which Chriſt did really take away our Sins, and propitiate for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62708:30"/>And to clear this Caſe from its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, it is to be obſerv'd, That God as the Governour of Mankind, gave them a Law, which was to be the general Rule of all their Actions: This Law he ſecures on each hand, as all other wiſe Magiſtrates, with Penalties ſutable to the power of the Lawgiver, which being Omnipotent, they too muſt of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be Infinite and Eternal. The keeping of the Commands of God bleſt with ever laſting Life, the breach of them puniſh'd with equal Miſery. This was the original Covenant, or Contract, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, which was very juſt to be impos'd on Man in his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, for then he was endued with ſtrength to perform the Condition; and was as equitable to be exacted from him after his Fall, becauſe he had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his weakneſs and inſufficiency by his own fault, and had willingly diſabled himſelf. But God was more merciful than to deal with him according to the rigour of Juſtice; he had a compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſence of that helpleſs State into which he was ſunk, and was willing to accept of a Propitiation. He knew that the Sins he ſhould commit in his faln
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62708:30"/>
Condition, would be of a different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from thoſe of the Angels, and therefore were more mercifully to be proceeded againſt. That the Angels were irreclaimably loſt, becauſe God had done for them all that could be done; had created them ſo perfect, that they had a whole proſpect of their Duty at one view; knew when they fell as much as they could know, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore admitted of no room for Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or alteration of their choice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But that Man receives the Knowledge of his Duty by degrees, and advances into a Mind prepoſſeſt with the prejudices of Senſe, and therefore may ſee farther and farther into things, ſo as to correct his Errors, and repent of them. That his Paſſions grow ſtrong before his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has force to govern them. That his Duties are ſo many, that in ſome caſes they are almoſt inconſiſtent. That even when he ſins and provokes his Maker, there are ſecret declarations in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience againſt what he acts; or, in the Language of the Apoſtle, <hi>The Evil that he would not, that he does.</hi> Such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations as theſe mov'd the merciful God to be willing to receive Man to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62708:31"/>
favour; made him inclinable to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd, and to mitigate that Anger he had juſtly conceiv'd againſt him for the breach of his Laws. But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that God ſhould be pacify'd, while the Law which Man has broken, and which the weakneſs of his Nature tempts him ſtill to violate, remains in its ſeverity. There can be no Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, while this is to be executed upon every failure; while Man is born under almoſt a neceſſity of Sinning, and yet oblig'd to a neceſſity of Innocence. Something muſt be done to this Law, before God's diſpleaſure can be remov'd; and if ſo, <hi>This Law muſt either be wholly taken away,</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd in a more eaſy Sence,</hi> or ſome other ſatisfaction made it.</p>
               <p>But the Law, which ought to have been the Rule of Man's Life, <hi>could not be repeal'd and quite taken away.</hi> For then Man either muſt be left Lawleſs, or ſome other Law made in the room of it. The former throws down all the boundaries of Virtue and Vice, gives encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to every Irregularity, excludes God out of the Government of the World, and places Man in the wildeſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62708:31"/>
State of Nature, accountable to none but himſelf for his Actions. If a new Law is to be ſubſtituted, either this Law muſt partake ſomething of the former, or be oppos'd to it. If it has ſomewhat of the Injunctions of the old Law, it muſt have as much of the Difficulties of it too; oppos'd it cannot be, for the former Law riſes ſo regularly from the Nature of Things, that whatſoever ſhould command any thing contrary to it, would enjoin what is unjuſt, and therefore would be null as ſoon as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulg'd.</p>
               <p>Neither could this <hi>Law have a milder and more equitable Sence or Conſtruction put upon it,</hi> to ſoften its hardneſs, that Man might in ſome meaſure evade the Obligation, and therefore the Penalty of it. For a mild interpreting of a Law is only a ſhewing, That ſome Perſons or Actions are not comprehended under it. As the ancient <hi>Heathens</hi> were not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Judicial or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, or the preſent <hi>Chineſe</hi> by the Evangelical. As Works of Religion and Mercy are not included under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of working on the Sabbath. But neither of theſe can take any place
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62708:32"/>
here. For Man could not pretend to be exempted from a Law, which was made and deſign'd for him, and could not be ſutable to any other Order of Beings. Nor could any Actions be excepted out of it, for then muſt all Actions be ſo; for tho' particular Perſons might only break the Law in ſome ſpecial parts, and therefore only have need of having thoſe Actions Privileg'd, which were contrary to it; yet Mankind in general would violate every Branch of it: ſo that all Actions in groſs muſt be put out of its reach; which is the ſame with an Abrogation, or Repeal.</p>
               <p>But there was a different Method from all theſe. A Method by which the Law might be retain'd in its Majeſty, as well as Integrity; not <hi>one jot or tittle of it paſs away,</hi> and yet Man be freed from its Rigour. This was, if a third Perſon would interpoſe, and undergo the Puniſhment due to the Offenders: would ſatisfy the Divine Wrath, and propitiate for Mankind. For the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or Honour, as well as the Force of a Law, is ſufficiently preſerv'd, if either its Injunctions are kept, or ſatisfactory Puniſhment inflicted. But, <hi>Who can</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:62708:32"/>
                  <hi>ſtand before God when he is angry?</hi> Or, Who attone for the Sin of Mankind? Which of all the Angels or Arch-Angels can ſuſtain the Perſon of a Mediator, and ſatisfy the Law which we have broke? Which in the Language of the Holy <hi>Job,</hi> might <hi>like a Dayſman betwixt God and us, lay his hand on us both.</hi> For <hi>God is not a Man, as we are, that we ſhould anſwer him, and ſhould come together in Judgment.</hi> The moſt perfect of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Beings would ſhrink under ſo vaſt a Burthen. So that the Son of God himſelf muſt be deputed for ſo glorious a purpoſe. <hi>He that comes from</hi> Edom, <hi>with dyed Garments from</hi> Bozrah. <hi>Wherefore is he red in his Apparel, and his Garments like him that treadeth in the Wine-fat?</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe <hi>He has trodden the Wine-preſs alone, and of the people there was none with him.</hi> And <hi>in this God commended his Love towards us, that while we were yet Sinners Chriſt died for us.</hi> That <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him,</hi> and that <hi>with his ſtripes we were healed.</hi> For as by his Life he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd every part of the Law, did what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it had enjoin'd, and ſo perform'd our Righteouſneſs; ſo by ſubſtituting
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62708:33"/>
himſelf to bear the Puniſhment of our Tranſgreſſions, by enduring what the Law had threatned, he diſſolv'd our Obligation to thoſe Sufferings, which were due to us according to the Order of the Divine Juſtice, and pacify'd the Diety's Fury; the Law being ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in its original Majeſty. And both theſe as well the Innocence of his Life, as the Meritoriouſneſs of his Death, were neceſſary for the Perſon who ſhould attone for the Sins of Mankind. For had not his Life been wholly made up of Obedience, had there been one flaw, one Tranſgreſſion in it, he could not have been that holy and unſpotted Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World. All that he could have done, would have been to have died for his own Offences, if perhaps he could have waſh'd out his Perſonal ſtains by his Blood. But as to our Faults, it muſt coſt more to redeem them; the Sacrifice which can expiate for them muſt have nobler Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: ſo that <hi>He muſt let that alone for ever.</hi> The Innocence of his Life was therefore not only an accompliſhing of the Law in our ſtead, and a Rule for us to act by; but was in a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62708:33"/>
manner a Qualification alſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him to ſuffer duly for our Sins.</p>
               <p>Which Paſſion was the formal Act which took away our Tranſgreſſions. On him they were laid, and he paid the Price of them. By this Act, and under this Qualification <hi>did he propitiate for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The equitableneſs of which Propitiation, by removing the Penalty from the Sinner to a Stipulator, who engages himſelf to ſuffer for the Guilty, is the next thing to be conſider'd.</p>
               <p>If there was any Injuſtice in this, as <hi>Socinus</hi> pretends there is, it muſt either conſiſt in this, That an innocent Perſon underwent a moſt barbarous, poinant, as well as ſhameful Death; that One in whoſe Mouth was found no Guile, was oppreſt, was afflicted, as well as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd and rejected of Men; or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he endur'd all this for our Sins. But there is no Injuſtice in the former, becauſe it is plain from Scripture, and <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf owns, That our Saviour, after a Life of the moſt ſpotleſs Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, had it taken away by the moſt cruel and ignominious Death; a Death
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62708:34"/>
of Slaves and Malefactors. And this not only by the Permiſſion, but even by the Ordinance and immediate Act of God; for <hi>He was ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted,</hi> and <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right? Far be it from God, that he ſhould do Wickedneſs, and that the Almighty ſhould pervert Judgment.</hi> So that the Enquiry will be this, Whether it is conſiſtent with Equity, that the Holy <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> the true and uniform Pattern of all Virtue, ſhould be thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh'd, as the Propitiator for us Sinners. And that he ſhould be ſo, is neither irreconcilable with that poſitive Juſtice or Equity, which God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd in his Word, nor with that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Juſtice which may be drawn from the Reaſon of Mankind, and the Practice and Uſage of Nations, and which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> ſo much inſiſts on. The deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Puniſhment from the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor to the Innocent, is not irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable with the Divine Word. For it is not irreconcilable with the Divine Word, either that an Innocent ſhould be puniſh'd for the Sins of the Guilty; or that he ſhould be in ſuch manner puniſh'd, that the Guilty may be freed

with the Uſe of Nations, That one ſhould ſuffer for another's Crimes; ſo is it not leſs ſo, That the Guilty ſhould gain Impunity, by ſomething which has been ſuffer'd for him. Thus in the inſtance of Sacrifices, receiv'd into the Religion of all Nations; whatſoever the matter of them was, whether it was <hi>Thouſand of Rams,</hi> or whether they brought <hi>their firſt-born, and offer'd the fruit of their Bodies for the ſin of their Souls;</hi> yet the intention of them both, was to procure Impunity to the Sinner, by laying the Puniſhment ſomewhere elſe.

Nor is there any thing in it unjuſt, whether we examine it by the Rules of Juſtice diſplay'd in the Word of God, or by the Uſage of Nations.

               <p>That God ſhould releaſe our Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is reaſonable, whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Nature of God, whoſe Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt ſtrongly plead before the Throne of Grace for faln Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, even before there was any other Advocate; or whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Nature of that Service, which God exacts from Man. For God never obliges to Duty, where he has put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of a poſſibility of requiting it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But while Man's Sins were unforgiven, while his obligation to Puniſhment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, it was not in the power of God to reward his Piety. Since undiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſery was to be his Doom at laſt, and was to be the common Event of all; both of <hi>thoſe who ſacrificed, and thoſe who ſacrificed not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It being therefore thus reaſonable, That God ſhould releaſe Man's Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it is as reaſonable. That he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62708:37"/>
ſhould lay this Puniſhment on Chriſt. For either the Puniſhment muſt be laid on Chriſt, or on ſome other, or be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without any Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>But without Satisfaction (whatſoever the <hi>Deiſt</hi> may fancy) the Penalty could not be ſutably remov'd: for, that God ſhould pardon Sin, without receiving any Satisfaction, is, firſt, againſt his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Being; for <hi>He is of purer Eyes than to behold Evil,</hi> and <hi>cannot look on Iniquity.</hi> Againſt his Juſtice, becauſe as a juſt and righteous Governour of the World, he may not ſuffer his Laws to be affronted, without vindicating their Honour.

               </p>
               <p>Nor could the Puniſhment be laid on any other, but Chriſt; becauſe none, except one of the Perſons of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> could ſuffer Puniſhment ſufficient to clear the Guilty. For it was infinite Majeſty which was injur'd, and it muſt be ſatisfy'd by Majeſty as infinite.

It was not meet that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhould propitiate; becauſe he was to be ſent by the Mediator, in order to the applying of the Salvation, which he ſhould purchaſe. So that whatſoever imaginary Models the <hi>School-men</hi> may raiſe of other Methods, by which God might ſave the World; yet there is none which agrees with Reaſon in all Points, but the Propitiation which Chriſt wrought through his Sufferings.</p>
               <p>The ſumm of all is, That Chriſt is become our Propitiation; not <hi>by Dying to bear witneſs to any ſaving, or ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doctrin;</hi> not <hi>by gaining a Right by his Death to forgive Sin;</hi> not <hi>by giving us an Example, by which we may have our Sins pardon'd;</hi> not <hi>by any Encouragement his Death might yield us to an holy Life;</hi> not <hi>by any of theſe ſingle,</hi> nor <hi>by all united;</hi> but <hi>by Dying for our Sins,</hi> and paying a Price tantamount to our Tranſgreſſions.

               <p>THE Apoſtle, in the entrance of this Chapter, informs us, That Chriſt being a Prophet ſo much ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all before him, and now advanc'd above the Angels to his Royal Office in Heaven, whereby he is certainly able to perform what he foretold; we ought in all reaſon to heed his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and to make uſe of them as means to fortifie us, when we are tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sin or Apoſtacy. For if the Law
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62708:39"/>
were given only by the Miniſtry of Angels, and yet the Threats on the breaking of that did come to paſs, and all the Sins committed by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt it, were ſeverely chaſtis'd, and the Tranſgreſſors not ſuffer'd to enter into the promis'd Land; How ſhall we avoid equal Puniſhment, if we do not, by Conſtancy and Obedience, make our ſelves capable of that Deliverance, which Chriſt firſt at his being upon Earth, and the Apoſtles which heard it from him, aſſur'd us of; and which God himſelf has teſtify'd, by ſo many Prodigies, and ominous Preſages? And by giving them, who foretold 'em, Power to work Miracles, and other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of the Spirit: <hi>God alſo bearing them witneſs, both with Signs, and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and with divers Miracles.</hi>

                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I ſhall cloſe all, by briefly ſhewing, That tho' Chriſtianity was at firſt eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Miracles;</hi> yet that there is no reaſon, that we ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a continu'd ſucceſſion of them to the preſent times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſhew what a <hi>Miracle</hi> is.</p>
               <p>A Miracle is ſomething that ſurpaſſes the Power of Men, or of Nature; wrought in ſavour of a Perſon, who knows that this Miracle ſhall be thus tranſacted. 'Tis a Work that ſurpaſſes the Power of Men, or of Nature: for let an Effect be never ſo ſurprizing or extraordinary, yet while it is within the force of ſecond Cauſes, it is no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. It muſt (in ſtrict ſpeaking) bear the lively Impreſſion, and ſovereign Stamp of <hi>Divinity</hi> upon it; ſo that we may, without hazard of being deceiv'd, boldly vouch, that <hi>This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi> Which we may ſafely ſay, when Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are cur'd by a Touch; the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Seas calm'd by a Rebuke; and the Dead rais'd by the Command of One, who aſſum'd no more than the Form of a Man. When the Unlearned
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62708:40"/>
ſpeak Languages, which they never learn'd. When the Flames ſhall loſe their deſtructive Nature, and inſtead of conſuming, guard. When a Hand rais'd up ſhall determine the Fate of Armies. When the Lord ſhall <hi>hearken to the voice of Man, inſomuch that the Sun ſhall ſtand ſtill upon</hi> Gibeon, <hi>and the Moon in the Valley of</hi> Ajalon. As a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle thus ſurpaſſes the Power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo the Perſon in favour of whom it is wrought, ought to know that this Miracle ſhall be thus wrought. He ought either to know in particular, that this Miracle will be wrought, and no other; or that a Miracle of ſome kind will be wrought, when natural Helps ſhall fail. Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> preſt behind, and the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> rag'd before, tho' he ſeems to have had no ſpecial Revelation, that the Sea ſhould be made dry Land, and the Waters be divided; yet he knew in groſs, that <hi>The ſalvation of the Lord ſhould be ſeen that day, and that the</hi> Aegyptians <hi>whom they had ſeen that day, ſhould no more be ſeen again for ever.</hi> Therefore the dividing the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> was a Miracle perform'd by <hi>Moſes,</hi> tho' he did not particularly foreſee it. But
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62708:41"/>
when the Perſon, in behalf of whom a miraculous Work is brought about, is wholly ignorant of it; this can be no Miracle, nor ought any Conſequence to be drawn from it, as if that Perſon was immediately Commiſſion'd from God. The ſudden Advancement of Men from the loweſt Fortunes, to the higheſt Stations, by unaccountable and unforeſeen means, is ſometimes aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the immediate Hand of God: but ſince this Exaltation may be for the Ruin, as well as for the Happineſs of Mankind; and ſince the Party exalted could not foreſee his Succeſs, 'tis no Miracle, tho' it is wrought by a Divine Power; nor ought we to conclude, that this Perſon is a nearer Favourite of Heaven, than the reſt of Human kind. The Creation of a Reaſonable Soul is miraculous; but becauſe it is uſual, is not of that kind of Miracles expreſt in the Words. Thus the Inſpiration of Grace is miraculous; but becauſe it works now a-days according to the method of Reaſon and Diſcourſe (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> may pretend to the contrary) aſſiſting us while we uſe ſuch moral Means, as Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62708:41"/>
and Reaſon preſcribes, it is not to be rang'd with the Miracles men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd here.</p>
               <p>Since Miracles therefore are the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a Power more than Natural, it is juſt to enquire,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What Power is capable of working a <hi>Miracle.</hi>

Lettre</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 355.</note> advanc'd, That <hi>Miracles</hi> may be wrought by good or bad Angels, or by a Power leſs than Infinite; yet it may be laid down as a Concluſion, That infinite Power alone is capable of working a Miracle. For a Miracle proclaims an omnipotent Agent, and carries the Hand of God written upon it in bright Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, legible to the moſt Vulgar Reaſon. For every true Miracle is a forming of ſomething out of nothing; and that either in the thing it ſelf, or in the manner of forming it. In the thing it ſelf, when it is of that ſort, that it cannot be form'd by any ſecond and ordinary Cauſes: As the Reſurrection of the Dead, the Re-union of the Soul and Body, the reſtoring of the Springs
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62708:42"/>
and Mechaniſm of Motion, after a total ſeparation. For Death is a Priſon, which ſurrenders back its Captives upon no other Summons below thoſe of the Almighty. To reſtore Life being only the Prerogative of him who gave it. Or a Miracle may conſiſt in forming ſomething out of nothing, as to the manner of doing it; when the thing lies within the power of ſecond Cauſes, yet is brought about without the aſſiſtance of any of them: As to cure Diſeaſes by a Word ſpeaking, or by touching the Hem of the Garment. Where there is ſomething which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers calling Light out of Darkneſs, and commanding every thing to be from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Creation therefore being one of the peculiar Acts of God, and which we do not know that He ever commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to a Creature; the Power of working Miracles, as to the original of it, muſt be ſo too: For only He who firſt form'd the Laws of Nature, can ſuſpend or alter them. 'Tis true, the Angels far ſurpaſs us in the excellency of their Faculties, and therefore may perform ſuch things, as are apt to raiſe Admiration in us, becauſe of our unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62708:42"/>
with the cauſes of them, or manner of their Production. Even the fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Angels themſelves have not their Forces ſo much broken by Sin, but that by Lying Wonders they may eaſily impoſe on the Spectator's Eye; tho' 'tis wholly impoſſible for them, by any Power of their own, to alter the Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or produce a real <hi>Miracle.</hi> So that if a <hi>Miracle</hi> has been wrought for the confirmation of any Doctrin, 'tis a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrant, that this Doctrin is of God. But ſince the evil Angels, who have aſſum'd the Perſon of God, may alſo counterfeit his wondrous Works, it will be neceſſary,</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To enquire into ſome of thoſe Marks, whereby a true <hi>Miracle</hi> may be diſtinguiſh'd from a falſe one. So that a difference may be put betwixt the Works of <hi>God,</hi> and thoſe of his greateſt Enemies.</p>
               <p>The firſt Mark of a true <hi>Miracle</hi> is, That there ſhould be ſufficient Evidence that this <hi>Miracle</hi> has been wrought, and the Effect of it ought to be addreſt to our Senſes. For a <hi>Miracle</hi> it ſelf, is not an object of our Belief, tho' it is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62708:43"/>
form'd in confirmation of ſomething, which we are oblig'd to believe: For then a <hi>Miracle</hi> would be as obſcure as the thing which it is produc'd to prove. And every <hi>Miracle</hi> would want another, to make it ſerviceable to its grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Mark of a true <hi>Miracle</hi> is, That it ought not to tend to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of any Doctrin, before eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by God, by ſufficient Miracles. For God cannot be divided againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: But ſhould he overthrow that by Miracle, which he had before ſettled by Miracle, Eternal Truth would diſagree with himſelf. For Miracles, and a Doctrin, give mutual ſupport one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; as Miracles declare the Doctrin to be true, ſo the purity and excellence of the Doctrin, confirm the Miracles to be Divine. But if there is an Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency between the Miracles, and the Doctrin; the deciſion muſt be in favour of the Doctrin, in oppoſition to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. For if a Perſon acts the moſt wonderful Works, to give Sanction to a Religion, which contains low Idea's of God, or interferes with the great Duties, we owe to one another; his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62708:43"/>
are nothing but artful Frauds, and he himſelf only a more pompous Deceiver: So on the other hand, when Miracles are produc'd in favour of a Doctrin, which is pure and holy; whoſe proſpects of Rewards are only laid in a future State; which enjoins Modeſty, Temperance, Sobriety, and Patience, and whatſoever is fitted to advance Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature; ſuch a Doctrin is highly fitted to perſwade Men, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought in behalf of it, are true.</p>
               <p>The third Mark of a true <hi>Miracle</hi> is, That the Effects of it ought to be laſting and durable. If Diſeaſes are remov'd by a Miracle, they ought ſo to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, as not to return. If Sight is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to the Blind, it ought not to be a temporary Reſtitution, but a permanent and continued ſtate of Seeing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Miracles ought to be of that Nature, as to be capable of being extended over the whole Creation. For ſince they flow from an infinite Power, which has equal Juriſdiction over every Creature, they cannot be confin'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any particular Circle of Beings. For whatſoever Creature the Voice of God is addreſt to, it immediately loſes, its
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62708:44"/>
Liberty, and can only perform what is his Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>There is a fifth Mark which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attends on a real Miracle, which tho' it does not fully convince, that the Miracle is true; yet it is a great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it to the Love and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of Mankind; and is fitted to perſwade us, That the Doctrin ſettled by it, is from above: That is, when a Miracle is wrought for the good of Mankind; to cure their Diſeaſes, raiſe their Dead.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Mark of a true <hi>Miracle</hi> is, That it ſhould not be wrought meerly for the Advantage, or Honour of the Performer; nor ought he to propoſe any Intereſt from it, but the good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Mankind. Where theſe Marks combine in any Miracle, we may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely vouch, That it is the Work of God; and that the Perſon who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms it, is Commiſſion'd from Heaven, after an extraordinary manner. So that I ſhall proceed to ſhew,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Miracles perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and therefore thoſe wrought by his Apoſtles, have all theſe Marks of a true Miracle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:62708:44"/>And Firſt, There was ſufficient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, That the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> were wrought. And firſt, There was Evidence ſufficient to convince thoſe, who flouriſh'd in the times in which the Miracles were wrought; and ſecondly, To ſatisfy us, who live in diſtant Ages. Thoſe who were co-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with the Miracles, had not the leaſt Umbrage from Reaſon, to doubt the truth of them. For they were wrought in publick, often in great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of People; generally upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and invetera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diſeaſes and Maladies, in preſence of the Enemies of Chriſtianity: And in matters addreſt to Senſe, where every one has due Power, as well as Right to judge. Even the moſt implacable Adverſaries, who ſaw and envied this growing Religion in its Infancy, could not deny, but that notable Miracles had been done by the Profeſſors of it.</p>
               <p>But, Secondly, There is ſufficient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to ſatisfy us, that theſe Miracles have been wrought. And this Evidence riſes from the Sincerity of the primitive Believers, who were Eye-witneſſes of theſe Miracles, and Recorders of them
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62708:45"/>
to Poſterity: And who laid down their Lives, not only to give Sanction to the Doctrin of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> but to atteſt the truth of his Miracles, by which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd. The Relations of theſe Perſons muſt be aſſuredly true, ſince they could propoſe no other Intereſt to themſelves, but the Propagation of Truth. All other ſiniſter aims were diſappointed by their Deaths, and their Reward was only to be hop'd for, in that glorious future State, of which they diſcours'd ſo much. Add to this, That the firſt Profeſſors of Chriſtianity always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to Miracles, and challeng'd the <hi>Heathens</hi> to bring their fancy'd Deities; aſſuring them, that they ſhould all be miraculouſly ſtruck dumb by the God of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> otherwiſe they offer'd themſelves to Death, as Enemies of the eſtabliſh'd Religion of their Country. The greateſt Enemies of Chriſtianity could not deny ſo manifeſt a matter, as the Miracles wrought by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles. <hi>Lucian,</hi> the great Ridiculer of all Religion, freely owns it: For He, whom he blaſphemouſly ſtyles in his <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap>, is undoubtedly our Saviour. This

                  <hi>Jewiſh Sophiſter,</hi> he tells us, caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, heal'd the Sick, rais'd the Dead.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Miracles of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not tend to overthrow any Doctrin, before eſtabliſh'd by God, by ſufficient Miracles. For tho' the Civil and Judicial Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> fell ſhortly after our Saviour's Death, becauſe they were only calculated for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and were diſſolv'd with that Polity; yet we find that our Saviour, during his abode on Earth, did not in the leaſt invalidate their Obligation; and was ſo far from teaching any thing contrary to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of them, that he was always prepar'd to practiſe them himſelf. As to the Ritual and Ceremonial Law, which was employ'd about Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and Purifications, and Sacrifices, in diſtinction of Meats, and Times, and various other Rites and Obſervances; this was not properly diſſolv'd and made void by the coming of Chriſt, but fulfill'd and made good by him. The Rites and Ceremonies of this Law, were the Types and Reſemblances of thoſe future good things, which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd under the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a kind of rude
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62708:46"/>
Draught and Sciography of a more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, refin'd and perfect Oeconomy, which was deſign'd, and at laſt finiſh'd and compleated by Chriſtianity. But while theſe Laws continued in force, our Saviour ſubmitted himſelf to them. He was Circumcis'd, and preſented in the Temple; and perform'd all other Rites, commanded by the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> He did not therefore work any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, in oppoſition to theſe Laws, but they having remain'd as long as they were deſign'd to do, and there was any uſe of them, expir'd and abated of their own accord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Effects of our Saviour's Miracles were permanent. He did not ſuſpend only, but expel Diſeaſes: the Dead which he rais'd, had their Soul join'd to their Body by as firm an union, as when it was at firſt inſpir'd.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Our Saviour's Miracles were extended over the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: the Power of them was as large as the Circle of the World; nor were Hell and the Grave exempted from their Juriſdiction. The faln Angels, who rebell'd againſt God, were yet forc'd to ſubmit to him. And Death
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62708:46"/>
and Diſeaſes were ſoften'd into Life and Health. The Winds and Seas were ſilent at his Voice; and <hi>He ſtilled the raging of the Waters.</hi> So that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Obedience of all Nature, was a ſufficient Motive to perſwade, that it was the God of Nature who acted.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Our Saviour's Miracles bear that endearing Character, That they were wrought for the good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. For moſt of the Works of our Saviour were equally beneficial and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous. Even in the Prologue to his own Crucifixion, (his violent Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) when one of his Enemies was wounded, he beſtow'd a Miracle to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his cure. The Spirit of the Goſpel diſplay'd it ſelf in all that he did, as that of the Law in the Miracles of <hi>Moſes:</hi> As the latter were generally perform'd, to deſtroy and conſume; ſo thoſe of <hi>Jeſus</hi> wholly aim'd, to preſerve and ſave.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Our Saviour's Miracles were not deſign'd to gain himſelf Applauſe, Intereſt, or Honour: For he refus'd to be made a King. And tho' he was crown'd indeed, yet it was with Thorns alone: tho' he was Exalted, yet it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62708:47"/>
was only upon the Croſs, to be made a more conſpicuous Inſtance of Woe and Infamy. <hi>He was deſpis'd and rejected of men; a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from him: He was deſpis'd, and we eſteem'd him not.</hi> As theſe Marks of a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle agree to the Works of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſo do they to thoſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and Primitive Believers. For theſe were only reſemblances, of what their Lord had done before; repetitions of his miraculous Acts, and therefore bear the ſame Marks and Signatures. <hi>Phlegon,</hi> free'd by the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> mentions the Miracles of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">Contra <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</hi>
                  </note> to <hi>Origen,</hi> who liv'd near <hi>Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>'s time, and had read his Books then commonly extant; and therefore his Teſtimony muſt be as valid, as if we had the Originals. <hi>Porphyry,</hi> as inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and as ſevere an Enemy as ever appear'd againſt our Religion, owns ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Miracles to be perform'd by the firſt Chriſtians, in defence of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. God therefore bore witneſs to their Doctrin, by thus wonderfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing of himſelf: their Doctrin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is true. For when Miracles are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62708:47"/>
once brought to ſecond a Doctrin, theſe ſilence all my ſcruples; I yield, I am convinc'd: for God cannot exerciſe his own Power, or delegate it to any other, to give ſanction to a Lye, or honour an Impoſtor. But theſe Marks cannot agree with any Miracles; which were wrought in competition with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's. As for the Cures pretended to be perform'd by the Emperors, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> as they are related by <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 7. in Veſpaſian.</note>

                  <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and <note n="c" place="margin">12. p. Edit. Salmaſil.</note> 
                  <hi>Spartianus;</hi> thoſe who reflect what different Artiſiees were about that time eſpecially, us'd to gain an eſteem of Divinity to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, will not much wonder, that ſuch reports ſhould be ſpread of them, or that Perſons ſhould counterfeit and imitate thoſe Diſeaſes deſcrib'd, to give themſelves out to be reliev'd by them: So that they fail againſt the firſt and principal Mark of a true Miracle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not evident that they were at all perform'd. For there ſeems to be no neceſſity for the Hypotheſis of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> That <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was endued from above with a Power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, becauſe he was to be God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Vengeance againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:62708:48"/>
The next who appear'd after theſe, but who made a much greater Figure than they, was that famous Impoſtor <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Tyaneus;</hi> but his Tranſactions want the greateſt part of the Notes of a true Miracle. For, <hi>firſt,</hi> They are feign'd to be done in private, and therefore what reaſon have we to believe that they were done at all? <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Perſon who gives an account of him <hi>(Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus)</hi> liv'd above an hundred Years after him. <hi>3ly,</hi> All his Miracles are only falſe Tranſcripts of our Saviour's, with all ſubmiſſion to a late famous Author,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>p. <hi>Parker</hi> of the Law of Nature, <hi>p.</hi> 296.</note> who has aſſerted the contrary. Thus becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was the Son of God, <hi>Apollonius</hi> is fancy'd to be ſo too: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Angels proclaim'd our Saviour's Birth, a parallel Miracle is advanc'd in favour of <hi>Apollonius:</hi> Becauſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was forſaken by his Diſciples, <hi>Apollonius</hi> is deſerted by his Scholars: Becauſe our Saviour was accus'd before <hi>Pilate, Apollonius</hi> is impeach'd before <hi>Domitian:</hi> Becauſe our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt with his Diſciples after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Apollonius</hi> alſo appears after his Death, to a certain Young man, and gives him an account of a future State,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62708:48"/>
about which he was extremely curious: Becauſe our Saviour aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there was alſo a Voice heard, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting <hi>Apollonius</hi> into Bliſs: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.<note place="margin">Philoſt. lib. 8. cap. 12.</note> Thus all other work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Miracles, who ever have made any oppoſition to our Saviour, cannot produce theſe Marks of a true and juſt Miracle; and therefore their Doctrins are not of God, nor are they to be look'd upon as Prophets. So that I ſhall proceed to ſhew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That tho' Chriſtianity was at firſt eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Miracles,</hi> yet that there is no reaſon why we ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a continued ſucceſſion of them to the preſent Times.</p>
               <p>For it is unreaſonable to expect that God ſhould work a Miracle, where the End may be accompliſh'd without one. This would be to make Miracles too vulgar and deſpicable. For a thing often ſeen, how excellent ſoever it is, yet ceaſing thereby to be new, it ceaſes alſo to be admir'd. For 'tis not the worth or excellence of an Object, which draws the eyes and wonder of Men after it. For can any thing be imagin'd more
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62708:49"/>
auguſt and beautiful, than the Sun in its full light and glory; and yet how many more Spectators and Wonderers does the ſame Sun find, under the veil of an Eclipſe? Miracles continued in the Chriſtian Church, till the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, had receiv'd its ſettlement from them, in a great meaſure; and ſhould God call Perſons to convert Infidels, he might perhaps employ this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Method again. Tho' ſince Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is fully eſtabliſh'd, 'tis more likely that he might accompliſh this grand Deſign, by the inviſible workings of his Grace, upon the Hearts of the Unconverted; by inclining and moving them within, and by ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Providences without. And this may give us reaſon to ſuſpect ſome of St. <hi>Xavier</hi>'s, and the <hi>Indian</hi> Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's<note place="margin">vid. <hi>Xaverii Epiſt.</hi> lib. 3. Epiſt. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Miracles.</p>
               <p>As to the preſent Objections of the<note place="margin">Obj.</note> 
                  <hi>Deiſts,</hi> which they propoſe in this form, That if God had reaſon to work Miracles in former times, there is alſo reaſon why he ſhould form them at preſent; ſince the ſame Spirit of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief prevails and flouriſhes now, as much as it did when Miracles were
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62708:49"/>
wrought: And therefore God is oblig'd to work Miracles in favour of thoſe who queſtion Religion now, as he did in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of them, who liv'd in the times of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>To this it may be reply'd, That the<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> Proofs which we have of the ancient Miracles, are convincing to us, as well as to them before whom they were viſibly wrought; nay, there is this to be ſaid in favour of the ancient Miracles, That they have undergone the Teſt of Time, and have been diſcuſs'd in moſt Ages, thro' which they have paſt, and yet no flaw is found in them; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid of modern Miracles, if they could be had: And therefore, on this account, they carry a greater ground of Credibility. But we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark farther, That thoſe who may juſtly demand new Miracles, ought to have made good uſe of thoſe means, which God had before diſplay'd, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his Truth. They ought, without Biaſs or Paſſion, to have examin'd the Revelation of the New Teſtament. They ought to be adorn'd with all thoſe Virtues, which they themſelves own to be perfective of their Natures, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62708:50"/>
juſt Qualifications of a pure and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Deiſt.</hi> They ought to be truly humble and ſubmiſſive, to whatſoever bears the reſemblance of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and if they have not theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, which the Light of Nature, and their own magnify'd <hi>Deiſm</hi> it ſelf, prove ſo extremely neceſſary; how can they expect that God ſhould make freſh diſcoveries to them, by new Miracles? But granting that God ſhould conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend ſo far, as to work Miracles in their favour, there is the greateſt reaſon to believe, that they would find collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and pretences, to continue ſtill in their Unbelief; ſince they have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ways to evade thoſe of our Saviour, granting that the Matters of Fact were true. And it is very remarkable, That tho' nothing could be more bright and convincing than the Miracles of our Saviour, yet the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtill found out rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to break the Force, and avoid the Evidence of them. And are the <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and <hi>Deiſts</hi> of our Age leſs furniſht with Sophiſtry, or better prepar'd to entertain Religion? Does not the ſame diſpoſition of Heart, ſo contrary to the Chriſtian Religion; Do not the ſame
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62708:50"/>
Pride, Prejudices, and Negligence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail amongſt them, which did amongſt the <hi>Jews?</hi> Is God therefore oblig'd to humour their unreaſonable Deſires, or run the hazard of having his wondrous Works expos'd to their Cenſures, Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms, and captious Enquiries? At this rate, God would be engag'd to work a Miracle, as often as any Man ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at Impiety high enough to doubt of his Religion, and to receive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Sentiments into his Breaſt. At this rate, why ought not Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief to abound, that Grace might much more abound? But farther, Is not the Syſtem of <hi>Deiſm</hi> ſo contriv'd, as quite to preclude the working of a Miracle? For if <hi>God</hi> is Material, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> pretends, and ſo not diſtinct<note place="margin">v.

                  </note> no ſuch thing as a Miracle. Tho' an Event may be ſtrange and uncommon, yet it muſt be natural ſtill; ſince <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> being the ſame, what is wrought by the former, is alſo wrought by the latter. Why therefore do they demand ſuch Proofs, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

               <p>But to cloſe all: We have not only <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> but a greater than <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Holy <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> if we hear not them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will we be perſwaded if the greateſt Miracle ſhould be wrought, and even one ſhould riſe from the Dead. The Miracles therefore of Religion are wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adapted to convince us of the truth of it; and we our ſelves may be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable, to perſwade Unbelievers of the force of Religion, if we will ſuffer it to work one great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Miracle on us; that is, to reform our Lives, by compoſing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly motions of our Souls, by cooling the irregular warmth of our Affections; and by charming all our Paſſions into ſo ſedate a Peace, as to be ſubmiſſive to the Rules of the Chriſtian Religion: which is greater than to ſpeak with the Tongues of Men and Angels. Then ſhall we bring Honour to our holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and be duly prepar'd to expect the laſt and finiſhing Miracle of it; that is, that our <hi>Corruptible</hi> may <hi>put on Incorruption, and</hi> our <hi>Mortal Immortality.</hi>

               <p>THE peculiar method by which our Saviour deliver'd his Doctrin; the tendency of it to a greater meaſure of Piety, than was commonly taught by the moſt extraordinary Doctors of thoſe times; the ratifying of his Divine Commiſſion, by a train of unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62708:52"/>
Miracles, which were not only ſuited for the conviction, but alſo at the ſame time adapted to the uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Mankind; and all theſe grac'd with the moſt unblameable Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ever was, had rais'd the Love of the greateſt part of his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; the Envy of ſome, the Wonder and Curioſity of all. Of this number (whether mov'd by Envy or Curioſity alone, but moſt likely principally by the former) a Lawyer, one who was throughly vers'd in the moſt refin'd Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties of the Jewiſh Law, came to try what his Judgment was about the Law, or Rule of Life; deſigning probably to diſcover, whether he would advance any thing contrary, either to the Law, or the receiv'd Traditions, that ſo he might make him obnoxious to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of that Law, whoſe Sanctions he ſhould diſhonour by his Innovations. The Enquiry which he propoſes to him, is one of the greateſt importance, and in whoſe Reſolution the moſt moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Intereſt is concern'd: namely, What was neceſſary to be obſerv'd for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that <hi>External Life,</hi> which Chriſt promis'd in a clearer manner, than had
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62708:52"/>
been diſplay'd by the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. The Enquirer, no doubt, was expecting a ſyſtem of new Precepts, the addition of a Table unknown to <hi>Moſes;</hi> at leaſt that the old ones ſhould be extended to freſh Duties, and new Obligations. And no queſtion but that he was highly ſurpriz'd, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour informs him, That the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, was a true and adequate ſtandard of Duty, and the living up to it, the ſole way to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That tho' the Law of Ordinances and Ceremonies oblig'd none but the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet that the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as it was the Reaſon, ſo it ſhould be the ſtanding Religion of all Mankind. That what was indiſpenſably requir'd to Salvation before the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to the Subſtance of it, be ſo after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor any other Duty ſuperinduc'd. For the Law, as ariſing from the nature and relations of Things and Perſons, and as marking out the boundaries of Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, which are always in the main the ſame, was uncapable of Change, Addition, or new Interpretation; was ſtill to be read and practic'd, agreeably to its genuine and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62708:53"/>
original Sence. And that the Saviour of the World, during the term of his abode in it, had no other Authority but to walk ſuitable to its Commands, and to reconcile for the Affronts which had been put upon its Divine Author, by Mankind's diſobedience of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A certain Lawyer ſtood up and tempted him ſaying, Maſter, What ſhall I do to inherit Eternal Life? He ſaid unto him, What is written in the Law? How readest thou?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the Words, taken in relation to the purport of the Lawyer's Queſtion; a preparation to which Anſwer is made in thoſe our Saviour's other Queſtions, <hi>What is written in the Law?</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>How readeſt thou?</hi> but fully compleated in that Injunction of our Saviour's upon the reading of the Law, in the words after the Text, <hi>Do this and live:</hi> From the Words thus taken, I conclude, That as our Saviour did not invalidate any Commands of the Law; ſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, That nothing was made a Duty, or abſolutely needful to the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> but what was ſo under the Old Teſtament, before his coming; otherwiſe he had been oblig'd
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62708:53"/>
to have inform'd the Lawyer of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe new Terms of Salvation, and not to have refer'd him to the Law, and what was to be read in it. He did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore new extend the old Commands, or impoſe new ones: he introduc'd no new Religion into the World, nor even ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Circumſtances of it; the Will of God as it was reveal'd to Man, being of that kind, that it is as unchangeable as his own glorious Nature; and the way to Heaven as much one, as that ever-bleſſed and holy <hi>GOD,</hi> whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment makes up the Bliſs of that happy State. This Concluſion, drawn from the deſign of the Words, I ſhall endeavour to prove, by ſhewing,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it was inconſiſtent with the Character which our Saviour ſhould bear, to exerciſe ſuch Legiſlative Power, as to give New Commands, or new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion to the Old ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Moral Law</hi> in its own nature was incapable of receiving an addition of New Commands, or of having the Old ones extended to New Duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That as it was inconſiſtent with our Saviour under that Character
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62708:54"/>
which he bore, and as there was this incapacity in the Law; ſo That he never attempted to do what was both thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Nature of the Thing, and beſides his own Character, to extend the Old Commands, or impoſe New ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That as our Saviour has not added any thing to the Law, ſo neither has he taken any thing from it; nor is there any Priviledge in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which makes void any of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God before given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I ſhall briefly reflect on the Encouragement that there is to obſerve the divine Commands, becauſe their obſervance ſhall be rewarded with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life,</hi> as it is ſtyl'd by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>The three firſt of theſe Poſitions are quite contrary to the Doctrin taught by <hi>Smaloius,</hi> or whoſoever elſe was the Author of the <hi>Racovian Catechiſm,</hi> and<note place="margin">Racov. Cat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62708:54"/>
make additions to the Law, and that the Law was qualify'd to receive 'em; and that he did not only extend the Moſaick Commands to new Duties, but alſo made the Appendage of ſeveral Commands of his own. Such are the Commands of <hi>Self-denial, taking up the Croſs,</hi> or <hi>Patience under Miſery and Death, the following of Chriſt;</hi> to which Duties, they ſay, there was no obligation before Chriſtianity. In oppoſition to whom, I ſhall endeavour to prove,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That it was inconſiſtent with that Character which our Saviour ſhould bear, to exerciſe any ſuch Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power, as to give new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or newextenſion to the old ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>By the Virtue of his Character, our Saviour does not ſo much as aſſume Authority, to diſplace the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair, or to weaken that power which they had gain'd over the People; tho' he well knew how unjuſt their Pretenſions were both to the one, and the other: ſo far is he from publiſhing any thing, but what might reaſonably be ſpoken from the Chair of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſuitably to his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62708:55"/>
Sence. <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſit in Moſes's ſeat; all therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they bid you obſerve and do, that obſerve and do.</hi> 'Tis true, he diveſts the Law, as was fit, of thoſe artificial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which, inſtead of ſtrengthning, did (in his unerring Judgment) make it void. He drew off that Veil from its Face, which their Doctor's Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had put on it; and ſhew'd the <hi>beauty of its Holineſs,</hi> in its full luſtre. But he does not, that we find, add any thing to it; and as <hi>He came not to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets,</hi> ſo neither came he to make any New Law of his own. For the Character which he ſuſtain'd, was indeed unqualify'd for ſuch an Office; becauſe he did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Perſon of a Law-giver, to give New Laws, but in that of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, being at once the Prieſt and the Sacrifice, to atone for our breaches of the old; to free us from the Curſe which we had contracted by them, and to be made a Curſe for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from the Curſe of the Law. For this is one of the great differences between <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> That the former was to make Laws, and by the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62708:55"/>
force of them, to accuſe and condemn the Diſobedient; whereas <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> came only to pardon, abſolve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile. <hi>Do not think that I will accuſe you to the Father,</hi> (ſays he to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>Jews,) there is one that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſoth you, even Moſes in whom you truſt:</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe <hi>God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World,</hi> or indeed to execute any other branch of Judicial or Legiſlative Juriſdiction; but <hi>that thro' him the World might be ſaved.</hi> For <hi>the Law,</hi> the Rule of Practice and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>was given by Moſes; but Grace,</hi> the Diſpenſation of Pardon and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement to the Benitent; <hi>and Truth,</hi> the Fulfilling of the Types of the Law, <hi>came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The appearance of <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief,</hi> was too inglorious for a divine Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver to aſſume; and Laws would but receive ſmall force from him, who <hi>was deſpis'd and rejected of men.</hi> So that he was only to live, ſuffer, and die ſuitably to the Law, a Pattern of unmateh'd Innocence and Virtue: to fulfil it, not to add to it. And indeed it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unneceſſary, that our Saviour ſhould be inveſted with the Power of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62708:56"/>
adding any thing to the Law: For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Moral Law</hi> in its own nature was incapable of receiving an addition of New Commands, or of having the Old ones extended to New Duties.</p>
               <p>The Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>The Law of God is perfect;</hi> and there is reaſon that it ſhould be ſo, if we conſider, that the fources of Good and Evil are not chiefly laid in any poſitive Injunction of God, with a deſign to try Man's Obedience, (as <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sunt qui nullam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptorum cauſamquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, ſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt omnia ſolam Dei Voluntatem ſequi.</hi> Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides, <hi>Mor. Nov. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> ſome have fancy'd) but in the order and dependance of things themſelves, which are always in the principal the ſame. We muſt therefore conclude, that this Law, which is the Rule of this Good or Evil, muſt be always the ſame too; and therefore when it began to be a Law, or a meaſure of this Good or Evil, it muſt be as perfect as it is at preſent; becauſe what is now Good or Evil, was always Good or Evil. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, If we ſurvey the compaſs and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of that Holineſs, Sanctity, and Perfection which were commanded by the Law; we may find, that it was not an imperfect Holineſs which might be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62708:56"/>
diſpens'd with in ſome points; but was to be a compleat, univerſal Holineſs, inconſiſtent either with the leaſt Sin, or the want of the leaſt Virtue; was to be like their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> not only <hi>without ſpot and blemiſh,</hi> but alſo perfect in every part: for, <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> ſays God. The Holineſs of the Divine Nature was to be the meaſure of their Holineſs; and ſince no Law could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join any thing which tended to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Holineſs than this, it follows, That no Law could be ſuperadded to this, nor the Law which exacts ſuch Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be extended to any other Duties: the Law was then incapable of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an addition of New Commands, or of having the Old ones extended to New Duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our Saviour did not attempt to do what was both thus againſt the Nature of the Thing, and beſides his own Character, to extend the Old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or impoſe New ones.</p>
               <p>He did not new extend the Old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; he did not reach them out to New Duties, which they did not inforce before. And this may be made out from
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62708:57"/>
a ſhort view of the divine Commands, and the meaſure of their Obligation, as they were given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and explain'd by him and the ſucceeding Prophets. And in the firſt place, the Duties of the firſt Table, which regard God, were advanc'd to the higheſt pitch before our Saviour's coming; neither did the firſt Command of <hi>having no other Gods before the true one,</hi> receive any addition by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip being paid to our Saviour; becauſe he is <hi>God of the ſame Nature with the Father, God over all, God bleſſed for ever.</hi> The object of divine Worſhip was not multiply'd by Worſhip given to him; becauſe <hi>He and the Father are One.</hi> The ſecond, third and fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were obſerv'd by the <hi>Jews,</hi> even to the greateſt Superſtition; to the think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their exactneſs in their Duties towards God, might atone for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their Duties towards their Neighbour; and that the abundance of their Sacrifices, join'd with their Zeal for the <hi>Worſhip, the Name of God, and his Day,</hi> might excuſe for their want of <hi>Mercy, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion:</hi> So that our Saviour rather ſeems to regulate their miſtaken Zeal on this Head; to try
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62708:57"/>
to make their Social Virtues conſiſtent with their Religious, than to have added any thing New. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> indeed had perverted the deſign of the fifth Commandment, by teaching the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of defrauding Parents of what was due to them, by a conſecrating it to God; yet this is not the intent of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſeems to be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly careful for the keeping of this Command, in its utmoſt e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But immoderate Anger, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a deſire of Revenge, is as much againſt the Morality of the Law, as of the Goſpel. Or elſe why ſhould the Pſalmiſt adviſe to <hi>ceaſe from Anger, and forſake Wrath?</hi> or why ſhould <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribe <hi>Anger as outragious, and Wrath as cruel?</hi> why as only <hi>reſting in the boſom of Fools,</hi> if there was no inconformity in it with the divine Law?</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Revenge:</hi> Private was as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful before the Goſpel, as under it. <hi>Thou ſhalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the children of thy people,</hi> was God's Law by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and no more is his Law
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62708:58"/>
by Chriſt But as for Publick <hi>Revenge,</hi> by the Sword of the Magiſtrate, it is as much allow'd by the latter, as by the former; for the Magiſtrate under the Goſpel too is <hi>a Miniſtar of God, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger to execute Wrath on him that does evil.</hi>
               </p>

But what other meaſure can there be of the Evilneſe of any Deſire, but the Illneſs of the Action, to which it tends?

Thus the Bleſſed practice the great Duties of Virtue and Religion; act above as we ought to do below, in conformity to the Divine Will.</p>
               <p>But, Secondly, As they practice theſe Virtues, ſo they practice them by a Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62708:72"/>Which is very evident: for every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, which is; whether it is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Agent, or an intermediate one; whether it moves by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pure Inſtinct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Nature, or whether it acts by Choice or Election, yet has ſome Rule of its Actions; whether this Rule is planted in its Nature within, or deliver'd to it from without. God Himſelf, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Agent, who acts ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Inſtruments, without the Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of Time, without Matter or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, yet never acts without Rule. Tho' his Actions are free and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd, yet are they confin'd to a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, by His Wiſdom and Juſtice, from which even His Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot make them ſwerve. For <hi>Juſtice and Judgment are the Habitation</hi> (or as others, the Baſis or Foundation) <hi>of his Throne.</hi> As his own connate, original Wiſdom, or the Rectitude of his own Nature, is the Rule and Meaſure of his own Actions; ſo is the Tranſcript of it, if I may ſo ſpeak, the Rule for all other Agents to move by. <hi>He has given the Sea his decree, that the Waters ſhould not paſs his Commandments;</hi> and if the proud tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Waves move by his Divine

Rules, how much more has he ſettled a Rule for his Angels, <hi>that excell in ſtrength;</hi> for thoſe his bleſſed Miniſters, <hi>who do his Pleaſure?</hi> The very Title of <hi>Angel</hi> imports Duty and Obedience to that glorious Power from whence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd its Commiſſion; and Obedience implies ſome Rule by which it ought to be proportion'd. As the Angels, ſo the Saints, in doe Subordination, are in their ſeveral Stations rang'd under Rules and Laws. For they are all Parts of the great Celeſtial Polity, and all make up one Church Triumphant; therefore muſt be ſubject to the ſame Heavenly Canons, Laws and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.

               <p>Thirdly, This Rule is the ſame with that by which we ought to regulate our Actions, therefore they are very fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and that it is the Rule of the Saints and Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, may be thus prov'd:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> That it is the Rule of the Saints, or of the <hi>Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect.</hi> That Law which recovens in the Saints that Image of God, which was defac'd by the Fall, is the Rule of their Actions; but the acting up to the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> is a Recovery of this Image, and ſo muſt be that Rule. For Heaven is properly nothing elſe but a Recovery of that State (with ſomething more of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) <hi>from which Man by Tranſgreſſion fell.</hi> If therefore acting in conformity with the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> in all its Points, is a Recovery of that State, and that Image; it is probable to ſuppoſe, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62708:73"/>
in Heaven this Law ſhall be the Rule of the Actions of the Bleſſed Saints: but an acting up to the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> in all its Points, is a Retrieval of the Divine Image; for the being <hi>made in the Image of God,</hi> is nothing elſe but being made in conformity with the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> and in a State of Legal Innocence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Image of God in Man, ſays, That it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Man's being <hi>made in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> which are the two great Points of the <hi>Moral Law;</hi> the former denoting the Duties of the ſecond Table, and the latter of the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As long therefore as Man liv'd up to the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> maintain'd <hi>Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſneſs and true Holineſs;</hi> ſo long was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to bear the Divine Image: but <hi>Man being in Honour</hi> had <hi>no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> but became <hi>like the Beaſts that periſh.</hi> For when he once broke the Law of his Maker, (whatſoever the Nature of his Sin was,) he loſt, this Image and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, and reſembled rather that Curſed Spirit, who had Betray'd him, than that Bleſſed God who had Created him. And under this reſemblance with the Apoſtate Angels had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he continued,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62708:74"/>
had not God (by an Effort of Goodneſs, which excell'd even that by which he made him) offer'd to retrieve him to his former Image and Likeneſs. And this was by aſſiſting him with his Grace, to live up to the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> which he had before broken; to keep the Divine Commands, which would ſo purify his Nature, as to renew the Divine Image, in ſome proportion, till he ſhould be receiv'd into Heaven, which his Saviour had purchas'd for him; where the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God ſhould be renew'd, with a Luſtre ſurpaſſing that in which Man was at firſt created. But the reaſon why the Image of God ſhould ſhine with a peculiar Splendour in Heaven, ſeems to be, becauſe Man is there put out of a poſſibility of ſinning any more, and of defacing this Divine Image. And this Heavenly State, being only a renewing of that Image of God, which Man had ſhortly after his Creation loſt; if that Image did (as was before ſhewn) at firſt conſiſt in Man's living up to the Rules of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> of <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true Holineſs;</hi> if this Image was forfeited by Tranſgreſſing theſe Laws; if it is in ſome degree renew'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62708:74"/>
in this Life, by acting up to them; it ſeems to follow, that it ſhall be totally renew'd, and eternally preſerv'd in Heaven, by an everlaſting Obedience of the Saints to theſe Laws of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of <hi>Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi> This Law therefore is the Rule for the Saints to act by in Heaven.</p>
               <p>And, Secondly, It is the Rule for the Angels to act by alſo; which may be ſhewn from an Argument drawn from the Fall and Revolt of the Evil Angels, and accuſs'd Spirits. The Argument is this: If thoſe Spirits which fell from before the Throne of God, fell by their Diſobeying that Law of God, which is ſtyl'd the <hi>Moral Law;</hi> it follows, that they were oblig'd to the Obſervance of this <hi>Moral Law.</hi> For every criminal Diſobedience ſuppoſes an antecedent Obligation. But if theſe accurs'd Spirits were ty'd to the keeping of this Law; we muſt conclude, that all the reſt of the Angelick Hierarchy w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> under the ſame Allegiance. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ly there was not one Rule of Obedience given to one part of the Celeſtial Hoſt, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to the Remainders. So that the Point to be prov'd is, That the Angels
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62708:75"/>
fell by Tranſgreſſing the <hi>Moral Law.</hi> The Tranſgreſſing of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> was the Crime which baniſh'd them Heaven. Whether their unpardonable Fault was Ingratitude towards God, as ſome ſuppoſe; or Infidelity, as others; or Pride, and a Reflection on their own Perfections, without conſidering God as the Author, as moſt; or Envy, as <note n="*" place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Gen.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul and diſmal Sin form'd out of the Malignity and Venom of each one of them mixt together; yet was it a Violation of the <hi>Moral Law.</hi> It was an Injury offer'd to that Light which God had put within them, as well as within Mankind. They therefore who ſinn'd againſt the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> who are Eternally puniſh'd for this ſinning were ty'd to the Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Law. If they were oblig'd to it once, ſo are the Angels which ſtand at preſent; for the bleſſed Angels are juſt the ſame now, which they were once, Tho' now the Objects of God's Eternal Vengeance, yet were they once his chief Miniſters; as much his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, as the moſt ſpotleſs, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62708:75"/>
of all the Angels; ty'd to no other Rules; no other Terms of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The Bleſſed Angels are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at preſent rang'd under the Occo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as well as the Curſed were immediately after their Creation, and before their Fall: which may be farther prov'd, by the Analogy that there is between the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> and the <hi>Celeſtial.</hi> There is the neareſt Reſemblance and Analogy between the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> and the <hi>Celeſtial;</hi> whether we conſider the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as it may be reduc'd to One Precept, to Two, or to Ten. It may be reduc'd to One, to that of Love; for <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> But the moſt perfect Love is diſplay'd in Heaven, in the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Charity: for <hi>tho' Prophecies ſhall fail, tho' Tongues ſhall ceaſe, tho' Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall vaniſh away; yet Charity never fails,</hi> but is compleated in Heaven. <hi>'Tis the bond of Perfectneſs,</hi> and in it, as in a Center, all Duties meet and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. The <hi>Moral Law</hi> may be farther combin'd into Two Precepts: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God,</hi> and <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> for <hi>on theſe Two Commandments hang all the Law</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62708:76"/>
                  <hi>and the Prophets.</hi> But the Law remains in Heaven under this Character. For firſt, The Saints and Angels love their Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed God with the pureſt Tranſports of Devotion; they adore him with the moſt profound Veneration, and they ſerve him with the moſt faithful Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Secondly, They purſue one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with the moſt ſincere Love and unfeign'd Charity; they rejoyce at one another's Happineſs, and are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animous in their Affections towards one another, as they are in their Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God.</p>
               <p>But Laſtly, The <hi>Moral Law</hi> is dilated into Ten Precepts, and under this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude they are practic'd in Heaven with the utmoſt vigour. Eight of theſe Precepts are Negative, and there is no doubt but that they are obſerv'd by the Saints and Angels with the greateſt accuracy. Far be it from thoſe pure Spirits, to lift up their Eyes to any God but the True One; to detract from, or to envy one another; to deſire what belongs to another, no not another's Happineſs.</p>
               <p>As to the Affirmative Commands, tho' they do not abide literally, yet they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62708:76"/>
remain myſteriouſly; becauſe they are chang'd into better. The Fourth, of the Sabbath, or the Lord's Day, ſhall be alter'd into a more noble one: for in Heaven there ſhall be no diſtinction of Days, but all the Rounds of an happy Eternity ſhall make up one Day, which ſhall not know a ſecond; and that wholly appropriated to the Lord, one Everlaſting Sabbath, one Eternal Reſt. As to the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivorum [ſc.</hi> Praecepto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum] <hi>erit in beatltudine ſumma ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatio, niſi forte illius de Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; quia non erit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendendi hunc actum.</hi> Scot. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>Sent. d.</hi> 38. <hi>q.</hi> 1.</note> Fifth, it ſhall not be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, but perfected: for tho' all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Relations ſhall ceaſe, as only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Neceſſities of this Life; yet ſhall that Honour, that Reverence, that Obedience, which are by the Fifth Commandment peculiarly attributed to Parents, become due to all the Saints.</p>
               <p>The force of all is, That the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Bleſſed is a juſt Rule for our Obedience, on account of the <hi>Matter</hi> of it; becauſe they practice the ſame Virtues, and practice them by the ſame Rule, which we are oblig'd to. God's Will perform'd <hi>in Heaven,</hi> is therefore on this account a juſt Standard for our accompliſhing of it <hi>on Earth.</hi> So is it on account of the <hi>Manner</hi> of its Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by the Bleſſed Saints and Angels, which was the Second General.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:62708:77"/>So that I ſhall very briefly ſhew, that they perform God's Will after that Manner, as to be juſt Patterns for us.</p>
               <p>For, Firſt, They perform it with all poſſible Chearfulneſs and Alacrity. The Word is no ſooner out of God's Mouth, but it is alſo executed; and theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his ſtay not ſo long, as even to promiſe Obedience. There is not among them any demurring to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Command, or any delay put to the Execution of it, by an over-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt repreſenting their own unfitneſs for their Task. They queſtion not at all with God about the ſuitableneſs thereof, nor yet debate with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether or no, or with what Vigour they ſhall apply themſelves to the Execution of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They perform God's Will uniformly. For an imperfect Obedience is (in ſtrict ſpeaking) no Obedience at all; for he who only obeys ſo far as himſelf pleaſes, only does God's Will as far as it complies with his own. There is this more extenſive Proof of the Uniformity of the Angel's Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, That the greateſt part of it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62708:77"/>
in diſcharging ſuch Commands, as ſubject them, in ſome proportion, to thoſe Creatures which are plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them. Such are thoſe Commands, which demand their attendance upon us, who are by Creation <hi>made ſomewhat lower than they;</hi> yet have made our ſelves much more ſo, by our Sins and Frailties. So that it is eaſy to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, That had not their Obedience been truly uniform, it would not have carried them to a compliance with ſuch Branches of it, as ſeem not fully conſiſtent with the Dignity and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur of their Order and Station.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Their Comportment with the Divine Will is conſtant and ſettled, and they always diſcharge the Will of God, as well as chearfully and uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That Eſtabliſhment which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd to their Piety, by the Election of God, will moſt certainly produce this Conſtancy. Beſides this, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture diſplays them as always looking on the Face of God, expecting (as it were) and inviting his Commands, or travelling about his Meſſages; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually deſcending from Heaven about their Earthly Miniſtrations, or aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62708:78"/>
up thither after the Execution of them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Obedience of the Angels is as compleat, as it is chearful, uniform and conſtant; and reaches to every Branch of their Injunction, as well as to all God's Commands; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as there can be no doubt of their ſufficiency for ſuch a Compliance, who are ſo near to the Divine Influences, and ſo gloriouſly adorn'd by them; ſo the ſame Reaſon and Obedience, which move them to have a reſpect to all God's Commands, will incite them to have a regard to every the minuteſt Punctilio, as having the ſame Impreſs of the ſame Divine Will ſtampt upon it.</p>

or fear His Puniſhments in a future State. And as it is thus a very neceſſary Duty, ſo (if exactly practic'd) is it a difficult one too. For it is a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with God; and for Man, <hi>who is but of yeſterday,</hi> to correſpond with the Almighty, <hi>who inhabits Eternity,</hi> muſt employ the utmoſt force of all his Powers and Faculties. For if the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim</hi> and <hi>Seraphim,</hi> who were always without Spot or Blemiſh, and in whom was never found any Guile, cover their Faces while they are Praiſing and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring the infinite Perfections of God; what Geſture can be humble enough for Man, who compoſes himſelf to Pray to Him laden with his Sins, and whoſe Iniquities have gone over his Head? If thoſe glorious Spirits are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in Scripture, as ſhifting from place to place while they are worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Creator, as conquer'd and overpower'd by the Purity of His Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; with what Confuſion muſt Man appear before Him, who was <hi>conceiv'd in Sin, and born in Iniquity?</hi> What at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and application of Thought? What modeſty of Expreſſion? What ſubmiſſiveneſs of Behaviour? What
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62708:79"/>
Love and Admiration? What warmth of Affection muſt be us'd to make our Sacrifices acceptable to our Maker? And certainly, as it had been the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Preſumption, to have offer'd to have entertain'd any Entercourſe with the Almighty, had not He Himſelf encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd it; ſo ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He has vouchſafed to do it, it is our moſt excellent Glory, that we can addreſs our Supplications to Him. But ſtill the Obligation abides, to put them up with all the Devotion and Fervency of Spirit, which our Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are capable of; to prepare our ſelves with the niceſt diligence, that we may</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pray always with all Prayer and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Praying always,</hi> is not meant a conſtant or continued Exerciſe of the Act of Prayer, ſo as to be always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the Name of God. For this would be inconſiſtent with our other relative Duties: for there are Virtues to be practic'd, which more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately regard our Neighbour and our ſelves, as well as thoſe which ſolely reſpect God; and we are oblig'd to Juſtice, Charity and Humanity, as well
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62708:80"/>
as to Pray, Praiſe and Adore. But by <hi>Praying always,</hi> is to be underſtood ſuch a Godlike Frame and Temper of Spirit, accompany'd with ſuch an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Life, and reliſh of Heavenly Things, that we may be ever diſpos'd for this Duty, when fit opportunities ſhall call for it. By <hi>Praying in the Spirit</hi> (whatſoever the <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> pretend) ſeems to be only imply'd, that our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ought to have the <hi>Qualifications</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd; ſo that they ought to be put up rather for things Spiritual, than Temporal; for God's aſſiſtance to enable us to perſevere in Goodneſs, for the removal or averting of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for all Graces needful for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Means for the ſecuring or encreaſing of them; which are ſtyl'd the <hi>Gifts,</hi> or Privileges of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> And this too falls under the former Head, and is a <hi>Qualification</hi> neceſſary to make us Pray aright; ſince there can be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Argument that we are well <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> for Prayer, than that we pray for Bleſſings of the moſt noble Importance, the moſt momentous Concern. So that in the Text are couch'd the <hi>Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> requir'd to make us ſucceſsful
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62708:80"/>
Petitioners at the Throne of Grace. For the reaſon why ſo many Prayers are not heard by Heaven, after thoſe Promiſes which are annex'd to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this Duty, is, becauſe we are not duly accompliſh'd to be Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for its Mercies. And it is eaſy for us in this Caſe, to vindicate the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, and to make an Apology for our Maker, in our Maker's own Words, which are, that <hi>We ask and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not, becauſe we ask amiſs.</hi> In order therefore to make us fit Supplicants to the God of Glory, and to put our Souls into ſuch a Temper, that they may be conſtantly and habitually fitted for the Diſcharge of this Duty, there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Qualifications</hi> needful. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What <hi>Qualifications</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prepare us for Prayer, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we Pray, and in order to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is requir'd in the very time, or act of our Praying, when our Devotions are on the Wing, and our Lips are <hi>touch'd with a Coal from the Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What muſt be done after we have Pray'd, to make our antecedent Prayers duly effectual.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:62708:81"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What Acts are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and extended through each of theſe, both before, in, and after our Prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore, What <hi>Qualifications</hi> are neceſſary to prepare us for Prayer, or before we Pray, and in order to it.</p>
               <p>Now the Firſt <hi>Qualification</hi> neceſſary to prepare us for Prayer, is the Purity of our <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Menander.</hi>
                  </note> Hearts, or the Direction of our Lives by the Commandments of God. For if our Affections are impure, or our Ways unrighteous, it is in vain to make our Applications to God: for we know that <hi>God heareth not Sinners, but if any man is a worſhipper of God, and doth his Will, him he heareth.</hi> For, <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous, and his Ears are open to their Prayers</hi> alone. For without Godlineſs, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>Antinomian</hi> Schemes ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may draw,) whether it conſiſts in Innocence, or ſincere Repentance, our Prayers can never mount up to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God; becauſe the Burden of our Sins will certainly keep them from aſcending to that Holy Place, where nothing, but what is compleatly ſo, can
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62708:81"/>
appear. And it would be Preſumption, to hope that our ſpotleſs Saviour ſhould preſent ſo unacceptable a Sacrifice to his Father, as the Petitions of a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant, who declares himſelf to be in a State of Hoſtility againſt both of them, by an avow'd complying with what they moſt abhor. Nay, it is the moſt unwarrantable Inſolence, for him who ſtill retains a Love for his Sins, and yields to them upon the general returns of Temptation, to approach his Maker in any Holy Office. For it is only an <hi>honouring</hi> Him <hi>with his Lips, while his Heart is far from</hi> Him; and ſeems to be what the Apoſtle calls a <hi>Lying to God,</hi> a profeſſing himſelf his moſt devoted, moſt obedient Servant, while his own Conſcience, by a reflection on his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will tell him that he is his open and inveterate Enemy. 'Tis a collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with Him, <hi>who tries the Heart and the Reins,</hi> and <hi>to whoſe Eyes all things are n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ked and open:</hi> as if Omniſcience could be impos'd on by Pretences, or a Religious Pageantry was tantamount to Solid Virtue and Piety; or ſaying of, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> would excuſe for the not doing the Will of <hi>our Father which is</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:62708:82"/>
                  <hi>in Heaven.</hi> So that till we are free from all known and willful Sin, 'tis to no purpoſe to make any Supplication to God. He will not hear, will not regard our Prayers. They are like <hi>unballowed Fire</hi> offer'd to Him, and are <hi>an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his ſight;</hi> for of him, who is not reſolv'd to part with his Sins, the very Prayers are ſinful. That Duty which draws others nigher to God, caſts him at a greater diſtance from him. That Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance which ſanctifies others, ſerves only to aggravate his deplorable Stare, and to render his Condition more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable. But neither, on the other hand, is he leſs criminal, if he does not Pray at all: for he is not excus'd from this Duty, by being unqualify'd for it, but he becomes guilty, not only of thoſe Sins which are the hindrances of his Devotion, but of that Inability to Devotion, which they have caus'd; and ſo hard are his Circumſtances, that he is likely to ſuffer, not only for making his Duty impoſſible by ſinning, but even for not diſcharging it, while it is thus impoſſible. And this juſtly enough too, becauſe this Impoſſibility was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuperinduc'd; an Act of his own
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62708:82"/>
choice and free election, and for which he has none to blame beſides himſelf, and his own wild Paſſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. So that while his Caſe continues thus, he is on all accounts <hi>unqualify'd</hi> for Prayer, and yet is guilty too if he does not Pray, till by hearty Repentance he has freed himſelf from his Sins. So indiſpenſibly neceſſary is Purity from Sin, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for Prayer. But as there are different kinds of Sins, ſo is there the greateſt neceſſity that we ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of thoſe Sins, which are moſt oppos'd to the Spirit of Prayer; for they are not all of them equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of it. But theſe are Malioe, Ill-will, or Hatred of our Brother. Now as theſe Vices commence two manner of ways, either by Injuring our Brother, or by receiving an Injury from him; ſo we may be ſuppos'd, in either Caſe, to be guilty of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on all regards <hi>unqualify'd</hi> for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if we do not contribute our utmoſt towards the ſuppreſſing of them. As for Inſtance: If I have injur'd my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and given him any umbrage to hate me, I am in a great meaſure guiley of the Sin, and therefore am <hi>unqualify'd</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:62708:83"/>
for Prayer, if I do not endeavour a ſpeedy Reconcilement with him. For <hi>if my Gift is before the Altar,</hi> and I there <hi>remember that my Brother has ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me,</hi> (any juſt cauſe of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I have injur'd him,) I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to <hi>leave</hi> my <hi>Gift before the Altar, and go, and firſt be reconciled to</hi> my <hi>Brother.</hi> So on the other hand, when we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd by our Brother, we are guilty of the Malice, and the <hi>Sin lies at our door,</hi> and ſo our Prayers become ineffectual, if we expreſs an eager Deſire to revenge our ſelves; if we ſhew an Averſion and Unwillingneſs to forgive him; if we neglect his Propoſals of Peace and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. For how can we expect that God ſhould pardon our Sins of the blackeſt Character, if we will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our <hi>Fellow-ſervant the leaſt Offence?</hi> And has not our Bleſſed Lord taught us, that we cannot Pray to God to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our Treſpaſſes,</hi> unleſs <hi>we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us?</hi> And as often as we uſe this ſacred Prayer of our Saviour's, if we do not forgive thoſe who have offended us from the bottom of our Hearts, we deſire that God would not forgive us; that He
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62708:83"/>

Otherwiſe, if we only ask for God's Bleſſings, to conſume them on our Luſts, we petition Heaven to contribute to our Undoing, and beg of the Almighty Materials for our Sins, and for Occaſions to provoke Him.

                  </gap>it. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe, an Addreſs to the Throne of Grace, is to no purpoſe. The moſt art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and elaborate Petition can meet with no welcome there; but like the <hi>Dove,</hi> when ſhe was at firſt <hi>ſent</hi> out of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62708:85"/>
the <hi>Ark,</hi> after it has in vain roam'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Heavens, without finding any admiſſion, muſt return to its diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed owner <hi>empty.</hi> And if theſe <hi>Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> are needful for us before we apply our ſelves to God in Prayer, while we are yet at a diſtance from him; what will be ſufficient for us to do in the time and act of Praying, when we are before the very Preſence of the Living God, and the pure Eyes of the Eternal are fixt upon us? How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful muſt that place be, which, by God's being more immediately reſident in it, is none other but the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> and the <hi>Gate of Heaven?</hi> So that we ſhall enquire,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is required in the very time and act of our Praying, while our Devotions are on the Wing, and our Lips are <hi>touch'd with a Coal from the Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Firſt <hi>Qualification</hi> neceſſary for us in the time of Prayer, is <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> becauſe Prayer is a Talking with God. And this <hi>Humility</hi> ought to be form'd in us, Firſt, by the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Majeſty of that God, with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62708:86"/>
whom we have to do: That He is the <hi>Higheſt</hi> far above all, who has <hi>Heaven for his Throne,</hi> and the <hi>Earth for his Footſtool. Who meaſures she Sea in the palm of His Hands. In whoſe Hand is the Soul of every living thing, and the Breath of all Mankind. Hell is naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him, and Deſtruction hath no cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He ſtretcheth out the North over the empty place, and hangeth the Earth upon nothing.</hi> And, Secondly, this Humility ought to be rais'd by the ſence of our own Vileneſs. Firſt, as we are Men and the Creatures of God, over whom he has an abſolute Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. As we are nothing but a little breathing Duſt and Aſhes, which after a <hi>ſhort time,</hi> but very <hi>full of trouble,</hi> muſt return to that out of which we were form'd. If the moſt glorious of his Creatures are ſo deſpicable before Him, that <hi>He puts no Truſt in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and charges even his Angels with Folly;</hi> how ſhall they come before Him, <hi>who dwell in Houſes of Clay, whoſe Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is in the Duſt?</hi> But, Secondly, much more ought we to be humble in our Prayers, as we are Sinners, and worthy (if God ſhould reward us after
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62708:86"/>
our Sins) of Eternal Death. We have affronted Infinite Majeſty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſerve Infinite Puniſhment. And tho' through the Mercies of God, and the Merits of our Bleſſed Saviour, our ſevere Repentance may hinder the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this Sentence; yet we muſt remember, that Humility is a part even of Repentance it ſelf. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that it is the Goodneſs of God alone, which makes our Miſery leſs, ought to make our Sin greater, and heighten our Humility for having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonded ſo gracious a Creator, when we pray for Remiſſion for thoſe Offences.</p>
               <p>The Second <hi>Qualification</hi> in the time of Praying, is a due fixedneſs: and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Mind. For God is an Object ſo noble, that he demands the utmoſt Intenſion of our Thoughts. They ought all to be collected, and fix'd on him, directed as the <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es of the Cheru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>im in the Ark</hi> wholly <hi>towards the Mercy-ſeat.</hi> And in order to this, our Minds ought to be diſengag'd from whatſoever may occaſion their ſtragling; as from an over-violent Love of the World, its Pleaſures and Intereſts, and to be poſſeſt with whatſoever may raiſe a juſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62708:87"/>
as with an awful ſence of the Dignity and Excellence of this Duty, the ineſtimable Worth of thoſe Mercies for which we petition, the greatneſs of our Wants and Neceſſities. Nor is it enough, (as the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> Aquin. <hi>2da 2dae Qu.</hi> 84. <hi>ad</hi> 13. <hi>Non ex ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiritur quod atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio adfit O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationi per totum,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Schoolmen</hi> looſely determin in this Matter,) that this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is purpoſed and intended, tho' it is not executed. Nor is it ſufficient that we come with a Reſolution to be attentive, if we do not vigorouſly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it. For is a Reſolution a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Diſcharge of any other Duty? Or was the <hi>Son</hi> in the Goſpel juſtify'd for reſolving to <hi>go and work in the Vineyard,</hi> and yet not doing it? A Reſolution to Pray in general, might as well abſolve us from not Praying at all, as a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to be attentive, from not being ſo. No: tho' God will make abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Imperfection of our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, reſulting from the unavoidable weakneſs of our Natures, or our being diſus'd to Think or Reflect; yet will not he diſpenſe with the total want of it. And if we are ſorry for this Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our Attention, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour effectively to correct it, God will concur with us, and by drawing nigher
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62708:87"/>
to us, and diſcovering his Perfections with a greater Luſtre, will make our Attention not only eaſy and natural, but even alſo pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>The Third <hi>Qualification</hi> of Prayer, in the act of Praying, is a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Deſire, and fervency of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For a lukewarm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Petitioner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks a Denial, and he himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to his own Repulſe. He ſeems unconcern'd in making his Suit, and ſo may expect God to be leſs concern'd to grant it. He ſeems to ſlight the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, while he asks it. Can it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be imagin'd, that he ſhould think himſelf much oblig'd by it, or be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for it? While a fervent Prayer ſhews how ardently we deſire a Mercy, and how thankfully we are like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. And this is a ſtrong Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for God to beſtow it on us; for He is ſo tenden and indulgent, that He cannot deny us any thing which is fit for us, when He ſees us wrought up to a due valuation of it, and our Hearts earneſtly bent upon it. For it is the <hi>ſervent Prayer of the righteous man, which prevaileth much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:62708:88"/>The Fourth <hi>Qualification</hi> of Prayer, in the act of Praying, is a general Love for Mankind, and a Concern for their Happineſs. For the Compaſs of our Prayers ought to be as large as that of our Charity, and with its open Arms embrace all Mankind: extended even to thoſe, who are perhaps contriving to <hi>lay our Honours</hi> and Bodies <hi>in the duſt,</hi> while we are mounting their Souls, in our Devotions, up to the Heavens. For we are oblig'd by our Holy Religion, to <hi>bleſs them which curſe us,</hi> and to <hi>pray for them which deſpitefully uſe us.</hi> And in purſuit of this univerſal Charity, our Saviour, (according to <note n="*" place="margin">De Orat.</note> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s pious Obſervation,) has taught us to ſay, <hi>Our,</hi> and not <hi>My Father,</hi> only, <hi>which art in Heaven,</hi> that mindful of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and common Original, and of that glorious dependance on which we ſtand related to God, we might unite our Prayers for all thoſe, who bear the ſame illuſtrious Character of the <hi>Sons of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fifth <hi>Qualification</hi> of Prayer is, That our Prayers ought to be ſhort, not abounding with an exceſs of Words. For Prayer is the Language of the Heart, rather than of the Tongue; of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62708:88"/>
the Affections, more than of the Lips; and great and rais'd Paſſions, ſuch as make up the moſt perfect Devotion, are ſeldom attended with a copious fluency of Words. For the Soul is too much employ'd within, to love leiſure to exerciſe it ſelf about Flouriſh, or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Harangue. Of this conciſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are moſt of the ſacred Hymns and Prayers which are extant, ſuitable to the Majeſty of God: for the moſt ſhort, is alſo the moſt ſolemn and ſtately Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Addreſs, and agreeable to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind's Infirmities which hinder us from enlivening with a due Spirit a long and tedious Prayer Of this Nature are our Saviour's own Prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one of the laſt of which in his Agony, is ſo ſhort, and yet ſo pathetical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it ſeems (according to the Hiſtory) to be accompany'd with more drop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Blood than Words.</p>
               <p>The Laſt <hi>Qualification,</hi> in the act of Praying, is Perſeverance. Perſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, not as the <hi>Meſſallians,</hi> from the Apoſtle's Command in the Words, of <hi>Praying always</hi> thought, by an unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken continuation of the acts of Prayer; but by a conſtant Preparation for, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62708:89"/>
Exerciſe of them, as opportunities, and freedom from other Duties demand. For this is the Perfection, not only of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but of all Virtues. Without this they are only faint efforts, and attempts to pleaſe God, which ſhall never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of, nor rewarded by Him. But it has a moſt eſpecial force in Prayer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for if the Unjuſt Judge in the Goſpel, <hi>who neither fear'd God, nor regarded Man,</hi> yet granted the Widow's Petition, mov'd purely by her reſolute Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; how much more ſhall God, who is the Juſt Judge of all Mankind, and whoſe Goodneſs inclines Him to be kind and beneficent to His Creatures, grant our Requeſts, if <hi>we cry day and night to Him? I tell you,</hi> (as the Goſpel has it) <hi>He will grant them ſpeedily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humility</hi> therefore, <hi>Attention, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Charity, Brevity</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> are <hi>Qualifications</hi> neceſſary in the time of Prayer. But there are,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Qualifications</hi> neceſſary after we have pray'd, to make our antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Prayers duly effectual.</p>
               <p>As Firſt, an obſervation of God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to our Prayers; an eyeing the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62708:89"/>
tendency of his Providence, whether he does grant our Petitions or not; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to ſpititual Concerns. And there is an infallible Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to meaſure our Succeſs by: for we may aſſuredly conclude, That God has heard our Prayers, as to Pardon of Sins, (for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,) if we find our ſolves free from voluntary Tranſgreſſions. But if after our Prayers we are as much Sinners as over, this is a ſign that God has not heard our Petitions, and that our Sins are not pardon'd; and the fault muſt be our own, becauſe we did not truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them, before we pray'd for their Remiſſion. So that we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our Repentance, as well as our Prayers; and: if the former is ſincere and the latter duly <hi>qualify'd,</hi> we ſhall certainly be ſucceſsful. Thus we may know that God has granted our Prayers as to ſpiritual Graces, if we find our ſelves improv'd in Virtue after our Prayers: otherwiſe the fault is our own; we have not endeavour'd vigour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly after Grace. So that we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

none on God's: for <hi>He is always more ready to Give, than we to</hi> Pray. He is prepar'd to prevent with his Bleſſings even our firſt Wiſhes for them, and to reward our pious Deſires, even before they have time to cloath themſelves with Words.</p>
               <p>The Second <hi>Qualification</hi> after Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is a returning God Thanks for His Grants and Denials: that is, His Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of temporal Advantages. For this is often as great a Proof of His Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goodneſs and Concern for us, as any of His moſt Merciful Indulgences. 'Tis a myſterious Method of Kindneſs, which obliges us againſt our Wills, and makes us happy in contradiction to our moſt paſſionate Deſires; depriving us of what would prove to us only a more agreeable Ruine, a more pleaſant and beautiful Deſtruction. And how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere ſoever Diſappointments may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us at firſt, yet the event and cloſe of Things will ſhew, that we had good reaſon to be thankful to God, for His croſſing us in our Wiſhes, and for viſibly fruſtrating us in the ſucceſs of our Prayers; and we ſhall at laſt find the ſatisfaction of conſigning our choice

               <p>The Third <hi>Qualification</hi> after Prayer, is a due Value of our great Privilege, That we may pray to God. For hole great is the Prerogative of a Chriſtian, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Fourth <hi>Qualification</hi> is a learning by God's Denials, to make fitter Addreſſes for the future. For if my Prayer's are not granted, there muſt be ſome fault in me. Till that is amended, Heaven will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

This is all the Return we can make to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for the innumerable Bounties which it ſhatters upon us with open hands. This is a kind of relieving our Saviour in his ſuffering Members; and he tells us, that he will look on it, as if done to himſelf. And there can be no greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inducement for God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow temporal good things on us, than if we conſecrate a part of them to him by our Alms. We render him, if I may ſo ſpeak, our Debtor, and (pardon the boldneſs of the Expreſſion) we may in ſome meaſure, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to this Duty, appeal to his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as well as to his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> to make ſuitable Requitals; which he will moſt certainly perform, tho' not in <hi>Kind,</hi> yet in what will be much more for our <hi>Advantage;</hi> and will conſult, tho' not our preſent Satisfaction, yet

               <p>The next <hi>Qualification</hi> is a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive one, and which takes in all the reſt, yet withal a very neceſſary one too; and that is univerſal Holineſs and Sanctity. For our Praying in a ſhort time will make us loave off our Sins, or our Sins our Prayers. So that this will be an Effect, as well as a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of our Devotion.

               <p>THERE are ſcarcely any purely Hiſtorical Paſſages of Scripture, which carry the appearance of greater Obſcurity, or have had more various Sences put upon them, than thoſe which regard <hi>Melchizedec.</hi> Tho' who this Perſon was, has been a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Point, and perhaps ever will be ſo, (for Controverſies do not end with the firſt Authors of them;) yet that Chriſt is parallel'd with him, in his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62708:95"/>
Prieſtly Office, is as evident as the other part is dark and intricate. I ſhall therefore endeavour to give a view, both of the obſcure and bright ſide of this Subject, by making ſome tranſient Remarks, both on the <hi>Perſon</hi> and the <hi>Parallel;</hi> by</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall parallel Chriſt with him in this Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall enquire who <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi> is.</p>
               <p>No mention is made of this holy Perſon, ſave in the <hi>14th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi> and in the <hi>110th Pſalm,</hi> except what the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſays of him, which is wholly taken from thence. Thus little being ſpoken of him, has been the foundation of ſo many Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But all that has been rationally deliver'd about him, may be reduc'd to Five Heads. The firſt Notion is that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who make <hi>Melchizedec</hi> the ſame with the Patriarch <hi>Sem:</hi> for they paying the greateſt Honour to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom they ſaid that he was their
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62708:95"/>
Father, reſented it ill, that he ſhould give Tithe to a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of an higher Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. To wipe off which blemiſh, they firſt declare <hi>Melchizedec</hi> to be an Angel, and in after-times the Patriarch <hi>Sem,</hi> and that he bleſſed <hi>Abraham</hi> as his great Grand-ſon; thus thinking to ſecure the repute of their Nation.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>Melchizedec</hi> was not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Sem,</hi> may be made plain. Firſt, Becauſe the Apoſtle ſays that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent was not counted, being <hi>without Deſcent;</hi> but the Pedigree: of <hi>Sem</hi> may be traced down from <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſtands upon eternal Record. Secondly, <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedec</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>without Father</hi> and <hi>without Mother;</hi> but the Scripture gives us a large Hiſtory of <hi>Noah</hi> the Father of <hi>Sem.</hi> Thirdly, The Order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedec</hi> was different from the Levitical Order; but the Prieſthood of <hi>Sem</hi> muſt be the ſame with that of <hi>Levi,</hi> becauſe <hi>Levi</hi> was deſcended in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> right Line from <hi>Sem.</hi> More than this, Fourthly, the Apoſtle prefers the Order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedec</hi> to the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or the Levitical Order; becauſe <hi>Levi</hi> paid tithes to him in <hi>Abraham.</hi> Which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument would be null, if <hi>Melchizedec</hi>

               <p>But to return: From what has been diſcours'd we may gather, that it was common from the firſt Ages of the World, that the ſame Perſon ſhould be both King and Prieſt. I ſhall proceed to enquire,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Into the Nature of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec's</hi> Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>And to underſtand this, we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Nature of that Law which he preſided over by his Sacerdotal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and according to which he was a Prieſt. Now this Law was the Law
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62708:99"/>
of Nature, improv'd by ſome Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which might be handed down from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> and from him to the Age of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For this is all the Law that was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> unleſs we make the Law of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the eating of the forbidden Fruit a poſitive Law. If he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd this, he ſhould have ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd his Innocence, and thereby his Happineſs. Happy State of Innocence! which had not much more to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from Heaven it ſelf, but only that it wanted Continuance. <hi>At fuit ingens gloria!</hi> for <hi>Adam</hi> forſeiting his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, had his clear Notions of this pure Law in a great meaſure defac'd. What he had left, or what was farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to him, was in ſome proportion brought down to the times of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec,</hi> and according to this Law was he a Prieſt. By this Law he, and thoſe under his Juriſdiction, were inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to worſhip one God, to ſwear by his holy Name, to give him due Honour, to make Vows by him, to gather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Aſſemblies, to raiſe Altars, to build Temples, to do to others as they would deſire others ſhould do to them.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62708:99"/>
By this Rule lived <hi>Enoch,</hi> and ſo pleaſed God, that he was tranſlated into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. By this acted <hi>Abraham,</hi> after he had forſaken his Idolatry, after he had burnt his Father's Gods, and made them a pleaſing Sacrifice to the True One. And we cannot but receive high <hi>Idea's</hi> of this auguſt Prieſt, to whom the Son of God himſelf was made like. No queſtion but the innocence of his Life, and the fervour of his Devotion, far outvied the beſt and moſt pious of his Age. There is indeed a ſeeming diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in thoſe Expreſſions, which affirm that he had <hi>neither beginning of days, nor end of life,</hi> and that he <hi>abideth a Prieſt continually:</hi> but if by a Metaſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm natural enough, we tranſlate what is here ſaid of the Perſon or Prieſt, to the Prieſthood or Law themſelves, all will appear very eaſy. For theſe Rules of Natural Religion are eternal; had no beginning of Sanction, nor end of Obligation; but being the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dictates of Right Reaſon, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and never to be abrogated, as the Jewiſh Law and Prieſthood were; but ſhall remain even in Heaven it ſelf, as was ſhewn in a former Diſcourſe.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62708:100"/>
This Law is ingeniouſly ſtyl'd by <hi>Philo,</hi> the Law ſtampt on the immortal Mind of God. And ſome of the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> are ſo extravagant as to aſſert, that it was before the Will of God it ſelf, before Eternity. Such was <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> ſuch the Nature of his Prieſthood. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt was a Prieſt after his Order.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt, as a divine Reſtorer of the eternal Law, recover'd it to its original Splendor, after it had been a long time obſcur'd by Prejudice and Vice. He form'd a Religion, which was nothing elſe but a digeſt of the Rules of Right Reaſon. For what is the Goſpel, conſider'd without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Believing, and of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but the Law of Nature? Every thing practical is enjoin'd by that Law. Thoſe hard and ſevere Precepts, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning good for evil, of dying for what we think to be our Duty, have not only been commended, but alſo practic'd by noble <hi>Heathens,</hi> who only mov'd by the Law of Nature. What is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's excellent Sermon on the Mount, but a Scheme of natural Principles?
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62708:100"/>
The whole deſign of it is, to recover Right Reaſon from thoſe fooliſh Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, by which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had darken'd it. The Virtues which are there enjoin'd, Meekneſs, Humility, Juſtice, Purity of Spirit, Charity, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive as even to love our Enemies, are all branches of the natural Law. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets of old among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Philoſophers among the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> were propagators of this Law: but what was taught by the former, was not ſo clear, tho' as perfect, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewn; what by the latter, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſo clear nor perfect, as what was perform'd by our Saviour. The Philoſophers (if I may ſo ſpeak) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd the firſt Sketches and Out-lines; but he drew the Lineaments and true Symmetry of this majeſtical Piece. To evince that our Saviour's aim was to retrieve the Law of Nature, you may obſerve, that when Chriſt endeavour'd to correct the Miſtakes of the <hi>Jews</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Divorce, he refers them to the original Inſtitution of Marriage, by the Law of Nature; which Rule may alſo hold in the caſe of Polygamy, tho diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd with in regard to the Patriarchs.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62708:101"/>
So that we may conclude, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's intention, as he was a <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decian</hi> Prieſt, was to reduce the Law of Nature to its original purity, that it might nearly reſemble what was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocence. The whole World being divided into <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> tho' very unequally, both of them had miſerably tortur'd the Law of Nature; ſo that our Saviour's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Hand was neceſſary to aſſert it to its native Liberty. For the Ritual Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was an heavy Yoke, and there could be no true Liberty, but under the Law of Nature, (which is alſo the Law of God,) which only reſtrains us from what is truly ill, or really hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. This therefore is a common foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, and that of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> That they both of them eminently adorn'd the Law of Nature, tho' the former did it with a diſtinguiſhing Glory. Chriſt indeed is a Prieſt for ever, after a way which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be apply'd to <hi>Melchizedec;</hi> that is, by entering into Heaven, and offering himſelf a Sacrifice devoted for our Sins; and by the Virtue of this Sacrifice, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting himſelf before God as our high

The Religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in like manner triumph'd over Idolatry, and whereſoever it appear'd, gave a total ſtroke to <hi>Polytheiſm.</hi> So groundleſs was that Calumny of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which makes <hi>Jeſus</hi> deſcended not from <hi>Abraham,</hi> the true worſhipper of God; but from the idolatrous <hi>Thera,</hi> whoſe Practice they make him to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.

               <p>TO make my Thoughts more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar on this noble, tho' common Subject, I ſhall offer to prove,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there ſhall be a <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it ſhall be of the Body only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it ſhall be of the <hi>ſame</hi> Body from which the Soul was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, There ſhall be a <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of the Body. Where I ſhall prove,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That ſuch a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> has not any thing in it, which carries the appearance of an Impoſſibility.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it is in it ſelf very
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62708:104"/>
probable and ſuitable to the Rules of true Reaſon. And</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That upon the proſpects of the divine Promiſes and Predictions, it is certain and beyond all queſtion firm.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Body has not any thing in it, which carries the appearance of an Impoſſibility. For if the Reſurrection is impoſſible, it is becauſe that either the <hi>Power</hi> which is to perform this miraculous Act, has not force enough to accompliſh it; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Subject</hi> about which it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, is not capable to be rais'd after this wonderful manner. But neither of theſe are true: for tho' neither Man nor Angel could raiſe a dead Body, yet it is within the compaſs of the <hi>Divine Power.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Deity knows where the Particles and Atoms of the Bodies of the Dead are repos'd, in what ſecret Cells they are lodg'd, and what Changes they have run through ſince their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He can aſſemble theſe ſcatter'd Parts, and unite them in their former harmony and beauty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He can command the Soul
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62708:104"/>
back to its ancient abode, call it from Bliſs or Woe, to reſume its former Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſo that <hi>theſe dry Bones</hi> ſhall <hi>live,</hi> and become the ſame Man they were before their Diſſolution.</p>
               <p>And, Firſt, the Deity knows where the Particles and Atoms of the Bodies of the Dead are repos'd, in what ſecret Cells they are lodg'd, and what Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they have run through ſince their ſeparation from the Soul.</p>
               <p>For God underſtands all the inviſible Paſſages of Nature, and every ſmall part of a Body, and can trace it thro' all its turns and ſhapes, whatſoever outward Frame it may aſſume. He knows where the remains of the firſt <hi>righteous Sacrificer,</hi> the firſt Example of Mortality, (which all Mortals muſt tranſcribe,) are diſpos'd of, as well as thoſe of the laſt Man, who ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Curſe, and ſhall be the laſt of thoſe who ſhall return to Duſt. For whatſoever viſible Figure our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Body may be inveſted with, to Him it is undiſguis'd and confeſſes it ſelf. The ſineſt Glaſſes can only help us to the ſight of the Surface, and external Contexture of ſome Bodies, while ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

others may be of ſo nice and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate a Frame, as no more to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by them, than by the Eye without their aſſiſtance. But nothing can be ſo minute, as to <hi>lie hid from</hi> the Underſtanding of God, no more than any thing can be ſo glorious as to <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi> it. As in his Book all <hi>our Members</hi> were <hi>written,</hi> which <hi>in continuance were faſhion'd,</hi> when <hi>as yet there was none of them;</hi> ſo every Atom which belongs to us is known to Him who made us. Tho' (in the Prophet's Language) <hi>we go down to the bottoms of the Mountains, and the Earth with her Bars is about us; or tho' we are caſt into the deep, in the midſt of the Seas, and the Floods compaſs us about, and his Billows and Waves paſs over us;</hi> even this Darkneſs hides us not from Him, but every Particle lies open to his view. As God knows where the Atoms of the Bodies of the Dead are repos'd, ſo</p>
               <p>Secondly, He can aſſemble theſe ſcatter'd Parts, and unite them in their former harmony and beauty.</p>
               <p>He who could make Man out of the Duſt, and employ'd ſuch a Profuſion of Wiſdom and Goodneſs on the liveleſs Clay, as to advance it into the <hi>Image of</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:62708:107"/>
                  <hi>God,</hi> can ſurely reſtore the diſſolv'd Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, and in the noble Expreſſion of Scripture, make our <hi>Bones flouriſh like an Herb.</hi> He can ſummon and re-call Man's divided Atoms from the Earth and from the Waves, and reconcile their long eſtrang'd Parts to their ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity; where they ſhall fall into their primitive Order and Situation, after the ſeparation, in ſome, for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Years. Tho' ſome among ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations, either out of a wild and ſalvage Barbarity, or out of the moſt preſſing neceſſity, (of which we have a mournful Inſtance in the Siege of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. v. 26.</note> in Scripture,) ſeem, if it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to diſappoint a Reſurrection of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Bodies, by making them the Nouriſhment of their own; yet God who knows where all thoſe Particles abide, which ever did belong to any Man's Body, can call them from their ſecret Repoſitories, to compleat the Body made imperfect by this unnatural Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, in order to be enliven'd by the Soul.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God can command the Soul back to its ancient abode, call it from Bliſs or Woe, to reſume its former Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62708:108"/>
ſo that <hi>theſe dry Bones</hi> ſhall <hi>live,</hi> and become the ſame Man they were before their Diſſolution. And this muſt appear very eaſy: for the Soul loſes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the ſeparation from the Body, as the Body does by being parted from the Soul. This piece of Divinity within us owes no homage to the Elements, nor is liable to be chang'd as they are. As to the Souls of the Bleſſed, they pay a conſtant attendance before the Throne of Grace, and are always expecting the joyful Command, by which they are oblig'd to a re-union. And as to the Souls of the Unhappy, they ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unwillingly to re-inſpire their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome Manſions, to animate once more thoſe Parts, which, as in tortur'd Men, are only new ſet and compacted to be tormented a new. As there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Body, which carries the appearance of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, ſo</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is in it ſelf very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and ſuitable to the Rules of true Reaſon. The ancient <hi>Apologiſts</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity defending it againſt the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> uſually ſhew'd the probability of a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> from ſome Parallels in the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62708:108"/>
Works of Nature. Thus the <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> Springs riſing ſo gloriouſly from the Winter, and the Day from the Night, the moſt beautiful Offsprings from the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd Parents, were by their pious Rhetorick exalted into ſome kinds of Proofs, as well as Types of the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> But theſe are not ſo much Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of, as handſom Alluſions to this great Truth, in order to take off that Contempt with which the <hi>Heathens</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd this new and ſurprizing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. Tho' the order of Effects and Changes in Nature, furniſh us not with any thing which may make the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> probable; yet the juſt view of the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, as it is diſcover'd by the Light of Reaſon, will make it appear very ſuitable to it. For tho' it is not agreeable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, to raiſe up Mankind, only to make them capable of acting over again all that ſcene of Folly, Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature, Vanity and Vice, which they live obnoxious to now; yet to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them back to a Life which is truly heavenly, glorious and happy, in which they are made fit for ſo glorious a Being as God Himſelf, to take delight
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62708:109"/>
in, is a deſign worthy a wiſe and good Creator, who certainly made Man for ſome nobler Ends, than what he can arrive to in this State of Mortality. The chief deſign (as ſeems evident to the Light of Nature it ſelf) for God to create Man, was to communicate his own Goodneſs, and to preſentiate an order of Objects to himſelf, which bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Image, and being endued with Reaſon, might ſtill glorify his Name, and yield him back ſome faint Reflexion of Himſelf. If ſo, ſince God <hi>Is</hi> to all Eternity, why ſhould he not deſire a Preſentiation of theſe Objects to all Eternity? Why ſhould he not be willing to be glorify'd, and to have this ſort of Reflexion of Himſelf made back to all Eternity? And ſince God has laid the Laws of Morality and Religion on the Body, as well as on the Soul; ſince that is oblig'd to Purity and an humble Adoration, as well as this to Virtues peculiar to its Nature; why ſhould God be fancy'd, to be ſo wholly taken up with this, as not in the leaſt to be concern'd for that? Why ſhould he change the State of the Bleſſed, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them of that, which properly makes
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62708:109"/>
up their Humanity, by refining them into a pure Spirit? As the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is thus probable, ſo is it</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Upon the proſpects of the Divine Promiſes and Predictions cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and (beyond all queſtion) firm. It was obſcurely predicted ever ſince the very Fall of Man, and darkly imply'd in the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who was to be a Redeemer of the Body, as well as of the Soul. As the firſt Man was made with all the Perfections due to his Body as well as to his Soul; ſo he who ſhould repair what Man loſt by his Fall, muſt reſtore him the Excellencies of that, as well as of this. And tho' the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Reſurrection to the <hi>Jews,</hi> was not ſo clear as to put it beyond all doubt, and to make it a ſtrict Article of Faith; yet are there ſeveral Texts in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which are manifeſt Alluſions to it, and tacit Proofs of it. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> introduces God ſpeaking: <hi>See now, that I, even I, am He; I kill and I make alive.</hi> And thus <hi>Iſaiah</hi> with his uſual height of Language: <hi>Thy Dead ſhall live, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my dead Body ſhall they ariſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and ſing ye that dwell in the Duſt; for thy Dew is as the Dew of Herbs, and the</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:62708:110"/>
                  <hi>Earth ſhall caſt out the Dead.</hi> To which may be ſubjoin'd that remarkable place of <hi>Job: Though after my Skin Worms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this Body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God; whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and my eyes ſhall behold, and not another.</hi> Tho' the excellent <hi>Grotius</hi> applies theſe Words to his Temporal reſtitution, or at moſt to diſcover his Expectation of a future State alone; yet they ſeem at leaſt to allude to the Hopes which he had of a <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> As to that place which our Saviour quotes from <hi>Exodus, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob;</hi> they appear only in general to prove the Immortality of the Soul, and to ſhew that theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs were not in a State of Annihil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; tho' with particular regard to the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> againſt whom they were urg'd, they are a juſt and matchleſs Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for a <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> For they ſcrupled only the Immortality of the Soul; and if they could conceive that the Soul could exiſt independent of the Body, they could grant that it might be re-united to it. For they were of the ſame Opinion in that Age, which the followers of <hi>Spinoſa</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:62708:110"/>
maintain in ours, That what <hi>Is,</hi> is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, excepting God alone: in which fundamental Point of Natural Religion, of God's being a Spirit, thoſe ancient <hi>Scepticks</hi> were much more Orthodox than our modern ones. But how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure ſoever the Doctrin of the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> might be under the Revelation of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> yet under the <hi>New</hi> this Article is deliver'd with all the light and demonſtrative force imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The whole ſtreſs of the Goſpel is, as it were, repos'd upon it; and becauſe it look'd ſtrange and ſurprizing to the unbelieving World, it is enforc'd with greater Arguments, repeated with more frequency. To mention only one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable place of our Saviour's: <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel not at this, for the hour is coming in which all that are in their Graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth; they that have done Good unto the Reſurrection of Life, and they that have done Evil unto the Reſurrection of Damnation.</hi> As this was a conſiderable part of our Saviour's Preaching, ſo he confirm'd it by his own Example, by riſing from the Dead himſelf, and ſo by virtually raiſing thoſe which are his. For, <hi>If the Spirit of</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:62708:111"/>
                  <hi>him which rais'd Chriſt from the Dead dwell in us, he that rais'd Chriſt from the Dead, ſhall alſo quicken our mortal Bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in us.</hi> So that a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Body is not only poſſible and highly probable, but upon the proſpects of the Divine Promiſes and Predictions certain. As there ſhall thus be a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Body, ſo</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Reſurrection</hi> ſhall be of the Body only.</p>
               <p>And this Reſtriction is neceſſary to the overthrowing of an Opinion, That the Souls of Men periſh with their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but yet ſo, that both ſhould be rais'd again at the laſt Day; That they ſhould both ſleep in Darkneſs, till the laſt Alarm, and ſhould both riſe again at the finiſhing of all Things. This Opinion was firſt ſtarted by ſome <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Biſhops, (as we are inform'd by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus,</hi>) and has been more vigorouſly in later times defended by great Pretenders to Reaſon.

And it may perhaps be enquir'd, Whether the ingenious <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of late, which have ſeem'd to level the diſtinction between diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Species of Subſtance, and ſo to break down the Boundaries between Spirit and Body, have not help'd to abet this Opinion. But to reply to this Fancy concerning the <hi>Sleep of the Soul:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In our Saviour's account of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Fates of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the Rich Man, we find that the former was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately convey'd to Bliſs, and the latter to Miſery. And granting that this is only a <hi>Parable,</hi> or general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, (yet that it was an Hiſtory of things truly tranſacted, is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62708:112"/>
of <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ambroſ.</hi> in <hi>Luc. Ier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull.</hi> lib. 4. <hi>contra</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. <hi>Hilar. Enarrat. in Pſalm.</hi>
                  </note> ſeveral of extraordinary Note;) yet the main deſign of it muſt be founded upon the Nature of Things, and muſt ſhew that the diſtance is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſmall, between the Soul's quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Body, and its being tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to its final State. Thus the Penitent Thief, who was Crucify'd with our Saviour, aſcends forthwith after his Death, from the Pains and Tortures of the Croſs, to the Joys of Paradiſe. This <hi>Sleep,</hi> or Reſt of the Soul, is chiefly grounded upon that uſual Metaphor in Holy Writ, by which Death is reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to <hi>Sleep.</hi> But the Scripture does not apply it to the Soul, but the Body reſting in the Grave, that it may be awaken'd to a Reſurrection. For this would be wholly inconſiſtent with the Apoſtle's Aſſertion, where he ſays, that <hi>While we are at home in the Body, we are abſent from the Lord;</hi> and that <hi>ſo ſoon as we are departed out of the Body, we ſhall be preſent with the Lord.</hi> For <hi>to be with the Lord,</hi> muſt imply a ſtate of Felicity, which Sleep is not, but only of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity; and the Apoſtle's Argument would loſe its force, and would be no encouragement againſt the Terrours of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62708:112"/>
Death, if ſo ſoon as we are dead, we ſhould fall aſleep, ſink into a Condition of Inſenſibility, and till the <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Be, as if we were not at all. The Soul therefore is not rais'd with the Body, but is call'd from a ſtate of Bliſs or Woe, to which it was remov'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon its ſeparation from it, to reſume its ancient Manſion.

This method of Diſcourſe ſeems juſt and true, notwithſtanding

               </head>
               <p>IN order to endeavour to give ſome Check to the prevailing Humour of <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> which is become ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Modiſh, that no Perſon can be that ſelf-admir'd thing, a <hi>Wit,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; I ſhall,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> (as is moſt natural,) propoſe a ſhort view of ſome of thoſe <hi>pretended</hi> Reaſons, which the <hi>Scepticks</hi> and <hi>Deiſts,</hi> and others of the ſame Order, uſually give for their <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> and Doubts about the Truths of Religion. To every one of which I ſhall return a tranſient Reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall take a ſhort ſurvey
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62708:116"/>
of the <hi>true</hi> Reaſons and Motives, which make Men <hi>Scepticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>pretended</hi> Reaſons are ſuch as theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, They believe Religion to be falſe, becauſe many who make great ſhews of being Chriſtians, are only ſuch out of Intereſt, and in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood would change the Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion for another, which would be more ſerviceable for their Deſigns.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They have an ill Opinion of Religion, becauſe many who are zealous for its <hi>Truths,</hi> are yet negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the <hi>Morals</hi> of it, and live after ſuch a manner, as would make a ſober Heathen bluſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They deſpiſe Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſeveral Profeſſors of it, embrace it not out of Reaſon or Conviction, but out of a ſupine Credulity, and walk blindly on in the Chriſtian Religion, only becauſe it is the Worſhip of their Country.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They entertain a low Idea of Chriſtianity, becauſe, tho' ſaid to be reveal'd for the good of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet God has only propagated it
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62708:116"/>
in a ſmall part of the World; and even where it has been promulg'd, it is found but an indifferent Expedient to work any ſuch extraordinary Effects on Mens Minds, as might be expected from a Religion, which God Himſelf came down from Heaven to preach, and to ſeal with his Blood.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That the Diviſions amongſt ſingle Chriſtians, and the Wars and Diſcords between Chriſtian Princes and Commonwealths, often heightned by Religious Controverſies, and inflam'd by the violent Harangues of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick Perſons, are great Prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtian Religion, and give a Moral <hi>Deiſt</hi> great Advantage over a Zealot for Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Theſe have been, and ſtill are, ſome of the leading Forces in the Van of <hi>Scepticiſm.</hi> There are indeed many particular Objections laid againſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar parts of Chriſtianity, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall within the compaſs of this ſhort ESSAY. But to return a curſory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to each one of theſe Objections.</p>
               <p>Firſt, 'Tis no juſt Reflection upon the Religion, That many, who make great ſhews of being Chriſtians, are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62708:117"/>
only ſuch out of Intereſt, and in all probability would change the Chriſtian Profeſſion for another, which would be more ſerviceable for their deſigns. Tho' ſome may be Chriſtians at preſent out of Intereſt, yet if we enquire into the firſt Inſtitution of our Religion, we ſhall find, that it was its intrinſick Worth which firſt recommended it to the World, when there was no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motive or Intereſt to make it taking. For did the Apoſtles and firſt Diſciples of our Saviour, turn Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans upon any temporal Proſpect? Or what Advantage could thoſe who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them, for the two firſt Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, propoſe? What could they gain by this new Profeſſion, but Diſgrace, Impriſonment and Death? And can any one be a Platonick lover of Shame and Pain, and court Miſery for its own ſake alone? Now theſe purer Times, nigheſt to the origin of our Religion, are thoſe which our Adverſaries ought to have enquir'd into, and level'd their Objections againſt; otherwiſe their Arguments only wound the preſent Profeſſors of Religion, many of which we own to live below the dignity of it,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62708:117"/>
but fall far ſhort of doing any injury to Religion it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Sceptick</hi> ought not to have an ill Opinion of Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many who are zealous for its <hi>Truths,</hi> are yet negligent of the <hi>Morals</hi> of it; and live after ſuch a manner, as would make a ſober <hi>Heathen</hi> bluſh. Firſt, becauſe the Chriſtian Religion is only a Law for our Actions, which can invite and perſwade alone, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not force an Obſervance. And the ill Actions of Chriſtians ought no more to be imputed to Chriſtianity it ſelf, than the Diſorders of any Perſons, who live under Civil or Municipal Laws, ought to be charg'd upon thoſe Laws. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Tho' theſe Perſons Lives are an open contradiction to Chriſtianity, yet it does not follow, but that they may be convinc'd of the Truth of it in their Minds and Underſtandings. For we may eaſily ſee, that Men are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways determin'd by the dictates of their Reaſon, but frequently by the biaſs and reliſh of their Senſes and Paſſions. Nor can we conclude, that becauſe Perſons live as if Chriſtianity was an Impoſture, that therefore they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62708:118"/>
are fully perſwaded that it is ſo. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we find that they have often Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſes and ſad Reflections on their Actions, which can only riſe in Minds ſatisfy'd of the Truth of that, againſt which they practiſe. For only the fear of being call'd to Account <hi>hereafter,</hi> can make us ſorrowful and amaz'd for having done amiſs <hi>here,</hi> under temporal Impunity. Thirdly, <hi>Morality, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> and the nobleſt Inſtitutions which ever were, lie under the ſame blemiſh with Chriſtianity. For the Lives of their Profeſſors have ſeldom anſwer'd their refin'd Rules. And it is ſcarce poſſible that they ſhould do ſo, till Man is ſubtiliz'd into a pure Spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued from thoſe Paſſions and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which at preſent checquer and diſcolour our Natures. As to the Zeal of theſe Perſons, it is falſe and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, if their Actions are not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their great Pretenſions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, 'Tis no juſt Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtianity, That ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it, embrace it not out of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Conviction, but out of a ſupine Credulity, and walk blindly on in the Chriſtian Religion, only becauſe it is
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62708:118"/>
the Worſhip of their Country. For the Chriſtian Religion does not demand any ſuch credulous Temper of Mind from its Profeſſors. All that it requires is, an Underſtanding free from Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and which is ready to pay atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Reaſon. Our Saviour at the Eſtabliſhment of this Religion, did not deſire to be believ'd on his own Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: <hi>If I bear witneſs of my ſelf,</hi> ſays he, <hi>my witneſs is not true.</hi> He appeals to his Miracles, as the moſt glorious Credentials of his Celeſtial Miſſion; for <hi>the Works which the Father</hi> had <hi>given</hi> him <hi>to finiſh, the ſame Works that he</hi> did <hi>bore witneſs of</hi> him, <hi>that the Father</hi> had ſent him. Theſe Miracles he propoſes to the Examination of the Spectators, and if they could diſcover any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture in them, that they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the power of Nature, or of Magick, (as was <note n="*" place="margin">

He does not fix the guilt of Unbelief purely in the <hi>Jews</hi> rejecting his Religion, but in refuſing to pay an Aſſent to it, after that it was made ſuitable to Reaſon, prov'd out of the Prophecies of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſupported by Miracles greater
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62708:119"/>
than every thing, but their Infidelity. <hi>If I had not done among them Works which none other man did, they had not had ſin; but now have they both ſeen and hated me and my Father.</hi> As our Saviour, ſo his Apoſtles addreſt to the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of their Followers, in order to excite their <hi>Faiths.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul: Prove all things; hold faſt that which is good.</hi> And that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, which our Saviour lov'd after a moſt paſſionate manner, adviſes the Church, <hi>Not to believe every Spirit, but to try the Spirits, whether they are of God.</hi> So that the Chriſtian Faith does not conſiſt in an implicit Credulity, and blind Aſſent; but in a well-founded and rational Belief, ariſing from juſt Information, and exact Reaſoning on Things. The <hi>ſaving</hi> Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion indeed are few, and lie in a ſmall Compaſs, though not within ſo little Bounds as the Author of <hi>The Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Chriſtianity,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hobbes</hi> de <hi>Civ. Relig</hi> p. 386. <hi>&amp;c. par 6. &amp;c. Dico autem, alium Arti culum Fidei praeter hunc</hi> JESUM HSSH CHRIST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>UM <hi>hommi Chriſtiano, ut neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ad ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, requiri nullum,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> contend for. And tho' every one ought to give the true Reaſons for his Belief, yet the <hi>Saving Truths</hi> of Religion in many illiterate Perſons, if attended with a Moral Life, Humility of Spirit, and Fervency of Devotion, may be as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62708:119"/>
to God, as in the moſt eminent Critick in Theological Matters, who can give the niceſt Reſolution for every thing relating to them. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, every one is oblig'd (as far as lies in his power) to examin and try the Articles of his Religion; and to be a Chriſtian, not by Education, Cuſtom or Example, but by Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. So far is Religion (that is, the Reform'd Religion, ſuch as was taught by our Saviour and his Apoſtles) from encouraging a ſupine Credulity, or blind Belief.</p>
               <p>Nor is the <hi>Sceptick</hi>'s Fourth Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on valid, That Chriſtianity has been propagated by God only in a ſmall part of the World; and even where it has been promulg'd, it is found but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Expedient to work any ſuch extraordinary Effects on Men's Minds, as might be expected from a Religion, which God himſelf came down from Heaven to preach, and to ſeal with his Blood.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt part, That Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is only known to a ſmall part of the World; it may be reply'd: Firſt, That tho' God has been graciouſly pleas'd to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62708:120"/>
promiſe, that he will by his good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo order things, that <hi>the ſound of the Goſpel</hi> ſhall be <hi>heard</hi> in the <hi>uttermoſt parts</hi> of the Earth; yet has he not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited the Time when it ſhall thus be univerſally promulg'd Secondly, That it is the fault, in ſome meaſure, of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians themſelves, why their Religion is not diffus'd among the unconverted Nations; becauſe Voyages to theſe barbarous Climes, are only undertaken upon Motives of Intereſt, or Proſpects of Commerce, without any deſign to promote the Truths of Religion. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Chriſtian Religion has been communicated to almoſt all the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd World. Moſt of the Territories of the four famous Empires have had the Goſpel preach'd amongſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other Parts more lately diſcover'd. While good Morals and Humanity, while Humility, Chaſtity, Honour and Probity flouriſh'd; ſo long the Chriſtian Religion continued: but when theſe were de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ac'd by Violence, Ambition, Pride, Luſt and Ill-nature, it was time for Religion to take her flight up to Heaven, or to ſome more hoſpitable Regions upon Earth. For how could
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62708:120"/>
ſhe ſubſiſt, when her foundation (Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality) was remov'd? Fourthly, As to thoſe places where the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has not been heard of, God will deal with them as a God of Mercy.

               <p>As to the ſecond part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, That even where Chriſtianity has been promulg'd, it is found but an indifferent Expedient, to work any extraordinary Effect on Men's Minds; it may be anſwer'd, That it is purely Satyr and Invective, and is plainly void of Truth. For tho' it muſt be with confuſion own'd, that many Chriſtians are guilty of Vices, which would make an ingenuous Heathen bluſh; yet the Eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity has given a total defeat to many National and Publick Crimes. Amongſt many Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd Nations (as is plain from their own Poets and Hiſtorians,) Parents might expoſe their Children, and Maſters mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Slaves, with Impunity, and without any dread of being call'd in queſtion.

                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:62708:122"/>We cannot deny, but Chriſtianity ill underſtood, has been the innocent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of publick Diviſions, and private Diſcords; the moſt beautiful Parent of ill-reſembling Children. The Goſpel has arm'd Nations to their own ruin, and the Pulpit has given the ſignal for very unnatural Wars. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, Religion it ſelf ought not to be blam'd. For, firſt, The Founder of this Religion predicted that ſuch a diſmal Event ſhould attend his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Think not, that I am come to ſend Peace on Earth: I came not to ſend Peace, but a Sword.</hi> Secondly, It was not the deſign of Chriſtianity, to cheriſh Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Diſcords amongſt its Followers.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62708:123"/>
muſt be believ'd, but what can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>true</hi> Cauſe of <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> is <hi>Prejudice,</hi> or a raſh Judgment made upon Religion. For not only the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but ſome who have been initiated into Chriſtianity, frame falſe Idea's of it. They are too much <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd</hi> to believe, that God will puniſh Crimes of finite duration with infinite Pain. They fancy that there is reaſon to hope, that he may releaſe his Threats, and ſome way mitigate the Penalty: that it is a ſervile and mercenary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to engage us to Obedience, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing to our Fears, by propoſing Proſpects of eternal Miſery. But theſe Objections riſing from <hi>Prejudice,</hi> would be eaſily remov'd, if the <hi>Sceptick</hi> would conſider, that God does not puniſh Men for Sins which they could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void; not for ſingle Acts, but inveterate Habits, and final Obſtinacy. That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, if ſincere, takes off the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Guilt. That he gives us Grace to ſhun Sin, and Grace to repent of it. That Hope and Fear are the fitteſt Paſſions, by which a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be acted upon. That every
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62708:123"/>
Sin is againſt infinite Majeſty, an Act too of our own Choice. That God would be wanting, in promoting the Obſervance of his Laws, if he did not make the greateſt Puniſhment due to the Violation of them. That he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes eternal Happineſs to Obedience, as well as threatens everlaſting Miſery upon Diſobedience.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>true</hi> Cauſe of <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> is a <hi>Diſpoſition of Heart</hi> contrary to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For a Soul ſtain'd with Vice can never comply with the Truths of Religion. The Will and Affections muſt firſt be purify'd, before the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding can be enlightned. Hence our Saviour endeavours to plant the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence even of Children in the Minds of his Followers, before he propoſes the great Myſteries of Religion. Happy are they who have preſerv'd their Innocence unſtain'd, and whoſe Soul has never loſt its native Candour. The firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of Religion will ſtrike upon ſuch Minds as theſe, with the moſt vigorous Light, and will convince them, as ſoon as addreſt to them. But to Spirits ſunk into a ſtate of Sin, Religion appears upon a diſadvantage, and like an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62708:124"/>
ſtriking upon a diſorder'd Organ, forms an irregular Impreſſion. Let the Wings of the Soul once be diſengag'd from the <hi>weight</hi> of Sin, as the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> (as well as Scripture) neatly ſtile it, and it will fly up to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as to its proper Center.</p>
               <p>The fourth Cauſe of <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> is the <hi>prevailing Humour</hi> of <hi>turning every thing into Ridicule.</hi> Nor are ſacred Things themſelves exempted; which takes off that Veneration which is due to them, and makes them look firſt contemptible, and afterwards falſe.</p>
               <p>The fifth <hi>true</hi> Cauſe of <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> (and the laſt which I ſhall mention,) is <hi>want of Conſideration</hi> or <hi>Attention.</hi> For if Men either think not at all, or not regularly, or employ their Thoughts in other curious Speculations, they will of neceſſity continue <hi>Scepticks.</hi> But the fault is in themſelves, not in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: they can no more complain of Obſcurity in that, than thoſe who have wilfully clos'd their own Eyes, of want of Light in the Heavenly Luminaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:62708:124"/>Let the <hi>Sceptick</hi> take away theſe <hi>true Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> and the <hi>pretended</hi> ones will vaniſh of their own accord. But while theſe remain, they are like to continue <hi>Scepticks,</hi> till the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a future State ſhal not only make them <hi>underſtand,</hi> but even <hi>feel</hi> that Religion is True.</p>
