            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Nowe to proue that these bee the ordinaunces of God, we haue by goddes word bothe in the olde testamente and in the newe, their names rehearsed, theyr offices dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, and theyr duties commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

            <p>Truthe it is, that the Apostles had all thynges comen, yea and that christen men, in that they are christen men rather then couetous men, haue all thynges comen, euen vnto thys day.

ryche menne shoulde kepe to theym selues no more then they nede, and geue vnto the poore so muche as they nede. For so Paule wryteth to the Corinthes.

And so dyd the Apostles take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as appeareth in the fourth of the actes. <hi>Quotquot habebant agros et possessiones. etc.</hi> As many as hadde landes and possessions dyd sell them, and broughte the prices vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the feete of the Apostles, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision was made vnto euerye one accordinge vnto euerye mannes neede. So they whyche myght spare dydde frelye geue, and they whiche hadde nede dyd thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receyue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21134:11"/>For so is it mete, that christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> mens goodes shuld be comen vnto euery mans nede, &amp; priuate to no mans luste.

                  </gap> regnare propter peccata populi.</hi> It is God, as the scripture in the .xxxiiii. of Iob doth testifye, whych maketh an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritie to be a ruler for the synnes of the people. Nowe the people of the countrey vse to saye, that their gentlemen and officers were neuer so full of fayre woordes and euyll dedes (whych is hypocrisy) as they nowe be. For a gentleman wyl saye that he loueth his tenaunt as well as hys father dyd, but he kepeth not so good a house to make them chere as hys father dyd, and yet he taketh mo fynes, &amp; greater rentes to make them neadye, then hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hadde.</p>
            <p>Another wyll say that he would bye a Lordshyppe of the kyng, for
<pb facs="tcp:21134:19"/>
the loue that he hath to the tenaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes thereof, but assone as he hathe boughte it, by takynge of fynes, heyghnyng of rentes, and sellyng away of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>modities, he maketh the same tenantes pay for it. Another sayth that he would haue an office to do good in hys contrey, but as sone as he hath authoritie to take the fee to hym selfe, he setteth hys seruaunte to do hys duetye, and in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stede of wages he geueth them au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to lyue of pyllage, brybry and extorcion in the countrey.</p>
            <p>Now you of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trey, marke your lesso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> I saye, and take it home wyth you. It is God that maketh these euyl men to be gentlemen ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and officers in the countrey: it is the sinnes of the people that cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seth God to make these men youre rulers. The man is sometymes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll, but the authoritie from God is alwayes good, and God geueth
<pb facs="tcp:21134:19"/>
good authoritye vnto euyll men, to punyshe the synnes of the euyll people. It is not therefore repy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, rebellyng, or resistyng gods ordinance, that wyll amende euyll rulers. For Paule sayeth, that all powers be of goddes ordinaunce. And in Iob it is playne, that euyll menne bee made rulers by God: So that who soeuer resysteth the offycers, be the menne neuer so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl that be in office, he resisteth the ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of God, he can not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle againste God, but surely he shall be plaged of God. And as the people can haue no remedye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst euyll rulers by rebellyon, so can the rulers haue no redresse of rebellious people by oppressyon. Example of bothe we haue in the thyrd booke of the Kynges, where as it appeareth that Roboam lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng good counsell to vse the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wyth gentlenes and folowyng
<pb facs="tcp:21134:20"/>
euyll counsell to kepe them vnder by extremytye, dyd so exasperate and styrre vp the hertes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple against him beyng their kyng, that ten partes of them dyd by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious rebellion, burste oute from hym, and were neuer after subiecte vnto hym, nor to none of his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And those rebellious people by Ieroboam whom they them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues chose to be their kynge, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the captayne of theyr rebelly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were brought into farre worse case and more myserye then euer they were afore, compelled to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake God, and to vse Idolatrye, and were euer after plaged wyth sodeyne deathe, honger, dearthe, warres, captyuytie, and all kynde of myserye.</p>
            <p>Learne therefore ye people if ye inforce to ease your selues, wheras ye imagine that ye be euyll entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of men, be ye sure that ye shall
<pb facs="tcp:21134:20"/>
fele in deede that ye shall be more greuouslye afflycted by the ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of God. And learne ye ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers if ye intende by onely suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to kepe vnder rebellion, be ye sure if ye thruste it downe in one place it wyll braste out wyth more vyolence and greater daunger in ten other places, to the further dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietynge of you beynge rulars, and to the vtter destruccyon of all youre people beynge rebelles. Heare ye people what God sayeth by those people that wyll not be in subieccion, because they thynke the men to be euyl whiche be in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye. Yea harke what the Lord sayeth as concernynge the proude, ambycyouse, and vncyrcumcysed Kynge Nabugodonozer whyche was an euyll manne in dede, in the twentie and seuen Chapter of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remye. <hi>Gens et regnum. et cetera.</hi>

That people and realme that doth not serue Nabugodonezer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinge of Babilon, and whosoeuer put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not his necke vnder the yocke of Nabugodnozer the kynge of Babilon, I (sayeth the Lorde) wyl viset vpon that people in sweard, honger, and in pestylence. And in the .xxvii. of the same Prophete. <hi>Catenas ligneas contriuisti, et facies pro e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is ferreas.</hi> Thou hast broken the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of wood, and shalt make for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> fetters of yron. By the whiche he declareth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as a prysoner in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pynge of a gayler, if he breake hys fetters of wood, shall not therefore by the gayler be set at lybertye, but rather cheyned wyth more stronge fetters of yron: Euen so, people be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ynge in the kepyng of God, if they by rebellyon breake their yocke of subieccion, whych they nowe haue, shall not therfore by God be putte at libertie, but rather be thruste in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:21134:21"/>
a more straite, greuous, &amp; stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger yocke, where they shall be sure neuer to haue libertie nor ease. Wherfore ye people, if ye fele your burden is heauye, and youre yocke greuouse, pacyently suffer, and call vnto the Lorde: for then he wyll heare thee, and he wyl relieue thee, and he wyll delyuer thee.</p>
            <p>And you rulers, because ye knowe that the people oughte not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake or refuse what burden or yoke so euer ye charge them wyth all, see that ye charge them with no more then they maye beare and suffer. For if they cry vnto you for reliefe and easemente, and you wyll not regarde theyr sorowes, but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynynge that they be to wealthy, ye wyll encrease their miserye, and decay their wealthe, as Pharao, and Roboam did: Well then, if the examples of Pharao and Robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am wyll not suffyce you, marcke

And to resyste ryghte by myghte, so that thou wylte not be subiecte in humylitye, vnto those powers whyche God by hys righte hath set ouer the in authoritye is a greate euell, and therefore a greate matter of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>science.

            <p>Dauid knowynge Saule the kyng to be a wycked man and hys deadly enemy, and hauyng Saule in a denne, where as if he would, he myght haue kylled hym: this Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid hadde a good conscience not to touche the lordes anointed, to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Saule to be kynge and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte hym selfe. Daniel was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded not to praye to God: the Apostles were commaunded not to preache gods worde. These dyd not rebell against the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

no nor yet for conscience obey men, but rather they obeyed God. For Daniell did praye, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles dyd preache. So ryse not, rebell not, resiste not, what soeuer the rulers them selues do: And be ye not so scrupulous as to thynke the bond in conscience vnto euerye thing that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> beyng a ruler com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundeth the to do it especiallye, if God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maund the contrary.

Pau. i. vnto the Cor. xi. <hi>Vnus panis unu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> corpus multi sumus:</hi> One bred say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he one body we are y<hi rend="sup">â€¢</hi> be many: by the whiche he declareth that as of diuers cornes of wheate by the liquor of water knode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> into dough

is made one loafe of breade: so we being diuerse men, by loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie, whyche is the liquor of lyfe, ioyned into one congregacion, be made as dyuers members of one misticall body of Christe, where by I say, as by one example in the stede of many, learne that the more gorgeous you youre selues bee in silkes &amp; veluettes, the more shame is it for you to see other poore and neady, beyng members of the same bodye, in ragges and clothe, yea bare and naked.</p>
            <p>Doest thou not thynke them to be members of the same bodye that thou arte? Then arte not thou a member of Christe, then arte not thou a chylde of God, then art no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Euen as ye do prouide indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentlye for euery parte of youre naturall bodye, by reason of the which, ye are bounde, and subiecte to corruption: So let no parte or member of youre Christen bodye be vnprouyded for: By reason of the whyche bodye, ye be heyres of the heauenly kyngdome.

               </gap>ume, fere, honor. Of these iiii. wordes wil I conclude almost in .iiii. wordes. Ye must gyue try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
<pb facs="tcp:21134:35"/>
to whome trybute is due: cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, to whome custome is due: feare, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> feare is due: honour, to whome honoure is due. Under trybute be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>teined taxes, fiftenth, subsides, and suche as be payed at sometymes to the Rulers, and be not continuall. Customes be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, tolles, rentes, and such as the people paye vnto the officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. For payinge of trybute besydes thys commaundemente of Paule, we haue exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ple of Christes mother, whych beyng at the houre of her trauell went out of Galyle vnto Bethlem, a toune in Iewry, there to be taxed, and pay trybute vnto Cesar.</p>
            <p>As concernyng custome, Christ hymselfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maunded Peter to pay for them both, lest that they shulde offend: that is, lest that they, in not paying, shuld geue euyll example vnto the people. So Christen men
<pb facs="tcp:21134:36"/>
must nedes paye both trybute and custome. What trybute and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome good men may take, it appe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth in that that goeth afore: sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye euen so muche and no more as shall sufficientlye dyscharge their costes, necessaryly bestowed in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectynge of euyll, and rewardyng good. Marke that I say they may or ought to take no more: for here I tell them their duty. For truly if they do requyre more of you that be their subiectes, then is it youre duty to pay that whiche they aske, and not to be curyous to know for what cause it is asked, but this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to take hede that with due reue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rence ye pay it, as Paule co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and as Christe and hys mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue geuen you exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ple. Feare and honoure belonge chieflye, yea in a manner onely vnto God. For God onely for hym selfe is to be feared and honoured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21134:36"/>All other for gods cause, are so to be feared and honoured: as that feare and honoure which is geuen vnto them, may procede and come finally vnto God. For, <hi>dominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um tuum adorabis et illum solum coles.</hi> Thou shalte honoure the Lorde thy God, and hym only shalt thou reuerentlye serue. As for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll, feare hym not, for he wyll doo no lesse harme vnto thee then he canne: he canne do no more then God wyll suffer hym. Feare ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leste that thou offende God, and he sufferre the Deuyll to vtter hys malyce, and myschyefe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes thee.</p>
            <p>That feare, honoure, or seruice whyche accordynge to goddes com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundemente is done vnto those personnes whom God hath autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rysed to receyue it in hys name, is done vnto God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21134:37"/>As that money whych by thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente is payde to thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t in thy name, is paid vnto the. Therefore Christe rulynge in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates by authorytye, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge houngrye and coulde in the poore by pytye, doeth commaunde vs to geue, and promyseth that he hym selfe wyll receyue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde that honoure of reuerence, seruyce and obedyence doone to the hygher powers, as to hys ordinaunce in the common welath: and also that honour of charitable almes, relyefe, and conforte, whych is bestowed vpon the poore and neady, as vpon the lyuely mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his owne body. As for that whych wythout goddes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, of mans phantasticall ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginacion is doone vnto Images, must nedes be hyghe dyshonoure, &amp; greuous displeasure vnto God, when as the lyuely ymage of God

            <p>God is also honoured in all hys creatures, when as they be taken wyth thankes, and vsed as he hath commaunded: and therfore, when as they be vnthankfully taken, or wyckedly abused, then is he disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and displeased.</p>
            <p>Nowe, heare a short conclusion, <hi>Qui ex deo est, uerbum dei audit</hi>: He that is of God, heareth the worde of God. All you I saye that be Christen men, Gods chyldren, and indued wyth Goddes spiryte, wyll heare the worde of Gods threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, and fearyng hys vengeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce, repent, wyll heare the woorde of gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maundement, and folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng his counsels amende your ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, wyl heare the worde of Gods

promyse, and paciently sufferynge, trust to hys goodnes. As for you that wyll not heare and regarde goddes worde, ye declare your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues not to be of God. But for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye haue the deuyl to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ye wyll fulfyll the lustes and desyres of the Deuyll, whyche is your father. And the luste and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the Deuyll is, to hynder the worcke and pleasure of God: and thys is the worke and wyll of God, that we should repose oure faythe and truste in Christe Iesu, and bestowe oure laboure and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in our owne vocacyon.
