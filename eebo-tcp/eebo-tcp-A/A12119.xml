            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE men are brought forth vpon the earth for good ends, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallest of which is the glory of God, and then to better the world; in which many haue had bands, either of necessity, or other occupations, to haue lesse experience by their knowledge: I thinke, I should migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily erre, if I should not deliuer as well to others, what I haue seene and learned by my passing so many, and so strange countries; as I should haue done, if had not giuen my time and the expence of it to the first end, which was, and is, God his great glory.</p>
            <p>In my first yeares, my friends bestowed on mee those learnings which were fit for a Gentlemans ornament, without directing them to an occupation; and when they were fit for agible things, they bestowed them and me on my Princes seruice, in which I ran many courses, of diuers fortunes, according to the condition of the warres, in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17801:6"/>
which, as I was most exercised, so was I most subiect to accidents: With what opinion I carried my selfe (since the causes of good or ill must be in my selfe, and that a thing without my selfe) I leaue it to them to speake; my places yet in authority, in those occasions were euer of the best; in which, if I committed errour it was contrary to my will, and a weakenesse in my iudgement; which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, I euer industriated my selfe to make perfect, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting my owne ouer-sights by the most vertuous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples I could make choise of: Amongst which, as there was not a Subiect of more worthinesse and vertue, for such examples to grow from, then the euer-liuing in honour, and condigne estimation the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> as my reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and regard to his rare qualities was exceeding; so I desired (as much as my humility might answere, with such an eminency) to make him the patterne of my ciuill life, and from him to draw a worthy modell of all my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And as my true loue to him, did transforme me from my many imperfections, to bee, as it were, an imitator of his vertues; so his affection was such to mee, that hee was not onely contended, I should do so, but in the true Noblenesse of his minde gaue me liberally the best trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his mind in counselling mee; his fortune to helpe mee forward; and his very care to beare mee vp in all those courses, which might giue honour to my selfe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the name of his friend: in so much, that after many actions, into which, peraduenture, he prouoked my owne slackenesse, The Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> dying, and leauing <hi>Don Cesare D'Este</hi> Inheritor of that Principality, who by his birth could, indeed, challenge nothing iustly, being a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard; notwithstanding, in the worlds opinion hee was most likely to haue bene established in that succession, through the long continuance of the gouernment in that name; and the Princes of that name, hauing euer through
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17801:6"/>
their temperate and iust condition of Ruling, wouen themselues into a sincere affection of that people: which was well proued, by that great league made against it in former time by the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> frustrated by the true deuotion of those Subiects to their Prince; besides, the great expectation, which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally had of that <hi>Don Cesare,</hi> and the extreme bondage of the gouernment of the Church, which those that haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in another quality do vtterly abhorre. Which that excellent Earle also considering, and besides (hauing no thought in him euer separated from those circumstances, which might bring to an happy end his infinite desire of her Maiesties Honour, Seruice, and prosperous good of his Country,) iudging that the <hi>Pope</hi> would not giue his claime vnto the Dutchy without words, and actes, and by the impotency of both those Princes in themselues, both to make and continue so great a warre (as that was likely to haue bene by former examples) but that it must grow to great partiallities: The lesser Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> being not likely to endure the Churches so great encrease of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porality, which errour was so greatly reprehended by them all in <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth King of <hi>France</hi>; And that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing place to the right of that title, they should interesse him in the same iudgement for <hi>Vrbine</hi> also, and many other places: so that the war, by these reasons, in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance likely to bee somented: and that the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> both in hope to better his estates in <hi>Italy</hi> by that trouble, and by necessity to preserue those, which hee had already, and for being Vicar to the Church, and obliged for his kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> must be imbarked fully in that action; which would haue bene both a great diuersion from his other designes, and a facillitating of any enterprise, which that generous spirit of that Earle was euer framing, and vndertaking against him: and holding opinion that the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17801:7"/>
Dukes greatest necessity at the first must bee of incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and Captaines, sent mee presently (though the least amongst many) accompanied with diuers Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of approued valour, and procured the Count <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> Generall of the States Army, to write him letters of as much comfort, as could bee giuen from so braue a Prince, and so famous an Estate: and though my iourney was vnder-taken in the dead of Winter, and I left no paines vntaken to accelerat it; yet before I could arriue in <hi>Italy,</hi> I found the Duke giuen ouer to quieter resolutions, and <hi>Ferrara</hi> yeelded to the <hi>Pope</hi>; himselfe satisfying himselfe with <hi>Modona,</hi> and <hi>Rhegium,</hi> of which hee now beareth the Title. Which when I had aduertised the Earle of; as he, who neuer had his owne thoughts, limited, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any bounds of honourable and iust ambition; So he also desired, that those whom he had chosen into a neerenesse of affection should also answere both his owne conceipt of them, and satisfie the world in his election of them: wherefore, not willing I should returne, and turne such a voice as was raised of my going to nothing; as vnwilling that I should, by a vaine expence of my time, money, and hope, bee made a scorne to his and (through him) to my enemies: Hee proposed vnto me (after a small relation, which I made vnto him from <hi>Venice</hi>) the voiage of <hi>Persia,</hi> grounding of it vpon two points.</p>
            <p>First, the glory of God; to which, his excellent religious mind was euermore deuote. Then, if God would not please to choose me as a worthy instrument to that great end; yet by making a profitable experience of my seeing those Countries, limitting vpon the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> vniall parts, and answering to her Maiesties Merchants trades in <hi>Turky,</hi> and <hi>Muskouy</hi>; and besides, being not vnlikely but some parts might haue bene found fit for the <hi>Indian</hi> Nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then principiated in <hi>Holland,</hi> and muttered of in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17801:7"/>
It might proue a subiect to extract great and good matter out of, for the honor of her Maiestie, and the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular good of our Country: Besides, some more priuate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, which my fortune, being of the condition, which my persecutions haue brought it vnto, counselleth mee not to speake of: though they were most worthy ones, and honourable, and honest in him, as a great Subiect, and maine Piller of that State, which hee was bound to serue by all meanes and all industry. Hauing with these Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements receiued strength to my owne minde, large meanes and letters of fauour and credit to the company of Merchants at <hi>Aleppo</hi>; without opening the secrets of my deliberation to any, as fearing the strange humour of the world, rather inclined to mis-iudge of all actions, then to giue them onely a charitable construction: not willing to be scorned if it effected not; and assuring my selfe of all sort of reputation, if it proceeded well.</p>
            <p>I imbarked my selfe at <hi>Venice</hi> for <hi>Aleppo,</hi> in a <hi>Venetian</hi> ship, called the <hi>morizell,</hi> the foure and twentieth of <hi>May</hi> 1599. Fiue and twenty daies the Ship was sailing betweene <hi>Malmocko</hi> the Port of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Zant</hi>; in which space one of the worst in the Ship, a passenger to <hi>Ciprus,</hi> vsed most scandalous speeches of her Maiesty, which being brought vnto mee, not onely moued with the dutifull zeale which a Subiect oweth to his Prince; but euen with that respect which euery Gentleman oweth to a Lady, I commaunded one of my people to giue him a fit reward for so vile an abuse: which was no sooner done, but the Shippe was all in an vprore. And though the cause of the act was iust, and so vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by diuers principall Merchants, which went to <hi>Zant,</hi> and that the punishment was nothing proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the sceleratnesse of the fact; yet through the instigation of one <hi>Hugo de Potso,</hi> a Portingall Factor,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17801:8"/>
which was going to <hi>Ormus</hi> (though they shewed all to bee satisfied, because they durst do no other, yet) when wee were to haue departed in the ship from <hi>Zant,</hi> they would no more receiue vs, so that wee were forced to hire a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramosall to carry vs to <hi>Candy,</hi> where wee receiued most honourable entertainement, (the comming of strangers thither being a thing so vnsuall that the Duke desired to shew the Magnificence of the great Signory to vs that came first; and peraduenture should bee the last for a long time.)</p>
            <p>From thence in the same Carramosall wee departed to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Paphos,</hi> where wee found nothing to answere the famous relations giuen by ancient Histores of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that Iland, but the name onely, (the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse of the <hi>Turke,</hi> and time, hauing defaced all the Monuments of Antiquity) no shew of splendor, no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of men in a fashion, nor possessors of the ground in a Principallity; but rather Slaues to cruell Maisters, or prisoners shut vp in diuers prisons: so grieuous is the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of that miserable people, and so deformed is the state of that Noble Realme. Notwithstanding, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent power (I meane resident in that Iland, which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of that great tyranny) is so small, that if the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle remnant of people, which is left there had courage; or if they haue courage, had also armes; or if the Princes Christian had but a compassionate eye turned vpon the miserable calamity of a place so neere them, rent from the Church of God, by the vsurpation of Gods and the worlds great enemy: and maintained more by the terrour, which his name hath stroke into some truely; into others no more, but that they are contented hee should bee thought terrible, for the better progresse of their owne more vniust designes; I do not see, in that small iudgement which my experience hath giuen mee, but the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of that place and people were most facile (being but foure thousand <hi>Turkes</hi> in the whole Iland) and the glory would bee immortall to the Actor; besides the profite which must needs follow from so great an acquist; and the preseruing of it would also bee of no expence, nor hazard: the peoples affection binding it selfe to their redeemer; besides a necessity to keepe them vnited vnto him by the meanes of so abhorred a neighbour, from whom their vindication, into liberty, must bee maintained by their owne constancy: and his extreme weakenesse by sea, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranting all tranquility from feare of a powrefull inuasion, by which the Conquerour might be put in the least hazard. But God (who in his great iudgement weigheth mans sinnes, and appointeth, forth of his treasury of wrath, scourges for their iniquities) perhaps hath not fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his causefull indignation, yet, with the suffering of that people; and therefore blindeth the eies of the good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, of all his great instruments, whom hee hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the world to glorifie his name, to administer iustice, and to lighten the burthen of the oppressed, that they should not see the calamites of that Country, nor that their cries should come into their eares, by which their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous hearts should be moued to condigne compassion; nor that their iudgements should be free to see their owne particular honour, and profite: So <hi>God vseth to show man that hee is a bubble, raised onely by his breath, mouing by the same, and falling by the same, according to the will of his great prouidence, to which we in the pride of our nature, yeeld not the true attribution due vnto it: yet the powerfull working of it is such, that with the confusion of our foolish pride, it proueth it selfe an eternall wisedome, which will giue lawes to the world, and the bridle to all people, and guideth onely the hearts of Princes.</hi>

            <p>At this Oration of his, were present certaine <hi>Armenian</hi> passengers, who had knowne vs in the ship, which moued with the enormity of so vile an act (that Christians should sell and betray Christians to Turkes, and that vpon no cause of offence, which they were witnesses of, wee should be persecuted with such a kind of inhumane cruelty) with all speed possible hired a Boate, themselues, for <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretta,</hi> came with it vnto vs, prouided in it victuals for vs, and the Maisters themselues to loose no time; and besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vs, with teares in their eies, to flye from thence with all speed possible; relating vnto vs the scelerattreason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired against vs, and our imminent perill. Wherefore we instantly changed into that Boate, and perceiuing a Fregat a farre off, rowing towards vs, for hast, left most of our things behind vs, and yet could not make so much speed, but that the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> which were in the Fregat, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vs, bestowed some shot vpon vs, and had peraduenture ouertaken vs, if the night had not ended their chasing vs, and our dangers.</p>
            <p>This Boate, in which wee were, was an ordinary passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger betweene <hi>Ciprus</hi> and <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> a small way of onely a night and a halfe sayling, and halfe a daies sayling: So that by reason the Maister was vnlike to mistake his way, much lesse so iust contrary as hee did, towards two

houres in the night, we met another passage-Boate, put off from <hi>Famagusta,</hi> holding the course which wee intended: The night was faire, with the shining of the moone and star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; yet, by reason of the difference in sayling, wee first lost sight of that Boate, then by our different course, the Maister of ours, insteed of <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> going for <hi>Tripoly,</hi> which, certainely, was a great worke of God to preserue vs. The other Boate, at breake of the day, being taken at the entrance of the port of <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> by certaine Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Pirates, who put all to the sword, that were in it, and hearing of vs, we had rowed so far into the Riuer <hi>Orontes,</hi> before they could recouer vs, that they durst no further prosecute that prey.</p>
            <p>There we found a goodly Country, repleat euen natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with all the blessings the earth can giue to man, for the most part vncultiuated, here and there, as it were, sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with miserable Inhabitors, which in their fashion shewed the necessity they had to liue, rather then any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in their liuing.</p>
            <p>From thence wee sent our Interpretor to <hi>Antiochia,</hi> to prouide vs horses to bring vs thither, which hee returned within two daies after, and with them wee proceeded thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, full of great care how we should escape from thence: The Turke hauing giuen certaine scales to trade in, out of which, as it was vnlawfull for any to conuerse; so it must needs be an vneuitable perill for so great a company, when the same great Prouidence, which at first defended vs from the former hazards, gaue vs the good hap to meete with two <hi>Ianizaries, Hungarish-runnagates,</hi> who vnderstanding that we were Christians, compelled against our dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into that place, our intention to be a visitation of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and with all our feare of some great preiudice by our being arriued out of the distinguished places for all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; hauing told vs first, that they themselues had beene

Christians, and though they had, for reasons best knowne to themselues, altered that condition; yet they wished well to those which still were so, and especially to all of those parts: and afterwards cheerefully comforting vs, inuited vs to lodge in their house, securing vs, by a number of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, from all dangers; which as they courteously offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, so (if I may giue so faire a terme, to such a people) they honourably performed: For being by the <hi>Cady</hi> of <hi>Antiochia</hi> required to present vs vnto him, they did not onely deny vs, as bound vnto it by the lawes of hospitality, in respect of their promise, as they themselues said; but called fifty other <hi>Ianizaries</hi> of <hi>Damasco,</hi> their friends, to defend vs, if the <hi>Cady</hi> should haue offered violence.</p>
            <p>And now that I haue had occasion to speake of the <hi>Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> of <hi>Damasco,</hi> which by likely-hood, of that they presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to do in that point, must bee men of great authority, both in power and estimation: It will not bee amisse, to vse so fit an opportunity to discourse of the Turkes whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of those parts, which I did not behold with the eies of a common Pilgrime, or Merchant; which passing onely by goodly Citties and Territories, make their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon the superficiall appearance of what they see: but as a Gentleman bred vp in such experience, which hath made me somewhat capable to penetrate into the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and imperfection of the forme of the State, and into the good and ill Orders by which it is gouerned.

So that where the Dominion ioyneth with the power of the Christian Princes; his presence keepeth those parts from danger of innouation: Where hee is further separated, his <hi>Tymarri,</hi> (which are certaine to whom he distributeth so much land for their desert in vertue, which was their first institution; and by that tenure are bound to finde him their persons, and so many horses in his warres) they, I say, hauing their estates soly depending vpon his gouernment, assuring him from all perill of alteration.

Yet the negligence of the Princes Christian will not make vse of these extreame defects of his to amplifie their Dominions, to eternize their Honours; and (that which is the greatest) to glorifie God, which hath made them Princes, onely to execute his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; (none of which now can bee more iustly infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vpon any, then vpon that great blasphemer against his Holy one, and tyrant of the world) giue peace to their inique passions, which giue cause to the very earth to sigh, to all good hearts to groane, and kindle Gods indignation against them, and their people: and turne first their aspects to that which they owe to God; and then to the true ambition of a Prince, to doe great and iust things; which with their honour might also bring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite to their present estates; and are of such a condition, that the effecting of them is vtterly without danger, or difficulty: seeing with the very sight of a compleat Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, his Souldiary, in those parts, would be terrified, through their inability, to resist; and the people, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change possible to worse fortune, would all follow those Ensignes, which their extremity doth already force them to wish for.

came vnto mee, and after a little other discourse, told me, that there was a great muttering amongst diuers great men there, what I was, and what my designes might bee; that hee found me to bee dangerously spied after: and wished me to haue regard, (if not to my selfe) yet to so many, which he did imagine were impawned in that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune by my meanes. And though it were true, that hee came vpon the motion of an honest, pious, and charitable heart; yet I was so fearefull of an <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant, that I did rather imagine him to be the spy, then lightly to haue bene an instrument of his preuention. Therefore agreeing with him in the complement onely, I answered determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in the rest; that I knew no iust cause of perill, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I feared none; and if there were any curious eies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, because of the number of my company, the <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan</hi> comming, they should see good vse made of them all: and vntill that time I would haue patience with their loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and speaking.

When I came there he brought me to a <hi>Vitto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> of whom he had already hired Horses, Camels, and Moiles for me; and I found a Tent pitched by his seruants: and then opening his gowne, hee deliuered me a bag of <hi>Chakins,</hi> with these very words: The God of heauen blesse you, and your whole company, and your enterprise, which I will no further desire to know, then in my hope, which perswadeth mee that it is good; My selfe am going to <hi>China,</hi> whence if I returne, I shall little need the repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this courtesy, which I haue done you with a most free heart; if I die by the way, I shall lesse neede it: But if it please God so to direct both our safeties with good prouidence, that we may meete againe, I assure my selfe, that you will remember mee to bee your friend; which is enough, for all that I can say to a man of your sort. And almost, without giuing me leasure to yeeld him condigne thanks (if any thankes could be condigne) for so great and so noble a benefite, he departed from me: And as I heard afterward from him by letters from <hi>Ormus,</hi> hee receiued much trouble after my departure, through his honourable desire to perfect the kindnesse which hee had begone. For imagining, that by the continuall spies, which claue to my house, that my flight could not be secret: he had no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner left mee in the <hi>Carauan,</hi> but that hee changed his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to mine, saying that I had done the like to his; and went to the <hi>Cady,</hi> telling him that I was sicke, desiring his Physition to visite mee, knowing well enough that the <hi>Cady</hi> had none, but onely to giue colour to my not

            <p>And though it bee a miserable thing for a man to grow an example in cases of affliction, yet it is necessary that some men should be so; and because it pleaseth God, that I should bee one, and a great one of these: So I may also be taken, for as great a one of his infinite mercies, and through them his direct pleasure in what sort, hee will haue men gouerne themselues. For hauing fastened my mind to that good purpose, and intermingled some particular intentions of mine owne ambitions: as God shewed a sensible disposition to fauour the one; so by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling me to the very pit of extremities, he taught me to cast away the other; and to haue my sole confidence in him, disposing my minde to his pleasure; not to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of my owne frailty, which founded in the perfectest man, moueth to continuall errours: not that man doth not more desire to intend good then euill, by a naturall reason, (vertue being the health of the mind, and vice the

            <p>
               <hi>Neither must man thinke that for many burthens, which God layeth vpon him, that hee is wholy abandoned, and so leape from an awfull humility to a direct despaire of his mercies: Since God, like a great Prince, will haue men his Subiectes, so truely his, that all their thoughts shall depend vpon his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not vpon the swolne bubbles of their owne hearts. which if they erre in, humility is the true reconciliation of their offence, before that great Iudge: and desperation, a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest token of a maine rebellious spirit; which, reposed vpon a vaine assurance of himselfe, plungeth him in that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, vpon the contrary proceeding of his intentions: which are so farre from power to effect themselues by any ability in himselfe, that himselfe can no longer subsist, then Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is hee should.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, God is not as man, whom we may abuse, by hauing diuers propositions mingled of good and bad ends: the bookes of our hearts being laid open before him, in which he readeth our most inward thoughts; for which wee must continually giue an account, feeling the reward of our good motions by the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificency of his mercies and our bad by the infliction of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamites; which wee may auoide, if wee will vnderstand God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17801:18"/>
and our selues; which we may euer do by making the best vse of the wisedome which wee haue borne in our selues; by learning of other; and exercitation; which are the acquisters of all Sciences: amongst all which, none is so great in it selfe, nor so greatly importing man. And though many, in the mis-vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the world, are acounted learned and wise without it; let them know, that such are like vntimely fruite, which carry with them a temporall wonder, raised through the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of other, which put no distinction betweene the effects of the world, and the workings of God, when there is so great a one, as permanency in the last, and no more but apparition in the other, shewing it selfe, and dissoluing without, almost, any memory, that any such thing was: which should make the iudgement of men not to proceed to their absolutenesse, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the present fortune of any; but first see the end which God hath appointed him vnto; and then to giue a diffinitiue sentence; in which they cannot erre, drawing their iudgement from his, who neuer erreth.</hi> Of most part of which things (as I said) I may bee a most present, and a most certaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, both of the mutablenesse of fortunes workings, of the causes, (which I confesse freely) of Gods infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and of his order of gouernement, vnder which hee disposeth mens actions. And though I had, through the sencible apprehensions of such great lessons, giuen mee by so diuers iudgements, throwne away all other opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then those, which had their aspects onely turned to the promotion of his glory: Yet my frailty gaue me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall terrour during those thirty daies in which we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with that company of blind Pilgrimes through the Deserts; not knowing what God had wrought for my secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and those which were with mee, by that good man, <hi>Signior Vittorio.</hi> At the end of which wee arriued in the King of <hi>Persia's</hi> dominions, hauing first passed a great tract of good and ill Countries, the desert places of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Yet in that simplicity of liuing (not being without that contagion of all Mankind, of all Prouinces, and of all States, ambition of getting superiority, and larger Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) some wars daily grow in amongst them, euen to the extirpation of a whole Nation: As wee found freshly, when wee passed by one of those Princes, called <hi>Hider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beague,</hi> all whose people were deuored by the sword, or carried away captiue, by <hi>Cobatbeague</hi>: and himselfe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, onely with some twenty soules, in certaine poore Holdes in a Rocke.</p>
            <p>The precise summe, which I receiued of the <hi>Florentine,</hi> I set not downe, to preuent the scandales of diuers, who measuring euery mans mind by the straightnesse of theirs, will beleeue no act, which doth not symbolize with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: but so much it was, that being thirty daies vpon the way to the Confines; then fifteene from the Confines to <hi>Casbine,</hi> where wee attended one month the Kings ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall; it was not onely sufficient to giue vs aboundant meanes for that time, but to cloth vs all in rich appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, fit to present our selues before the presence of any Prince, and to spend extraordinarily in giftes, by which wee insinuated farre into the fauour of those, which had the authority of that Prouince, during our abode, and expectation of the Kings comming: In which time wee were well vsed, more by the opinion, which they had, that the King would take satisfaction by

The Gouernour visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me once; <hi>Marganabeague,</hi> maister of the Kings house, (whom I had won vnto me by presents) came oftentimes to see me: besides (as it seemed) being more inwardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Kings inclination, fitted himselfe more to that, then others did, which knew it lesse.</p>
            <p>And now that Iam in <hi>Persia,</hi> &amp; speak of the kings absence; since he is both one of the mightiest Princes that are, and one of the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>test, for the true vertues of a Prince, that is, or hath bin; and hauing come to this greatnesse, though by right; yet through the circumstances of the time, &amp; the occasions, which then were, solely his owne worthinesse, &amp; vertue, made way to his right: besides, the fashion of his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t differing so much from that which we call bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barousnesse, that it may iustly serue for as great an <hi>Idea</hi> for a Principality, as <hi>Platoes</hi> Common-wealth did for a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, of that sort. I hold it not amisse to speake amply first of his person, the nature of his people, the distribution of his gouernment; the administration of his iustice, the condition of the bordering Princes, &amp; the causes of those warres, in which he was then occupied; that by the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of those, this discourse may passe with a more liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more sensible feeling.</p>
            <p>His person then is such, as a well-vnderstanding Nature would fit for the end proposed for his being, excellently well shaped, of a most well proportioned stature, strong, and actiue; his colour somewhat inclined to a man-like blacknesse, is also more blacke by the sunnes burning: his furniture of his mind infinitly royall, wise, valiant, liberall, temperate, mercifull, and an exceeding louer of Iustice, embracing royally others vertues, as farre from pride and vanity, as from all vnprincely signes, or acts; knowing his

Their Princes he beheaded, and of them, slue twenty thousand of the ablest for the warres, assuring his peace with them by their extremest ruine; and as he was, by all reports, a most braue, &amp; warlike Prince, hauing pacified his owne state, and desirous to recouer, not onely what was freshly lost; but all which was formerly taken from the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies</hi> kingdome, by the power of the <hi>Ottomans</hi>; vnited all his thoughts, and all his Councels to that one great end; which all finished with his life, ending it selfe by treason of his Princes (not without perswasion of the Turke) when he had fit yeares, mind, and courage; and meanes ioined with ocasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to haue made himselfe the greatest Prince of many ages: all which though they made his death miserable, yet the manner was more miserable; being vilely slaine by his Barber, retiring halfe drunke from a banquet, to which he

was prouoked by the conspirators, which presently parted the state between them; euery man making himselfe abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Prince of those prouinces, which they had in gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and parting the royall treasure amongst them for their reciprocall maintenance, disposed themselues vnitely to resist the comming in of <hi>Abas</hi>; whom notwithstanding they did not much feare, hauing promise of the <hi>Turke</hi> that he should be detained in <hi>Corassan</hi> where he was refuged: &amp; knowing that he had neither men nor money, nor years to giue him any incoragement to attempt against them, who had soone confirmed themselues, both with giuing good satisfaction to the people, and with liberality to the Souldiary; and their entrance into the state being without opposition, and so, without offence, made the foundation both more sure and more facile.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> Councell also was exceeding good for his ends; for hauing dissipated the vnite power of that great dominion into so many branches, which though he knew could continue together to maintaine their wrong against the true kings right; yet that their owne ambitions in short time would stirre them to debate amongst themselues: by which, as he was out of doubt of perill, during the trauels of his warres, so he was assured that at his conuenient oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, either by their owne quarrels, or by his power, they should be all subiected to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abas</hi> in the meane time, whose iust Title made him king, assured himselfe that both the murder of his brother, and this parting of the state, had the <hi>Turkes</hi> counsell concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with those Princes impiety: and not doubting but the king of <hi>Corasan</hi> was also perswaded to deteine him, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding by his necessity, began to deale boldly with him for his assistance against his rebels, laying before him how preiuditiall the example was to all Princes; and most to him who was chiefe of all those <hi>Tartar</hi> Princes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

If this rebellion of naturall subiects procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a happy course, much more would they bee anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do the like which were Lords, and no subiects: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, though the counsell of the <hi>Turke</hi> had not palesated it selfe openly, yet in all iudgement it might be perceiued, that he had onely raised this, as a Pageant, to fill the world with gazing, whilest hee fitted his designes to impatronize himselfe of the state; which if he should do, how terrible a neighbour he would be to the King of <hi>Corassan,</hi> he submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his wise consideration. For himselfe, that he had bin so bound to him in his first calamity, that without other re

            <p>This victory assured the Rebels (as they thought) from all further danger; supposing that these small forces, were all, which then their King could, or hereafter should bee able to lead against them: Imagining that the King of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasan,</hi> if hee would haue succored him indeed, that hee would neuer haue cast a way those few, to increase the strength of their foundation, and to diminish the others reputation, which is so effectuall in a not well confirmed Princes first actions, especially in a Prince who must come to his right by his vertue and fortune. But the King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> whose owne minde euer comforted him, with a stedfast assurance of his greatnesse, to which hee is now growne, hauing recouered the Mountaines, liued amongst the Heardes-men for three months, vnknowne, changing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, from place to place, without any certaine abode, accompanied onely with ten or twelue followers, which were of his first Gouernours, and other yong Gentlemen brought vp with him from his child-hood.</p>

Neither were the men so welcome, as that <hi>Ferrat Can,</hi> being a wise Prince, and a great Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, grew a party, and such as the King also stood in need of: Neither did the King loose any sort of opportunity, but hearing of the Assembly which certaine of the Princes were making in the neerest Prouinces vnto him, with all speed fell vpon them, and ouer-throwing them followed them as farre as <hi>Casbin.</hi>

            <p>There were many daies spent in Counsell, and at last it was concluded, since the suppression of the King was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, being abandoned by him which was his onely Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and Counsellour; by so great a part of his strength; and vpon the confidence which <hi>Ferrat</hi> gaue them to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine the rest; that it would proue too dangerous, to call in those forces of the Turkes, which were in readinesse for their succour; Not knowing whether they should so easily free themselues of them againe, if they were once entred. They feared the Turkes purposes, and as much feared to know them; therefore to auoide the danger of being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to experience them, they determined to write to the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Tauris,</hi> that the war was so certaine to bee fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, by themselues, that they would reserue his fauour till a more vrgent opportunity: and with that deliberation a principall man was dispatched with a present for the <hi>Bassa.</hi> Of this, the King had present aduice, by a confident messenger, and also that few nights after, the principals
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17801:25"/>
of the Army were to meete together at <hi>Ferrats</hi> house, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited to a great banquet; which being vnderstood by him, electing fiue thousand of his best men, and best horsing, with great, and close iourneies, he came to <hi>Casbin</hi>; where hauing secretly disposed his people, in the Mountaine, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the quarter of <hi>Ferrats</hi> troupe, hee expected the signe which was to bee giuen him. The Prince (as it was appointed) failed not of comming, nor hee of his signe to the King, nor the King to accomplish his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For <hi>Ferrat</hi> hauing protracted the banquet the most part of the night, when the whole company was heauy with wine and sleepe, the King was receiued into the house with three hundred men, where without any vp-roare, he slew all those which were inuited, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of three score and ten; the seruants and Pages being so suddenly taken hold of, and with such dexterity, that without any mouing of other rumors, the same fashion of feast of singing and of dancing, continued all the night; and in that space all the rest of those people, which the King had with him, were appointed, in the breaking of the day, to make the greatest shew, and the greatest noise that they could vnder the foote of the Mountaine, as though all the Army had beene there, marching to the Towne. When the Alarum beganne to bee hot in the Towne, and euery man fell to his Armes, and repaired to <hi>Ferrats</hi> lodging, where they supposed their Princes to haue bene; the King hauing disposed his three hundred men which were shut fitly in the house, and <hi>Zulpher</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his fiue thousand all in a Troope, in the great place, the threescore and ten <hi>Cans</hi> heades were shewed all laced vpon a string, and hung out of a Tarras; vpon which the King presently shewed himselfe, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with <hi>Ferrat Can</hi>; whereas the Maiesty of the King, the terrour of the sight, represented before them,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17801:25"/>
the feare of the Army, which they saw (as they thought) at hand, <hi>Zulpher</hi> and <hi>Ferrat Cans</hi> power amongst them, which they perceiued turned against them; their being destitute of Commanders, and the guiltinesse of their owne consciences, for their rebellion, stroke them into so dead an amazement, that they stood ready, rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all mischiefe, then that they had either courage, or mindes, or counsell to auoide it.</p>
            <p>The King, as though he had a while aduised with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe what he would both say and do; at last after a good pause, seeming that his royall mercy had preuailed against his iust indignation; hee told them, that the wickednesse of their vniuersall conspiracy against him, was such, that hee was distracted in himselfe, what to say or doe against them: for though they might excuse themselues vpon those Princes which had seduced them; yet they knew, that the others authority, had no more force vpon them then their own willing obedience, which called as great a punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon the one, as the other. What cause they should haue, generally, to desire such an innouation of gouernement, as they, by their owne conuenence had erected amongst them, he could not deuise; his Grand-father, Father, and Brother, hauing euer guided the Helme of their State, with that integrity of iustice, and that vniuersall satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was not to be wished, of any, to find more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, for those which desired to liue onely quietly; nor more iust measure of honour, or due reward, then was magnificently giuen to those which had deserued them; and why they should haue lesse hope of him, he knew not, neuer hauing made, willingly, any other demonstration of his minde, then such as might be proportionable to their best expectations. But since his true feeling of humane frailty, made him well vnderstand how easie mens mindes are to be abused by others artifice, and their owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17801:26"/>
hee to oke so great a compassion of the calamity into which they had, (either wilfully, or misled by others errors) cast themselues; that if he could haue any confidence, that they would truely repent of their past wickednesse, and bend their mindes to serue him with a perfect heart, hee could also easily perswade himselfe to change the seuerity of the iudgement, which they had merited, into mercy, forgiuenesse, and forgetfulnesse of their offence; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himselfe, that this iniurious great disorder (which had hapned, as all other of that kind do, through the ignorance of many, and malice of few) should also be expiated by the bloud of those few, who had already concluded the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their vsurped authority, and their long hopes with a short and iust death.</p>
            <p>This being spoken, by the King, with courage and maiesty; and being so far from that which their guilty consciences did cause them to apprehend, facily brought forth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>effectes of a multitude, which being easily inclined to hope more then they should, and to suffer lesse then is fit,</hi> as though the King, with his royall mercifull speech, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them as great a present good, as if hee had discharged them from the terrour of the punishment of almost an vnpardonable offence: cryed out, let the King liue, let the King liue; we are all King <hi>Abas</hi> his slaues, and will not suffer to liue any of his enemies: and there was more trouble to defend the poore people of <hi>Casbin</hi> from sacking by them, (their Towne euer hauing bene a wel-disposed harbour for the Rebels) then to turne their heartes and armes to the Kings part. Besides the succours which the Kings of <hi>Gheylan</hi> and <hi>Mazandran</hi> had sent the Rebels, were with great difficulty saued, and returned to their countries by the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> with commandement to tell their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that as the poore men were not culpable, which obeyed their Princes authority, by whom they were sent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17801:26"/>
against him, and for that innocency, hee had giuen them their liues; so that hee would not bee long from seeking his reuenge vpon their Maisters, which had more iustly deserued it, by his neuer prouoking them to any offence. And when hee came with his Army thither, hee would proue, by those mens acknowledgement vnto him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could discerne by the benefites they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready recieued of him in the gift of their liues, which they had forfeited vnto him, by bearing Armes with Rebels against him, what better hopes they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of him, if they would dispose themselues to deserue good of him.</p>
            <p>In this meane time, the same of this great successe, flew to both the Armies about the Mountaines of <hi>Hama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>: which, as it comforted the Kings with exceeding ioyfulnesse; so it entred into the others with such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that they presently vanished, euery man retyring to his best knowne safe-gard, that part of the warre ending with the blast onely of the fortune of the other, with little expence of time, labour, and bloud: which being vnderstood by the King, hee raised <hi>Oliuer-Dibeague</hi> to the title of a <hi>Can,</hi> and sent him, with those forces which hee had, to <hi>Hamadan,</hi> to settle the Country in a good forme of gouernement, and to ease it from the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the other dispersed troupes. <hi>Zulpher</hi> hee also called <hi>Can,</hi> and sent him to <hi>Ardoutle</hi> which frontireth vpon <hi>Tauris,</hi> with an Army consisting of twenty and foure thousand men, in shew to quiet the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but indeed, to preuent any moouing of the <hi>Turkes.</hi> And because hee knew, that as his state stood then weake, raised (as it were) freshly from a deadly sickenesse, it was not fitte for him (at that time) to bind himselfe to wrastle with such an enemy, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king knowledge of his ill disposition towards him; hee
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17801:27"/>
dispatched Embassadours to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to <hi>Tauris,</hi> and to the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to congratulate with them, as with his friendes, for the felicity of his fortune; and to strengthen himselfe, by alliance, also the more firmely, against the proceeding of any thing which the <hi>Turke</hi> might designe against him, either then or in future time; he required the daughter of <hi>Simon Can,</hi> one of the Princes of the <hi>Georgians,</hi> to wife, which was, with as ready an affection performed, as demanded.</p>
            <p>Whiles that Lady was comming from her father, the King vnderstanding that the <hi>Cans</hi> sonne of <hi>Hisphaean</hi> held yet strong the Castle, and whether he gaue it out to amaze his Army, which now beganne to looke for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, for the great trauels and dangers which they had passed, or whether hee had heard so indeed; true it is, that hee gaue out, that the most part of the treasure of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> was, by the consent of the Rebels, for security, kept together in that Castle: to receiue the which, and to chastice that Rebell, the King marched thither with a part onely of his Army, leauing the rest at <hi>Casbin,</hi> which was Frontier to <hi>Gheylan,</hi> against which his purpose carried him. Without much trouble, hee expugned the Fort at <hi>Hisph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

His owne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to content the Army, and his Armies necessity to aske contentment, drew him suddenly back from thence to <hi>Casbin,</hi> where he had not stayed many daies, (for daily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction with hope hauing no reall meanes) but that the Queene arriued, honourably accompanied with 2000 horse, and <hi>Byraicke Myrza</hi> her brother. The Marriage was soone dispatched, those countries vsing few ceremonies in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17801:27"/>
such cases: and God blessed them both so happily, that within the tearme of lesse then one yeare, shee brought him a gallant yong Prince who is now liuing, called <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir Mirza.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King vnwilling to oppresse his countrey, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to reuenge himselfe vpon the kings of <hi>Gheylan,</hi> and <hi>Mazandran,</hi> to enlarge his Empire, and to content his Souldiers; hauing a flourishing Army, both in men, and the reputation of his present victory; resolued, all vnder one, to increase his stare, honour himselfe, ease his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and satisfie his Souldiers with the enemies spoyles. <hi>Gheylan</hi> is a country cut off from <hi>Persia,</hi> with great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, hard to passe, full of woods (which <hi>Persia</hi> wanteth; being here and there onely sprinkled with hils, and very penurious of fuell, onely their gardens giue them wood to burne, and those hils, which are some fagots of Pista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chios, of which they are well replenished) betweene those hils there are certaine breaches, rather then vallies; which, in the spring, when the snow dissolueth, and the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of raine falleth, are full of torrents; the <hi>Caspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> sea includeth this Countrey on the East: betweene which and the hils, is a continuing valley, so abounding in Silke, in Rice, and in Corne, and so infinitely peopled, that Nature seemeth to contend with the peoples indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry; the one in sowing of men, the other in cultiuating the land; in which you shall see no peece of ground which is not fitted to one vse or other: their hils also (which are rockes towards <hi>Casbin</hi>) are so fruitfull of herbage, shado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by the trees, as they shew, turned towards the sea, that they are euer full of cattell, which yeeldeth commodity to the countrey, by furnishing diuers other parts. In this then lay the difficulty most of the kings enterprize, how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the countrey: for the rest there were great reasons of his hopes, the kings of those countries being amazed with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17801:28"/>
these first great successes of the king of <hi>Persia,</hi> their people discouraged, many Princes, which though they might v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite themselues against a common enemy, yet their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations could not be so speedy, as from one alone, nor so firme; many accidents happening, which might either absolutely dis-ioyne, or diuert them one from the other, or cast suspition amongst them, which might giue the way to a good occasion against one, by which the victory against the other might be also facilitated: Besides, his owne Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was so much raised in courage by their last happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, and those so animated, through an opinion in themselues, of that reputation which had first followed the King, and the rest so desirous to wash away the ignominy of their offence, by some great and good act, ioyned to the hope of rich preyes; that there could bee almost thought of no obstacle able to withstand their valour and willingnesse.</p>
            <p>Yet before the king would enter into this action, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, that before he had better setled himselfe in his owne state, that he thrust himselfe vpon a cast of fortune, to seeke after the winning of others; yet since hee was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto it, by a certaine great necessity, hee resolued to take the best wayes for the securing all dangers which might rise against himselfe at home; and setting his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in a reposed state, from so many tempests, which had contrarily moued it, as well as to make due and confident prouisions for his intended warres. First then he called vnto him to <hi>Casbin,</hi> all gouernors, &amp; all administrators of Iustice, whosoeuer had occupyed those functions, during the vsurped rule of the <hi>Cans,</hi> through all his prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; with the kinsmen, friends and children of the said <hi>Cans</hi>: besides, that all men of power, as <hi>Mirzaes, Cans, Sultans,</hi> and <hi>Beagues,</hi> which are principall Titles of Dukes, Princes, and Lords, should repaire thither,

His chiefe <hi>Viseire</hi> he made one <hi>Haldenbeague,</hi> a wise man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently seene in all affaires, of great experience; but such a one as was onely his creature, without friends or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: him hee commanded to passe through all his prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, accompanied with the <hi>Xa-Hammadaga</hi>; who is, as it were, Knight Marshall, to cleare them from vagabonds, robbers, and seditious persons. <hi>Ologonlie,</hi> which had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him in all his aduersity (a man of great worthinesse) he made bearer of his great Seale, which is an office there, liker the Lord priuy Seale, then Chancellor (The place of the <hi>Viseire</hi> comprehending in it, the office of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and high Treasurer) him he also aduanced to the dignity of a <hi>Can.

            <p>Thus hauing wisely and prouidently placed, through all his estates, those who must be most assured to him, their fortunes depending onely vpon him, hauing no more strength, nor authority in themselues, then they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from him: and hauing all the great ones in his Army with him, or such of them as could not bee able to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, either by their few, or many yeares, or sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so securely left at <hi>Casbin,</hi> that they could not by

And moreouer, hauing dispatched all those, and keeping their persons with him which had any obligation to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Cans,</hi> secured by that meanes (as much as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of any man could secure him) from perill at home: hauing called <hi>Oliuer di Can</hi> from <hi>Hamadan,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted him a successor for that Gouernement with ten thousand new men; hee set himselfe forward to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, with his old Troopes, and great part of his rebelled Army, with no greater courage and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell then fortune: for those men which were remitted by him to <hi>Gheylan,</hi> and <hi>Mazandran,</hi> (as those which had beene somewhat exercised in the warres) hauing, with some more, adioined vnto them the guard of the straights, from which the maine Army of the Kings was some foure leagues remoued (remembring the benefite of the King, better then their faith to their Princes) at the very sight of the first Troopes, retired themselues from the places left to their confidence in charge; which aduantage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followed by <hi>Ferrat,</hi> with the Alarum giuen, fell so iustly vpon that Army, that what with the vnexpected terror of the straights abandoning, and their being surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in disorder, the Army was facily broken, with the death of two of the Kings, and an infinite slaughter of people, which had beene much greater if the woods had not couered them from the fury of their enemies. The greatest of those kings hauing escaped with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty (accompanied euer with the terror of the perill from which he had escaped) neuer ended his flight, vntill hee came into <hi>Seruane</hi>; and from thence went to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> to desire succour from the <hi>Turke,</hi> where he yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.

            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:17801:29"/>The Countrey being first spoiled, and ransomed at a great rate, which they might well beare, by reason of their great riches, which they had gathered together through a long peace, and the Kings Army excellently well satisfied; he dispatched, instantly, Embassadours to the <hi>Turke,</hi> the <hi>Georgians</hi> and his old friend, the King of <hi>Corassan,</hi> to giue them an account of this new victory: not doubting, but as it would bee exceeding pleasant to some; so it would bee as bitter to others: and leauing <hi>Ferrat Can</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Countrey, and <hi>Oliuer Dibeague,</hi> as his assistant, but to bee commanded by him, hee returned himselfe full of glory, and great victory into <hi>Persia,</hi> disposing himselfe to reduce his state to that excellent forme of gouernment which now it hath.</p>
            <p>First then, after his arriuall in <hi>Casbin,</hi> hauing heard by his <hi>Viseire,</hi> &amp; the relation of <hi>Xa-Hammadaga,</hi> of some who had not onely spoyled the Subiects in their substances; but the country of all orders, &amp; iust forme of gouernement, which now it hath; and giuen them, by that meanes, more matter of dis-vnion, then vnion; insomuch, that they were ful of theeues, of vagabonds, of factions, &amp; such like insolencies: he iudged it fit, to reduce it the more peaceable and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to giue it in those cases, a good condition of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Whereupon, he presently dispatched that <hi>Xa-ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madaga,</hi> a terrible, and resolute person, with full power and authority, for the reformation of those disorders; who in short time, though with most terrible examples, reduced all the Prouinces to a vnite tranquility, with mighty repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>Whilst hee was busied in that administration; the King, to shew that it was necessity, that counselled to giue him that excessiue authority, and to preserue it from being odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to himselfe, appointed in the chiefe city of euery Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, a Gouernour elected of those of most valour: to

These determined all causes within themselues of those Prouinces in which they had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration; and because they should neither be burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the Prouinces, nor corrupted in paritializing; the King paid them their stipend, enioyning them vpon paine of life to take no other sort of reward. And because such things, and causes might fall out, as by reason of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of them, or appellations of the parties might be brought before himselfe, because hee would euer know what he did, and be continually informed, not onely of the generall state of the Prouinces, but of their particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration; hee ordained Posts once euery weeks from all parts, to bring all sort of relations to the Court; for which cause also hee willed that one of the two generall Aduocates should euer be resident there, who receiuing those relations presenteth them to the <hi>Viseire,</hi> and hee to the King.

equity, generall security, and tranquility; had beene of sufficient ability to haue bound the hearts of people vnto him: Yet knowing what his were, and to leaue no meanes vnacted which might both assure them more, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with them; because he knew, that their owne dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, which were euill, would neuer, rightly, iudge of the cause of many rigorous examples that had passed, which by that fault in them, had ingendred him hatred amongst them; to purge their minds from that sickenesse, and gaine them the more confidently, hee determined to shew, that if there were any cruell act, brought forth, it did not grow from himselfe, but from necessity. Wherfore hee displaced, by little, (finding particular occasions daily against some or other) all the whole <hi>Tymarri</hi> of his estate; as though from them had growne all such disorders, as had corrupted the whole gouernment, sending new ones, and a great part of them <hi>Gheylaners</hi> to their possessions, with more limited authority, and more fauourable to the people; the old ones part he casherd, part he distributed in <hi>Gheylan</hi> and <hi>Mazandran,</hi> which he had new conquered: so that by that Art, the people began to rest exceeding well satisfied, and himselfe the more secured; those which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them being bound to his fortune; and those which were remoued also, being disposed in the new conquered Prouinces, which they were bound to maintaine in securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for their owne fortunes, which depended onely vpon their preseruing them for the King.</p>
            <p>When all these things were done, and the King began to thinke himselfe, throughly established, for a long time, both from intrinsicke and extrinsicke dangers, The <hi>Turkes</hi> forces being so occupied in the warres of <hi>Hungary,</hi> that hee had no leasure to looke to his increasing; the <hi>Tartarres</hi> of <hi>Corrasan,</hi> his friendes, by the old hospitality which hee had receiued from their King; and if not his

friends, yet cold enemies, such as would bee long resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, before they would attempt any thing to his preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: There fell out a new occasion to trouble, both the peace of his minde and Countrey, if it had not beene preuented with great dexterity, celerity, and fortune. For <hi>Ferrat Can,</hi> not regarding his benefites done to the King, knowing too well his owne worthinesse, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing vnto that, the successes of all the kings fortunes, and for so great causes, not being able to limit his mind within any compasse of satisfaction, not resting conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the place of Generall, nor Gouernment of <hi>Gheylan,</hi> nor with the honour to be called the Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but despising that <hi>Haldenbeague</hi> should bee <hi>Viseire,</hi> and not himselfe all; which had giuen the king all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take counsell, to innouate, and alter things with the <hi>Bassaes</hi> of <hi>Seruan,</hi> and <hi>Tauris. So dangerous are too great benefites from a subiect to a Prince, both for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and the Prince, when they haue their minds only capable of merit, and nothing of duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These practises of his, were most dangerous, for which hee did more assure himselfe, to haue layd a strong foundation for the discontentment of those <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mari</hi> which the King had sent into his Gouernement; and so had they beene, questionlesse, if <hi>Oliuer di-Can,</hi> through his true zeale to his Maisters seruice; and, perhappes, a little enuy at the others greatnesse, had not made him so watchfully diligent, that hauing ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered his intentions by very momentuall circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hee gaue the King, from time to time, notice of them; which at the first were negligently receiued, and rather taken as matter of emulation, then truth: But when those very same aduertisements euer continued, and <hi>Oliuer di Can,</hi> was not at all terrified from sending of them; neither by the kings neglecting them, nor rebuke, and that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17801:32"/>
               <hi>Mahomet Shefia</hi> was also secretly arriued in the Court, with more particular and certaine aduice, that the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Seruan</hi> had sent a great summe of money to <hi>Ferrat,</hi> which was receiued on a certaine day, and in a certaine place. The king hereupon presently sent <hi>Xa-Tamascooli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beague,</hi> his chiefe fauourite, to will <hi>Ferrat Can,</hi> for very important affaires, for the determining of which his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence was requisite, to repaire to the Court; which hee excused, through his indisposition, which he said to bee such, that he could not possibly trauell: so that persisting in that deniall, when <hi>Xa-Tamas Coolibeague</hi> perceiued that he would not be perswaded, he returned with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the king; who assuring himselfe the more by the denial, of the former related accusations, instantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his guard of twelue thousand <hi>Courtchies</hi> to be in a readinesse; with which, and a thousand of the <hi>Xa-Hamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaes</hi> he vsed such celerity, that he preuented the newes of his comming, and was sooner arriued at <hi>Ferrats</hi> house then he had almost opinion that his messenger had beene returned: yet, although amazed with his owne guiltinesse, and the kings sudden comming, he made shift to make great shew of the indisposition which hee had so long counterfeited.</p>
            <p>The king, as soone as he came vnto him, said; that hee had taken a great iourney to visit him in his sicknesse, and to bring him the cure thereof; and hauing commanded all out of the Chamber, but themselues onely alone (as the king himselfe told me) he vsed such like speeches vnto him: Father,<note place="margin">

               </note> I do acknowledge, that first from God, then from you, these fortunes which now I haue, haue receiued their being; And I know, that as a man, I may both erre in my merit to God, and in my well deseruing of your seruice. But my intention, I can assure you, is most perfect in both: the time of my establishment in my estate, hath beene so
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17801:32"/>
small, that I could scarce vse it sufficiently to performe my generall duty towards my people, ouer whom (by Gods permission) I am appoynted; much lesse to prouide for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular satisfaction, as I mind, and will doe; which you principally, as a Father to me, both in your yeares, and my election should haue borne withal. But since some ill spirit hath had power to mis-leade your wisedome, so far as to make you forget your great vertue; you shall once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue wholesome counsell from me, as I haue done often from you: And because that <hi>all counsels, as well in publicke, as priuate deliberations, require a reposed spirit, free, and pure from wrath, feare, all perturbation or perticular interest; for a troubled mind is more apt to erre, then to aduse iustly, and hath more need of proper medicines for it selfe, then it hath properly in it selfe to apply any comfort to others; and is fitter to receiue, then to giue counsell: from which, as from a great and violent current, are caried all those errours and disorders which are brought vpon rash deliberations, the which haue euer long repentances, and disasters, as the perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their hauing bene; and are most of all detestably blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when such an imprudency is accompanied with that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite damage, as to thinke of alteration in a state, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceede without in-iustice, seeleratenesse, bloud, and a thousand mischiefes: an act in it selfe wonderfull difficult, wonderfull wicked, and proceeding from an incomparable vile quality. But hee that can restraine himselfe from being transported by vntemperate apetites, and can dominate his passions, and giue a iust rule to himselfe, to his cupidities and desires, doth euer giue the best time to all deliberations, by mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating heat and fury; and so altereth all counsell, from that nature which it receiueth, from an vnquiet and troubled mind</hi>: Which if you had done, you would not haue entred into a thought onely of so dangerous an action against your selfe, nor so dishonourable as to haue machinated the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17801:33"/>
ruine and trouble of your owne King, Friend, &amp; Country; which though it be palesated, it is but to my selfe only, who rather desire to chastice you as a friend, with good admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, then by rigour. Therfore, though it be <hi>euer incident to all men, to haue this great defect, to feare chiefely nearest dangers, and to esteeme much lesse, then they ought, of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> Yet bee you most assured, that the perill which you might feare from my person, is much lesse then that which you had throwne your selfe into, if you had, or should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute your enterprizes. From my person you shall neuer, (except by great constraint from your selfe) looke for any thing of other condition, then a true Princely loue, and a Royall regard of your seruices: In the other course, you called against my will, vpon your selfe, the rigor of Iustice, and fury of the sword, which in the warre consumeth all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. And because <hi>in that aduersity which a mans minde brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vpon himselfe, the feares and terrours are euer greater then the euils which concurre with them</hi>; be you of good comfort without the feeling onely of any such conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thing, and call strength from your minde to your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that you may endure to go with me to <hi>Hisphaan,</hi> where you shall haue cause to digest all these melancholies. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> neither excused, nor confessed; but indifferently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the king, as sory to haue giuen cause of offence, and infinitely reioycing (as hee seemed) that the king had so royally pacified himselfe with him: and not daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to go with the king, desired him to vse some few daies in the visiting of the Countrey; in which time, hee hoped that God, and the comfort of his presence, would raise him from his infirmity. The king certainly (as I before said) was by all necessity in the world, either forced to execute him, or to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile him perfectly vnto him: for any midle course had but made him desperate, and aggrauated all sort of perill, which he might haue feared from him; his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17801:33"/>
already done, his valour and vertue were of great moment to perswade the king to the easier way; being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his owne excellent mind, which I haue seene the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest proofes of, that may bee brought forth by Prince, or man liuing.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ferrat Can</hi> (who knew, that <hi>true iustice neuer weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth offences, and deserts, but seuerally, and without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingling them together, rewardeth the one, and chasticeth the other; and that benefites are more easier forgotten, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries</hi>) feeling the weight of his offence, and measuring the kings heart by his owne, gaue the wickednesse of his minde power ouer his vertue; And, though hee seemed altered to all good intentions, yet his heart was still swollen with that poyson which shortly brought him to destruction. The king hauing staid some eight, or ten dayes in the Countrey, was sooner hastened thence, then hee thought, by the newes of the Queenes death, who was deceased by a sudden and violent sicknesse, after his departure: so that with great speede, taking <hi>Ferrat</hi> with him; and leauing Lieu-tenant in the Countrey, for <hi>Ferrat, Mahomet Shefia,</hi> he returned to <hi>Hisphaan</hi>; where, after some dayes spent in sorrow, for his great losse, hee sent to <hi>Alexander,</hi> the other <hi>Can</hi> of the <hi>Georgians,</hi> to demand his daughter, by that meanes to binde againe that league, which might haue beene dissolued by the death of the other Queene: In that Embassage went <hi>Xa-Tamas Coolibeague,</hi> who returned with the Lady within few moneths.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, the brother to that king of <hi>Corasan,</hi> who had so royally and carefully brought vp the king of <hi>Persia,</hi> when he fled from the wrath of his father, rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his brother, slue him, and all his children; but onely one; whose tutors fled with him into the mountaines, &amp; so escaped the present danger, &amp; persecution of that tyrant.

Diuers other also, as they had been in estimation or fauour with the old king, fearing for that, the violence of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent authority, and others, onely discontented with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, and the wicked meanes of it, fled into <hi>Persia</hi>; by whom the king hauing largely and perfectly vnderstood the state of things, hauing so faire a way both to shew an infinite royall point of gratitude to that one poore poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the murdered king, for great obligations to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and withall, to assure himselfe in future times and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, from that certaine enemy, which had euer hung, like a dangerous cloud ouer his state, vsually breaking into terrible tempests, as it was, or should bee carried against him by the breath of the <hi>Turke</hi>: though he knew those <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> so obstinate enemies to his Gouernment, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if they had the most odious reasons of dis-union amongst themselues, yet that they would combine against him; without reposing himselfe vpon any hope to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by those partialities, which the refuged vnto him see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to promise; but confident onely in the iustice of the cause which he intended, in his owne force, vertue, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and fortune; hee resolued to gather his Armie, and to goe for those parts; to which hee was, besides his owne disposition, mightily instigated by <hi>Ferrat Can,</hi> whose feare &amp; ambition, being without meanes of end, gaue him assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by the place of Generall which hee held, to haue some faire opportunity giuen him to end them, with the kings ruine, and without his owne danger.</p>
            <p>Thirty thousand men the king tooke with him for that warre, twelue thousand Harquebusiers, which bare long peeces, halfe a foote longer then our Muskets, sleightly made; the bullet of the height of Caliuer, which they vse well and certainely: and eighteene thousand horse, which may seeme a smal troop in these places, where the wars are carried with innumerable multitudes. But the king of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siaes</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:17801:34"/>
iudgement agreeth with that of the <hi>best experienced Captains, that multitudes are confusers of orders, &amp; deuourers of time, and of those meanes which nourish the wars; and are good for no other vse, but to make a war soone breake off, and to consume the world.</hi> This Armie being chosen out from all his forces, of elected good men, hee carried into <hi>Corasan</hi> with wonderfull expedition; &amp; had taken it vtterly vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, if <hi>Ferrat Cans</hi> aduertisement had not preuented his celerity; who had not onely giuen notice to them, but to the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Tauris,</hi> of the kings purpose, and his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, promising them a certaine victory, and the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of the kings owne person. A dayes iourney the king passed peaceably into the Countrey, without the sight onely of an enemy: himselfe with fiue thousand of the best men, accompanied with diuers of the principal lest, was a kinde of vauntguard to the rest, which followed with <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Can, Zulphir Can,</hi> and <hi>Oliuer di-Can,</hi> which marched softly. The king by that meanes, was farre aduanced; and being almost assured in himselfe, that through the celerity of his comming, he should find yet no enemy sufficiently able to resist him, &amp; more confidently, by the perswasion of <hi>Ferrat Can</hi>: some sixe hundred horse, vnder the leading of <hi>Vseph-Aga</hi> (which were sent to discouer before the kings troope) fell vpon fifty thousand of the enemy; vpon which sight he would faine haue retired: but being so farre inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that he could not, and vnable to resist so great a force, with the losse of almost all his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, he was beaten back to the Kings grosse: who by the dust rising a farre off, and the great noyse following, imagining what it was indeed, with a great &amp; ready courage prouided himselfe ready to fight, and dispatched Messenger vpon Messenger, to command <hi>Ferrat Can</hi> to aduance vnto him. To the first <hi>Ferrat</hi> answered, that it was but a troope of some few ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals, and desired the king to march on, and not trouble
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17801:35"/>
himselfe nor his Army, and to diuers the like. At the last, when yong <hi>Hassan-Can</hi> came from the king, and told him the kings danger, and that certainely the whole force of the enemy had charged him; he began to shew feare, &amp; to call a Councell of the Commanders, then to know what they were best to resolue of, for the sauing of the Army, since the king had so rashly lost himselfe. Which when <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer di-Can</hi> heard, vpbraiding him of treason, called vpon all those which loued the king to follow him; and putting spurs to his horse, being followed by <hi>Courtchibassa,</hi> &amp; most of the kings Guard, &amp; many other, with all possible haste, speeded to the king; who, by this time, was forced to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine, and retire, as well as he could, without disorder, or shew of feare. But when this Troope, of <hi>Oliuer di-Can</hi> was seene, his men receiued new courage; and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which depended more vpon <hi>Ferrats</hi> treason, then their owne valour, began to be exceeding amazed, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it had bin the whole Army, and that <hi>Ferrat</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed his treason from his Maister to them: Wherefore slacking their first fury, and rather standing at a gaze, then fighting, the king commanded <hi>Vseph-Aga</hi> to charge them throughly afresh, and not to giue them time to take new courage: which hee did, with so good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that lighting vpon the vsurper of <hi>Corasan,</hi> and his sonne, hee slue them both with his owne handes; from which grew the first maine flight of the enemy, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the victory for the king. The chase was despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly followed, so that in that battell, &amp; the chase were slain 30000 men, with the vsurper king and his son; and diuers of the principall of the country taken. That night the king pitched his Tents in the place of the battell; and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by <hi>Oliuer di-Can,</hi> and the whole army, which cried out, with open mouth, of <hi>Ferrats</hi> treason, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pering the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew of his indignation with a compassionat feeling

Which when he had said, he gaue <hi>Oliuer Di-Can</hi> the Generalship of his Army, and appointed him to do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution vpon <hi>Ferrat,</hi> who being resolued of that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which his double offence had brought vpon him, attended ready in his Tent, without feare, to die, or desire to liue; and there receiued that punishment, which was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his excellent parts, if hee had made that true vse of them which he should.</p>

               <hi>Zulpher Can,</hi> his brother, knowing that he had as highly and as much offended as his brother had, yet wanting the same courage to receiue the iudgement, which he had to offend, fled to the port of the Kings Tent, and there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated himselfe on the ground; whence being called by <hi>Oliuer Di-Can,</hi> he denyed to die any where, but there; that the King when hee should come forth, might tread vpon that bloud, which had so vilely, and vndeseruedly offended him: which being brought to the King, by a Page that wished well to <hi>Zulpher,</hi> and had some good hope of the Kings nature, that hee might doe the poore Prince some good; after a little pause, the King came forth, and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Zulpher</hi> lying grouelling on the ground, pittied him, and despising, withall, his little valour: Behold, said he, to those which stood by, how weake a foundation reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath, which is not erected from a mans owne vertue.

This man was so great yesterday, that you all honored him, and now lyeth despised before you all, through his owne wickednesse. He hath bene aduanced by me, for his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vertues, and with the death of his brother, he doth shew you all, that no worthinesse of his owne, but that which abounded in his brother, if hee could haue made good vse of it, gaue him courage also to seeme capable of those honours which I bestowed on him. <hi>Zulpher,</hi> God forgiueth mee as great sinnes hourely, which I commit against him, as thy fault can be to me: and since it hath pleased him, that I hold so great a place by him here, I will also vse the example of his infinite goodnesse, for the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of this mercy, and referre my vengeance to him, and giue thee time to repent; and the rather, because thy abiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse taketh all apprehension from me of cause to doubt thee: <hi>Hee neuer dareth hurt a King, which feareth to die.</hi> And remember that this is the first day of thy life, in which thou must take more vertuous waies, then thou hast hitherto walked in, that I may haue honour by the mercy which I haue shewed thee, and profite by thy good serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and thy selfe, maist cast away farre from thee, by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and good deedes, the shamefull memory which men will haue of thy past wicked Treason. This was the end of that great and foule conspiracy, which gaue great hope to the Kings enemies; and ending by such a prouidence, was the meanes of the Kings greater and better security, which could neuer haue bene perfect so long as so great a man had liued, both hauing cause to feare, &amp; by that giuing continuall cause to be feared. Next day, the King mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched farther into the Countrey, and so daily aduanced on without obstacle; the keyes of all their Townes meeting him by the way; and at the last, an Embassage from the whole state, with a generall submission: which when hee had receiued, hauing spent some time, in the setling of

those men also, (who were a great number) falling downe vpon their faces, confessed to the King; and that their long silence had giuen the Gouernour the more boldnesse to vse the vtermost of extortion, and tyrannous exaction vpon them.</p>
            <p>The Gouernour denied some, maintained other to bee done vpon iust causes: but all so confusedly, and with so vnstable a fashion of proceeding, as hee bewrayed his owne guiltinesse: notwithstanding the king stayed his iudgement, either of him or the causes, vntill another day of hearing.</p>

to make those the maine helpers of my designe, I left no sort of fashion forgotten which might procure mee fauour from all the other: though I soone found their appearances answered not with their mindes, which were onely contained from ill demonstrations against mee, by the Kings fauour to mee, and their feare of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him; not onely through the ordinary enuy which followeth all Courts, but by the great hatred which they had to the very name of a Christian, beeing in their soules <hi>Turkes</hi>: though not daring to palesate it for their owne certaine danger.</p>
            <p>For the king knowing how potent a vniter of mens mindes the selfe-same Religion is for the tranquility of an Estate: and the like dis-vniter seuerall Religions are for the disturbance of the peace of an Estate, hee is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding curious and vigilant to suppresse, through all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, that Religion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which followeth the interpretation of <hi>Vssen</hi> and <hi>Omar,</hi> and to make his people cleaue to that of <hi>Aly</hi>: Not (as I iudge) through any Conscience, which carrieth him more to the one then the other; but first to extirpate intrinsicke factions, then to secure himselfe the more firmely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Turke,</hi> who beeing head of that part which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth <hi>Omar</hi> and <hi>Vssen,</hi> should haue too powerfull a way into his Countrey, if his peoples hearts were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined vnto him by the force of Religion. Therefore hee doth not onely striue to roote it out, but to defile it, and make it odious; hauing in vse, once a yeare, with great solemnity, to burne publiquely, as maine Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, the Images of <hi>Vssen</hi> and <hi>Omar</hi>: then doth hee cause his great men publiquely (in scorne of their insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution) to goe with a Flagon of Wine, carryed by a Foote-man, and at euery Village, or where they see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Assembly of people, to drinke; which himselfe also
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17801:42"/>
vseth, not for the loue of the Wine, but to scandalize so much more the contrary Religion: that by such a kinde of prophaning of it, they may weare the respect of it out of the peoples heartes: Which when it fayleth with reuerence in Religion, the pillers thereof are vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken. Yet (as I say) there are of the very grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, exceeding precise <hi>Turkes,</hi> if they durst do other for their owne fortune sake, then couer, with all artifice, that infection.</p>
            <p>Ten dayes I was betweene <hi>Casbin</hi> and <hi>Cassan,</hi> where arriued, I receiued more gracious demonstrations from the King, then I could hope for, or wish: beeing farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my present merit, and my iudgement how to deserue it at all.</p>
            <p>Foure dayes his Maiestie stayed there, after my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; in which time there passed many Triumphes at <hi>giuoco-di-canna</hi> in the day, &amp; good fire-works in the night: at which I was euer present with himselfe, with no lesse respect, then if I had been his brother, as he also called me, and continued that name afterward, all the time of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Persia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second day of his Iourney, from thence, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <hi>Hisphaan,</hi> hee called mee vnto him, my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and my Interpreter; and (after some few discourses) hee began to tell vs the whole history of those his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which I haue discoursed: and ioyned that hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, the <hi>Turke</hi> had sent him a faire sword (hee did beleeue) to cut off his head withall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, if <hi>Ferrat Cans</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had well succeeded: for after the Messenger arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at <hi>Tauris,</hi> vnderstanding how God his great proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, had not onely mightely preserued, but giuen him that famous victory ouer his enemies, he had sent for new order to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which came to no other end, but to call him back againe. But the best was, the more
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17801:43"/>
the Prince hated him, the more his subiects loued him, hauing receiued newes at <hi>Cassan,</hi> of ten thousand soules of <hi>Courdins</hi> which had abandoned their possessions vnder the <hi>Turke,</hi> and required some waste land of him to inhabit in; which he had giuen them.</p>
            <p>And though this discourse opened somewhat largely the Kings heart vnto mee, I durst bee no bolder, at that time, then to say, It was euer, almost impossible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue a quyet amity betweene two so great Potentates, as himselfe, and the <hi>Turke</hi>; especially beeing so neere neighbours: that I doubted not, but his Maiesty, in his great wisedome, prouided his Counsell and strength al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready against any danger which might grow from him, of which there was no present doubt, as long as hee was so powerfully diuerted by the warres of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; which if they were ended, I saw no Obligation of faith, or any thing else, which could secure his Maiesty from those Armes, which had beene euer so ready a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his State, in all occasions; especially now that his Maiesties vertue, and fortune ministred to the <hi>Turkes</hi> will too great maine causes; First to stop the course of his too fast rising greatnesse, which hee could by no reason wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly suffer; Then to recouer his reputation, which his Maiesty had taken from him, by assubiecting the <hi>Tartars,</hi> which were vnder his protection. And if with both these hee saw his subiects also fall from him to his Maiesty, in so great troopes, it might bee a mighty effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-reason to hasten him to a conclusion, vpon indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tearmes of those warres in <hi>Hungary</hi>; his Maiesty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much more dangerous vnto him, not onely through his power, the reputation of his late victories, and such a floud of fortune, ioyned to his great vertue and wisdome, but also by the symbolizing of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which would more facilitate an entry into his state, then the sword, when there
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17801:43"/>
should grow no more mutation in the maine points of gouernement, lawes, nor orders, but the person of the Prince onely. The obstinate warres, and resistances of the progresse of the one and the other, betweene the <hi>Turkes</hi> and the <hi>Christians,</hi> grew from the maine alterations of all Lawes, Orders, and forme of gouernment, with the vtter ruine of the conquered, being so diuerse in all those; and more in the principall point of religion, by which he was euermore assured of vs, generally infestuous to the very apprehension of his Subiects. But his Maiesty, from whom there was none of these generall dangers, was, questionlesse, the more perticularly feared by him: <hi>And euer hee that is feared wrongeth his iudgement, if hee liue into great and carelesse security.</hi> I concluded, it would please his Maiesty to pardon me that I said so much, that if I had erred, it was in my iudgement, not in my zealous affection vnto him; neither had I presumed to looke into such high matters, if his Maiesty, by his discourse, had not directed my sight; which if it had bene amisse, his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties benignity and great wisedome could pardon the fault, for the true affection which caused it.</p>
            <p>He answered, that he was so far from mis-liking my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of speech that he thanked me for it, desiring me to continue it. <hi>For Princes (said hee) are, indeed more then men, when they find faithfull friends which will freely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise them; and lesse them men when they are without such: the brightnesse of their greatnesse so dimming their sight, that they haue much more neede of helpe, then priuate men; who being conuersant in all things, gather experience of euery thing, which a Prince cannot haue; Nature, onely, bringing forth a man, his perfection following by his owne vertue, learning and experience; the two first a Prince might haue, the last hardly, and euer vnperfect.</hi> Which made him euer carefully desire such, friends, as might minister a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17801:44"/>
faithfull helpe to that defect; but because we are now in iourney we shall leaue those things for a more reposed time, to be spoken of at <hi>Hisphaan,</hi> where we shall haue leasure enough both to deliberate and resolue of some good things; and with that called some other, who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him with discourses of Hunting, and Hauking, in which he is much delighted, and vseth them with great magnificence: Neuer going to any of those sports, but that he carrieth forth aboue fiue hundred dogges, and as many Hauks, nothing rising before him but it is game. For flies he hath sparrowes; for Birds, Hobbies and Marlins; for the greatest sort some Hawke or other; and for Roe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare Eagles; hee hath particular <hi>Agaes</hi> for his Hawkes and Dogges, and other Officers to them a great number.</p>
            <p>The next day, I singled out <hi>Oliuer Di-Can,</hi> with whom, (after a few complements) I communicated the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with me, of his first troubles, and latter fortunes; extolling his Maiesty as it was fit; and besides, giuing the greatest honour to himselfe, without flattery, that I could deuise; then I told him of my answere to the King, and on purpose I said, I feared, that it might turne to my harme, being newly planted in the Kings fauour, subiect to the enuy of the Court, and wanting a tongue to speake for my selfe: and that to entermeddle in so great and perri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matters, it could not choose but awake some couered malice, to take occasion to worke me some damage. But my confidence was such, first in the Heroycke minde of the King himselfe, then in the generous disposition of his excellency, that I should bee protected from perill for this fault, as I would preserue my selfe with more cautel heereafter.</p>
            <p>Hee answered me, that the Kings affection vnto me was such, that no man durst lift vp a thought against me: which the Court knew well. For himselfe, as he knew not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17801:44"/>
the conditions of our Courts, so I might mistake those of theirs: if enuy bare so great a sway with vs, wee had lighter Princes, and men of more presumption. In this Court there was not a Gentleman but the King: the rest were shadowes which moued with his body. But in this which I had said to the King, if I had entended it, to moue him to warre in so fit a time against the <hi>Turke,</hi> I had done well; and assured mee that both he, and <hi>Xa-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-Coolibeague</hi> would with all their powers concurre with me to bring it to an essentiall deliberation; though, said he, there be three dogges, <hi>Haldenbeague, Bastan-Aga,</hi> and <hi>Courtchy Bassa,</hi> that will mainely oppose themselues against it: yet in the conscience of my duty, which I owe to his Maiesty, I assure my selfe, that there is no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure way, either for the preseruation of his person, or state, but that. Therefore since you haue begunne in so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py an houre, to breake the Ice of so great and so good an enterprise, follow it without feare, since God will prosper your good intention in it, and we will second you, with all the strength and industry which wee haue. This was all which I desired, to be assured of some friend; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially such a one, as might haue both opinion and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of wisedome and fauour with the King. For being a stranger, if I had vndertaken the bearing of so weighty a businesse my selfe alone, I should hardly haue escaped the being ouer-weighed with it, knowing <hi>that the best proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions haue euer oppositions, mens humours neuer concurring all to one end, and the nature of men being alwaies opposite to a strangers aduancement</hi>: Which since it must proceed in such a place from a speciall act of his owne vertue, which could neuer be produced without a subiect to worke by, the next way to wash away insensibly such a growing repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, was to keep me from any other meanes of establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then bare <hi>Fauor, which as it is very transitory in priuate

my particular obligation to his Maiesty was so great, that I was bound, not onely, to say what I thought fit for his seruice; but to do as much, as my life might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish for the same. More-ouer being emboldned by his royall gracious answer vnto me vpon the way, (which I did take for a kind of commandement) I would presume to say some-thing more largely then I did then, of that which I tooke to concerne his Maiesty, as much as any thing else could. Neither would I speake any thing of other condition, then such, as he in his great iudgement should find so well grounded; that nothing could bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, either to the iust cause, honour, vtility, or facility of the enterprise, which I would propose. And because I would cleare all clouds, which might hang about it, my selfe which propounded it, was such, that I was onely a shadow, which, by the vrging of my owne nature, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, should follow the body of his victories, rather then haue, or hope, for any other perticular interest in them my selfe. For the first points, <hi>There could no deliberation bee grounded vpon a greater foundation of equity, then that which had his end onely directed to the recouery of that, which was by force and violence vsurped from his State: nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more honourable for a Prince then to bee able, without hazard, not onely to reuenge priuate and publicke wrongs; but to recouer their members againe to his seates, by his wisedome and vertue, which haue bene separate either by the defect, or fortune of his Predecessors</hi>; All this, both publicke and priuate profite, followed so great an encrease of State (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing in all points the force of his State) and his poore Subiects, which were throwne out of their possessions, either through their true deuotion to his Maiesty, which could giue them no peace vnder another gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or through the extreme tyranny of the <hi>Turke,</hi> should be recouered againe to their owne, with his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

The facility shewed it selfe diuers waies; principally in his owne fortune, wisedome, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; against which, there was no likely resistance, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when there was no equall obstacle; then the reputation of his late victories, ioyned with the other, would find, or make a way through all difficulties; then his <hi>Militia</hi> which was fresh and vncorrupted; then the incapacity of the <hi>Turke,</hi> his corruptions of gouernment, want of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, sundry rebellions, and distractions from any possibility of being able to make any potent resistance against his Maiesties proceedings, by his warres in <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which his Maiesty might assure the continuance of; if it pleased him to inuite the Princes Christian to his amity, which hee should offer vpon that condition: by which also, hee should receiue one other worthy benefite fit for such excelling parts, as hee was most richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant in, not to conclude the true knowledge of them, in that one corner of the world: but with making these great Princes knowne vnto himselfe, hee should make his owne worthinesse, like-wise, knowne vnto them. Neither, (as I said at the first to his Maiesty) though these were great points to moue so high a spirit, intending to glory, and great things, as his was, that they were so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant as other were.

For what likely-hood was there, that a Gentleman of quality, without some great disaster fallen him, should take such a voyage, so full of dangers and expences, vpon a fame of a Prince, spread by ordinary Merchants? Since I know, hee could neuer haue spoken with men of better quality in those parts, which could haue knowne your Maiesty: And if it were true, that such a motion, onely, had brought him; why should hee not giue time to the growing of his better fortunes, by your Maiesties Munificencies and fauours; without drawing himselfe into the danger, to bee a perswader of a perrilous enterprise: then which, hee cannot bee so ignorant, as to vnderstand no way to bee so precipitious for himselfe; But because it is inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, hee must do it; without regard to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, to whom hee is onely, newly, bound, for present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites; which hee careth but to enioy, vntill he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled you in his designes: and then will hee relye vpon those, to whom hee oweth greater obedience, for more permanent benefits, and greater through so great a merite.

and all kind of strength against him, if hee should breake the faith of his truce, or moue against you hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. That it is iust, honourable, and profitable for your Maiesty, perhaps I may agree; though it bee a question, whether it be iust, or honourable, to breake a peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a iust occasion giuen. But howsoeuer, it is more wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for your Maiesty to find a better, and more fit time which shall furnish you with all necessary prouisions for so great an enterprise: And further, I say, if the <hi>Turkes</hi> gouernement bee corrupted, giue it more time, and the sicknesse will encrease. Is hee incapable? his yeares are too many to make him amend; therefore by giuing your selfe time, you loose nothing; he will be incapable still. But <hi>Sinan Bassa</hi> was a great name; So was <hi>Mustapha</hi>; and so was <hi>Osman</hi>; and so hath hee many now; so that his state doth neither stand nor decline, with his defects, as long as hee hath worthy men to maintaine it.

your Artillery: all which must bee had for a warre; and though your fortune, and the nature of the country (which hath no strong places) did not require them against the <hi>Tartars,</hi> yet of necessity, you must haue them against the <hi>Turke,</hi> who hath a Fortresse in <hi>Tauris, Tifflis</hi> and <hi>Vannes,</hi> strong places; and neuer moueth his Armies, but full of Artillery: which you must also haue, if you meane to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed honourably, and with condigne fortune against him.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, for you to send, and begge an Amity of the Christian Princes, what a sit perswasion is it for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties greatnesse? which notwithstanding, if you were compelled by necessity, somewhat from your selfe, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity would make it tollerable: But for you to seeke them which haue need of you, there is so litle reason, that he hath sinned against your power, person, and state, which hath propounded it. Your Maiesty may, in your too great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, passe ouer your iust indignation for such acoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: but we know what it meriteth.</p>
            <p>There is behinde you, <hi>Lar,</hi> and <hi>Ormus,</hi> the one a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome fomentated as a bar between you and the <hi>Portugals:</hi> and the other, which is vsurped, from a king anciently tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to your predecessors. Whilst your Maiesty maketh your selfe ready for the greater, begin with the lesser en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise. Nothing will giue you more honour then that; First, to vindicate those places, in which your religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; and by that, iustifie the more whatsoeuer you shal enterprize. If this Christian can giue you these; if he can giue you aboundance of all other wants, if he can giue you Hostages from his Kings, that they shall not in <hi>Hungary</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but in other places also, fasten vpon that huge body of the <hi>Turke</hi>; and that they shall neither make peace nor truce with him, except your Maiesties consent concurre, that nothing may be defectiue in so great an action: And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17801:48"/>
that your Maiesty may be secure, that the weight of all shal not wholly fall vpon your selfe; then your Maiesty shall haue some foundation to deliberate on. Otherwise, I thinke neither his perswasions to be harkened to, nor himselfe to be retained: who sheweth by his sudden beginning, that no fauour, grace, nor benefits from your Maiesty, can acquiet his mind from stirring you against your owne peace, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and security of your state and person.</p>

               <hi>Oliuer di-Can</hi> answered, that there was difference between a proposition which was only moued to be councelled of, and a perswasion. That he thought I councelled nothing, (much lesse perswaded) but onely propounded that to the king, which if it were not then fit to bee executed, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that I knew not in the present condition of the kings affaires; yet I deserued not so bitter a censure: since <hi>Princes ought to heare all, and elect the best; and for that elections sake, to animate all to speake freely.</hi> And because it hath pleased his Maiesty to giue you, and me, and all of vs, leaue to speake, as it is all our duties to say what wee thinke: so our places are of such a condition, that our powers are nothing in resoluing: but onely in discoursing before his Maiesty, those things which in the truth of our consciences, wee thinke meetest for his seruice. And if conuenient and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary things be propounded, by a Christian, by a Iew, or by the worst man liuing; not onely in religion, but the very disposition of his life, I see no cause why you, nor I, nor any should reiect that which is good for the illes sake; since <hi>Princes must, and ought, make their benefite of all men: not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding what they are, but how they may serue them.</hi> This Christian hath come from farre, and through great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (he faith) through his affection, growing from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling fame of his Maiesty; and should not I thinke, that his glory is worthy to be carried as farre as tongues of men goe? And shall not I thinke, also, that a Merchant speaking
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17801:48"/>
of his vertues, is not inabled beyond his spirit, raised by such a subiect, to shew it like it selfe, not like his owne Merchandize? And why should I iudge him sent by any, when hee hath not assumed to himselfe the honour, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor priuiledges of an <hi>Embassdour</hi> in a strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where no man would neglect any thing which might aduance his quality, or security? But hee hath onely put himselfe vpon the Kings fauour; and what hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, hath proceeded rather from a minde, to merit by some good act, that fauour, then a demonstration of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dependance: for hauing giuen himselfe to the king, to serue him without limitation of time, but as long as it shal please his Maiesty to serue himselfe of him, hee sheweth plainely, that hee hath included his hope of fortune, and benefite by this, or any other action, within the compasse only of his Maiesties gracious benignity. And seruing his Maiesty in this, or any other imployment, which his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty will vouchsafe to make vse of him, If he do it as a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he hath no hope, but in the merit of his owne vertue, which must be discerned and rewarded by his maiesty; if he serue as a Prince of his Maiesty (as now by his great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificency hee beareth the title and place; the same vertue must euer confirme and aduance his fauour, and the same king must iudge and reward it. And this I haue said in a double duty; first, to maintaine the act of his Maiesties great iudgment, which cannot mistake it selfe in the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution worthily of his fauors; then in that of hospitality, to answere iustly for a Gentleman, come to our home, where wee are all bound to defend him from wrong: especially bearing about him so great a priuiledge as a true affection to our king.</p>
            <p>But now to speake of the proposition, the <hi>Viseirs</hi> obiections against it: as I do thinke them worthy of so wise a man; yet because <hi>particular factions doe sometimes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17801:49"/>
blinde men, both in councelling, and deliberating</hi>: So questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse his great iudgement hath beene much clouded with some of those; which haue made him erre directly in the iudgement of some things; and to misconceiue of the maine purpose generally of the proposition. For <hi>no mans intention is to be iudged to stretch beyond possibility</hi>: So that whatsoeuer was propounded to his Maiesty as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, honourable, and profitable for him, and his state, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded withall that well-vnderstanding intention, that it would please his maiesty to prouide, in the firmnesse of his wisedome and councell, condignely for it: if he want trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to gather it; if he want munition &amp; Artilery, to make quantity of both: which must indeed require a time for the act; not the resolution vpon the act. Without which his Maiesty (as he shal haue no great cause himselfe) &amp; his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters will be lesse diligent in the expedition of all such prouisions; of which (to say the truth) that huge masse of money is of least importance; his Maiesty beeing able to make in the time of this <hi>Turkes</hi> distraction (and if his whole power were also vnited) a sufficient Army of his <hi>Timarri,</hi> and such as hee already payeth, vpon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, to proceede with any great designe against him. For admit hee should (vpon the mouing of the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) come to any foule conditions of peace in <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as it is vnlike that hee will; yet there must bee so much time betweene the proposition and concluding of the peace, and remouing of his Army thence, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it hither, that any great thing will bee first ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, before any obstacle will appeare against it. But in reason, hee should rather endure any vnreasonable losse this way, then the least there: For (besides that his principall parts are altogether disposed on that side; in so much that the danger of <hi>Hungary</hi> doth extend it selfe to <hi>Constantinople</hi>) Wee are euen of the selfe same,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17801:49"/>
or little different religion, so that the warres cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with a mortall hatred and desire of extirpation, which beareth with it so much the lesse danger: and as it is the more facile to be satisfied, so easier and lesse perillous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will euer end it. That <hi>Tauris, Tistis, Vannes,</hi> are strong places, I do not denie it; but withal I know that the strength of no place can maintain it selfe against the power &amp; furie, and the ordinarie miseries brought by the wars, without a certaine succour; which I cannot see how they can be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of. The <hi>Tartars</hi> you say are newly conquered, and will rebell with such a great opportunitie: surely I take that opportunitie the onely direct meanes to answere them, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing breeding discontentments to a dangerous breaking forth, so much as idlenesse, and the continuall sight of that which they take to be their oppression.</hi> Therefore his Maiestie hauing an Armie of thirty thousand men there, and from thence draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth thirtie thousand <hi>Tartars</hi> of the best able for the warres, the Prouince must be most assured; the meanes and chiefe actors of innouation being in his Maiesties Armie; and their wiues, children, and parents, in pawne with their countrey for their true seruing his Maiestie in his warres: which he did think so necessarie for the King to vndertake, that he made no difference betweene putting his state in extreme perill, and the not vndertaking of them; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selling his Maiestie to doe in that point, as all wise Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vse to doe, not onely to haue regard to the present euils but to the future, and to repaire them with all industrious prouidence: because that by seeing them, and preuenting them a farre off, the remedie might be applied with great facilitie and good effect; but by expecting them vntill they beare downe all by their great waight with them, their cure will be taken &amp; vsed out of time, the sicknesse being growne to incurable tearmes: as the Physitions say of the Hecticke seauer, which in his first entrance into the bodie is easie to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17801:50"/>
be cured and hard to be knowne, but through the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time with the rancor of the disease by not hauing known it, &amp; applied remedie in the beginning, it changeth the first order, and groweth it selfe facile to be knowne and impossible to be remedied: so doth it occurre in matters of state; for fore-seeing with wise prouidence, the euils which rise toward it, there is no difficultie in auoiding them; but when from either neglect or ignorance of preuenting them they palisate themselues to euery mans vnderstanding, there is no more remedie familiar with our reason securely auail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able against them. Which maketh me bee bold to say, that since the inconueniences which his Maiestie must suffer by the Turke are so apparant, he must resolue and strengthen his minde and meanes to remoue them, and not to giue them greater power to follow him by auoyding a warre: since you may know that the warre cannot be absolutely taken away, but deferred only with the enemies aduantage. Neyther will I euer be aduised by that which is alwaies in the mouth of the wise men of these daies, which is to enioy the benefit of time; but will say and euer thinke, that <hi>Euery Prince, and euery man should make vse of his owne vertue and wisdom, seeing time driuing euery thing before it doth ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce as often good as ill, &amp; ill as good.</hi> And why it should at any time diminish the reputation of his Maiesties great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to inuite the Princes Christian to so honourable and great an action, I cannot discern, when <hi>it is one of the greatest foundations of a Princes reputation to raise himselfe to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test enterprises, in which his iudgement may not be mistaken in the possibilitie of effecting them.</hi> And since it is necessary for his Maiestie to combine himselfe with them for his owne strength and reputation, if eyther he attempt the Turke, or be attempted by him, why should it not bee more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and more facile for him, for the accomplishment of his ends, to speake vnto them in their necessitie (if there be
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17801:50"/>
any of eyther part) and so to linke himselfe the stronglier with them by such a bond; then in his owne necessitie, in which condition there is a great question whether he shall be heard. Lastly, how strange a conclusion you haue made, I will desire you to behold with better consideration. You will not haue the King to make warre with the Turke, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid expence of money and munition, where the best parts and most plentifull of both countries are confining, which would giue abundance, and cheaper liuing to an Armie; but you will haue him go to <hi>Larre,</hi> to <hi>Ormus,</hi> sterile coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries farre remoued, where the charges onely of supplying victuals to an Armie, would be of more cost then all other munition and expence of the Armie besides. And besides; there is no danger of the King of Spain, who hath euer held a fashion of maintaining himselfe rather then encreasing. Besides the nature of his force is of a contrarie qualitie to giue vs feare of his too great inlargement, hauing neither abundance of horse nor men, but only gallies which assure his forts, with which also he is sufficiently contented. And how wearying out a warre to his Maiesties treasure, and men, that must be where he must fight but at the enemies pleasure and aduantage, the strength of his enemie stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the Sea, in which the King hath no sort of shew of power, he submitted to his Maiesties wisest considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: besides the infinite danger by the nature of the lying of the state of the Turkes and the King of Spaines, and the essentiall of their potenties were of such a condition, that whatsoeuer was diminished from his Maiesties, or the King of Spaines, was an absolute addition to the Turke; who by that aduantage of the weakening each others for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, should haue a more facile entrie vpon any one or both of them. And that it was wel proued by his Maiesties prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, that there was not a more maine vpholder of the beginning, and foundation of their state nor manner
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17801:51"/>
of preseruing it (which was all they could doe) then that league which vnited both their forces euer against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemie. And now that God and the great vertue of his Maiestie had so augmented the limits of his dominion, that he had power ioyned with true iustice and necessitie, to recouer those vsurped Prouinces which the Turke held from him (In which action nothing could more secure him, then first, an assured relatiue friendship betweene the Princes Christian and him generally, and particularly the forces of the King of Spaynes by Sea in those parts) it should be a strange Counsell to perswade his Maiestie to make warre with him whom he had euer profited by, and to offend all in offending him; and voluntarily to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble the Turke in whatsoeuer hee would vndertake against him: which must needs be by all reason &amp; iudgement his enemy. Which made him beseech his Maiestie to continue that so commodious friendship vnto him, and to strengthen himselfe with new, to fomentate those rebellions, which were no rumours, (one of those that were in Armes being <hi>Moombaregue</hi> a Prince tributarie to his Maiesty; the others, though no men of great qualitie, yet of great happinesse in their proceedings) and to prouide for all things necessary for so great an enterprise: for which, though the Vicesire were otherwise perswaded, nothing did more facilitate the iudgement of his good successe, then the Prince of the Turkes owne incapacitie; <hi>Nothing hauing euer beene proued more certaine, then that the Ministers of any Prince do euer sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize with their Masters vertues or vices; and that men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary vertue with them, haue euer little power, or little time: suspition being the best preseruer of their defects, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aymeth at those who haue more vertue then themselues, as fearing them most.</hi> A discourse proued true by the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end of all those named, and by many examples which he would leaue vnrehearsed, as things that neuer

bare more credit then the faith of the hearer gaue them. And so left off, humbly beseeching his Maiesty to pardon his <hi>bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and freenes which were euer the birth of true zealous deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>: he had onely expressed what he thought, his Maiesty might please to resolue of that hee thought honourable, secure, and profitable for his state and person. The causes of his danger from the Turke he spake not of, first touched by me, and apparant to all. The king then comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded <hi>Baslan-Aga</hi> to speake freely also what he thought, who after a reuerence vnto him, hauing repeated the arguments past, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them all (as it is his fashion apparantly to offend no bodie: but what he doth in that qualitie is secretly) and then as though he meant no such matter, diuiding what he would speak into two points,<note place="margin">The great Chamberlai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This proposition by the wisedome of his Maiesty resting doubtful, so that none of vs by knowing which way his owne disposition inclineth, haue any sort of constraint, either by fearing to oppose our opinions against what his will intended, or by a desire to raise our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into a better conceit of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I say then that all warres are eyther made vpon the Confines of the States which moue them: or farre from the Confines of the maker of them, by penetrating further into the maine bodie of him vpon whom they are made. <hi>And it is not possible for any to vse great Armes or small a long time, which haue not a fountaine of great reuenewes from at home, and a foundation of great plentie in the field.</hi> For as without sinewes the members of this compact of our bodie cannot moue; and if they doe, shew a stirring onely, for a testimonie of their life, which may be in them; yet that mouing is vnperfect both in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and continuance: So Armes neyther can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17801:52"/>
neyther can they be appropriated to necessarie des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, nor maintained vnited in any enterprize without a Riuer of money which may refresh them in conuenient time, and make swimme after them munitions, victualles, and other necessarie prouisions both for the sustenance of euery particular bodie, and importing to the good purpose and effect of the mannagement of their Armes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the reuenewes of iust and good Princes, (as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the subiects from whom they are deriued) are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited; and drawing without measure for one yeare or two huge quantities of money out of their estates, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries will remaine poore and exhausted of gold and siluer. From whence proceedeth that warres of such a condition as cannot be ended neere at hand, but draw (through the necessitie of perfecting them well when they are once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun) the Prince and the Armie a farre off; neyther can be vndertaken nor continued, but by Princes who haue infinite treasures acumulated through long times prouidence, or neuer-ending mines (for other sort of ordinarie aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of what greatnesse soeuer it be, will be dried vp and vanish; and a short time bringeth it to an end) the times of peace gathering by minutes that which the warre spendeth by houres: and one yeare of warre consumeth the fruits of many yeares of peace. <hi>Mustapha Bashaw,</hi> when <hi>Soliman</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated of the warres which he made with our great king <hi>Ismael,</hi> told him that before he resolued of it, that there were foure torrents to be opened; the one of men, the other of victuals, the other of munition, the other of money: and in all he said well, but in the last best. For if euery sort of warre require mightie expence, questionlesse such a one doth it most, which is carried farre from your owne home, where the nourishment of your owne countrie may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister abundance and cheapnesse to your people: which the Turke proued true: for hauing vndertaken that warre
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17801:52"/>
more vpon the Confidence of his resolution then good Councel, being a Prince of so great power, he so consumed his treasure that hee was compelled to abase the allay of his Gold and Siluer: and for all that to raise the price to the double value: and to comport it with the falsification of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and many such great inconueniencies; for which the Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries rushed into strange mutinies, and many perrillous successes followed: yet had he <hi>Timarri</hi> as your Maiesty hath; but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the length &amp; quality of the war deuoured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faster the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their abilitie was to beare, the Prince was constrained if he would vse them, to giue them means of sustenance also: &amp; your Maiestie which hath a state as yet exceeding feeble, and scarce recouered from a mortall sicknesse, is so much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to beare the burthen of such a warre, that by ouer weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it in drawing from it that small vital sustenance which it hath, it may (which God forbid) occasion the last ruine of it; like a sicke bodie, which aggrauated with the ill of the disease, looseth his naturall vigour.

time enough to prouide abundantly, by the greatnesse, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and wealth, of your owne Dominions: and the <hi>Turkes</hi> present distractions, troubles, and generall corruptions, which in naturall discourse are likelier to encrease by time then decrease. For <hi>Good and I'd haue in the gouernment of men this difference between themselues, that Good though it be brought forth by time, yet it is not renued by time; and though by our stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and industries it be maintained, it corrupteth not-withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by degrees of it selfe, and finally of it selfe, also extinguisheth; as we may read and see in the succeedings of all states and of all Sects: the contrarie of which appeareth in Ill, since it doth not wast by little and little through the wearing of time, as Good doth; but rather increaseth to a more powerfull validitie, and by easie pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages riseth to the extremitie of declination.</hi> So that hauing such assurance of the working of time in that qualitie with which the <hi>Turke</hi> is alreadie infected, Your Maiestie may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponder and resolue at leisure of the proceeding of your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise: only prouide meanes to establish and perfect it when it shall bee concluded. This Christian hath brought with him a Founder of artillarie: let him bee vsefull to your Maiestie in something; and let vs your seruants haue the comfort to see some good fruit of your infinite magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie. In the meane time, by deferring your deliberation, Your Maiesty shal euer haue adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage to determine by the progresse and successe of thinges, and so shall you either moue or stand what way soeuer you incline vnto, more surely founded. For your Maiesties sending to the Princes Christian, I giue also the same counsell to beware of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by acceleration, since if they be great, and haue neede of colligating themselues with your Maiestie (as your need of them shall neuer bee without theirs of you, both rising from the same, either the <hi>Turkes</hi> potencie to sustaine him ioyntly, or his impotencie to dissolue him ioyntly) they I say without once measuring obligations, honour done, or

If they be Princes of no great power in themselues, their suspition, feare, and iealousie will naturally induce them to combine themselues with your Maiestie, or any Prince of a porportionable power for such an effect, for the ruine and destruction of a more powerful enemie. That this Christian doth insist to haue it done now, I cannot discerne his reason; for if his condition be good in his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, it is vnlikely that for the enioying of any other fortune he will perpetually banish himselfe from thence, and would be glad to haue such a demonstration there of his valour and fortune, to haue bin able to perswade a great King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> to such an act: in which if the books of our former Kings erre not, many great Kings, or at least Kings, haue fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Princes Christian hath beene intimated as one of the most necessarie: we shall do well in the generall good vse which we must make of this interposition of time, to doe also that. For though it be true, that their interesses will euer make such a proposition acceptable: yet where there is a proffer of such a condition, as beareth with it a kinde of Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is of mere honourable fashion for vs, so it addeth grace and reputation and more strength to it, or any such like purpose. For neither will I relie so much vpon my owne power, or fortune, or the present benefite which I meane to bestow vpon these of <hi>Corasan,</hi> that I will forget I haue offended them, and to arme my selfe with all the best aduise I can against the sinister working of any fortune.

Yet this must I tell you and him, which hath not yet beene thought of, That a great Prince, as I am, must receiue a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall for an iniury: and I had rather not know them at all, then with knowing them to be also offended by them;

            <p>What the king replied I know not (hauing receiued this opinion of <hi>Courtchi Bassa</hi> from the king himselfe, who by that and other eternall contrary counsels was so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17801:58"/>
in his owne resolution as a prince that desireth to doe great things, and them also well determines not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly vpon faire hopes, but carrieth his hopes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by the working of his wisedome: so that many daies after, when I would begin to enter into a new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of those deliberations, hee would presently turne himselfe to speake of other matters. In this fashion more then one moneth passed, in which I had no comfort of my desire, but onely that which <hi>Xa-Thamas Colibeague</hi> &amp; <hi>Oliuer Di Chan</hi> gaue me, and the kings exceeding fauour which rather increased then decreased towards me.</p>
            <p>In this time (as though all the strength of that ill spirit, who euer raiseth the vttermost of his skill and power to preuent all good purposes had conspired to ouerthrow the well proceeding of this good businesse) There came newes to the Court, that <hi>Mahomet-Aga</hi> Generall of the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> of <hi>Bagdat</hi> was entred into the kings Confines, as Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador from the Turke, with a rich present, and maruellous honourable traine: And that those of <hi>Ormus</hi> had stayed by force sixteene slaues which were sent by the great <hi>Mogore</hi> to the king; with nine other which <hi>Oliuer Di-Chan</hi> had bought in those parts, and the Marchants for their more security had sent them with those of the kings. This raised the courages of those which opposed themselues to the maine businesse, alienated mightily the hearts of <hi>Oliuer Di-Chan,</hi> and <hi>Xa-Tamas Colibeague</hi> from all, and exasperated the king himselfe so much against them, that his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie speech was no other, but that hee would shortly learne them to haue a respect vnto him, which did so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fill my very soule with perplexitie, and anxietie, that I fell into a very dangerous sicknesse, in which the king neuer failed daily to visit me himselfe; and finding that the recordation of those things did aggrauate both the griefe of my minde, and vnquiet of my bodie, he forbad that any
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17801:58"/>
in my presence should speake more of it, but onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me with all sort of discourse of recreation, with so roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and so gracious a regard, that he shewed apparantly enough, that few accidents could dispose his minde from any reasonable contentment which he might giue me. In the meane time <hi>Mahomet-Aga</hi> arriued at the Court, whom the king sent his <hi>Viseire</hi> and <hi>Courtchibassa</hi> to meete accompanied with a thousand horse of the principall of the Court, and of the Citie. These (no question) gaue him large instructions, and as large hopes; which if he had gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also rightly, he might haue done his Master great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and himselfe infinite honour: but through his owne too hastie greedinesse, assurance, and desire, he preuented himselfe whilest he striued first beyond that which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently good, then beyond that which was better, and at the last beyond all reasonable (and I thinke his owne) hopes. For first being proudly confident vpon the greatnes of his Master; then vpon the difficultie of the king of <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> present estate, to be moued to offend so potent a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; then vpon so great and strong a faction in the Court; besides hauing heard by them that the kings mind was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from those of <hi>Ormus,</hi> and that <hi>Oliuer Chan</hi> also was then likewise alienated from his first censure through the particular wrong done vnto himselfe, or else that he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the inclination of his minde according to <hi>the corrupt condition of all Courts, in which the loue of obsequiousnesse to the Prince, and fitting themselues to their appetites (by that meanes to strengthen their owne emulations) is more power-able then the feare to do ill, and the working of their owne consciences</hi>: or else <hi>that in all things there is a certaine reuolution; and as there are mouings of times, so there are also vartations in our minds and fashions.</hi> Making himselfe strong in his assurance vpon these foundations, &amp;c vpon the weaknes of his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, which was left much infeebled by the distraction of

minds of the readers. I speake onely of a good intention, tossed with the tempests, first of many desperate calamities; then with many potent oppositions; the iustice, wisedome, temperance, liberalitie, valour, mercifulnesse, and generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all excellent vertues in a Prince esteemed by vs barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and yet indeed fit to be a patterne and mirrour to some of ours, who haue <hi>Christ</hi> in our mouthes, and not the least of his Saints in our hearts. Besides the varietie of his fortunes disposition, bridled and brought to a good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by the force of his wisedome and goodnesse, and true experience of the power of fortune: in which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course there is no alteration of matter; the subiect being euer the person of the king, and his excelling vertues: which I had rather speake of, to point out by them the happinesse of his state, then to see a farre off the miseries of some of ours swimming in blood, full of cruell commandement, continuall accusations, false frendships, the ruine of innocents, implacable factions, and pernicious ends of things: contrarie to that which ought to be with vs of a better profession; and is with those which we despise.</p>

gouernment in the alteration of which, though he knew his greatnesse and Maiestie violated, yet he could yeeld so much from what he ought to do to the king of <hi>Persias</hi> years and heat of valour; that hee would content himselfe with that satisfaction. Then he aduised him to force his nature, and couer this vaine glimmering of fortune with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and good counsell; which euer would aduise him to maintaine and preserue his estate, rather with warie then violent counsels. This his Master demanded of him to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate (by the facile granting of it) all greater iniuries; wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his Maiestie to consider well of the demand, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the demander and his owne: <hi>Denials euer to such Potentates being receiued for maine offences; that it was euer a wise determination to yeeld to the authoritie of time, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, and to auoid by that good iudgement, vrgent perils, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister conditions: nothing being a more secure repaire, then to strike satle against insupportable tempests, it many times happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that the too great valour of men vsed with too great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To conclude, he said that his Maiestie must be so farre from thinking to weaken his Maister by cunning and by artifice, and so to keepe his Armes farre from him; that he must resolue such courses to be seruile: and to execute

Tor the kings great discontentment with those of <hi>Ormus,</hi> &amp; the strong opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of most of his counsell to any proposition against the Turke, did facilitate a way for him to haue fashioned the king to any condition of firmer tearmes with his Master, then they had hitherto stood in.

            <p>So that being instantly sued to by <hi>Cuchin-Allibi</hi> a Courtchie of <hi>sixe Thomans stipend by</hi> the yeare, and in disgrace also, for some ill part that he had plaied, I (pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thereunto by the <hi>Viseir</hi> and <hi>Bastan Aga</hi>) spake vnto the king that he might goe with me, in the forme onely of a testimonie, though honoured with some good words in the letters, for the bettter reputation of the businesse: which the King was exceeding backward in consenting vnto, desiring me eyther to goe alone, or better accompanied. The last I told him lay in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties power to command; the other I could not doe, and promise him, or hope my selfe for good successe: nothing being more fraile then such a reputation (as would suddenly grow by such a businesse) vnsuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any sort of strength, so that it would be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect for all sort of malice to worke vppon, his Maiestie being too farre remoued to giue iust proofe of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment from him, if it should be opposed. And the more strange it was, and lesse hoped for, as it would be the more ioyfully embraced by the good. So it would giue the more colour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and strength to bad mindes against me. At the last (I think through the secret wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of those which were euer enemies to the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this businesse, &amp; the mainescarcitie of others which had minds fit for such imployment, &amp; qualities also fit for such minds.) I was vrged to take that fellow, &amp; the king content to let him go. But would bestow on him no more then 50. <hi>Tomans</hi> for the whole expense: which he called also cast away.

Neyther did he incline at all to doe this for any feeling which he would haue in that point of his Maiesties munificences promised, but onely for the sensiblenesse of doing well which hee thought and knew he should do by obeying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie in that commaunding request. Hee did confesse notwithstanding that the world could not lay vpon him a greater aduersitie, then to be separated from me: yet he would neuer bee so broken with any fortune, (though it should rise from other causes) as to loose the least title of the dignitie of his minde. His yeares were but few, but neyther gray heires nor wrinckles should (with so wise an vnderstanding iudgement as his Maiesties) giue more authoritie to any then the good fruites proceeding from an honest and vertuous spending of the time which a man hath passed: hee did desire no more fauour with his Maiestie for his staying then his other merits should bee worthie of: yet because hee was left alone without other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort then what his owne heart gaue him, hee would bee confident that his Maiestie would not forget what hee owed to himselfe as a Prince, nor to him as a Gentleman which had freely matched obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with affection.

In the meane time I beseech God, since the <hi>Turkes</hi> loue cannot apply it selfe by no meanes to your Maiestie, that their hatreds may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue one against the other: no destiny being able to vrge faster forward the greatnesse of your Dominion, nor no fortune being of more validity to make an euen way vnto it, then the amity of our Princes, and eternall discord amongst your enemies. I was almost saying, that God would prosper your Maiestie in all things; but certainely I trust hee will: and I say so, since it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth more rightly to his great Holinesse, and to our reuerence to belieue constantly of his deeds then to know them. And this great reason I haue of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, the greatnesse which God hath giuen your Maiesty ioined to so great and excellent vertues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which questionles are appointed to some great &amp; extrordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end. Then that your Maiestie hath pleased not to deceiue your selfe in this withering peace which you haue with the <hi>Turke,</hi> which is more delighting for the present, then safe for the future: <hi>that rest being euer false, which is taken amongst inopulent and strong neighbours.</hi>
