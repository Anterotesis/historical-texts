            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VPon the 6. of this present May, there were landed at <hi>Waterford,</hi> 10000. men all accounted in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like habit fitted for present service, which men, in this Martial array, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with all kind of Ammunition, were supposed to be under the conduct and command of the Lord <hi>George Digby,</hi> and that he and the rest of these his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Confederates have joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the Rebels now in <hi>Ireland. Immediatly after their arrivall in Ireland, they having had some Conference with the Ring-leaders of all these mischievous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, they marched toward Dublin, and in their march they gave most cruell and bloudy testimonies of their divellish and inhumane intentions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In their march unto Dublin, they burnt two stately towns, and put all the Inhabitants

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was strange unto all our English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that that nobly descended Lord</hi> Geore Digby <hi>should bid his farewell to his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Allegeance unto this Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The noise and shrikes of these so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely butchered Protestants, and the flames of these so burned towns, could not long bee convealed from Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But with a speed as great as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, it did soon arrive at Dublin, and cntred into the knowledh of Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> who was grieved at the soul at that heavy and bloudy News, and being
<pb facs="tcp:64642:3"/>
rather desirous to redresse and save their survivers cryes, forthwith desired that a generall counsell might bee summoned within the City, to advise what should be the most speedy and most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meanes of remedy. The agreement and consent being made for present for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it was much dilated under whose command these Forces should be dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but at the length it was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the generall consent, that Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> should have the ordering and command of those present Forces. This Noble Cavaleere was now on fire untill he came to action, and thought every minute a tedious Age untill hee came to face his enemy. At his first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, the Enemy seemed very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and resolute, and as if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the merit of his cause, was bold and gave strong defiance unto the now approaching Cavaleere. It was no-now a time to debate the mattet in words; the quarrell, which nothing else could determine, their Swords now
<pb facs="tcp:64642:4"/>
must decide. Without any further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay their Forces are brought up, the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall was given, and the Fight began. So hot and fierce was the first on-set, that the Enemy would not now neede the heat of those damnable flames which his divellish malice had kindled to warme himselfe. The Fight was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and fitrce, and the true God of war was himself a spectator, and a just Judge of this cause; and after a tedious and after a tedious and bloody Skirmish, thought it fit, that those who by their practises had endeavoured to bring all to ruine and destruction, should now themselves, like waste and ruined buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, lye in heaps and spectacles to the publike contempt and scorne, as wayes fit for their former cruelty.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot omit to informe the Reader, and let him understand of a most strange Apparition, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the time during this Skirmish, the time being rare as the sight, and the truth having been confirmed by many
<pb facs="tcp:64642:4"/>
worthy Gentlemen, who were specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors thereof, and now are resident in this Citie. When both the Armies had joyned in Battaile, it being about the mid season of the day, there appeared, to the Admiration and astonishment of all the Spe<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tators, two great Luminaries or starres, of more then an ordinary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and during all the whole space of the Battaile, according to the motion of the Combatants, did mhve up and downe sensibly, to the Apprehension of many thousand people. <hi>And as soone as the Fight was ended, these two Starres shrouded themselves within the Clouds, and appeared no more. I have not made this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to winne the Reader to a superstitious beliefe, but thus far I will be bold to say, that I <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As I would not be too curious in my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, so would I not be too carelesse in my respects; I would willingly shun both the censure of superstitious folly and
