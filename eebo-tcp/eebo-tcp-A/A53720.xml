         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N account in general of the Nature and Design of the ensuing Discourse, with the Reasons why it is made publick at this time, being given in the first Chapter of the Treatise it self; I shall not long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Readers</hi> here at the entrance of it. But some few things it is necessary they should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withal, and that both as to the Matter contained in it, and as to the mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r of its hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The Subject Matter of the whole, as the Title and almost every Page of the Book declare, is the <hi>Holy Spirit of God and his Operations.</hi> And two things there are which either of them are sufficient to render any Subject either difficult on the one hand, or unpleasant on the other, to be treated of in this way; both which we have herein to conflict withal. For where the Matter it self is abstruse and mysterious, the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it cannot be without its Difficulties; and where it is fallen by any means what-ever under publick contempt and scorn, there is an abatement of satisfaction in the Consideration and Defence of it. Now all the Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s of the Holy Spirit are an eminent part of the Mystery, or <hi>deep Things of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For as the knowledg of them doth wholly depend on, and is regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Divine Revelation, so are they in their own Nature Divine and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, distant and remote from all things that the <hi>Heart of Man</hi> in the meer Exercise of its own Reason or Understanding can rise up unto. But yet on the other hand there is nothing in the World that is more generally despised as
<hi>foolish</hi> and contemptible, than the things that are spoken of and ascribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spirit of God. He needs no furtherance in the forfeiture of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with many, as a Person Fanatical, estranged from the conduct of Reason, and all generous Principles of Conversation, who dares avow an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in his Work, or take upon him the Defence thereof. Wherefore th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se things must be a little spoken unto, if only to manifest whence Relief may be had against the Discouragements wherewith they are attended.</p>
            <p>For the first thing proposed, it must be granted that the things here treated of, are in themselves mysterious and abstruse. But yet the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may endeavour an acquaintance with them, <hi>according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Gift of Christ unto every one,</hi> is made plain in the Scriptures of Truth. If this Way be neglected or despised, all other wayes of attempting the same end, be they never so vigorous or promising, will prove ineffectual. What belongs unto it, as to the inward frame and dispo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tion of Mind in them who search after Understanding in these things, what unto the outward use of Means, what unto the performance of Spiritual Duties, what unto conformity in the whole Soul unto each discovery of Truth that is attained, is not my present Work to declare, nor shall I divert thereunto. If God give
<pb facs="tcp:48389:3"/> an opportunity to treat concerning the Work of the Holy Spirit enabling us to understand the Scriptures or the mind of God in them, the whole of this way will be at large declared.</p>
            <p>At present it may suffice to observe, that God who in himself is the eternal Original Spring and Fountain of all Truth, is also the only Sovereign Cause and Author of its Revelation unto us. And whereas that Truth which Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally is one in him is of various sorts and kinds, according to the Variety of the things which it respects in its Communication unto us, the ways and means of that communication are suited unto the distinct Nature of each Truth in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. So the Truth of things natural is made known from God by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Reason, or the due Application of the understanding that is in Man unto their Investigation. <hi>For the things of a Man knoweth the Spirit of a Man that is in him.</hi> Neither ordinarily is there any thing more required unto that Degree or Certainty of knowledg in things of that Nature whereof our Minds are capable, but the diligent Application of the faculties of our Souls in the due Use of proper means u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>o the Attainment thereof. Yet is there a secret Work of the Spirit of God herein, even in the Communication of Skill and Ability in things <hi>Natural<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap> serving still a Liberty unto the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of Divine Providence in the disposal of all Men and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
            <p>But as to things supernatural, the Knowledg and Truth of them, the <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God</hi> are of another Nature; and in like manner a peculiar Application of our selves unto him for Instruction is required of us. In these things also there are Degrees according as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y approach on the one hand unto the Infinite Abysse of the Divine Essence and Existence, as the eternal Generation and Incarnation of the Son, the Procession and Mission of the Holy Spirit; or on the other unto those Divine Effects which are produced in our Souls whereof we have Experience. According unto these Degrees as the Divine Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension is exerted in their Revelation, so ought our Attention in the Exercise of Faith, Humility and Prayer, to be encreased in our Enquiries into them. For although all that Diligence in the Use of outward Means, necessary to the Attainment of the Knowledg of any other Useful Truth, be indispensibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the pursuit of an Acquaintance with these things also; yet if moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there be not an Addition of Spiritual Ways and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o the receiving of Supernatural Light, and the Understanding of the Deep Things of God, our labour about them will in a great measure be but fruitless and unprofitable. For although the Letter of the Scripture, and the sense of the Propositions are equally exposed to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of all mankind; yet the real spiritual Knowledg of the Things themselves, is not communicated unto any but by the especial Operation of the Holy Spirit; nor is any considerable Degree of Insight into the Doctrine of the Mysteries of them attainable but by a due waiting on him, who alone <hi>giveth the Spirit
<pb facs="tcp:48389:3"/> of Wisdom and Revelation in the Knowledg of them. For the things of God knoweth no Man but the Spirit of God, and they to whom by him they are revealed.</hi> Neither can the Scriptures be interpreted aright but by the Ayd of that Spirit by which they were indited, as <hi>Hierom</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>rmes, and as I shall afterwards fully prove. But in the use of the means mentioned we need not despond, but that seeing these things themselves are revealed that we may know God in a due manner, and live unto him as we ought, we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such a measure of Spiritual Understanding in them as is useful unto our own and others Edification. They may I say do so who are not <hi>slothful in hearing</hi> or learning, but by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Subject of the ensuing Discourses being intirely things of this Nature in their several Degrees of Access unto God or our selves, I shall give no account of any particular Endeavours in my Enquiries into them, but leave the Judgment thereof unto the Evidence of the Effects produced thereby. Only whereas I know not any who ever went before me in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of representing the whole <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Holy Spirit, with all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts, Operations and Effects, whereof this is the first Part (the Attempt of
<hi>Crellius</hi> in this kind being only to corrupt the Truth in some few Instances) as the Difficulty of my work was encreased thereby, so it may plead my Excuse, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing be found not to answer so regular a Projection, or just a Method as the nature of the Subject requireth, and as was aymed at.</p>
            <p>In the first Part of the whole Work which concerneth the Name, Divine Nature, Personality and Mission of the Holy Spirit, I do but declare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the faith of the Catholick Church against the <hi>Socinians;</hi> with what Advantage, with what contribution of Light or Evidence, strength or order unto what hath been pleaded before by others, is left unto the Learned Readers to judg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and determine. And in what concerns the Adjuncts and Properties of his Mission and Operation, some may, and I hope do judg themselves not unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding unto me for administring an occasion unto them of deeper and better Thoughts about them.</p>
            <p>The second Part of our Endeavour concerneth the Work of the Holy Spirit in the <hi>Old Creation,</hi> both in its Production, Preservation and Rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And whereas I had not therein the Advantage of any one Ancient or Modern Author to beat out the Paths of Truth before me, I have confined my self to express Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of Scripture with such Expositions of them as sufficiently evidence their own <hi>Truth,</hi> though also they want not such a suffrage from others as may give them the Reputation of some Authority.</p>
            <p>The like may be said of what succeeds in the next Place concerning his Work under the <hi>New Testament</hi> preparatory for the new Creation, in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of all sorts of Gifts Ordinary and Extraordinary, all kind of Skill and Ability in things Spiritual, Natural, Moral, Artificial and Political, with the Instances whereby those Operations of his are confirmed. All these things, many wherefore are handled by others separately and apart, are here proposed in their Order with respect unto their proper End and Design.</p>
            <p>For what concerns his Work on the <hi>Head of the New Creation,</hi> or the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, I have been careful to keep severely unto the Bounds of Sobriety, and not to indulge unto any curious or unwarrantable speculations. I have therefore therein not only diligently attended unto the Doctrine of the Scripture, our only infallible Rule and Guide,
<pb facs="tcp:48389:4"/> but also expresly considered what was taught and believed in the Ancient Church in this Matter, from which I know that I have not departed.</p>
            <p>More I shall not add as to the first Difficulty wherewith an Endeavour of this kinds is attended, arising from the Nature of the Subject treated of. The other concerning the <hi>Contempt</hi> that is cast by many on all these things, must yet be further spoken unto.</p>
            <p>In all the Dispensations of God towards his People under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there was nothing of God communicated unto them, nothing of Worth or Excellency wrought in them or by them, but it is expresly assigned unto the Holy Spirit as the Author and Cause of it. But yet of all the Promises given unto them concerning a better and more glorious State of the Church to be afterwards introduced, next unto that of the coming of the Son of God in the Flesh, those are the most eminent which concern an Enlargement and more full Communication of the Spirit, beyond what they were or could in their imperfect state be made Partakers of. Accordingly we find in the New Testament, that what-ever concerns the Conversion of the Elect, the Edification of the Church, the Sanctification and Consolation of Believers; the performance of those of Duties of Obedience which we owe unto God, with our Conduct in all the wayes thereof, is in general and particular Instances so appropriated unto him, as that it is withal declared, that nothing of it in any kind can be enjoyed or performed without his especial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yd and Assistance. So careful was God fully to instruct and to secure the faith of the Church in this matter, according as he knew its eternal Concernments to lye therein. Yet notwithstanding all the evidence given hereunto, the Church of God in most Ages hath been exercised with Oppositions, either to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or his Work, or the manner of it, contrary unto what is promised and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared concerning them in the Word of Truth; nor doth it yet cease so to be. Yea, though the Contradictions of some in former Ages have been fierce and clamorous, yet all that hath fallen out of that kind, hath been exceeding short of what is come to pass in the dayes wherein we live. For not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Socinians</hi> who have gathered into one Head, or rather ulcerous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume, all the virulent Oppositions made unto his Deity or Grace by the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians, Macedonians,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old; there are others who profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing no Enmity unto his Divine Person, yea, admitting and owning the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church concerning it, are yet ready on all occasions to despise and reproach that whole Work for which he was promised under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which is expresly assigned unto him in the Now. Hence is it grown amongst a Matter of Reproach and Scorn for any one to make mention of his Grace, or to profess an interest in that Work of his as his, without which no Man shall see God, if the Scripture be a faithful Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And some have taken pains to prove, That sundry things which are expresly assigned unto him in the Gospel as Effects of his Power and Grace, are only filthy <hi>Enthusiasms,</hi> or at least weak Imaginations of Distempered Minds. Neither is there any end of Calumnious Imputations on them by whom his Work is avowed, and his Grace professed. Yea, the department of many herein is such, as that if it were not known how effectual the Efforts of Profaneness are upon the corrupted Minds of Men, it would rather seem ridiculous and be despised, than to deserve any serious notice. For l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t any avow or plead for the known Work of the Spirit of God, and it is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately apprehended a sufficient Ground to charge them with leaving the Rule of
<pb facs="tcp:48389:4"/> the Word to attend unto Revelations and Inspirations, as also to forgo all thoughts of the necessity of the Duties of Obedience; whereas no other Work of his is pleaded for, but that only which no Man can either at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto the Rule of the Scripture as he ought, or perform any one Duty of Obedience unto God in a due manner. And there are none of this Conspiracy so weak or unlearned, but are able to scoff at the mention of him, and to cast the very naming of him on others as a Reproach. Yea, it is well if some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin not to deal in like manner with the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> himself. For Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Profaneness if once countenanced, are at all times fruitful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive, and will be so whilst Darkness and Corruption abiding on the Minds of Men, the great Adversary is able by his subtile malice to make impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on them. But in these things not a few do please themselves, despise others, and would count themselves injured if their Christianity should be called in question. But what value is there in that Name or Title, where the whole Mystery of the Gospel is excluded out of our Religion? Take away the Dispensation of the Spirit, and his effectual Operations in all the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course that is between God and Man; be ashamed to avow or profess the Work attributed unto him in the Gospel, and <hi>Christianity</hi> is plucked up by the Roots. Yea, this practical contempt of the Work of the Holy Spirit, being grown the only plausible Defiance of Religion, is so also to be the most <hi>pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> beyond all national Mistakes and Errors about the same things, being constantly accompanied with profaneness, and commonly issuing in Atheism.</p>

               <hi>The sense I intend is fully expressed in the ensuing complaint of a Learned Person published many years ago;</hi> In seculo hodie tam perverso prorsus immersi vivimus miseri, in quo Spiritus Sanctus omnino ferme pro ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio habetur: imo in quo etiam sunt qui non tantum corde toto eum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudient ut factis negent, sed quoque adeo blasphemi in eum exurgant ut penitas eundem ex orbe expulsum aut exulatum cupiant, quum illi nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam in operationibus suis relinquant efficaciam; ac propriis vanorum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituum suorum viribus, ac rationis profanae liberrati carnalitatique suae omnem ascribant sapientiam, &amp; fortitudinem in rebus agendis. Unde tanta malignitas externae proterviae apud mortales cernitur. <hi>Ideoque pernicies nostra nos jam ante fores expecta;</hi> &amp;c. Herein lies the Rise and Spring of that stated Apostacy from the Power of Evangelical Truth, wherein the World takes its liberty to immerge it self in all licentiousness of Life and Conversation, the end whereof many cannot but expect with Dread and Terror.</p>
            <p>To obviate these Evils in any measure, to vindicate the Truth and Reality of Divine Spiritual Operations in the Church, to avow what is believed and taught by them concerning the Holy Spirit and his Work, who are most charged and reslected on for their Profession thereof, and thereby to evince the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of those Calumnies, under the darkness and shades whereof some seek to countenance themselves in their profane scoffing at his whole Dispensation; to manifest in all Instances, that what is ascribed unto him is not onely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with Religion, but also that without which Religion cannot consist, nor the Power of it be preserved, is the principal Design of the ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s.</p>
            <p>Now whereas the Effectual Operation of the Blessed Spirit in the <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> or <hi>Conversion</hi> of Sinners, is of all other parts of his Work most vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently by opposed, and hath of late been virulently traduced, I have the more largely insisted thereon. And because it can neither be well understood, nor
<pb facs="tcp:48389:5"/> duly explained without the Consideration of the State of <hi>Lapsed or Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nature,</hi> I have taken in that also at large, as judging it necessary so to do. For whereas the knowledg of it lies at the bottom of all our Obedience unto God by Christ, it hath alwayes been the Design of some, and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth so to be, either wholly to deny it, or to extenuate it unto the depression and almost annihilation of the Grace of the Gospel, whereby alone our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be repaired. Designing therefore to treat expresly of the Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Nature by Grace, it was all accounts necessary that we should treat of its Depravation by Sin also.</p>
            <p>Moreover what is Discoursed on these things, is suited unto the Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them that do believe, and directed unto their furtherance in true Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Obedience and Holiness, or the Obedience of Faith. Hence it may be some will judg that our Discourses on these Subjects are drawn out into a greater length than was needful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nvenient, by that continual intermixture of Practical Applications which runs along in them all. But if they shall be pleased to consider, that my Design was not to handle thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> things in a way of Controversie, but declaring and confirming the truth concerning them, to accommodate the Doctrines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

How-ever if these things are neglected or despised by some, yea, be they never so many, there are yet others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> will judg their principal Concernment to lie in such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses as may direct and encourage them in the Holy Practice of their Duty. And whereas t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Way, Manner, and Method of the Holy Spirit in his Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as to this Work of translating Sinners from Death unto Life, from a State of Nature unto that of Grace, have been variously handled by some, and severely reslecled on with scorn by others, I have endeavourered so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and assert what the Scripture manifestly teacheth concerning them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it with the Testimonies of some of the Ancient Writers of the Church, as I no way doubt but it is suited unto the Experience of who have in their own Souls been made Partakers of that Blessed Work of the Holy Ghost. And whilst in the substance of what is delivered, I have the plain Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Scripture, the Suffrage of the Ancient Church, and the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them who do sincerely believe to rest upon, I shall not be greatly moved with the Censures and Opposition of those who are otherwise minded.</p>
            <p>I shall add no more on this Head, but that whereas the only Inconvenience wherewith our Doctrine is pressed, is the pretended difficulty in reconciling the Nature and Necessity of our Duty, with the Efficacy of the Grace of the Spirit; I have been so far from waving the Consideration of it, as that I have embraced every Opportunity to examine it in all particular Instances, wherein it may be urged with most appearance of Probability. And it is I hope at length made to appear, that not only the <hi>necessity</hi> of our Duty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of God's Grace; but also that as on the one hand we can perform no Duty to God as we ought without its Aid and Assistance, nor have any encouragement to attempt a course of Obedience without a just Expectation thereof; so on the other, that the Work of Grace it self is no way effectual but in the compliance with in a way of Duty; only with the leave of some Persons, or whether they will or no, we give the preheminence in all unto Grace and not unto our selves. The Command of God is the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Rule of our Industry and Diligence in a way of Duty; And why
<pb facs="tcp:48389:5"/> any one should be discouraged from the Exercise of that Industry which God requires of him, by the Consideration of the Aid and Assistance which he hath promised unto him, I cannot understand. The Work of Obedience is difficult and of the highest Importance, so that if any one can be negligent therein, because God will help and assist him, it is because he hates it, he likes it not. Let others do what they please, I shall endeavour to comply with the Apostle's Advice upon the Enforcement which he gives unto it; <hi>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling; for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his own good Pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things, with sundry of the like Nature, falling unavoidably under Consideration have drawn out these Discourses unto a length much beyond my first Design; which is also the occasion why I have forborn the present ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto them, those other Parts of the Work of the Holy Spirit, in <hi>Prayer</hi> or <hi>Supplication,</hi> in <hi>Illumination</hi> with respect unto the Belief of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and right understanding of the Mind of God in them, in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of <hi>Gifts</hi> unto the Church, and the <hi>Consolation</hi> of Believers, which must now wait for another Opportunity, if God in his Goodness and Patience shall be pleased to grant it unto us.</p>
            <p>Another Part of the Work of the Holy Spirit consisteth in our <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> whereon our Evangelical Obedience or Holiness doth depend. How much all his Operations herein also are by some despised, what Endeavours there have been to debase the Nature of Gospel-Obedience, yea, to cast it out of the Hearts and Lives of Christians, and to substitute an <hi>Heathenish Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi> at best in the room thereof, is not unknown to any, who think it their Duty to inquire into these things. Hence I thought it not unnecessary, on the occasion of treating concerning the Work of the Holy Spirit in our <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,</hi> to make a diligent and full enquiry into the true Nature of <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical-Holiness,</hi> and that Spiritual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase unto God which all Believers are Created unto in Christ Jesus. And herein following the Conduct of the Scriptures from first to last, the Difference that is between them and that Exercise of <hi>Moral Virtue</hi> which some pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad for in their stead, did so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently manifest it self, as that it needed no great Endeavour to represent it unto any impartial Judgment. Onely in the handling of these things, I thought meet to pursue my former Method and Design, and principally to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the reducing of the Doctrines insisted on unto the Practice and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Holiness, which also hath occasioned the lengthning of these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses. I doubt not but all these things will be by some despised; they are so in themselves, and their Declaration by me will not recommend them unto a better Acceptation. But let them please themselves whilst they see good in their own Imaginations, whilst the Scripture is admitted to be an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Declaration of the Will of God and the Nature of Spiritual Things, and there are Christians remaining in the World who endeavour to live to God and to come to the enjoyment of him by Jesus Christ, there will not want sufficient Testimony against that putid Figment of <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> being all our Gospel Holiness, or that the Reparation of our Natures and Life unto God do consist therein alone.</p>
            <p>In the last Place succeeds a Discourse concerning the <hi>necessity of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Obedience;</hi> some regard I confess I had therein, though not much, unto the ridiculous clamours of malevolent and ignorant Persons, charging those who plead for the Efficacy of the Grace of God, and the Imputation of
<pb facs="tcp:48389:6"/> the Righteousness of Christ, as though thereby they took away the necessity of an Holy Life. For who would much trouble himself about an Accusation which is laden with as many Convictions of its Forgery, as there are Persons who sincerely believe those Doctrines; and which Common Light gives Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony against in the Conversations of them by whom they are received, and by whom they are despised? It was the Importance of the Thing it self made peculiarly seasonable by the manifold Temptations of the dayes wherein we live, which occasioned that Addition unto what was delivered about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Evangelical Holiness;</hi> seeing, <hi>if we know these things, happy are we if we do them.</hi> But yet the Principal Arguments and Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that Necessity being drawn from those Doctrines of the Gospel which some traduce as casting no good Aspect thereon, the Calumnies mentioned are therein also obviated. And thus far have we proceeded in the Declaration and Vindication of the despised Work of the Spirit of God under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, referring the remaining Instances above-mentioned unto another occasion.</p>
            <p>The Oppositions unto all that we believe and maintain herein are of two sorts. First; Such as consist in Particular Exceptions against, and Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions unto each particular Work of the Spirit, weather in the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gifts, or the Operation of Grace. Secondly; Such as consist in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections cast on the whole Work ascribed unto him in general. These of the first sort, will all of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all under Consideration in their proper Places, where we treat of those especial Actings of the Spirit whereunto they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. The other sort, at least the principal of them wherewith some make the greatest noise in the World, may be here briefly spoken unto.</p>
            <p>The first and chief Pretence of this Nature is, That all those who plead for the Effectual Operations of the Holy Spirit, in the Illumination of the Minds of Men, the Reparation of their Natures, the Sanctification of their Persons, and their Endowment with Spiritual Gifts, are therein and thereby Enemies <hi>to Reason,</hi> and impugn the Use of it in Religion, or at least allow it not that Place and Exercise therein which is its due. Hence some of those who are otherwise minded, affirm that it is cast on them as a Reproach that they are <hi>Rational Divines;</hi> although s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>far as I can discern, if it be so, it is as <hi>Hierom</hi> was beaten by an Angel for being a <hi>Ciceronian</hi> (in the judgment of some) very undeservedly. But the grounds whereon this Charge should be made good, have not as yet been made to appear; neither hath it been evinced that any thing is ascribed by us unto the Efficacy of God's Grace, in the least derogatory unto Reason, its Use, or any Duty of Man depending thereon. I suppose we are agreed herein, That the <hi>Reason of Man</hi> in the State wherein we are, is not sufficient of it self to find out or frame a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion whereby we may please God and be accepted with him. Or if we are not agreed herein, yet I shall not admit it as a part of our present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, wherein we suppose a Religion proceeding from, and resolved into Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Revelation. Neither is it, that I know of, as yet pleaded by any, that <hi>Reason</hi> is able to comprehend all the things in their Nature and Being, or to search them out unto Perfection, which are revealed unto us; for we do not directly deal with them by whom the Principal Mysteries of the Gospel are rejected, because they cannot comprehend them, under a pretence, that what is above Reason is against it. And it may be it will be granted moreover, that Natural Reason cannot enable the Mind of a Man unto a
<pb facs="tcp:48389:6"/>
               <hi>saving Perception</hi> of Spiritual Things as revealed, without the especial Aid of the Spirit of God in Illumination. If this be denied by any, as we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg our dissent from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em, so we know that we do no Injury to Reason thereby, and will rather suffer under the Imputation of so doing, than by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the Scripture to turn <hi>Infidels,</hi> that we may be esteemed Rational. But we cannot conceive how Reason should be prejudiced by the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Rational Faculties of our Souls, with respect unto their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise towards their proper Objects; which is all we assign unto the Work of the Holy Spirit in this Matter. And there are none in the World more free to grant than we are, that unto us our Reason is the only Judg of the Sense and Truth of Propositions drawn from the Scripture or proposed therein, and do wish that all Men might be left peaceable under that determination, where we know th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y must abide whether they will or no.</p>
            <p>But the enquiry in this Matter, is what Reasonableness appears in the Mysteries of our Religion when revealed unto our Reason, and what ability we have to receive, believe and obey them as such. The latter part of this Enquiry is so fully spoken unto in the ensuing Discourses, as that I shall not here again insist upon it; the former may in a few words be spoken unto. It cannot be, it is not that I know of denied by any, that Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is highly Reasonable. For it is the Effect of the Infinite Reason, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Wisdom of God. But the Question is not, What it is in it self, but what it is with relation unto our Reason, or how it appears there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And there is no doubt but every Thing in Christian Religion appears highly reasonable unto Reason enlightned, or the Mind of Man affected with that Work of Grace in its Renovation, which is so expresly ascribed unto the Holy Spirit in the Scripture. For as there is a suitableness between an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Mind and Spiritual Mysteries as revealed; so seeing them in their proper Ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, it finds by experience their Necessity, Use, Goodness and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fest Good and Supream End. It remains therefore only, that we enquire how reasonable the Mysteries of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are unto the Minds of Men as corrupter; for that they are so by the entrance of sin, as we believe, so we have proved in the ensuing Treatise. And it is in vain to dispute with any about the Reasonableness of Evangelical Faith and Obedience, until the St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te and Condition of our Reason be agreed. Wherefore to speak plainly in the Case, as we do a knowledg that Reason in its corrupted State is all that any Man hath in that State, whereby to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand and judg of the Sense and Truth of Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rines revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in the use of such Aids and Means as it is capable to improve, is more and better unto him than any Judg or Interpreter that should impose a Sense upon him not suited thereunto; so as to the Spiritual Things themselves of the Gospel in their own Nature, it is <hi>Enmity</hi> against them, and they are
<hi>Foolishness</hi> unto it. If therefore it be a Crime, if it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nt and disadvantage of Reason, to affirm that our Minds stand in need of the Renovation of the Holy Ghost to enable them to understand Spiritual Things in a Spiritual Manner, we do acknowledg our selves guilty thereof. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, That by asserting the Efficacious Operations of the Spirit of God, and the necessity of them unto the discharge of every Spiritual Duty towards God in an acceptable manner, we do deny that Use and Exercise of our own Reason in things Religious and Spiritual, whereof in any state it is capable, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto of God it is appointed, is unduly charged on us, as will afterwards be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <pb facs="tcp:48389:7"/> But it is moreover pretended, that by the Operations we ascribe unto the Holy Spirit, we expose Man to be deceived by <hi>Satanical Delusions,</hi> open a door to <hi>Enthusiasms,</hi> directing them to the guidance of unaccountable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses and Revelations, so making may unto all Folly and Villany. By what means this Charge can be fixed on them who professedly avow that nothing is Good, nothing Duty unto us, nothing acceptable unto God, but what is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Scripture directed unto thereby and suited thereunto, which is the alone perfect Rule of all that God requires of us in the way of Obedience, but only ungrounded Clamours, hath not yet been attempted to be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. For all things of this Nature are not only condemned by them, but all things which they teach concerning the Holy Spirit of God, are the principal Wayes and Means to secure us from the danger of them. It is true, there have been of old, and happily do still continue among some, Satanical Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Diabolical Suggestions, and soul Enthusiasms, which have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to proceed from the Spirit of God, and to be of a Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. For so it is plainly affirmed in the Scripture, both under the Old Testament and the New, Directions being therein added for their Discovery and Disprovement. But if we must therefore reject the true and real Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit of God, the Principal Preservative against our being deceived by them, we may as well reject the owning of God himself, because the Devil hath imposed himself on Mankind as the Object of their Worship. Wherefore as to <hi>Enthusiasms</hi> of any kind, which might possibly give counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unto any Diabolical Suggestions, we are so far from affirming any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Holy Ghost to consist in them, or in any thing like unto them, that we allow no pretence of them to be consistent therewithal. And we have a sure Rule to try all these things by, which as we are bound in all such Cases precisely to attend unto, so hath God promised the Assistance of his Spirit that they be not deceived, unto them who do it in sincerity. What some Men intend by <hi>Impulses</hi> I know not. If it be especial Aids, Assistances and Inclinations unto Duties, acknowledged to be such, and the Duties of Persons so assisted and inclined, and that peculiarly incumbent on them in their present Circumstances, it requires no small Caution that under an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Name we reject not those supplies of Grace which are promised unto us, and which we are bound to pray for. But if irrational Impressions, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Inclinations unto Things or Actions which are not acknowledged Duties in themselves, evidenced by the Word of Truth, and so unto the Persons so affected in their present Condition and Circumstances, are thus expressed; as we utterly abandon them, so no pretence is given unto them from any thing which we believe concerning the Holy Spirit and his Operations. For the whole Work which we assign unto him, is nothing but that whereby we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to perform that Obedience unto God which is required in the Scripture, in the way and manner wherein it is required. And it is probably more out of Enimity unto him than us, where the contrary is pretended. The same may be said concerning <hi>Revelations.</hi> They are of two sorts, Objective and Subjective. Those of the former sort, whether they contain Doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto that of the Scripture or additional thereunto, or seemingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatory thereof, they are all universally to be rejected, the former being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely false, the latter useless. Neither have any of the Operations of the Spirit pleaded for the least respect unto them. For he having finished the whole Work of External Revelation, and closed it in the Scripture, his whole internal Spiritual Work is suited and commensurate thereunto. By
<pb facs="tcp:48389:7"/> Subjective Revelations nothing is intended but that Work of Spiritual Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whereby we are enabled to discern and understand the Mind of God in the Scripture, which the Apostle prayes for in the behalf of all Believers, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19.) and whose Nature God assisting shall be fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained hereafter. So little pretence therefore there is for this Charge on them by whom the Efficacious Operations of the Spirit of God are asserted, as that without them we have no absolute security that we shall be preserved from being imposed on by them, or some of them.</p>
            <p>But it may be it will be said at last, that our whole Labour in declaring the Work of the Spirit of God in us and towards us, as well as what we have now briefly spoken in the Vindication of it from these or the like Imputations, is altogether vain, seeing all we do or say herein is nothing but <hi>canting</hi> with unintelligible Expressions. So some affirm indeed, before they have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their <hi>Charter</hi> wherein they are constituted the sole Judges of what Words, what Expressions, what way of Teaching is proper in things of this Nature. But by any thing that yet appears, they seem to be as unmeet for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of that Dictatorship herein which they pretend unto, as any sort of Men that ever undertook the Declaration of Things Sacred and Spiritual. Wherefore unless they come with better Authority than as yet they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, and give a better Example of their own Way and Manner of teaching such Things than as yet they have done, we shall continue to make Scripture <hi>Phraseology</hi> our Rule and Patern in the Declaration of Spiritual Things, and endeavour an Accommodation of all our Expressions thereunto, whether to them intelligible or not; and that for Reasons so easie to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as that they need not here be pleaded.</p>

And as the Apostle sayes, Those who did thus, <hi>did not so by the Spirit of God;</hi> so he intends that they did it by <hi>the acting and instigation of the Devil,</hi> the unclean Spirit, which ruled in those Children of Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. And this was the Condition of these <hi>Corinthians</hi> themselves to whom he wrote, whilst they also were carried away after <hi>dumb Idols.</hi> On the other side, those that believed <hi>called Jesus Lord,</hi> or professed that he was the Lord, and thereby avowed their Faith in him and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto him.

<hi>Jesus</hi> to be the <hi>Lord,</hi> in the first place acknowledgeth him to be the true God. And then they professed him therewithal, to be <hi>their Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48389:10"/> the Lord of their Souls and Consciences, unto whom they owed all Subjection, and performed all Obedience, as <hi>Thomas</hi> did in his great Confession, <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> John 20. 28. Now as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intimated that those who disowned him and called him <hi>accursed,</hi> did speak by the instinct and instigation of the <hi>Devil</hi> by whom they were acted; So he lets them know, on the other hand, that no man can thus own and confess <hi>Jesus to be the Lord,</hi> but by the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> But it may be said that some acted by the unclean Spirit confessed Christ to be the Lord. So did the Man in the Synagogue, who cryed out, <hi>I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God,</hi> Mark 1. 23, 24. And <hi>vers.</hi> 24. He <hi>suffered not the Devils to speak, because they knew him.</hi> And the
<hi>Damsel</hi> possessed with a Spirit of Divination, cryed after the Apostle, saying, <hi>These Men are the Servants of the most high God,</hi> Acts 16. 17. So also did the Man who abode in the Tombs, possessed with an unclean Spirit, who cryed out unto him, <hi>What have I to do with thee Jesus, thou Son of the most high God,</hi> Mark 5. 7. And other Testimonies to the like purpose among the Heathen, and from their Oracles, might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
<hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) Our Apostle speaks of such a <hi>saying of Jesus to be Lord,</hi> as is accompanied with Faith in him, and subjection of Soul unto him, which is from the Holy Ghost alone. Thus none acted by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit can call him Lord. (2.) These Acknowledgments were either (1.) wrested from the Devil, and were no small part of his <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> and <hi>torment;</hi> or, (2) were designed by him with an intention to prejudice the Glory of Christ, by his Testimony, who was a Lyar from the Beginning.

And if this be so, it is likely that those before intended, <hi>who said Jesus was accursed,</hi> were some Persons pretending to be acted, or really acted by an <hi>extraordinary Spirit,</hi> which the Apostle declares not to be the Spirit of God. And so <hi>Chrysostome</hi> interprets those words of them who were visibly and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48389:10"/> acted by the Devil. Many such Instruments of his Malice did
<hi>Satan</hi> stir up in those dayes, to preserve, if it were possible, his tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Kingdom from Ruine. But there is no necessity thus to <hi>restrain the words,</hi> or to affix this sense unto them. Yea, it seems to me to be inconsistent with the Design of the Apostle, and Scope of the Place. For intending to instruct the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as was said, in the Nature, Use, and Exercise of <hi>Spiritual Gifts,</hi> he first lays down the Spring and Fountain of all <hi>Saving Profession</hi> of the Gospel, which those Gifts were designed to the furtherance and improvement of. Hereupon having minded them of their <hi>Heathen State and Condition</hi> before, he lets them know by what means they were brought into the Profession of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and owning of Jesus to be the Lord, in opposition unto the <hi>dumb Idols</hi> whom they had served. And this was by the Author of those Gifts, unto whose consideration he was now addressing himself. The great Change wrought in them as to their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Profession,</hi> was by the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> For <hi>no Man can say that Jesus is the Lord,</hi> which is the Sum and Substance of our Christian Profession, <hi>but by him;</hi> though some think he hath little or no concern at all in this matter. But to say
<hi>Christ is the Lord,</hi> includes two things; First, <hi>Faith</hi> in him as Lord and Saviour. So was he declared and preached by the Angels; <hi>Luke 2. 11. A Saviour which is Christ the Lord.</hi> And this word <hi>Lord,</hi> includes as the Dignity of his Person, so his Investiture with those <hi>Offices</hi> which for our Good <hi>this Lord</hi> did exercise and discharge. Secondly, The <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of that Faith; which two, where they are <hi>sincere,</hi> do always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company each other; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. For as the <hi>saying of Jesus to be Anathema,</hi> did comprise an open Disclaimure and Abrenunciation of him; so the calling of him <hi>Lord,</hi> expresseth the Profession of our Faith in him, and Subjection unto him. And both these are here intended to be sincere and saving. For that Faith and Profession are intended, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Church is <hi>built upon the Rock;</hi> the same with that of <hi>Peter, Thou art Christ the Son of the Living God,</hi> Matth. 16. 16. And that these are the Works of the Holy Ghost, which none of themselves are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for, shall God assisting be afterwards abundantly declared.</p>

It is true, this may so fall out and sometimes doth so, and <hi>de facto</hi> it did so in this <hi>Church of Corinth.</hi> One Admired one Gift, a second another of a different kind, and so the third. Accordingly among those who had received them, one <hi>boasted</hi> of this or that Particular Gift and Ability, and would be continually in its exercise to the exclusion and contempt of others, bestowed no less for the <hi>edification</hi> of the Church than his own. And so far were they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with <hi>vain-Glory,</hi> and a desire of <hi>self-Advancement,</hi> as that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the use of those Gifts in the Church, which tended principally to beget <hi>Astonishment</hi> and <hi>Admiration</hi> in them which heard or beheld them, before those which were peculiarly useful unto the Edification of the Church it self; which Evil in particular the Apostle rebukes at large

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> First then we may consider; That the Doctrine of the Spirit of God his Work and Grace, is the <hi>second great Head</hi> or Principle of those Gospel-Truths wherein the Glory of God, and the Good of the Souls of Men are most eminently concerned. And such also it is, that without it, without the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of it in its <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Improvement</hi> of it in its <hi>Power,</hi> the other will be useless unto those Ends. For when God designed the Great and Glorious Work of recovering Fallen Man, and the saving of sinners to the <hi>Praise of the Glory of his Grace,</hi> he appointed in his Infinite Wisdom <hi>two great Means</hi> thereof. The one was the <hi>giving of his Son for them,</hi> and the other was <hi>the giving of his Spirit unto them.</hi> And hereby was way made for the Manifestation of the Glory of the whole <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> which is the utmost end of all the Works of God. Hereby, were the <hi>Love, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Father in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and Projection of the whole; the <hi>Love, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Condescention</hi> of the Son in the Execution Purchase and Procurement of Grace and Salvation for sinners, with the <hi>Love, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the Holy Spirit in the effectual Application of all unto the Souls of Men, made gloriously conspicuous. Hence from the first Entrance of sin, there were <hi>two general Heads of the Promises of God</hi> unto Men, concerning the means of their Recovery and Salvation. The One was that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>sending of his Son</hi> to be Incarnate to take our Nature upon him, and to suffer for us therein; the Other concerning the <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his Spirit,</hi> to make the Effects and Fruits of the Incarnation, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and Suffering of his Son, effectual in us and towards us. To these Heads may all the Promises of God be reduced. Now because the
<hi>Former</hi> was to be the Foundation of the <hi>Latter,</hi> that was first to be laid down and most insisted on untill it was actually accomplished. Hence the Great Promise of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> the Principal Object of the Faith, Hope, and Expectation of Believers, was <hi>that</hi> concerning the
<hi>Coming of the Son of God in the Flesh,</hi> and the Work which he was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Yet was this also, as we shall see in our Progress, accompanied with a great intermixture of Promises concerning the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his coming and work effectual unto us. But when once that first work was fully accomplished, when the Son <hi>of God was come, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the Works of the Devil,</hi> the Principal remaining Promise of the New Testament, the spring of all the rest, concerneth the <hi>sending of the Holy Spirit</hi> unto the Accomplishment of his Part of that great Work which God had designed. Hence the Holy Ghost, the Doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Person, his Work, his Grace, is the most peculiar and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Subiect of the Scriptures of the New Testament, and a most eminent
<hi>immediate Object</hi> of the Faith of them that do believe. And this must be further cleared, seeing we have to deal with some who will scarce allow him to be of <hi>any Consideration</hi> in these matters at all. But I shall be brief
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48389:13"/> in these previous Testimonies hereunto, because the whole ensuing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is designed to the Demonstration of the Truth of this Assertion.</p>

                  <hi>First,</hi> It is of <hi>great Moment</hi> and sufficient of it self to maintain the Cause as <hi>proposed;</hi> that when our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ</hi> was to leave the world, He promised to send his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> unto his Disciples to supply his Absence. Of what use the Presence of Christ was unto his Disciples we may in some measure <hi>conceive;</hi> they <hi>knew</hi> full well whose <hi>Hearts were filled with sorrow</hi> upon the mention of his Leaving of them, <hi>John.</hi> 16. 5. 6. Designing to relieve them in this great Distress, which drew out the highest Expressions of Love, Tenderness, Compassion and Care to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, he doth it principally by this Promise; which he assures them shall be to their greater Advantage than any they could receive by the continuance of his <hi>bodily Presence</hi> amongst them. And to secure them hereof as also to inform them of its great importance, he repeats it frequently unto them, and inculcates it upon them. Consider some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of what he sayes to this Purpose in his last Discourse with them;
<hi>John 14. 16, 17, 18. I will pray the Father and he shall give you another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not neither knoweth him; but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless, I will come unto you;</hi> that is in and by this Holy Spirit. And v. 25, 26, 27. <hi>These things I have spoken unto you being present with you; but the Comforter who is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my Name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all Things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whatever I have said unto you. Peace I leave with you,</hi> &amp;c. And Chap. 15. 25. <hi>But when the Comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.</hi> And <hi>Chap. 16. v. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 15. Now I go my way to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, whither goest thou. But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless I tell you the Truth, is is expedient for you that I goe away, for if I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart I will send him unto You. And when he is come he will reprove the World of Sin, and of Righteousness, and of Judgment. Of Sin because they believe not on me. Of Righteousness because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; of Judgment because the Prince of this World is judged. I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth; for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he shall shew you things to come. He shall Glorifie me for he shall receive of mine, and he shall shew it unto You. All things that the Father hath are mine; therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shew it unto You.</hi>

                  </note> This was the great <hi>Legacy</hi> which our Lord Jesus Christ departing out of this World <hi>bequeathed</hi> unto his sorrowful Disciples. This he promiseth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48389:14"/> them as a sufficient relief against all their Troubles, and a faithful Guide in all their wayes. And because of the Importance of it unto them he frequently <hi>repeats</hi> it, and enlargeth upon the benefits that they should receive thereby; giving them a particular account why it would be more advantageous unto them than his own <hi>bodily Presence.</hi> And therefore after his Resurrection he minds them again of this Promise, commanding them to act nothing towards the <hi>building of the Church,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it was accomplished towards them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5, 8. They would have been again embracing his humane Nature and rejoycing in it. But as he said unto <hi>Mary, touch me not, John</hi> 20, 17. to wean her from any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal consideration of him; so he instructs them all now to look after and trust unto the Promise of the Holy Ghost. Hence is that of our Apostle;
<hi>though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more;</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 16. For although it was a great Priviledg to have known Christ in this World after the flesh, yet it was much greater to enjoy him in the Dispensation of the Spirit. And this was spoken by the Apostle as the Ancients judge, to rebuke the boasting of some about their seeing the Lord in the Flesh, who were thereon called <gap reason="foreign">

For there is somewhat that doth so, which is accompanyed with irrecoverable and eternal Ruine. And so is nothing else in the World. So <hi>Mark 3. 28, 29. All sins shall be forgiven unto the Sons of Men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme; but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath never forgivness. Or, He that speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this World, nor in the World to come, Matth.</hi> 12. 32. There remains nothing for him who doth <hi>despite to the</hi> Spirit of Grace, but a <hi>certain fearful looking-for of Judgment and fiery Indignation that shall devour the Adversaries,</hi> Heb. 10. 27, 29. This is that <hi>sin unto death</hi> whose remission is not to be prayed for, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16 For <hi>He</hi> having taken upon him to make effectual unto us the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy provided in the blood of Christ for the Pardon of our Sins, if <hi>He</hi> in the Prosecution of that Work be dispised, blasphemed, despitefully used, there neither is Relief, nor can there be Pardon for that Sin. For whence in that Case should they arise or Spring? As God hath not <hi>another Son</hi> to offer another sacrifice for Sin, so that he by whom <hi>his Sacrifice</hi> is despised can have none remaining for him; no more hath he <hi>another Spirit</hi> to make that Sacrifice effectual unto us, if the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in his work be despised and rejected. This therefore is a tender Place.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> The most signal Gift of the Spirit of God for the Use of the Church under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> was that of <hi>Prophesy.</hi> This therefore was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly in Honour and Reputation; as having a great impression of the <hi>Authority</hi> of God <hi>upon it,</hi> and <hi>in it</hi> of his <hi>Neerness</hi> unto Man.

And these things caused many to <hi>pretend unto this Gift,</hi> who were indeed never <hi>inspired</hi> by the Holy Spirit, but were rather on the contrary acted by a Spirit of <hi>Lying</hi> and uncleanness. For it is very probable, that when Men falsly and in meer pretence took upon them to be Prophets <hi>divinely inspired,</hi> without any antecedent <hi>Diabolical En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm,</hi> that the <hi>Devil</hi> made use of them to compass his own Designs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given up by the righteous Judgment of God unto all Delusions, for
<hi>belying his Spirit</hi> and holy Inspirations, they were quickly possessed with a <hi>Spirit of Lying</hi> and unclean Divination. So the false Prophets of <hi>Ahab,</hi> who encouraged him to go up unto <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> foretelling his pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous success, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 6. seemed only to have complied deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Inclinations of their Master, and to have out-acted his other Courtiers in <hi>Flattery,</hi> by gilding it with a pretence of <hi>Prophesy.</hi> But when <hi>Micaiah</hi> came to lay open the Mystery of their Iniquity, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a <hi>Lying Spirit</hi> by the permission of God had possessed their Minds, and gave them Impressions, which being Supernatural, they were deceived

Such were the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> in whose <hi>name</hi> expresly they prophesied, and whose Assistance they invocated. <hi>They called on the name of Baal, saying, O Baal hear us, 1 Kings</hi> 18, 26, 27, 28. Many of these were slain by
<hi>Elijah,</hi> and the whole Race of them afterwards extirpated by <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25, 26, 27, 28. This put an End to <hi>his Diety,</hi> for it is said, <hi>he destroyed Baal out of Israel;</hi> false Gods having no <hi>Existence</hi> but in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Minds of their Worshippers. It may be asked why these are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Prophets?</hi> and so in general of all the false Prophets mentioned in the Scripture. Was it because they <hi>meerly pretended</hi> and counterfeited a Spirit of Prophesie, or had they really any such? I Answer, that I no way doubt, but that they were of both sorts. These Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> were such as worshipped the <hi>Sun,</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Tyrians.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had invented many Hellish <hi>Mysteries,</hi> Ceremonies, and Sacrifices; these they taught the People, by whom they were hired. Being thus engaged in the Service of the Devil, he actually possessed their minds
<hi>as a Spirit of Divination,</hi> and enabled them to declare things unknown unto other Men. They in the mean time really finding themselves acted by a <hi>Power superior to them,</hi> took and owned that to be the Power of their God; and thereby became immediate Worshippers of the <hi>Devil.</hi> This our Apostle declares 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 20. Whatever those who left the true God aimed at to worship, the <hi>Devil</hi> interposed himself between that and them as the Object of their Adoration. Hereby he became the <hi>God of this World, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Him whom in all their Idols they worshipped and adored. With a spirit of Divination from him were many of the false Prophets acted, which they thought to be the Spirit of their God.

And with the like confidence did <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the Son of
<hi>Chenaanah</hi> carry it towards <hi>Micaiah,</hi> 1 Kings 22. 26. for he scornfully asks him, <hi>Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee;</hi> That is, whereas assuredly he speaketh in me, how came he to
<hi>inspire thee</hi> with a contrary Revelation? <hi>Ezekiel</hi> at the same time with
<hi>Jeremiah,</hi> was exercised and perplexed with them, <hi>Chap. 13, &amp;</hi> 14. For this sort of Persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely <hi>false Pretenders</hi> unto <hi>Divine extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Revelations,</hi> did of old usually abound in times of Danger and approaching Desolations.

<hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap. 23. from <hi>vers.</hi> 9. to 33. where any one may read their Sin and Judgment. And yet this false pretending unto the <hi>Spirit of Prophesie,</hi> was very far from casting any contempt on the <hi>real Gift</hi> of the Holy Ghost therein; nay it gave it the greater Glory and Lustre. God never more honoured his <hi>true Prophets,</hi> than when there were most

<hi>false Teachers</hi> under the New; Chap. 2. 1. <hi>But there were false Prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false Teachers among you.</hi> And the Reason of it is, because that as they pretended to the Spirit of the Lord in their <hi>prophesies,</hi> saying, <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> when he sent them not; so these ascribed all their <hi>abominable Heresies</hi> to the <hi>Inspiration of the Spirit,</hi> by whom they were not assisted.</p>

Beloved, beieve not every Spirit, but try the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the World. Hereby know we the Spirit of God; every Spirit that confesseth that Jesus is come in the flesh, is of God; and every Spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God.</hi> A two-fold Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection doth the Apostle here give unto all Believers. The first by the way of <hi>Caution,</hi> that they would not <hi>believe every Spirit;</hi> that is, not receive or give credit to <hi>every Doctrine</hi> that was proposed unto them as of immediate Revelation and Inspiration of the Spirit.

So dealt <hi>false Teachers</hi> with their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by their Pretences of <hi>immediate Revelations.</hi> His next Direction informs us how we may observe this Caution unto our Advantage, and this is by <hi>trying the Spirits themselves.</hi> This is the duty of all Believers on any such Pretences. They are to <hi>try</hi> these Spirits, and examine whether they are of God or no. For the observation of this Rule, and discharge of this Duty, the <hi>Church of Ephesus</hi> is commended by our Lord Jesus Christ; Rev. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And by this Warrant may we try the <hi>Spirit of the Church of Rome,</hi> which in like manner pretends unto Apostolical Authority and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> Unto these two Directions, the Apostle subjoyns the <hi>Reason</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent watchfulness required unto the discharge of this Duty. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>many false Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi> It is <hi>false Teachers,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> calls them, <hi>bringing in damnable Heresies,</hi> concerning whom he speaks. And he calleth them <hi>false Prophets,</hi> partly in an Allusion unto the <hi>false Prophets</hi> under the Old Testament, with whom they are ranked and compared by <hi>Peter;</hi> and partly because as they fathered their Predictions on Divine Revelation, so <hi>these</hi> falsly ascribed their <hi>Doctrines</hi> unto immediate Divine Inspiration. And on this account also he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them <hi>Spirits; Try the Spirits.</hi> For <hi>as</hi> they <hi>pretended</hi> unto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, so indeed for the most part they were <hi>acted</hi> by a Spirit of Error, Lying, and Delusion, that is the <hi>Devil</hi> himself. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I no way doubt but that mostly those who made use of this Plea, that they had their <hi>Doctrines</hi> which they taught by <hi>immediate Inspiration,</hi> did also effect other extraordinary Operations or undiscoverable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of them, as <hi>lying Miracles,</hi> by the Power of that Spirit whereby they were acted, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. Hence the Apostle doth not direct us to try their pretensions unto Inspiration, by putting them
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48389:17"/> on other <hi>extraordinary Works</hi> for their confirmation; for these also they made a shew and appearance of, and that in such a manner as that they were not to be detected by the generality of Christians, but he gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all a <hi>blessed stable Rule</hi> which will never fail them in this case who diligently attend unto it. And this is <hi>to try them</hi> by the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that they teach, <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 3. Let their Doctrine be examined by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and if it be found consonant thereunto, it may be received without danger unto the Hearers, whatever corrupt Affections the Teachers may be influenced by. But if it be not <hi>consonant</hi> thereunto, if it keep not up an <hi>harmony</hi> in the <hi>Analogie</hi> of Faith, whatever Inspiration or Revelation be pleaded in its Justification it is to be rejected, as they also are by whom it is declared. This Rule the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> confirms by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Instance imaginable; Gal. 1. 8. <hi>If we, or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Gospel unto you, then that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</hi> And the Apostle shews that for our advantage in this <hi>tryal</hi> we are to <hi>make of Spirits,</hi> it is good to have a clear conviction of, and a constant adherence unto some <hi>fundamental Principles,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such as we have reason to think will be the most cunningly attaqued by Seducers. Thus because in those dayes the principal <hi>design of Satan</hi> was to broach strange false Imaginations about the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Mediation of Christ,</hi> endeavouring thereby to overthrow both the one and the other; the Apostle adviseth Believers to <hi>try the Spirits</hi> by this one Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Principle of Truth, namely, that <hi>Jesus Christ is come in the flesh;</hi> which contains a confession both of his Person and Mediation. This therefore Believers were to demand of all <hi>new Teachers</hi> and Pretenders unto <hi>Spiritual Revelations</hi> in the first place; do you confess that <hi>Jesus Christ is come in the flesh;</hi> and if they immediately made not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, they never stood to consider their other Pretences but turned from them not bidding them <hi>God-speed,</hi> 2 Joh. 7. 10, 11. And I could easily manifest how many pernicious <hi>Heresies</hi> were obviated in those days by this short <hi>Confession of Faith.</hi> For some of late (as <hi>Grotius</hi> following

His coming in the flesh, is the same with the <hi>Words being made flesh,</hi> John 1. 14. or,
<hi>God being manifest in the flesh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. That is, the Son of God being made <hi>partaker of flesh and blood,</hi> Heb. 2. 14. or <hi>taking on him the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. That is, his being <hi>made of a Woman,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. or his being <hi>made of the Seed of</hi> David <hi>according to the flesh,</hi> Rom. 1. 3. His <hi>being of the Fathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And this was directly opposed unto those Heresies which were then risen, whose Broachers contended that Jesus Christ was but a Phantasie an Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, a manifestation of Divine Love and Power, denying that the Son of God was really incarnate, as the Antients generally testifie. And well had it been for many in our dayes had they attended unto such Rules as this. But through a neglect of it, accompanied with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded boldness and curiosity, they have hearkned in other things to
<hi>deceiving Spirits,</hi> and have been engaged beyond a recovery, before they have considered that by their <hi>cogging deceits</hi> they have been cheated of all the principal Articles of their Faith; by which, if at <hi>first</hi> they had steadily tryed and examined them, they might have been preserved from their Snares.</p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48389:18"/> The <hi>Jews</hi> say well, that there was a double <hi>tryal of Prophets</hi> under the Old Testament; the one by their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the other by their <hi>Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> That by their Doctrine, namely, whether they seduced Men from the Worship of the true God unto Idolatry, belonged unto <hi>all indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Persons</hi> of the Church. Direction for this is given <hi>Deut. 13. 2, 3. If the Prophet giveth a Sign or a Wonder, and it come to pass,</hi> (effect any thing by a seeming presence of an extraordinary Power) <hi>and say, Let us go serve other Gods, thou shalt not hearken unto him.</hi> Let his Signs and Wonders be what they would the People were to <hi>try them</hi> by what they taught. The Judgment upon Predictions was left unto the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim;</hi> for which Directions are given <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 20, 21, 22. And by vertue hereof they falsly and cruelly endeavoured to take away the Life of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> because he foretold the Ruine of them and their City,
<hi>Chap. 26. v.</hi> 11. In the first place, though his Sign, Wonder, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction came to pass, yet the Doctrine he sought to confirm by it being false, he was to be rejected. In the latter, the fulfilling of his Sign ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted him, because he taught with it nothing in point of Doctrine that was false. The first kind of tryal of the Spirits of Prophets is the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>all Believers</hi> under the Gospel. And those who would deprive them of this Liberty would make Bruits of them instead of Christians; unless to believe a Man knows not <hi>what,</hi> and to obey he knows not <hi>why,</hi> be the Properties of Christians, see <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Ephes. 5. 8, 9, 10, 11. Phil. 1. 10. 1 Thess.</hi> 5. 21. The other, so far as was needful to preserve the Church in Truth and Peace, was provided for in those <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> whilst there was a real communication of extraordinary Gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (and so more occasion given to the false Pretence of them, and more danger in being deceived by them) by a peculiar Gift of <hi>discerning them</hi> bestowed on some amongst them, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 10. Discerning of Spirits</hi> is reckoned among the Gifts of the Spirit. So had the Lord graciously provided for his Churches, that some among them should be enabled in an extraordinary manner, to <hi>discern</hi> and <hi>judg</hi> of them who <hi>pretended</hi> unto extraordinary actings of the Spirit. And upon the ceasing of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gifts really given from God, the Gift also of <hi>discerning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> ceased, and we are left unto the <hi>Word alone</hi> for the tryal of any that shall pretend unto them. Now this kind of Pretence was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in those dayes, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> to caution them that they suffered not themselves to be deceived in their Expectation and Computations about the Time of the coming of Christ, in the first place warns them not to be moved in it <hi>by Spirit,</hi> 2 Thess. 2. 2. That is, Persons pretending unto Spiritual Revelations. Something al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of this nature hath continued and broken out in succeeding Ages, and that in Instances abominable and dreadful. And the more eminent in any Season are the real <hi>Effusions of the Holy Spirit</hi> upon the Ministers of the Gospel, and Disciples of Christ, the more Diligence and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness against these <hi>Delusions</hi> are necessary. For on such opportunities it is, when the Use and Reputation of Spiritual Gifts is eminent, that
<hi>Satan</hi> doth lay hold to intrude under the colour of them his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Suggestions. In the dark Times of the <hi>Papacy</hi> all Stories are full of <hi>Satanical Delusions</hi> in Phantastical Apparitions, Horrors, <hi>Spectrums,</hi> and the like Effects of Darkness. It was seldom or never that any falsly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48389:18"/> pretended to the Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit; For these things were then of little use or request in the World. But when God was pleased to renew really a fresh communication of <hi>Spiritual Gifts and Graces</hi> unto Men in and upon the Reformation, the old Dreads and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
<hi>nightly Appearances</hi> tending unto Deeds of Darkness vanished, and every where by Satans Instigation arose <hi>false Pretenders</hi> to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; in which way of delusion he will still be more active and industrious, as God shall increase the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit in his Churches; though as yet in these latter Ages he hath not attained what he was arrived unto in the Primitive Times of the Gospel. A full and clear Declaration from the Scripture of the Nature of the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and his Operations, may through the blessing of God be of use to fortifie the Minds of <hi>Professors</hi> against <hi>Satanical Delusions</hi> counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Actings and Inspirations. For Directions unto this purpose are given us by the <hi>Holy Apostle,</hi> who lived to see great havock made in the Churches by deluding Spirits. Knowledg of the Truth, trying of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that go abroad by the Doctrines of the Scriptures, Dependence on the Holy Spirit for his Teachings according to the Word, are the Things which to this purpose he commends unto us.</p>

And from hence with the Fruits of it do they expect <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God,
<hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Blessedness</hi> hereafter. And one of these two things these deluded Souls must fix upon; namely, that this <hi>Light</hi> whereof they speak, is either the <hi>Holy Spirit of God</hi> or it is not. If they say it is the Spirit, it will be easie to demonstrate how by their so saying they utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroy the very <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Being of the Holy Ghost,</hi> as will evidently appear in our Explication of them. And if they say that it is not the
<hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God which they intend thereby, it will be no less mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that they utterly exclude <hi>him</hi> on the other side from his whole Work and substitute another, yea an <hi>Enemy</hi> in his room. For <hi>another God</hi> is a false God, <hi>another Christ</hi> is a false Christ, and <hi>another Spirit</hi> is a false Spirit, the Spirit of Antichrist. Now because this is a <hi>growing Evil</hi> amongst us many being led away and seduced, our Duty unto Jesus Christ, and Compassion for the Souls of Men, do require that our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most indeavour in the wayes of Christ's Appointment, should be used to <hi>obviate this Evil</hi> which eateth as doth a <hi>Canker;</hi> which also is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by prophane and vain bablings encreasing still unto more ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Some I confess do unduly <hi>rage</hi> against the Persons of those who have imbibed these <hi>Imaginations,</hi> falling upon them with violence and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48389:19"/> fury, as they do also on others; The Lord lay it not unto their charge. Yet this hinders not but that by those <hi>Weapons of our Warfare which are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds, casting down such like Imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it self against the Knowledg of God, and bringing into Captivity every thought unto the Obedience of Christ,</hi> We ought to attempt the destruction of their Errors, and the breaking of the Snares of Satan by whom they are taken captive alive at his pleasure. The course indeed of opposing
<hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>false Spirits</hi> by Praying, Preaching, Writing, is despised by them in whose furious and haughty minds, <hi>Ure, Seca, Occide; Burn, Gût,</hi> and <hi>Kill,</hi> are alone of any signification; that think, <hi>Arise</hi> Peter
<hi>kill and eat,</hi> to be a Precept of more Use and Advantage unto them than all the Commands of Jesus Christ besides. But the way proposed unto us by the Lord Jesus Christ himself, walked in by his Holy Apostles and all the Ancient Holy Learned Writers of the Church, is that which in these Matters we must and shall attend unto. And that course which is particularly suited to obviate the Evil mentioned, is to give a full plain evident Declaration from the Scripture of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of the Holy Spirit of God. Hence will it be undeniable manifest what a stranger this <hi>pretended Light</hi> is unto the true Spirit of Christ; how far it is from being of any real Use to the Souls of Men; yea how it is set up in opposition unto <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Work,</hi> by whom, and by which alone we become accepted with God, and are brought unto the enjoyment of him.</p>

<hi>Concern in the Spirit of God.</hi> This indeed is a thing which I have often wondred at, and do continue still so to doe. For whereas in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel every thing that is <hi>Good, Holy, Praise worthy</hi> in any Man, is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assigned to the <hi>Spirit</hi> as the immediate Efficient Cause and <hi>Operator</hi> of it, and whereas the Condition of Men without him, not made Partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Him, is described to be <hi>reprobate</hi> or rejected of God, and forreign unto any Interest in Christ; yet many pretending unto the Belief and Profession of the Gospel, are so far from owning or desiring a Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Spirit</hi> in their own Persons, as that they deride and contemn them who dare plead or avow any concern in him or his Works. Only I must grant that herein they have had some that have gone before them, namely the old scoffing Heathens.

<hi>Speak out now, receiving Power or Ability of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Spirit, or by the Spirit.</hi> Certainly an attendance to the old Caution, <hi>Si non caste tamen Caute,</hi> had been needful for some in this Matter. Could they not bring their own hearts unto a due Reverence of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and an endeavour after a Participation of his Fruits and Effects, yet the things that are spoken concerning him and his Work in the <hi>whole New Testament,</hi> and also in Places almost innumerable in <hi>the Old,</hi> might have put a check to their publick Contemptuous Reproaches and scornful Mockings, whilst they own those writings to be of God. But such was his Entertainment in the World upon his first Effusion;
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 13. Many Pretences I know will be pleaded to give Countenance unto this Abomination. For First, They will say, it is not the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> himself and his works, but the <hi>Pretence</hi> of others unto <hi>him</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> which they so reproach and scorn. I fear this <hi>Plea</hi> or Excuse, will prove too short and narrow, to make a Covering unto their Profaneness. It is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48389:20"/> venturing with Rudeness and <hi>Petulancy</hi> upon holy things, and then framing of Excuses. But in Reproaches of the Lord Christ and his Spirit, Men will not want their Pretences, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 32. And the things of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> which they thus Reproach &amp; scorn in any, are either such as are <hi>truely</hi> and really ascribed unto him and wrought by him in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> or they are not: If they are such as indeed are
<hi>no Effects</hi> of the Spirit of Grace, such as he is not promised for, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested to work in them that do believe, as <hi>vain Enthusiasmes, extatical Raptures,</hi> and Revelations, certainly it more became Christians, Men
<hi>professing</hi> or at least <hi>pretending</hi> a Reverence unto God, his Spirit, and his Word, to manifest and convince those of whom they treat, that such things are not <hi>Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> but Imaginatiocs of their own; then to <hi>deride</hi> them under the name of the <hi>Spirit</hi> or his <hi>Gifts</hi> &amp; Operations. Do Men consider with whom and what they make bold in these things? But if they be things that are <hi>real Effects</hi> of the Spirit of Christ in them that believe, or such as are undeniably <hi>assigned</hi> unto him in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which they despise; what remains to give countenance unto this daring Prophaneness? Yea, but they say, Secondly, It is not the real true <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of the Spirit themselves, but the false <hi>Pretensions</hi> of others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them which they traduce and expose. But will this warrant the Course which it is manifest they steer in Matter and Manner? The same Persons pretend to <hi>believe in Christ and the Gospel,</hi> and to be made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Benefits of his Mediation. And yet if they have not <hi>the Spirit of Christ,</hi> they have no saving Interest in these things; for if <hi>any Man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</hi> If it be then onely their <hi>false pretending</hi> unto the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> and his Works which these Persons so revile and scorn, why do they not deal with them in like manner with respect unto <hi>Christ</hi> and the Profession of the Gospel? Why do they not say unto them, <hi>you believe in Christ, you believe in the Gospel;</hi> and thereon expose them to Derision? So plainly dealt the Jews with our Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>Psal. 22. 7, 8. Math.</hi> 21. 39, 43. It is therefore the things themselves, and not the <hi>Pretences pretended,</hi> that are the Objects of this contempt and Reproach. Besides; suppose those whom at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent on other Occasions they hate or despise, are not <hi>Partakers</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> but are really strangers unto the things which <hi>hypocritically</hi> they profess? Will they grant and allow that any other <hi>Christians</hi> in the World do so really partake of him, as to be <hi>led, guided, directed,</hi> by him, to be <hi>quickned, sanctified, purified</hi> by him, to be <hi>enabled</hi> unto Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and all duties of Holy Obedience by him, with those other Effects and Operations for which he is promised by Jesus Christ unto his Disciples? If they will grant these things to be really effected and accomplished in <hi>Any,</hi> let them not be offended with them who desire that they should be so in themselves, and declare themselves to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and Men would have more Charity for them under their <hi>petulant scoffing,</hi> than otherwise they are able to exercise. It will Thirdly, Yet be pleaded, that they grant as fully as any the <hi>Being</hi> of the Holy Ghost, the <hi>Promise</hi> of him and his real Operations, only they differ from others as to the sense and Exposition of those <hi>Phrases</hi> and Expressions that are used concerning these things in the Scripture which those others <hi>abuse</hi> in an unintelligible manner, as making them <hi>proper</hi> which indeed are <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical.</hi> But is this the way which they like and choose to express
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48389:20"/> their Notions and Apprehensions? Namely openly to revile and scorne the very <hi>Naming</hi> and asserting the work of the Spirit of God, in the words which himself hath taught? A Boldness this is which as whereof the former Ages have not given us a President, so we hope the future will not afford an Instance of any to follow the Example. For their sense and Apprehension of these things they shall afterward be examined, so far as they have <hi>dared</hi> to discover them.

For without him, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as the Word, Ministry, and Ordinances of Worship, are Lifeless and Useless.

Of what <hi>use</hi> then is the Spirit of God in these things? Of none at all it may be, nor the Doctrine concerning him, but only to fill the World with <hi>a buzze</hi> and <hi>noise,</hi> and to trouble the minds of Men with <hi>unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Notions.</hi> Had not these things been spoken, they should not have been repeated, for Death lyeth at the Door in them. So then Men may
<hi>pray</hi> without him, and <hi>preach</hi> without him, and <hi>turn</hi> to God without him, and <hi>perform</hi> all their Duties without him well enough. For if any one shall plead the necessity of his <hi>Assistance</hi> for the due performance of these things, and ascribe unto him all that is good and well done in them, he shall hardly escape from being notably derided.

From the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World the Principal Revelation that God made of himself, was in the <hi>Oneness</hi> of his Nature, and his <hi>Monarchy</hi> over all. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Person of the Father</hi> was immediately represented with his Power and Authority. For he is the Fountain and Original of the Deity, the other Persons as to their Subsistence being of him. Only he did withal give out Promises concerning the peculiar <hi>Exhibition of the Son in the Flesh</hi> in an appointed season, as also of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to be given by him in an especial manner. Hereby were their <hi>Persons</hi> to be signally glorifyed in this World; it being the Will of God that all <hi>Men should honour the Son, as they honoured the Father;</hi> and the Holy Spirit in like manner. In this state of things, the only Apostacy of the Church could be <hi>Polutheisme</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Accordingly so it came to pass. The <hi>Church of Israel</hi> was continually prone to these Abominations; so that scarcely a Generation passed, or very few, wherein the <hi>Body of the People</hi> did not more or less defile themselves with them. To wean and recover them from this Sin was the Principal End of the Preaching of those <hi>Prophets</hi> which God from time to time sent unto them, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 13. And this also
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48389:21"/> was the Cause of all the <hi>Calamities</hi> which befel them, and of all the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God inflicted on them, as is testifyed in all the <hi>Historical Books</hi> of the Old Testament, and confirmed by Instances innumerable. To put an End hereunto God at length brought a <hi>total Desolation</hi> upon the whole Church, and caused the People to be carried into Captivity out of their own Land. And hereby it was so far effected that upon their <hi>Return</hi> what-ever other sins they fell into, yet they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from <hi>Idols and Idolatry, Ezek.</hi> 16. 62, 63. Chap. 23. <hi>vers.</hi> 27, 48. And the Reason hereof was, because the time was now drawing nigh wherein they were to be tryed with <hi>another Dispensation</hi> of God. The Son of God was to be <hi>sent</hi> unto them in the Flesh. To receive and obey him was now to be the principal <hi>Instance</hi> and Trial of their Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. They were no longer to be tried merely by their Faith whether they would own <hi>only the God of Israel,</hi> in opposition unto all false Gods and Idols; for that Ground God had now absolutely won upon them; But now all is to turn on this <hi>Hinge,</hi> whether they would receive <hi>the Son of God</hi> coming in the Flesh according to the Promise; Here the Generallity of that Church and People fell by their <hi>Unbelief,</hi> apostatised from God, and became thereby neither Church nor People <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 24. They being rejected, the <hi>Son of God</hi> calls and gathers another Church, founding it on his own Person with Faith and the Profession of it therein. <hi>Mat. 16. v.</hi> 18, 19. In this new Church therefore this Foundation is fixed and this Ground made Good, That <hi>Jesus Christ the Son of God</hi> is to be owned and honoured as we honour the Father. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. And herein all that are duly called Christians do agree; as the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> did in one God after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon;</hi> But now the Lord Jesus Christ being ascended unto his Father, hath committed his whole Affairs in the Church and in the World unto the <hi>Holy Spirit. Joh.</hi> 16. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. And it is on this Design of God, that the <hi>Person of the Spirit</hi> may be singularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in the Church, unto whom they were so in the dark before that some none of the worst of them professed they had not so much as heard whether there were <hi>any Holy Ghost or no, Acts</hi> 19. 2. that is, at least as unto the peculiar Dispensation of him then introduced in the Church. Wherefore the Duty of the Church now immediately respects the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> who acts towards it in the <hi>Name of the Father and of the Son.</hi> And with respect unto him it is, that the Church in its present state is
<hi>capable of an Apostasy</hi> from God; And whatever is found of this Nature amongst any here it hath its Beginning. For the sin of despising <hi>his</hi> Person and rejecting <hi>his</hi> work now, is of the same Nature with <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> of Old, and the <hi>Jews</hi> Rejection of the <hi>Person of the Son.</hi> And whereas there was a Releif provided against these Sins, because there was a new Dispensation of the Grace of God to ensue in the <hi>Evangelical</hi> work of the Holy Ghost; if Men sin against <hi>him</hi> and his operations containing the Perfection and Complement of God's Revelation of himself unto them, their Condition is deplorable.</p>

And hereon they have been taught, that the Great Concernments of their <hi>Peace, Comfort,</hi> and <hi>Assurance,</hi> of their Communion among themselves as the Saints of God, with many other Ends of their Holy Conversation, do depend. Nay it is and hath been constantly taught them that if there be not an <hi>effectual Work</hi> of the Holy Ghost upon their hearts, that they <hi>cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Now these things and whatever is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Explication of them, are by some called in <hi>Question</hi> if not utterly rejected.

Others say, that what is delivered concerning them is <hi>hardly</hi> if at all to be <hi>understood</hi> by Rational Men, being only empty Speculations about things wherein Christian Religion is little or not at all concerned. Whereas therefore many, very many, have received these things as <hi>Sacred Truths,</hi> and are perswaded that they have found them <hi>realized</hi> in their own Souls, so that into their Experience of the work of the Holy Spirit of God in them and upon them according as it is declared in the <hi>Word,</hi> all their <hi>Consolation</hi> and Peace with God is for the most part resolved, as that which gives them the best Evidence of their
<hi>Interest</hi> in him who is their Peace; and whereas for the Present they do believe that unless these things are so in and with them, they have no Foundation to build an <hi>Hope of Eternal Life</hi> upon; it cannot but be of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible necessity unto them to examine and <hi>Search the Scripture dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently</hi> whether these things be so or no. For if there be no such <hi>Work of the Spirit of God</hi> upon the Hearts of Men and that indispensibly necessary to their Salvation; if there are no such Assistances and supplys of Grace
<hi>needful unto every Good</hi> Duty as wherein they have been instructed; then in the whole course of their Profession they have only been sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>by cunningly devised Fables,</hi> their deceived hearts have fed upon ashes, and they are yet in their Sins.

I know indeed that most <hi>Believers</hi> are so far satisfyed in the Truth of these things and their own Experience of them, that they will not be moved in the least by the Oppositions which are made unto them, and the <hi>scorn</hi> that is cast upon them. <hi>For he that beleiveth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself. 1 Joh.</hi> 5. 10. But yet as <hi>Luke</hi> wrote his Gospel to <hi>Theophilus</hi> that he might <hi>know the certainty of those things wherein he had been instructed, Luke</hi> 1. 4. that is, to confirm him in the Truth by an Addition of new <hi>Degrees of Assurance</hi> unto him; so it is our Duty to be so far excited by the <hi>Clamorous Oppositions</hi> that are made unto the Truths which we Profess, and in whose being such we are as much concerned as our Souls are worth, to <hi>compare them diligently with the Scripture</hi> that we may be the more fully confirmed and established in them. And upon the Examination of the whole matter, I shall leave them to their option as <hi>Elijah</hi> did of Old; if <hi>Jehovah be God, serve him, and if Baal be God let him be worshipped.</hi> If the things which the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Professors do believe and acknowledg concerning the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> and his Work on their Hearts, his Gifts and Graces in the Church with the manner of their Communication, be for the <hi>substance</hi> of them wherein they all <hi>generally agree</hi> according to the Scripture, taught and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed therein on the same terms as by them received; them may they abide in the <hi>Holy Profession of them,</hi> and rejoyce in the Consolations they have received by them. But if these things with those other which in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them to the Souls of Men are directly and necessarily dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and to be deduced from them, are all but <hi>vain and useless</hi> Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is high time the Minds of Men were disburthened of them.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> In such variety are these words used and applyed in the Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of some very <hi>general Notions</hi> wherein the things intended do agree. For the most part there is no great difficulty in discovering the especial meaning of them, or what it is they signifie in the several places where they occur. Their Design and Circumstances as to the Subject Matter treated of, determine the signification. And notwithstanding the <hi>ambiguous Use</hi> of these words in the Old and New Testament, there are two things clear and evident unto our purpose. First, That there is in the Holy Scriptures a full distinct Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Declaration of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit of God</hi>

For we shall find this Doctrine to be the very Life and Soul which quickens the whole from first to last. Take away the Work and powerful Efficacy of the Holy Spirit from the <hi>administration</hi> of it, and it will prove but a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> of no saving advantage to the Souls of Men; and take away the <hi>Doctrine</hi> concerning him from the <hi>writing</hi> of it, and the whole will be unintelligible and useless. Secondly, That what-ever is affirmed of this <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> the Spirit of God, it all relates either to his <hi>Person</hi> or his <hi>Operations.</hi> And these Operations of his being various, are sometimes by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> called <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereof afterwards.

                  </note> As God then absolutely is called <hi>Holy,</hi> the <hi>Holy One,</hi> and the <hi>Holy One of Israel,</hi> being therein described by that Glorious Property of his Nature whereby he is <hi>Glorious in Holiness; Exod.</hi> 15. 11, And whereby he is distinguished from all false Gods; <hi>who is like unto thee O Jehovah, among the Gods, who is like unto thee, Glorious in Holiness;</hi> So is the Spirit called <hi>Holy</hi> to denote the <hi>Holiness</hi> of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And on this Account is the Opposition made between him and the
<hi>Unholy,</hi> or unclean Spirit. <hi>Mark. 3. 29, 30. He that shall blaspheme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Holy Spirit, hath never forgivness. Because they said he hath an unclean Spirit.</hi> And herein first his <hi>Personality</hi> is asserted; for the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit</hi> is a Person. And if the Spirit of God were only a <hi>Quality</hi> or
<hi>Accident</hi> as some fancy and dream, there could no comparative opposition be made between him and this <hi>unclean Spirit,</hi> that is the Devil. So also are they opposed with respect unto their <hi>Natures.</hi> His Nature is <hi>Holy,</hi> whereas that of the <hi>unclean Spirit</hi> is <hi>Evil</hi> and perverse. This is the Foundation of his being called <hi>Holy;</hi> even the eternal <hi>Glorious Holiness of his Nature.</hi> And on this account he is so stiled also with respect unto <hi>all</hi> his Operations. For it is not only with regard unto the particular Work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or making of us Holy, but unto all his Works and Operations that he is so termed. For he being the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Operator of all Divine Works that outwardly are of God, and they being in themselves all <hi>Holy</hi> be they of what kind soever, He is called the Holy Spirit. Yea he is so called to <hi>attest</hi> and witness that all his Works, all the Works of God, are <hi>Holy,</hi> although they may be great and terrible, and such as to Corrupt Reason may have an other Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; in all which we are to acquiesce in this, that the <hi>Holy One in the midst of us will do no iniquity, Zeph.</hi> 3. 5. The Spirit of God then is thus frequently and almost constantly called <hi>Holy;</hi> to attest that all the Works of God whereof he is the immediate Operator are <hi>Holy.</hi> For it is the Work of the Spirit to <hi>harden</hi> and blind obstinate sinners, as well as to
<hi>Sanctifie</hi> the Elect. And his acting in the One is no less <hi>Holy</hi> than in the other, although Holiness be not the Effect of it in the Objects. So when he came to declare his dreadful Work of the final hardning and Rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> one of the most tremendous Effects of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, a Work which for the strangeness of it Men <hi>would in no wise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though it were declared unto them, Acts</hi> 13. 41. he was signally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed

<hi>an Evil Spirit from the Lord,</hi> that is appointed and commissioned by him, for the punishing and terrifying of <hi>Saul.</hi> For as the Spirit of the Lord departed from him by with-drawing his Assistance and Influential opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby he had wrought in him those Gifts and Abilities of mind which fitted him unto the discharge of his <hi>Kingly Office,</hi> upon the first impressions whereof he was turned into <hi>another man</hi> from what he was in his Private Condition, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 6, 9. So the Evil Spirit came upon him to excite out of his own adust <hi>Melancholy,</hi> discontents, fears, a sense of Guilt, as also to impress <hi>terrifying thoughts</hi> and Apprehensions on his Imagination.

And that we may touch a little on this by the way; The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Trouble and distress of <hi>Saul</hi> lay in himself.

The most Eminent Wiseman was not wont in vain to affirm, that if the minds of Tyrants were laid open and discovered, it would be seen how they were cruciated and punished; seeing that as the Body is rent and torn by stripes, so is the Mind, by cruelty, Lusts, evil Counsels and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings;</hi> so he, as I suppose from <hi>Plato de Repub. lib.</hi> 9.

And if the Spirit did proceed only from the Persons of the <hi>Father,</hi> he could not be promised, sent, or given by the <hi>S n.</hi> Consider therefore the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of Christ in it self and <hi>abstractedly,</hi> and the Spirit cannot be said to be the Spirit of Christ. For it was <hi>anointed</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with Gifts and Graces by him as we shall shew. And if from hence he may be said to be the <hi>Spirit of Christ</hi> without respect unto his
<hi>proceeding</hi> from him as the Son of God, then he may be also said to be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48389:29"/> the <hi>Spirit of every Believer</hi> who hath received the <hi>Unction,</hi> or are anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his Gifts and Graces. For although Believers are so as to Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Degree unspeakably beneath what Christ was, who received
<hi>not the Spirit by Measure;</hi> yet as he is the Head, and they are the Members of the same Mystical Body, their <hi>Unction by the Spirit</hi> is of the same kind. But now the Spirit of God may not be said to be the Spirit of this or that Man who hath received of his Gifts and Graces. <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>Take not thy Holy Spirit from me;</hi> not <hi>my Holy Spirit.</hi> And he is distinguished from our <hi>Spirits</hi> even as they are sanctified by him.
<hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit himself beareth witness with our Spirit.</hi> No more than can he be said to be the Spirit of Christ meerly upon the account of his Communications unto him, although in a <hi>degree</hi> above all others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably excellent. For with respect hereunto he is still called the
<hi>Spirit of God</hi> or the Father who sent him, and anointed the Humane Nature of Christ with him.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> It will be said, perhaps, that he is called the Spirit of Christ, because he is promised given and poured out by him. So <hi>Peter</hi> speaks Acts 2. 33. <hi>Having received of the Father the Promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear.</hi> But in this regard, namely as given by Christ the Mediator he is expresly called the <hi>Spirit of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> he was given as the Promise of the Father; for so he is introduced speaking, <hi>v. 17. it shall come to pass in the last Days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh.</hi> And so our Saviour tells his Disciples, that he would <hi>pray the Father and he should give them another Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth, Joh.</hi> 14. 16, 17. Nor is he otherwise the Spirit of Christ originally and formally, but as he is the Spirit of God, that is as Christ is God also. On this supposition, I grant as before, that he may <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially</hi> be called the Spirit of Christ, because <hi>promised</hi> and sent by him, because <hi>doing his Work,</hi> and Communicating his Grace Image and likeness to the Elect.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> And this is yet more plain; 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 10, 11. Of which Salvation the Prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesyed of the Grace that should come unto you; searching what, or what manner of Time, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ which was in them did signify.</hi> And this Spirit is said abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be the Holy Ghost; 2 <hi>Epist.</hi> Chap. 1. 21. So then the Spirit that was in the Prophets of old in all Ages since the World began, before the Incarnation of the Son of God is called the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> that is of him who is so. Now this could not be, because he was <hi>anointed by that Spirit,</hi> or because he gave it afterwards to his Disciples; for his Humane Nature did not exist in the Time of their Prophesying. Those indeed who receive him after the <hi>Unction of the Humane Nature of Christ,</hi> may be said in some sense to receive the Spirit of Christ because they are made Partakers of the <hi>same Spirit</hi> with him, to the same Ends and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses according to their measure. But this cannot be so with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them who lived and Prophesyed by him and died long before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation. Wherefore it is pleaded by those who oppose both the Deity of Christ and the Spirit, which are undeniably here attested unto, that the Spirit here, whereby they cannot deny the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to be intended is called the Spirit of Christ, because the <hi>Prophets of old</hi> who spake by him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48389:29"/> did principally prophesy <hi>concerning Christ,</hi> and his Grace, and delivered great Mysteries concerning them. So Christ is made in this Place the
<hi>Object</hi> of the Spirits Teaching, and not the <hi>Author</hi> of his sending. So
<hi>Crell. Prolegom.</hi> p. 13. 14. But why then is he not called the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> also on this Reason; because the Prophets that speak by him, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly <hi>of God,</hi> the things and the Will of God? This they will not say, for they acknowledg him to be the <hi>Vertue and Power of God</hi> inherent in him and proceeding from him. But then whereas God even the Father is a <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>Christ is a Person,</hi> and the Spirit is said to be the
<hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit of Christ,</hi> whence doth it appear that the same Expression must have different Interpretations; and that the Spirit, is called the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> because he <hi>is so</hi> and <hi>proceedeth from</hi> him? but the Spirit of Christ because he is <hi>not so,</hi> but only <hi>treateth</hi> of him? The answer is ready; namely because the Father is God, but Christ <hi>is not,</hi> and therefore could not give the Spirit when he was not. This is an easie Answer; namely to deny a <hi>Fundamental Truth,</hi> and to set up that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal in an Opposition unto a clear Testimony given unto it. But the Truth is, this pretended sense leaves no <hi>sense</hi> at all in the Words. For if the Spirit which was in the Prophets be called the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> only because he did before-hand declare the things of Christ, that is his <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Glory that did ensue,</hi> and that be the sole Reason of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, then the sense or importance of the Words is this, <hi>searching what or what manner of Time the Spirit which did signifie when it testified before hand the sufferings of Christ which was in them did signifie when he testified before hand the sufferings of Christ.</hi> For according to this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, the Spirit of Christ is nothing but the Spirit as testifying before-hand of him, and thence alone is he so called; the Absurdity whereof is apparent unto all.</p>

But the Spirit here intended, is not called the <hi>Spirit of Antichrist,</hi> because it <hi>declared and foretold the things of Antichrist</hi> before his coming; On which account alone they allow the Spirit of God in the Prophets of Old to be called the Spirit of Christ. They have therefore no countenance from this Place which failes them in the Principal thing they would prove by it. Again supposing those Words, <hi>whereof you have heard that it should come and is now in the World,</hi> are to be interpreted of the <hi>Spirit</hi> mentioned and not of <hi>Antichrist</hi> himself, yet no more can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but that the false Teachers and Seducers which were then in the World acted with the <hi>same Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Antichrist</hi> should do at his coming. And so there is no Conformity between these Expressions. Besides the
<hi>Spirit of Antichrist</hi> was then in the World, <hi>as</hi> was Antichrist himself; so far as his Spirit was in the world, so far was he so also; For <hi>Antichrist</hi> and his Spirit cannot be separated. Both he and it were then in the World, in their forerunners who opposed the Truth of the Gospel about the Incarnation of the Son of God and his sufferings. And indeed the <hi>Spirit of Antichrist</hi> in this Place, is no more but his <hi>Doctrines; Antichristian
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48389:30"/> Doctrine</hi> which is to be tryed and rejected. Neither is any singular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son intended by <hi>Antichrist,</hi> but a <hi>Mysterious Opposition</hi> unto Christ and the Gospel, signally Headed by a <hi>series</hi> of men in the latter days. He therefore and his Spirit began to be together in the World in the <hi>Apostles Days,</hi> when the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity began to work, 2 Thessal.</hi> 2. 7. There is therefore no countenance to be taken from these words, unto the perverting and wresting of that other expression concerning the Spirit of Christ in the Prophets of old. This therefore is the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of this Apellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Holy Spirit is called the <hi>Spirit of the Son,</hi> and the Spirit of Christ, upon the Account of his Procession or <hi>Emanation</hi> from his Person also. Without respect hereunto he could not be called properly the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ; but on that supposition he may be, he is so <hi>denominated,</hi> from that various Relation &amp; Respect that he hath unto him in his Work and Operations. Thus is the Spirit <hi>called</hi> in the Scripture, these are the

And I shall endeavour to six what I have to offer upon its proper <hi>Principles,</hi> and from them to educe the whole Doctrine concerning it. And this must be so done, as to manifest the Interest of our <hi>Faith, Obedience,</hi> and Holy Worship, in the whole and each Part of it. For these are the immediate Ends of all Divine Revelations; according to that Holy <hi>Maxime</hi> of our Blessed Saviour; <hi>if you know these things, happy are ye if you doe them.</hi> To this End the Ensuing Principles are to be observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> 1. <hi>The Nature and Being of God is the Foundation of all true Religion and holy Religious Worship in the World.</hi> The great End for which we were made, for which we were brought forth by the Power of God into this World, is to <hi>Worship him</hi> and to give glory unto him. For he <hi>made all things for himself</hi> or his own Glory (<hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4.) to be rendred unto him according to the Abilities and Capacities that he hath furnished
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48389:31"/> them withal, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. 11. And that which makes this Worship indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensibly necessary unto us, and from whence it is <hi>Holy or Religious,</hi> is the Nature and Being of God himself. There are indeed many <hi>Parts or Acts</hi> of Religious Worship which immediately respect, (as their Reason and Motive) what God <hi>is unto us,</hi> or what he hath done and doth for us. But the Principal and Adaequate Reason of all <hi>Divine Worship</hi> and that which makes it such, is what God is in himself. Because he is, that is, an <hi>Infinitely Glorious, Good, Wise, Holy, Powerful, Righteous, self-subsisting, self-sufficient, All-sufficient Being,</hi> the <hi>Fountain, Cause</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> to all things, and of all that is Good in every kind, the <hi>First Cause, last End,</hi> and absolutely <hi>Sovereign Lord of all, the Rest</hi> and <hi>All-satisfactory Reward</hi> of all other Beings, therefore is he by us to be adored, and Worshipped with Divine and Religious Worship. Hence are we in our Hearts, Minds and Souls, to <hi>Admire, Adore,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> Him, his <hi>Praises</hi> are we to celebrate; <hi>Him to Trust</hi> and fear, and so to resign our selves and all our concernments unto his <hi>Will</hi> and Disposal; to regard him with all the Acts of our Minds and Persons, answerably to the Holy Properties and Excellencies of his Nature. This it is to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify him as God. For seeing <hi>of him, and through him, and to him are all things,</hi> to him must be <hi>Glory</hi> for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. Believing that God thus <hi>is,</hi> and that he is a <hi>Rewarder of them that seek him,</hi> is the Ground of all <hi>Coming unto God</hi> in his Worship, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. And herein lies the sin of Men, that the <hi>invisible things of God being Manifest unto them, even his Eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> yet they do not Glorify him as God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. This is to Honour, Worship, Fear God <hi>for himself;</hi> that is, on the Account of what he is himself. Where the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is, there is the true, proper, formal Object of Religious worship, and where that is not, it is Idolatry to ascribe it to or exercise it towards any. And this God instructs us in, in all those Places where the Proclaimes his <hi>Name</hi> and describes his <hi>Eternal Excellencies,</hi> and that either absolutely or in Comparison with other things. All is that we may know him to be
<hi>such a one,</hi> as is to be Worshipped and Glorified for himself, or his own sake.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> Secondly; <hi>The Revelation that God is pleased to make of himself unto us, gives the Rule and measure of all Religious Worship and Obedience.</hi> His
<hi>Being</hi> absolutely considered as comprehending in it all infinitely Divine Perfections, is the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of our Worship; but this Worship is to be
<hi>directed,</hi> guided, regulated, by the <hi>Revelation</hi> he makes of that Being, and of those Excellencies unto us. This is the End of <hi>Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> namely to <hi>direct</hi> us in paying that Homage which is due unto the Divine Nature. I speak not now only of <hi>Positive Institutions</hi> which are the free Effects of the Will of God depending originally and solely on Revelation, and which therefore have been various and actually chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this is that which I intend. Look what way <hi>soever</hi> God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth his Being and Properties unto us, by his Works or his Word, our Worship consisteth in a <hi>due Application</hi> of our Souls unto him according to that Manifestation of himself.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> Thirdly; <hi>God hath revealed or manifested himself as Three in One.</hi> And therefore as such is to be worshipped and glorified by us; that is, as three
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48389:31"/>
                  <hi>distinct Persons,</hi> subsisting in the same Infinitely Holy One individed Essence. This Principle might be, and had not that labour been obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ought to have been here at large confirmed, it being that which the whole ensuing Discourse doth presuppose and lean upon. And in truth I fear that the failing of some Mens Profession begins with their Relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishment of this <hi>Foundation.</hi> It is now evident unto all, that here hath been the fatal miscarriage of those poor deluded Souls amongst us whom they call <hi>Quakers.</hi> And it is altogether in vain to deal with them about other Particulars, whilst they are carried away with <hi>Infidelity</hi> from this Foundation. Convince any of them of the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> and all the rest of their Imaginations vanish into Smoak: And I wish it were so with them only. There are others and those <hi>not a few,</hi> who either reject the Doctrine of it as <hi>false,</hi> or despise it as <hi>unintelligible,</hi> or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect it as <hi>useless</hi> or of no great <hi>Importance.</hi> I know this <hi>Ulcer</hi> lies hid in the minds of many, and cannot but expect when it will break out and cover the whole Body with its Defilements whereof they are Members. But these things are left to the care of Jesus Christ. The Reason why I shall not in this place insist professedly on the Confirmation and Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Fundamental Truth, is because I have done it elsewhere, as having more than once publickly <hi>cast my Mite</hi> into this Sanctuary of the Lord; for which and the like <hi>services</hi> wherein I stand indebted unto the Gospel, I have met with that Reward which I did alwayes except. For the present I shall only say, that on this Supposition that God hath revealed himself as <hi>Three in One;</hi> He is in all our Worship of him so to be considered. And therefore in our Initiation into the Profession and Practice of the Worship of God according to the Gospel, we are in our Baptism ingaged to it, <hi>In the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. This is the Foundation of <hi>our doing all the things that Christ commands us,</hi> v. 20. Unto this Service we are solemnly dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, namely of God, as <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> as they are each of them equally participant of the same Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> Fourthly; <hi>These Persons are so distinct in their peculiar Subsistence, that distinct Actings and Operations are ascribed unto them.</hi> And these Actings are of two sorts; (1.) <hi>Ad intra,</hi> which are those internal Acts in one Person whereof another Person is the Object. And these Acts
<hi>ad invicem,</hi> or <hi>intra,</hi> are natural and necessary inseparable from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Existence of God. So the <hi>Father</hi> knows the <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>loveth</hi> him, and the Son <hi>seeth, knoweth,</hi> and <hi>loveth</hi> the Father. In these mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Actings, one Person is the Object of the Knowledg and Love of the other. <hi>John 3. 35. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand,</hi> Chap. 5. 20. <hi>The Father loveth the Son,</hi> Matth. 11. 27.
<hi>No Man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any Man the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther save the Son.</hi> John 6. 46. None hath <hi>seen the Father save he which is of God he hath seen the Father.</hi> This mutual Knowledg and Love of Father and Son is expressed at large, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22. which place I have opened and vindicated elsewhere. And they are Absolute, Infinite, Natural and Necessary unto the Being and Blessedness of God. So the Spirit is the <hi>mutual Love</hi> of the Father and the Son, knowing them as he is known, and <hi>searching the deep things of God.</hi> And in these mutual internal eternal Actings of themselves, consists much of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48389:32"/> the infinite <hi>Blessedness</hi> of the Holy God. Again, (2.) there are distinct Actings of the several Persons <hi>ad extra,</hi> which are voluntary or effects of Will and Choice, and not natural or necessary. And these are of two sorts, (1.) Such as respect <hi>one another.</hi> For there are <hi>external Acts</hi> of one Person towards another; but then the Person that is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of these actings is not considered <hi>absolutely as a Divine Person,</hi> but with respect unto some peculiar Dispensation and Condescention. So the Father <hi>gives, sends, commands</hi> the Son, as he had condescended to take our Nature upon him, and to be the Mediator between God and Man. So the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> do <hi>send the Spirit,</hi> as he condescends in an especial manner to the Office of being the <hi>Sunctifier</hi> and <hi>Comforter</hi> of the Church. Now these are free and voluntary Acts, depending upon the Sovereign Will Counsel &amp; Pleasure of God, and might <hi>not have been</hi> without the least diminution of his Eternal Blessedness. (2.) There are especial Acts <hi>ad extra</hi> towards the Creatures.

This way went the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Hereticks of old, and they are now followed by the <hi>Mahumetans;</hi> and some of late among our selves have attempted to revive the same Frenzy. But we shall not need to trouble our selves about this Notion. The folly of it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48389:32"/> is so evident, that it is almost by all utterly deserted. For such things are affirmed of the Holy Ghost in the Scripture, as that to assert his
<hi>Personality</hi> and deny his <hi>Deity,</hi> is the utmost madness that any one can fall into in Spiritual things. Wherefore the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the present great Enemies of the Doctrine of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> and who would be thought to go soberly about the work of destroying the Church of God, do utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject this Plea and Pretence. But that which they advance in the room of it is of no less pernitious Nature and Consequence. For granting the things assigned to him to be the Effects of <hi>Divine Power,</hi> they deny his <hi>Personality;</hi> and assert that what is called by the Name of the Spirit of God, or the Holy Spirit, is nothing but a <hi>Quality</hi> in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, or the Power that God puts forth for such and such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; which yet is no new invention of theirs.

<hi>particular Testimony,</hi> nor from the Assignation of any single Personal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty unto him, but from the constant Uniform Tenor of the Scripture in ascribing all these <hi>Properties</hi> unto him. And we may add hereunto, that things are so ordered in the Wisdom of God, that there is <hi>no Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Property</hi> that may be found in an Infinite Divine Nature, but it is in One place or other ascribed unto him.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> There is no Exception can be laid against the force of this Argument, but only that <hi>some things</hi> on the One hand are ascribed unto the <hi>Spirit</hi> which belong not unto a Person, nor can be spoken of him who is so; and on the other, that sundry things that properly belong to Persons are in the Scripture <hi>figuratively</hi> ascribed unto such things as are not so. Thus as to the first head of this Exception, the Holy Spirit is said to be poured out, to be shed abroad, to <hi>be an Unction,</hi> or the like, of all which Expressions we shal treat afterwards. What then shall we say, that he is <hi>not a Person,</hi> but only the <hi>Power of God?</hi> Will this render those Expressions concerning him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? How can the Vertue of God or the Power of God be said to be <hi>poured out,</hi> to be <hi>shed abroad</hi> &amp; the like? Wherefore both they and we acknowledg that these Expressions are <hi>figurative,</hi> as many things are so expressed of God in the Scripture and that frequently; and what is the meaning of them under their <hi>figurative</hi> Colours we shall afterwards declare. This therefore doth not in the least impeach our Argument, unless this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were true generally; that whatever is spoken of <hi>figuratively</hi> in the Scripture is no Person; which would leave no <hi>One</hi> in Heaven or Earth. On the other side it is confessed that there are things peculiar unto ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Subsistents or <hi>Persons,</hi> which are ascribed sometimes unto those that are not so. Many things of this Nature, as to <hi>hope,</hi> to <hi>believe,</hi> to <hi>bear,</hi> are ascribed unto <hi>Charity; 1 Cor.</hi> 13. But every one presently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends that this Expression is <hi>figurative;</hi> the Abstract being put for the
<hi>Cencrete,</hi> by a <hi>Metalepsis;</hi> and Charity is said to do that, which a Man endued with that Grace will doe. So the Scripture is said to <hi>see,</hi> to <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see,</hi> to <hi>speak,</hi> and to <hi>judg,</hi> which are Personal Actings; but who doth not see and grant that a <hi>Metonymy,</hi> is and must be allowed in such assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that being ascribed unto the <hi>Effect,</hi> the Scripture, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Cause, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God speaking in it. So the Heavens and the Earth are said the <hi>hear,</hi> and the Fields with the Trees of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to <hi>sing and clap their hands,</hi> by a <hi>Prosopopeia.</hi> Now concerning these things there is no danger of Mistake. The Light of Reason and their own Nature therein, do give us a sufficient understanding of them. And such <hi>figurative Expressions</hi> as are used concerning them, are common in all Good Authors. Besides the Scripture it self in other Places innumerable doth so teach and declare what they are, as that its plain and direct <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> Assertions do sufficiently expound its own <hi>figurative Enunciations.</hi> For these and such like Ascriptions are only <hi>occasional,</hi> the direct descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Things themselves is given us in other Places. But now with respect unto the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> all things are otherwise. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48389:33"/> uniform Expressions concerning him, are such as declare him to be a <hi>Person</hi> endowed with all Personal Propertys, no Description be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any-where given of him inconsistent with their proper Application to him.</p>

<hi>true;</hi> but that the words which he spake have quite another Intention. For it was not a <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>any Person</hi> that he intended, but it was the <hi>Sun</hi> or the <hi>Wind</hi> that he meant by all which he spake of him.

One of these you must certainly conclude upon. And it is no otherwise in this Case. The <hi>Scripture</hi> informes us, that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> Rules in and over the Church of God, appointing <hi>Overseers</hi> of it under him, that he discerns and judgeth all things, that he comforteth them that are faint, strengthens them that are weak, is <hi>grieved</hi> with them and provoked by them who sin, and that in all these and in other things of the like Nature innumerable, he worketh, ordereth and disposeth all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Counsel of his Own Willl.</hi> Hereupon it directeth us so to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our <hi>Conversation</hi> towards God, that we do not <hi>grieve him</hi> nor displease him, telling us thereon, what great things he will doe for us, on which we lay the stress of our Obedience and Salvation. Can any Man possibly that gives Credit to the Testimony thus proposed in the Scripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any otherwise of this Spirit, but as of an Holy, Wise, Intelligent, Person. Now whilst we are under the Power of these Apprehensions, there come unto us some Men, <hi>Socinians</hi> or <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom we have just cause on many other Accounts to suspect at least of deceit and falsehood; and they confidently tell us that what the Scripture speaks concerning the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is indeed true; but that in and by all the Expressions which it useth concerning him, it intendeth <hi>no such Person</hi> as it seems to do, but an <hi>Accident,</hi> a <hi>Quality,</hi> an <hi>Effect,</hi> or Influence of the Power of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48389:34"/> God, which <hi>figuratively</hi> doth all the things mentioned; namely, that hath a <hi>Will</hi> figuratively, and <hi>Understanding</hi> figuratively, <hi>discerneth</hi> and judgeth figuratively, is <hi>sinned</hi> against figuratively, and so of all that is said of Him.

And this sense is determined in the other <hi>Evangelists,</hi> to the
<hi>bodily shape</hi> wherein he descended. He took the form or <hi>shape of a Dove,</hi> to make a visible Representation of himself by. For a visible Pledg was to be given of the coming of the Holy Ghost on the <hi>Messiah</hi> according to the Promise; and thereby did God direct his great forerunner to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of him.

However it is certain that at the first Erection of the <hi>Altar</hi> in the Wilderness, upon the first Sacrifices, <hi>fire came out from before the Lord</hi> and consumed on the Altar the Burnt-Offering and the Fat; which when all the People saw, they shouted and fell on their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

And in like manner God bare Testimony to the Ministry of <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 King. 18. 38, 39.

And in Answer hereunto is our Lord Jesus Christ said to offer <hi>himself
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48389:36"/> through the eternal Spirit,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. It was therefore most probably a <hi>fiery Appearance</hi> that was made.

Deut. 4. 24. And as in these words, <hi>He shall Baptize with the Holy Ghost and with Fire,</hi> there is a Prospect unto what came to pass afterwards, when the Apostles received the Holy Ghost with a visible Pledg of <hi>fiery Tongues;</hi> So there seems to be a Retrospect by way of Allusion unto what is recorded, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 6, 7. For a living or <hi>fiery Coal from the Altar,</hi> where the Fire represented the Holy Ghost or his Work and Grace, having <hi>touched the Lips</hi> of his Prophet, his sin was taken away both as to the guilt and filth of it. And this is the Work of the Holy Ghost; who not onely sanctifieth us, but by ingenerating Faith in us, and the application of the Promise unto us, is the Cause and Means of our <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> also, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11.

And whereas they farther Object, That if the Holy
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48389:36"/> Ghost in the Appearance intended to manifest himself to be a <hi>Divine Person, he would have appeared as a Man, who is a Person, for so God or an Angel in his Name appeared under the Old Testament;</hi> it is of no more importance than the preceeding Exception.

No such thing being intended by the Holy Ghost, he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present himself under what <hi>shape</hi> he pleased.

For it would have taken off the Use of those <hi>instructive Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi> under the Old Testament, teaching the Incarnation of the Son of God; and also that sole Reason of such Appearances being removed, namely that they had all respect unto the <hi>Incarnation of the Second Person,</hi> as they would have been by the like appearance of the <hi>Third,</hi> there would have been danger of giving a <hi>false Idea</hi> of the Deity unto the Minds of Men. For some might from thence have conceived that God had a <hi>bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shape</hi> like unto us, when none could ever be so fond as to imagine him to be <hi>like a Dove.</hi> And these with the like Testimonies in <hi>general</hi> are given unto the <hi>Divine Personality</hi> of the Holy Spirit.

These things cannot be spoken of any but a Person endued with Understanding. And he thus <hi>searcheth</hi>

<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Isa. 40. 28. <hi>There is no End,</hi> Measure, or Investiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>his Understanding,</hi> Psal. 147. 5. There is no <hi>number of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;</hi> it is endless, boundless, infinite. It is excepted (<hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licting. de Trinitat.</hi> p. 605.) that the <hi>Spirit is not here taken for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit himself, nor doth the Apostle express what the Spirit himself doth, but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48389:37"/> what by the Assistance of the Holy Ghost men are enabled to do.</hi> By that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are helped to <hi>search</hi> into the deep Counsels of God. But as this Exception is directly against the words of the <hi>Text,</hi> so the context will by no means admit of it. For the Apostle giveth an account how the Wisdom, Counsels, and deep things of God, which the World could not understand, were now preached and declared unto the Church. God, saith he, hath <hi>revealed them unto us by the Spirit.</hi> But how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Spirit himself the Author of these Revelations to be acquainted with these things? This he hath from his own Nature, whereby he
<hi>knoweth</hi> or <hi>searcheth</hi> all things, even the deep things of God. It is therefore the Revelation made by the Spirit unto the Apostles and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Scripture of the New Testament, who were <hi>acted by the Holy Ghost</hi> in like manner as were the Holy Men of old, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. which the Apostle intendeth, and not the Illumination and Teaching of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the knowledg of the Mysteries by them revealed, whereof the Apostle treateth in these words. But who is this Spirit? The same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle tells us, that the <hi>Judgments of God are unsearchable, and his wayes past finding out,</hi> Rom. 11. 33. And asketh <hi>who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Counsellor?</hi> v. 34. And yet this Spirit is said <hi>to search all things, even the deep things of God;</hi> such as to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are absolutely unsearchable and past finding out. This then is the
<hi>Spirit of God</hi> himself, who is God also. For so it is in the Prophet from whence these words are taken. Who hath <hi>directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his Counsellor hath taught him?</hi> Isa. 40. 13.</p>
               <p>It will not relieve the Adversaries of the Holy Ghost, though it be pleaded by them, that he is compared with and opposed unto the <hi>spirit of a Man,</hi> v. 11. which they say is <hi>no Person.</hi> For no Comparisons hold in all Circumstances. The Spirit of a Man is his <hi>Rational Soul</hi> endued with Understanding and Knowledg. This is an <hi>individual intelligent Substance,</hi> capable of a subsistence in a separate Condition. Grant the Spirit of God to be so far a Person, and all their Pretences fall to the ground. And whereas it is affirmed by <hi>one</hi> among our selves, though otherwise asserting <hi>the Deity of the Holy Ghost,</hi> (Good. <hi>p.</hi> 175.) that this
<hi>Expression of searching the things of God, cannot be applyed directly to the Spirit, but must intend his enabling us to search into them, because to search includes imperfection, and the use of means to come to the knowledg of any thing;</hi> it is not of weight in this matter. For such Acts are ascribed unto God with respect unto their Effects. And <hi>searching</hi> being with us the means of attaining the perfect knowledg of any thing, the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the knowledg of God is expressed thereby. So <hi>David</hi> prays that God would <hi>search him and know his heart,</hi> Psal. 139. 23. And he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten said to <hi>search the hearts of men,</hi> whereby his infinite Wisdom is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, whereunto all things are open and naked. So is the Spirit said to <hi>search the deep things of God,</hi> because of his infinite Understanding, and the perfection of his Knowledg, before which they lie open. And as things are here spoken of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in reference unto God the Father; so are they spoken of <hi>him,</hi> in reference unto the Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27. He <hi>that searcheth the Hearts, knoweth the Mind of the Spirit.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that this Spirit is the Author of <hi>Wisdom and Understanding</hi> in and unto others; and therefore he must have them in himself, and that not virtually or causally onely, but formally also. 1 Cor. 12. 8. <hi>Wisdom
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48389:37"/> and Knowledg</hi> are reckoned among the Gifts bestowed by him. For those of Faith and Tongues it is enough that they are in him <hi>virtually.</hi> But for Wisdom and Understanding, they cannot be given by any but he that is wise and understandeth what he doth. And hence is he called ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly a <hi>Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, of Counsel and Knowledg,</hi> Isa. 11. 3. I might confirm this by other Testimonies where other Effects of Understanding are ascribed unto him; as 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 1. 1 Pet. 1. 11. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 21. but what hath been spoken is sufficient unto our purpose.</p>

A Power whereby any one is able to act according to the guidance of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and the determinations of his Will; declares him to be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. It is not the meer ascription of <hi>Power absolutely,</hi> or <hi>ability</hi> unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that I intend. For they may signifie no more but the Efficacy wherewith such things are attended in their proper places, as <hi>Instruments</hi> of the Effects whereunto they are applyed. In this sense <hi>Power</hi> is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Word of God, when it is said, <hi>to be able to save our Souls,</hi> Jam. 1. 21. And <hi>Acts 20. 32. The Word of God's Grace</hi> is said to be <hi>able to build us up, and to give us an Inheritance among them that are sanctified;</hi> if that place intend the Word written or preached, whereinto I have made enquiry elsewhere. For these things are clearly interpreted in other places. The Word is said to be <hi>able,</hi> yea to be the <hi>Power of God unto Salvation,</hi> Rom. 1. 16. because God is pleased to <hi>use</hi> it and make it effectual by his Grace unto that End. But where Power, <hi>Divine Power</hi> is absolutely ascribed unto any <hi>one,</hi> and that declared to be put forth and exercised by the <hi>Understanding,</hi> and according to the <hi>Will</hi> of him to whom it is so ascribed, it doth undeniably prove him to be a <hi>Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> For when we say the Holy Ghost is so, we intend no more but that he is <hi>one</hi> who by his <hi>own Divine Understanding,</hi> puts forth his <hi>own Divine Power.</hi> So is it in this Case, <hi>Job</hi> 32. 4. The <hi>Spirit of God hath made me, and the Breath of the Almighty hath given me Life.</hi> Creation is an
<hi>Act</hi> of Divine Power; the highest we are capable to receive any Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of. And it is also an Effect of the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of him that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth, as being a voluntary act and designed unto a certain end. All these therefore are here ascribed to the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> It is excepted (<hi>Schlicting.</hi> p. 613, 615.) that by the <hi>Spirit of God here mentioned, no more is intended but our own vital Spirits, whereby we are quickned, called the Spirit of God because he gave it.</hi> But this is too much confidence; The words are <gap reason="foreign">

But as some of them at least never are nor can be assigned unto any but a Divine Person; So we take our <hi>Argument</hi> from their joint consideration, or the uniform constant Assignation of them all unto him in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which renders it <hi>irrefragable.</hi> For the things themselves I shall not insist upon them because their particular <hi>Nature</hi> must be afterwards unfolded.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>25</label> First; He is said to <hi>teach us,</hi> Luk. 12. 12. The <hi>Holy Ghost shall teach you what you ought to say,</hi> John 14. 26. The <hi>Comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my Name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to remembrance,</hi> 1 John 2. 27. He is the <hi>Unction which teacheth us all things;</hi> how and whence he is so called shall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards declared. He is the great Teacher of the Church, unto whom the accomplishment of that great Promise is committed; <hi>and they shall be all taught of God,</hi> John 6. 45. It is said with the Church of God when Her <hi>Teachers are removed into a Corner,</hi> and Her Eyes see them not. But better lose all other Teachers and that utterly, than to lose this <hi>great Teacher</hi> only. For although he is pleased to make <hi>use</hi> of them, He can teach effectually and savingly <hi>without</hi> them where they are removed and taken away; but they cannot teach without him unto the least Spiritual
<hi>Advantage.</hi> And those who pretend to be <hi>Teachers</hi> of others, and yet
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48389:39"/> despise his <hi>teaching Assistance,</hi> will one day find that they undertook a Work which was none of theirs. But as unto our use of this <hi>Assertion</hi> it is excepted, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> affirms, that <hi>Nature also teacheth us;</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 14. <hi>Doth not even Nature it self teach you?</hi> Now Nature is not a Person. This is the way and manner of them with whom we have to do. If any <hi>word</hi> in a <hi>Testimony</hi> produced by us have been any where used <hi>metaphorically,</hi> though it be never so evident that it is so used in that place, instantly it must have the same <hi>figurative Application</hi> in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony excepted against, although they can give no Reason why it should so signifie. And if this course of <hi>excepting</hi> be allowed, there will be nothing left intelligible in the Scripture nor in any other <hi>Author,</hi> nor in common Conversation in the World. For there is scarce any Word or Name of thing but one where or other is or hath been abused or used
<hi>Metaphorically.</hi> In particular, <hi>Nature</hi> in this place of the <hi>Apostle</hi> is said to <hi>teach</hi> us <hi>objectively,</hi> as the Heavens and Earth teach us in what we learn from them. For it is said to teach us what we may learn from the customs and actings of them, who live proceed and act according to the Principles Dictates and Inclinations of it. Every one sees that here is no intimation of an <hi>active teaching</hi> by Instruction or a reall Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Knowledg; but it is said <hi>figuratively</hi> to do what we do with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto it. And not only in several places, but in the same Sentence a word may be used properly with respect unto one thing, and <hi>abusively</hi> with respect unto another. As in that saying of the Poet;
<q>Disce puer virtutem ex me, verumque laborem; Fortunam ex aliis.</q> For <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Industry</hi> are to be learned properly; but <hi>Fortune,</hi> as they called it, or prosperous Events are not so. These things therefore are very different, and their difference is obvious unto all. But we insist not meerly on <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> particular Instance. Let any Man not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely prepossessed with prejudice, read over that Discourse of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour unto his Disciples, wherein he purposely instructs them in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> on whom as it were he then devolved the care of them and the Gospel according unto the Promise <hi>John</hi> 14, 15, 16, <hi>Chap.</hi> and he will need no farther Instruction or Confirmation in this Matter. He is there frequently called the <hi>Comforter,</hi> the Name of a Person, and that vested with an <hi>Office,</hi> with respect unto the Work that he would do; and <hi>another Comforter</hi> in answer and conformity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Christ who was one Comforter and a Person as all grant,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 16. If he be not so, the intention of this Expression with these Circumstances, must be to <hi>deceive</hi> us and not instruct us. He tells them moreover that he is <hi>one</hi> whom the <hi>World neither sees nor knows,</hi> but who abideth with and <hi>dwelleth in Believers,</hi> v. 17. One whom the Father <hi>would send,</hi> and who would <hi>come</hi> accordingly; and that to <hi>teach</hi> them, to <hi>lead</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> them, and to bring things to their remembrance,
<hi>v.</hi> 26. A <hi>Comforter</hi> that should come and testifie or bear witness unto him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 26. One that should be <hi>sent of Him</hi> to <hi>reprove the world of Sin, Righteousness, and Judgment,</hi> Chap. 16. 7, 8. and abide with his Disciples to supply his own bodily absence. So is he said to <hi>Speak, Guide, Teach, Hear,</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> of Christ and to <hi>shew</hi> it unto others,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48389:39"/>
                  <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. with sundry other things of the same Nature and Importance. And these things are not spoken of him <hi>occasionally</hi> or in <hi>transitu,</hi> but in a direct continued Discourse, designed on purpose by our Lord Jesus Christ, to acquaint his Disciples <hi>who</hi> he was, and <hi>what</hi> he would do for them. And if there were nothing spoken of him in the whole Scripture but what is here declared by our Saviour, all <hi>unprejudiced Men</hi> must and would acknowledg him to be a <hi>Divine Person.</hi> And it is a confidence swelling above all bounds of Modesty, to suppose that because <hi>one</hi> or
<hi>other</hi> of these things are or may be <hi>Metaphorically</hi> or <hi>Metaleptically</hi> ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto this or that thing which are not Persons, when the <hi>figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of such an Ascription is plain and open; that therefore they are all of them in like manner so ascribed unto the Holy Ghost in that Discourse of our Saviour unto his Disciples, wherein he designed the Instruction of them as above declared. Of the same Nature is that which we discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before concerning his <hi>searching of all things,</hi> from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. which as it proves him to be an <hi>understanding Agent,</hi> so it undeniably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes a <hi>Personal Action.</hi> Such also are the things mentioned; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 16, 26. He <hi>helpeth our Infirmities,</hi> he <hi>maketh intercession for us,</hi> He himself <hi>beareth; witness</hi> with our Spirits; the particular meaning of all which Expressions shall be afterwards enquired into. Here the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> is to cry up a <hi>Prosopopaeia, (Schlicting.</hi> p. 627.) But how do they prove it? Only by saying that these things <hi>belong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to a Person which the Spirit is not:</hi> Now this is nothing but to set up their own false <hi>Hypothesis</hi> against our Arguments, and not being able to contend with the Premises to deny the <hi>Conclusion.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>26</label> There are two other places of this Nature both to the same purpose sufficient of themselves to confirm our Faith in the Truth pleaded for. And these are <hi>Acts 13. 2, 4. As they ministred unto the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>for the Work whereunto I have called them. So they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost departed.</hi> The other is <hi>Acts 20. 28. Take heed therefore unto your selves, and to all the Flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers.</hi> These places hold a good correspondence; and what is reported in an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary case</hi> as <hi>matter of Fact</hi> in the first, is <hi>doctrinally</hi> applyed unto <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Cases</hi> in the latter. And two things are remarkable in the first Place. (1.) The Holy Ghost's designation of <hi>Himself</hi> as the Person
<hi>unto whom</hi> and whose Work <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> were to be separated and dedicated. Saith he <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not, <hi>separate me,</hi> as in our <hi>Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> making the Spirit onely the <hi>Author</hi> of the Command, but <hi>separate unto me;</hi> which proposeth him also as the <hi>Object</hi> of the Duty required, and the Person whose Work was to be attended. <hi>Who</hi> or what then is intended by that Pronoun <hi>Me?</hi> Some Person is directed unto and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thereby. Nor can any Instance be given where it is so much as
<hi>figuratively</hi> used, unless it be in a professed <hi>Parable.</hi> That remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be enquired into, <hi>Who</hi> is intended in that word <hi>Me?</hi> And the words are the words of the Holy Ghost; <hi>The Holy Ghost said separate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me;</hi> He therefore alone is intended. All the Answer which the Wit and Diligence of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> can invent is, That these <hi>words are ascribed unto the Holy Ghost, because the Prophets that were in the Church of</hi> Antioch <hi>spake therein by his Instinct and Inspiration.</hi> But in this Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48389:40"/> there is no regard unto the force of our Argument; for we do not argue meerly from his being said <hi>to speak</hi> but from <hi>what is spoken</hi> by him,
<hi>separate unto me,</hi> and do enquire whether the Prophets be intended by that word or no? If so, which of them? for they were <hi>many</hi> by whom the Holy Ghost spake the same thing; and some <hi>one</hi> must be intended in common by them all. And to say that this was <hi>any of the Prophets</hi> is foolish, indeed blasphemous. (2.) The close of the third <hi>Verse</hi> confirms this application of the Word, <hi>to the Work whereunto I have called them.</hi> This confessedly is the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Now to call Men to the Ministry is a free <hi>Act of Authority</hi> Choice and Wisdom, which are Properties of a Person and none other. Nor is either the Father or the Son in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture introduced more directly clothed with <hi>Personal Properties</hi> than the Holy Ghost is in these places. And the whole is confirmed <hi>vers.</hi> 4. And <hi>they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed.</hi> He <hi>called</hi> them by furnishing them with <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> for their work; he <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> them to be set apart by the Church, that they might be blessed and owned in their Work; and he <hi>sent them forth</hi> by an impression of his Authority on their Minds given them by those former <hi>Acts</hi> of his. And if a Divine Person be not hereby described, I know not how he may so be.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>27</label> The other Text speaks unto the same purpose, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 28. It is expresly said that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> made the <hi>Elders of the Church</hi> the <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers of it.</hi> The same <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> is here again assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto him; and here is no room left for the Evasion before insisted on.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>28</label> There remains yet <hi>one sort of Testimonies</hi> to the same purpose which must briefly be passed through. And they are those where he is spoken of as the <hi>Object</hi> of such <hi>Actings</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> of Men as none but a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> can be. For let them be applyed unto any other <hi>Object</hi> and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency will quickly appear. Thus he is said to be <hi>tempted</hi> of them that sin. <hi>You agree together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> Acts 5. 9. In what sense soever this word is used, whether in that which is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to <hi>try,</hi> as God is said to <hi>tempt Abraham,</hi> or in that which is <hi>evil,</hi> to
<hi>provoke</hi> or induce to sin, it never is, it never can be used but with respect
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48389:40"/> unto a Person. How can a <hi>Quality,</hi> an <hi>Accident,</hi> an <hi>Emanation of Power</hi> from God be tempted? None can possibly be so but <hi>he</hi> that hath an <hi>Understanding</hi> to consider what is proposed unto him, and a <hi>Will</hi> to determine upon the Proposals made. So <hi>Satan</hi> tempted our first Parents; so Men are tempted by their own Lusts; so are we said to <hi>tempt</hi> God when we provoke him by our Unbelief, or when we unwarrantably make Experiments of his Power. So did they <hi>tempt the Holy Ghost,</hi> who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ventured on his <hi>Omniscience</hi> as if he would not or could not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their sin; or on his <hi>Holiness,</hi> that he would patronize their Deceit. In like manner <hi>Ananias</hi> is said to <hi>lie to the Holy Ghost,</hi> vers. 3. And And none is capable of <hi>lying</hi> unto any other but such a one as is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> a Testimony. For a <hi>Lie</hi> is a false Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony given unto that which is spoken or uttered in it. This He that is
<hi>lyed unto,</hi> must be capable of judging and determining upon, which without <hi>Personal Properties</hi> of Will and Understanding none can be. And the Holy Ghost is here so declared to be a Person, as that he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be One that is also Divine. For so the <hi>Apostle Peter</hi> declares in the Exposition of the words, <hi>v. 4. Thou hast not lyed unto Men but unto God.</hi> These things are so plain and positive, that the Faith of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers will not be concerned in the <hi>Sophistical Evasions</hi> of our <hi>Adversaries.</hi> In like manner he is said to be <hi>resisted, Acts</hi> 7. 51. which is the moral <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action</hi> or Opposition of one Person unto another. So also is he said to be <hi>grieved,</hi> or we are commanded not to <hi>grieve him,</hi> Ephes. 4. 30. as they of old were said to have <hi>rebelled and vexed the Holy Spirit of God,</hi> Isa. 63. 10. A figurative Expression is allowed in these words. Properly the Spirit of God cannot be <hi>grieved</hi> or vexed; for these things include such Imperfections as are incompetent unto the Divine Nature. But as God is said to <hi>repent</hi> and to be <hi>grieved</hi> at his heart, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 6. when he would do things correspondent unto those which Men will do, or judg fit to be done on such Provocations; and when he would declare what Effects they would produce in a <hi>Nature</hi> capable of such perturbations; So on the same Reason is the Spirit of God said to be <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>vexed.</hi> But this can no way be spoken of him, if he be not <hi>one</hi> whose respect unto sin may from the <hi>Analogie</hi> unto humane Persons, be represented by this figurative Expression. To talk of grieving a <hi>Vertue,</hi> or an <hi>actual Emanation of Power,</hi> is to speak that which no Man can understand the Meaning or Intention of. Surely He that is thus <hi>tempted resisted</hi> and
<hi>grieved</hi> by Sin and Sinners, is one that can <hi>understand judg</hi> and <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> concerning them. And these things being elsewhere absolutely spoken concerning God, it declares that he is so, with respect unto whom they are mentioned in particular.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48389:41"/> 9, 10. The Spirit is here expresly distinguished from the Son, as one Person from another.

And this is that in the <hi>Order of Subsistence</hi> He is the <hi>Third Person</hi> in the Holy Trinity. So it is expressed in the solemn Numeration of them, where their <hi>Order</hi> gives great direction unto Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Worship and Obedience; Matth. 28. 18. <hi>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> This <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> I confess in their Numeration, because of the Equality of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the same Nature is sometimes varied. So <hi>Rev. 1. 4, 5. Grace be unto you, and Peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come, and from the seven Spirits which are before his Throne, and from Jesus Christ.</hi> The Holy Spirit under the name of the <hi>seven Spirits</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of God, because of his various and perfect Operations in and towards the Church, is reckoned up in order before the Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. And so in <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>euctical</hi> conclusion unto his Epistles, the Son is placed before the Father: 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 14. The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and the <hi>Communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all.</hi> And some think that the Holy Ghost is mentioned in the first place: Col. 2. 2. <hi>The acknowledgment of the Mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ.</hi> In this expression of them therefore we may use our liberty, they being all <hi>one God</hi> over all blessed for ever. But in their true and natural Order of <hi>Subsistence,</hi> and consequently of
<hi>Operation,</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is the Third Person. For as to his Personal Subsistence, he <hi>proceedeth from the Father and the Son,</hi> being equally the Spirit of them both as hath been declared. This constitutes the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Order</hi> between the Persons which is unalterable. On this depends the Order of his Operation; for his working is a consequent of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Subsistence. Thus the Father is said to <hi>send him,</hi> and so is the Son also, <hi>John 14. 16, 26. Chap.</hi> 16. 7. And he is thus said to be <hi>sent by the Father</hi> and the Son, because he is the Spirit of the Father and Son, proceeding from both, and is the next cause in the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Trinity unto <hi>External Works.</hi> But as he is thus sent, so his
<hi>own Will</hi> is equally in and unto the Work for which he is sent. As the Father is said to <hi>send the Son,</hi> and yet it was also his own Love and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48389:42"/> Grace to <hi>come</hi> unto us and to save us. And this ariseth from hence, that in the whole <hi>Oeconomy of the Trinity,</hi> as to the Works that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly are of God, especially the Works of Grace, the order of the
<hi>Subsistence</hi> of the Persons in the same Nature is represented unto us, and they have the same dependance on each other in their <hi>Operations</hi> as they have in their <hi>Subsistence.</hi> The Father is the Fountain of all, as in Being and Existence so in Operation. The Son is of the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of him, and therefore as unto his Work is <hi>sent</hi> by him. But his own Will is in and unto what he is sent about. The Holy Spirit
<hi>proceedeth from the Father and the Son,</hi> and therefore is <hi>sent</hi> and <hi>given</hi> by them as to all the Works which he immediately effecteth; but yet his <hi>own Will</hi> is the direct Principle of all that he doth. He divideth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every one according <hi>to his own Will.</hi> And thus much may suffice to be spoken about the Being of the Holy Spirit, and the order of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence in the Blessed Trinity.</p>

Hereof <hi>Abraham</hi> makes his solemn Acknowledgment before the Lord; Gen. 18. 27. <hi>Behold I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord which am but Dust and Ashes.</hi> He ashes himself with the Remembrance of his Original. And this as it were God reproacheth <hi>Adam</hi> withal upon his Sin and Transgression; Gen. 3. 19. <hi>Thou shalt return unto the Ground, for out of it wast thou taken. For Dust thou art, and unto Dust thou shalt return.</hi> He lets him know that he had now by sin lost that Immortality which he was made in a condition to have enjoyed; and that his Body according to his Nature and Constitution, should return again into its first Principles or the Dust of the Earth.</p>

And God said, Let us make Man in our own Image after our likeness; and let them have dominion; so God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he him.</hi> He made him <hi>upright,</hi> Eccles. 7. 29. perfect in his Condition; every way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, fit, disposed, and able to and for the Obedience required of him.

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> First; As to the <hi>Essential Principles</hi> of the Nature of Man, it is not for nothing that God expresseth his Communication of a <hi>Spirit of Life</hi> by his <hi>breathing</hi> into him. God <hi>breathed into his Nostrils the Breath of Life.</hi> The Spirit of God and the Breath of God are the same; onely the one Expression is <hi>proper,</hi> the other <hi>metaphorical;</hi> wherefore this
<hi>breathing</hi> is the especial acting of the Spirit of God. The Creation of the Humane Soul, a Vital Immortal Principle and Being, is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Work of the Spirit of God; Job 33. 4. <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me, and the Breath of the Almighty hath given me Life.</hi> Here indeed the Creation and Production of both the essential parts of Humane Nature Body and Soul, are ascribed unto the same Author. For the Spirit of God and the Breath of God are the same; but several Effects being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned causeth a repetition of the same Cause under several names. This Spirit of God first made Man, or formed his Body of the Dust, and then gave him that Breath of Life whereby he became a <hi>living Soul.</hi> So then under this first Consideration, the Creation of Man is assigned unto the Holy Spirit; for Man was the Perfection of the Inferior Creation, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48389:47"/> in order unto the Glory of God by him were all other things Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Here therefore are his <hi>Operations</hi> distinctly declared, to whom the perfecting and compleating of all Divine Works is peculiarly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> Secondly; We may consider the <hi>moral State</hi> and Condition of Man, with the Furniture of his Mind and Soul in reference unto his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God and his enjoyment of him. This was the principal part of that <hi>Image of God</hi> wherein he was created. Three things were required to render Man <hi>idoneous</hi> or fit unto that Life to God for which he was made. First, An ability to <hi>discern</hi> the Mind and Will of God, with respect unto all the Duty and Obedience that God required of him; as also so far to know the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of God, as to believe him the only proper Object of all Acts and Duties of Religious Obedience, and an all-sufficient Satisfaction and Reward in this World and to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Secondly, A free uncontrolled unintangled <hi>disposition</hi> to every Duty of the Law of his Creation in order unto <hi>living unto God.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, An ability of Mind and Will, with a readiness of complyance in his Affections, for a due regular <hi>performance</hi> of all Duties and <hi>abstinence</hi> from all Sin. These things belonged unto the <hi>integrity</hi> of his Nature, with the <hi>uprightness</hi> of the State and Condition wherein he was made. And all these things were the peculiar Effects of the immediate Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghost. For although this <hi>Rectitude</hi> of his Nature be distinguishable and separable from the <hi>Faculties</hi> of the Soul of Man; yet in his first Creation they were not actually distinguished from them, nor superadded or infused into them when Created, but were <hi>concreated</hi> with them; that is his Soul was made meet and able to <hi>live to God</hi> as his Sovereign Lord, Chiefest Good, and Last End. And so they were all from the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> from whom the Soul was as hath been declared. Yea suppose these Abilities to be <hi>superadded</hi> unto Man's Natural Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as Gifts supernatural (which yet is not so) they must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in a peculiar manner to be from the Holy Spirit. For in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration</hi> of these Abilities unto our minds, in our <hi>Renovation</hi> unto the Image of God in the Gospel, it is plainly asserted that the Holy Ghost is the immediate Operator of them. And he doth thereby restore <hi>his own Work,</hi> and not take the Work of another out of his Hand. For in the New Creation the <hi>Father</hi> in the way of <hi>Authority</hi> designs it and brings all things unto an head in Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 10. which retrived his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal peculiar Work; and the <hi>Son</hi> gave unto all things a new <hi>consistency</hi> which belonged unto him from the beginning, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. So also the Holy Spirit renews in us the <hi>Image of God,</hi> the original implantation whereof was his peculiar Work. And thus <hi>Adam</hi> may be said to have had the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in his Innocency. He had him in these peculiar Effects of his Power and Goodness, and he had him according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of that Covenant, whereby it was possible that he should utterly lose him as accordingly it came to pass. He had him not by especial Inhabitation, for the whole World was then the Temple of God. In the Covenant of Grace founded in the <hi>Person</hi> and on the Mediation of Christ it is otherwise. On whomsoever the Spirit of God is bestowed for the <hi>Renovation of the Image of God</hi> in him, he abides with him for ever. But in all Men from first to last, all <hi>Goodness, Righteousness,</hi> and
<hi>Truth,</hi> are the Fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 9.</p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48389:47"/> The Works of God being thus finished, and the whole frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture set upon its <hi>Wheels,</hi> it is not deserted by the Spirit of God. For as the preservation, continuance, and <hi>acting</hi> of all things in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, according to their especial Nature and mutual Application of one unto another, are all from the powerful and efficacious <hi>Influences</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence; so there are particular Operations of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>

For the first, (as we have shewed) the Propagation of the succeeding Generations of Creatures, and the annual <hi>Renovation of the Face of the Earth</hi> are ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 30. For as we would own the due and just Powers and Operations of <hi>second Causes,</hi> so we abhor that <hi>Atheism</hi> which ascribes unto them an Original and Independent Efficacy and Causality, without a previous <hi>acting in, by,</hi> and <hi>upon them,</hi> of the Power of God. And this is here ascribed unto the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whom God sendeth forth unto that End and Purpose. As to <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>moral actions,</hi> such as the great Affairs of the World do consist in and are disposed of by, he hath in them also a peculiar Efficiency. Thus those great Vertues of <hi>Wisdom, Courage,</hi> and <hi>Fortitude,</hi> which have been used for the producing of great Effects in the World, are of his especial Operation. So when God stirred up Men to Rule and Govern his People of Old, to fight against and to subdue their Enemies, it is said the <hi>Spirit of God came upon them,</hi> Jud. 3. 10. The <hi>Spirit of the Lord came upon Othniel,</hi> and he <hi>judged Israel and went out to War.</hi> The Spirit of God endued him with <hi>Wisdom</hi> for Government, and with <hi>courage</hi> and skill in conduct for War. So <hi>Judg.</hi> 6. 34. And although Instances hereof are given us principally among the People of God, yet whereever Men in the World have been raised up to do great and wonderful things, whereby God executeth his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, fulfilleth any of his Promises or his Threatnings, even they also have received of the especial <hi>Gifts and Assistances</hi> of the Holy Spirit of God. For this Reason is <hi>Cyrus</hi> expresly called <hi>God's Anointed,</hi> Isa. 45. 1.
<hi>Cyrus</hi> had by God's Designation a great and mighty Work to effect. He was utterly to ruine and destroy the Great, Antient, <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. God had a concern herein, as to the avenging of the Quarrel of his People, and therein the accomplishment of many Promises and Threatnings. The Work it self was great, arduous, and insuperable to ordinary humane Abilities. Wherefore God <hi>sends his Spirit</hi> to <hi>fill Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> with Wisdom, Courage, skill in all Military Affairs, that he might go through with the Work whereunto in the Providence of God he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed. Hence is he called <hi>God's Anointed,</hi> because the <hi>Unction</hi> of Kings of old was an instituted Sign of the Communication of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost for Government unto them; see <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. and other Instances of the like kind might be given.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> Thus when the Church was to have a blessed Restauration of the Worship of God after the return of the People from their Captivity;
<hi>Zerubbabel</hi> is in an especial manner called to begin and carry on this Work in the building of the Temple. But the Difficulties he had to conflict withal were great, and appeared <hi>insuperable.</hi> The People were few and poor, and the Oppositions made unto them and their Work
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48389:48"/> great and many. Especially what arose from the Power of the <hi>Persian Monarchy</hi> under whose Rule and Oppression they were. For although they had Permission and Encouragement from <hi>Cyrus</hi> for their Work, yet immediately upon his Death they were oppressed again, and their <hi>Work caused to cease.</hi> This Power they could no way conflict withal; yet God tells them that all this Opposition shall be removed and conquered. <hi>Who art thou,</hi> saith he, <hi>O great Mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a plain,</hi> Zech. 4. 7. All the hindrance that arose from that <hi>great Mountain</hi> of the <hi>Persian Empire</hi> shall be removed out of the way, and the progress of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> in his Work shall be made smooth plain and easie. But how shall this be effected and brought about? Not by an
<hi>Army,</hi> or by <hi>Might, nor by Power, but by my Spirit saith the Lord of Hosts,</hi> v. 6. You would suppose that it must be done by Armies and open force, which you are altogether insufficient for. But this is not the way I will take in this matter. My <hi>Spirit</hi> shall work in their Hearts, Minds, and Counsels, that contrary to their fears they shall themselves further that work which hitherto they have impeded.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> First; He is said to be <hi>GIVEN</hi> of God; that is, of God the Father, who is said to GIVE him in an especial manner. <hi>Luk. 11. 13. Your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> Joh. 3. 34.
<hi>He hath Given his Spirit unto us.</hi> 1. Joh. 3. 24. Joh. 14. 16. <hi>The Father shall Give you another Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, v.</hi> 26. And in answer unto this Act of God, those on whom he is bestowed are said to
<hi>Receive</hi> him. <hi>Joh. 7. 39. This he spake of the Spirit which they that believe on Him should Receive.</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 12. <hi>We have received the Spirit which is of God.</hi> 2. Cor. 11. 4. <hi>if you have received another Spirit which you had not Reoeived;</hi> Where the Receiving of the Spirit is made a matter Common unto all Beleivers. So <hi>Gal. 3. 2. Acts. 8. 15, 19. Joh. 14. 17. Chap.</hi> 20. 22. For these two, <hi>Giving</hi> and <hi>Receiving</hi> are related; the one supposing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this Expression of the Dispensation of the Holy Ghost is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable unto the Opinion before rejected; Namely that he is nothing but a <hi>transient Accident,</hi> or an Occasional Emanation of the Power of God. For how, or in what sense can an <hi>Act</hi> of the Power of God be <hi>Given</hi> by him, or be <hi>Received</hi> by us? It can indeed in no sense be either the Object of God's <hi>Giving</hi> or of our <hi>Receiving,</hi> especially as this is explained in those other Expressions of the same thing before laid down, and afterwards considered. It must be somewhat that hath a <hi>Subsistence</hi> of its own, that is thus Given and Received. So the Lord Christ is frequently said to be
<hi>Given of</hi> God and <hi>Received</hi> by us. It is true we may be said in another sense to <hi>receive the Grace of God.</hi> Which is the Exception of the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> unto this Consideration, and the constant practice they use to evade plain Testimonies of the Scripture. For if they can find any Words in them used elsewhere in <hi>another sense,</hi> they suppose it sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict their plain Design and proper meaning in an other place. Thus we are exhorted <hi>not to receive the Grace of God in vain,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 1. I Answer the Grace of God may be considered two Ways. (1.) <hi>Objectively</hi> for the Revelation or Doctrine of Grace; as <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. So we are said to <hi>Receive</hi> it when we believe and profess it, in opposition unto them by whom it is opposed and rejected. And this is the same with our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Word preached</hi> so often mentioned in the Scripture; <hi>Acts 2. 41. James</hi> 1. 21; which is by Faith to give it Entertainment in our Hearts; which is the meaning of the Word in this Place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. Having taken the Profession of the Doctrine of Grace, that is of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel upon us, we ought to express its Power in Holiness and suitable O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, without which it will be of no use or Benefit unto us. And the Grace of God is sometimes (2.) take <hi>Subjectively,</hi> for the Grace which God is pleased to Communicate unto us, or gracious <hi>Qualities</hi> that he Works in our Souls by his Spirit. In this sense also we are sometimes said to receive it; 1 Cor. 4. 7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another, and what hast thou which thou didst not receive;</hi> Where the Apostle speaketh both of the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit. And the Reason hereof is, because in the Communication of <hi>internal Grace</hi> unto us, we <hi>contribute
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48389:49"/> nothing</hi> to the Procurement of it, but are merely capable recipient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And this Grace is a <hi>Quality</hi> or Spiritual Habit permanent and abideing in the Soul. But in neither of these senses can we be said to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit of God,</hi> nor God to <hi>Give</hi> him, if he be only the Power of God making an Impression on our Minds and Spirits; no more than a Man can be said to <hi>receive the Sun-beams,</hi> which cause Heat in him by their Natural Efficacy, falling on him. Much less can the <hi>Giving</hi> and
<hi>Receiving</hi> of the Spirit be so interpreted, considering what is said of his being <hi>sent</hi> and his own <hi>Coming,</hi> with the like Declarations of God's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of him, whereof afterwards.</p>

This I acknowledg wants not some Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in its Explication. For if the Holy Ghost be <hi>God himself,</hi> as hath been declared, how can he be said to be <hi>given by the Father,</hi> as it were, in a way of Authority? But keeping our selves to the sacred Rule of Truth, we may solve this Difficulty without Curiosity or Danger. Wherefore (1.) the <hi>Order of the Subsistence</hi> of the three Persons in the Divine Nature is regarded herein. For the Father as hath been shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the <hi>Fountain</hi> and Original of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> being of him, and the Spirit of them both. Hence he is to be considered as the <hi>principal Author</hi> and Cause of all those works which are immediately wrought by either of them. For of whom the Son and Spirit have their Essence as to their Personality, from him have they Life and Power of Operation; <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19, 26. Therefore when the Holy Spirit <hi>comes</hi> unto any, the Father is said to <hi>Give him,</hi> for he is the Spirit of the Father. And this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Father doth immediately respect the Work it self, and not the Person Working. But the Person is said to be given for the Works sake. (2.) The <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Blessed Trinity in the Work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Salvation is respected in this Order of things. The Fountain hereof lies in the <hi>Love</hi> Wisdom Grace and Counsel of the Father. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is done in the pursuit hereof is originally the Gift of the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is designed unto no other End but to make his Grace effectual. Hence is he said to <hi>send</hi> and <hi>give</hi> his Son also. And the whole Work of the Holy Ghost, as our Sanctifier Guide Comforter and Advocate, is to make the <hi>Love of the Father</hi> effectual unto us; Joh. 10. 13, 14.<note n="*" place="margin">

The Scripture knows of no earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that Men can make of themselves but Death. For as <hi>Austin</hi> says,
<hi>Quicquid tuum est peccatum est;</hi> and the Wages of Sin is death.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> Secondly; In Answer hereunto they are said to <hi>Receive</hi> him, on whom as a <hi>Gift</hi> he is bestowed; as in the Testimonies before mentioned. And in <hi>Receiving</hi> two things are implyed. (1.) That we contribute nothing thereunto which should take off from the thing Received as a <hi>Gift. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> answers <hi>Giving,</hi> and that implys freedom in the Giver. (2.) That it is their Priviledg and <hi>Advantage.</hi> For what a Man <hi>Receives</hi> he doth it for his own Good. First, then we have him <hi>freely</hi> as a Gift of God. For to <hi>Receive</hi> him in general is to be made <hi>Partaker of him,</hi> as unto those Ends for which he is given of God. Be those Ends what they will, in respect of them they are said to <hi>Receive him</hi> who are made Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of him. Two things may be pleaded to take off the <hi>Freedom of this Gift</hi> and of our Reception, and to cast it on something necessary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on our part. For (1.) our Saviour tells us, <hi>that the World cannot Receive him, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him,</hi> Joh. 14. 17. Now if the World cannot <hi>Receive</hi> him, there is required an Ability and Preparation in them that do so, that are not in the World; and so the
<hi>Gift</hi> and Communication of the Spirit depends on that <hi>Qualification</hi> in us. But all Men are <hi>Naturally</hi> alike the World, and of it. No One Man by <hi>Nature</hi> hath more Ability or strength in Spiritual things than another. For all are <hi>equally</hi> dead in Trespasses and Sins, all <hi>equally</hi> Children of Wrath. It must therefore be enquired how some come to have this <hi>Ability</hi> and Power to <hi>Receive</hi> the Spirit of God which others have not. Now this, as I shall fully manifest afterwards, is merely from the Holy Ghost himself and his Grace; respect being had herein only unto the <hi>Order</hi> of his Operations in us, some being <hi>Preparatory</hi> for and dispositive unto other; One being instituted as the means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining another, the whole being the Effect of the <hi>free Gift</hi> of God. For we do <hi>not make our selves to differ from others,</hi> nor have we any thing that we have not <hi>Received, 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Wherefore the Receiving of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost intended in that Expression of our Saviour, with respect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto some are <hi>able to receive him</hi> some are not, is not <hi>absolute,</hi> but with respect unto some certain Work and End. And this, as is plain in the Context, is the receiving of him as a <hi>Comforter</hi> and a <hi>Guide</hi> in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Truth. Here-unto Faith in Christ Jesus, which also is an effect and fruit of the same Spirit, is antecedently required. In this sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Beleivers alone</hi> can <hi>receive</hi> him, and are enabled so to do by the Grace which they have received from him in their first Conversion unto God. But (2dly.) it will be said that we are bound to <hi>pray for him</hi> before we receive him; and therefore the bestowing of him depends on a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48389:50"/> to be by us fulfilled. For the Promise is <hi>that our Heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit unto them that ask him,</hi> Luke 11. 13. But this doth not prove the bestowing and receiving of him not to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<hi>free.</hi> Nay it proves the Contrary. It is <hi>Gratia indebita, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Grace,</hi> that is the proper object of Prayer. And God by these encouraging Promises doth not abridge the Liberty of his own Will, nor derogate from the <hi>Freedom</hi> of his Gifts and Grace, but only directs us into the way whereby we may be made Partakers of them, unto his Glory and our own Advantage. And this also belongs unto the <hi>Order</hi> of the Communication of the Grace of the Spirit unto us. This very
<hi>Praying</hi> for the Spirit is a Duty which we cannot perform without his Assistance. For <hi>no man can call Jesus Lord but by the Holy Ghost,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 3. He helps us as a Spirit of <hi>Grace and Supplication,</hi> to pray for him as a Spirit of <hi>Joy and Consolation.</hi>

<hi>greatness</hi> of a Gift, the free Mind of the <hi>Giver,</hi> and want of desert or merit in the Receiver, are that which declare <hi>Bounty</hi> to be the spring and fountain of it. And all these concur to the height in God's <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Holy Ghost.</hi>

They receive a Gift and that from God, and that a great and singular Gift from Divine Bounty. Some indeed <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him</hi> in a sort as to some Ends and Purposes, without any advantage finally unto their own Souls. So do they who <hi>prophesie and cast out Devils by his Power in the Name of Christ,</hi> and yet continuing workers of Iniquity are rejected at the last day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23. Thus it is with all who receive his <hi>Gifts</hi> only without his Grace to sanctifie their Persons and their Gifts, and this whether they be ordinary or extraordinary; But this is only by accident. There is no Gift of the Holy Ghost but is
<hi>good</hi> in its own Nature, tending to a good End, and is proper for the Good and Advantage of them by whom it is received. And although the direct end of some of them be not the <hi>Spiritual Good</hi> of them on whom they are bestowed but the Edification of others; <hi>for the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit is given unto every man to profit withal,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 12, 17. yet there is that excellency and worth in them, and that use may be made of them, as to turn greatly to the advantage of them that receive them. For although they are <hi>not Grace,</hi> yet they serve to stir up and give an edg unto Grace, and to draw it out unto Exercise whereby it is strengthened and increased. And they have an influence into Glory; For it is by the Abilities which they give that some are made <hi>wise</hi> &amp; effectual Instruments for the <hi>turning of many to Righteousness,</hi> who shall shine as the brightness of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3. But the Unbelief, Ingratitude, and Lusts of Men, can spoil these and any other good things whatever. And these things will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in particular fall under our Consideration. In general, to be made Partaker of the Holy Ghost, is an <hi>inestimable</hi> Priviledg and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and as such is proposed by our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 14. 17.</p>

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48389:51"/> Secondly; God is said to SEND him. Psal. 104. 30. <hi>Thou sendest forth thy Spirit.</hi> John 14. 26. <hi>The Father will send the Holy Ghost in my Name.</hi> This is also spoken of the Son; <hi>I will send unto you the Comforter from the Father,</hi> John 15. 26. John 16. 7. And in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of that Promise it is said, he <hi>poured him forth,</hi> Acts 2. 33. Gal. 4. 6. <hi>God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son in your hearts;</hi> and in other places the same Expression is used. Now this upon the matter i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the same with the former of <hi>Giving him,</hi> arguing the same Authority, the same Freedom, the same Bounty. Only the word naturally includes in its signification a respect unto a <hi>local Motion.</hi> He which is <hi>sent,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth from the place where he was, <hi>from whence</hi> He is sent, unto a place where he was not, <hi>whither</hi> he was sent. Now this cannot properly be spoken of the Holy Ghost. For he being God by Nature, is naturally
<hi>omnipresent,</hi> and an Omnipresence is inconsistent with a Local Mutation. So the <hi>Psalmist</hi> expresly, <hi>Psal. 139. 7, 8. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? if I ascend up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c. There must therefore a <hi>Metaphor</hi> be allowed in this Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but such a One as the Scripture by the frequent use of it hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred familiar unto us. Thus God is said to <hi>arise out of his place,</hi> to <hi>bow the Heavens and come down;</hi> to <hi>come down and see</hi> what is done in the Earth, <hi>Gen. 18. 21. Isa.</hi> 64. 1. That these things are not spoken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of God who is <hi>immense</hi> all men acknowledg. But where God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to work in any place in any kind, where before he did not do so, he is said to <hi>come</hi> thither; For so must we do, we must come to a place before we can work in it. Thus the <hi>Sending</hi> of the Holy Ghost includeth two things as added unto his being <hi>Given.</hi> (1.) That He was not before in or with that Person, or amongst those Persons for that especial Work and End which he is <hi>sent</hi> for. He may be in them and with them in one respect, and be afterwards said to be <hi>sent</hi> unto them in another: So our Lord Jesus Christ promiseth to <hi>send the Holy Ghost</hi> unto his Disciples as a Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom they had received before as a Sanctifier. <hi>I will,</hi> saith he,
<hi>send him unto you and you know him, for he dwelleth with you,</hi> John 14. 17. He did so as a Sanctifier before he came unto them as a Comforter. But in every <hi>coming</hi> of His, He is <hi>sent</hi> for one especial Work or another. And this sufficiently manifests that in his Gifts and Graces he is not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> unto all. A supposition thereof would leave no place for this espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Act of <hi>sending</hi> him, which is done by Choice and Distinction of the Object. Much less is he a <hi>Light</hi> which is alwayes <hi>in all Men,</hi> and which all Men <hi>may be in</hi> if they please. For this neither is nor can be absent in any sense from any one at any time. (2.) It denotes as <hi>especial Work</hi> there or on them, where and on whom, there was none before of that kind. For this cause is he said to be <hi>sent</hi> of the Father.<note n="*" place="margin">Etenim si de loco procedit Spiritus &amp; in locum transit, &amp; ipse Pater in loco in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venitur &amp; Filius: si de loco exit quem Pater mittit aut Filius, utique de loco transiens Spiritus &amp; progrediens, &amp; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem sicut corpus secundum impias in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretationes relinquere videtur &amp; Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> Let us then briefly consider the Importance of this Expression. And one or two things may be observed concerning it in general. As (1.) wherever it is used it hath direct respect unto the <hi>Times of the Gospel.</hi> Either it is a part of the Promises concerning it, or of the Story of its Accomplishment under it. But where-ever it is mentioned, the Time, State, and Grace of the Gospel are intended in it. For the Lord Christ was <hi>in all things to have the preeminence,</hi> Col. 1. 18. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God <hi>gave</hi> his Spirit in some measure before, yet he <hi>poured</hi> him not out until He was first anointed with his Fulness. (2.) There is a
<hi>tacit comparison</hi> in it with some other Time and Season, or some other Act of God wherein or whereby God <hi>gave</hi> his Spirit before, but not in the way and manner that he intended now to bestow him. A <hi>larger Measure</hi> of the Spirit to be now given than was before, or is signified by any other Expressions of the same Gift, is intended in this Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> Three things are therefore comprized in this Expression. (1.) An eminent Act of Divine <hi>Bounty. Pouring forth</hi> is the way whereby Bounty from an all-sufficeing fulness is expressed. As the <hi>Clouds filled with a moist vapour pour down Rain,</hi> Job 36. 27. until <hi>it water the Ridges of the Earth abundantly, setling the Furrows thereof, and making it soft with Showers;</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 10. which with the things following in that place, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13. are spoken <hi>Allegorically</hi> of this pouring out of the Spirit of God from above. Hence God is said to do this <hi>richly, Tit.</hi> 3. 6. The <hi>renewing of the Holy Ghost;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>which he hath poured on us richly;</hi> that is, on all Believers who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto God. For the Apostle discourseth not of the <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> of the Holy Ghost which were then given forth in a plentiful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but of that Grace of the Holy Ghost whereby all that believe are regenerated, renewed, and converted unto God. For so were men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted of old by a <hi>rich participation of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and so they must be still whatever some pretend, or die in their sins. And by the same word is the <hi>bounty</hi> of God in other things expressed. The living God
<hi>who giveth us richly</hi> all things to enjoy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. (2.) This <hi>pouring out</hi> hath respect unto the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of the Spirit and not unto his Person. For where he is given he is given absolutely, and as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not <hi>more</hi> or less; but his Gifts and Graces may be more plentifully and abundantly given at <hi>one time</hi> than at another, to some Persons than to others. Wherefore this Expression is <hi>metonymical,</hi> that being spoken of the Cause which is proper to the Effect; the Spirit being said to be
<hi>poured forth,</hi> because his Graces are so. (3.) Respect is had herein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some <hi>especial Works</hi> of the Spirit. Such are the <hi>Purifying</hi> or Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the <hi>Comforting</hi> or Refreshing them on whom He is poured. With respect unto the first to these Effects, he is compared both unto Fire and Water. For both Fire and Water have <hi>purifying Qualities</hi> in them, though towards different Objects and working in a different
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48389:53"/> manner. So by <hi>Fire</hi> are Metals purified and purged from their Dross and Mixtures, and by <hi>Water</hi> are all other unclean and defiled things cleansed and purified. Hence the Lord Jesus Christ in his Work by his Spirit is at once compared unto a <hi>Refiners Fire</hi> and to <hi>Fullers Sope,</hi> Mal. 3. 2, 3. because of the purging purifying Qualities that are in Fire and Water. And the Holy Ghost is expresly called a <hi>Spirit of Burning,</hi> Isa. 4. 4. For by him are the Vessels of the House of God that are of
<hi>Gold and Silver</hi> refined and purged, as those that are but of Wood and Stone are consumed. And when it is said of our Lord Jesus that he should <hi>baptize with the Holy Ghost and with Fire,</hi> Luke 3. 16. it is but
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the same thing doubly expressed, and therefore mention is made <hi>only of the Holy Ghost,</hi> John 1. 33. But the Holy Ghost was in his Dispensation to purifie and cleanse them as <hi>Fire</hi> doth Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And on the same account is he compared to <hi>Water,</hi> Ezek. 36. 35.
<hi>I will sprinkle clean Water upon you and you shall be clean;</hi> which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<hi>v.</hi> 26. by a <hi>New Spirit will I put within you,</hi> which God calls his Spirit, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 39. So our Saviour calls him <hi>Rivers of Water,</hi> Joh. 7. 38, 39. see Isa. 44. 3. And it is with regard unto his purifying cleansing and sanctifying our Natures that he is thus called. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect therefore in an especial manner hereunto is he said to be <hi>poured out.</hi> So our Apostle expresly declares, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6. Again it respects his
<hi>comforting</hi> and refreshing them on whom he is <hi>poured.</hi> Hence is he said to be <hi>poured down</hi> from above as Rain that descends on the Earth; <hi>Isa.</hi> 44. 3. <hi>I will pour Water upon him that is thirsty, and Floods upon the dry ground;</hi> that is, <hi>I will pour my Spirit on thy Seed, and my Blessing upon thy Off-spring; and they shall spring up as among the Grass, as Willows by the Water-Courses,</hi> v. 4. see <hi>Chap.</hi> 35. 6, 7. He comes upon the dry parched barren ground of the hearts of men, with his refreshing fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Vertue and Blessing, causing them to spring and bring forth Fruits in Holiness and Righteousness to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7. And in respect unto his Communication of his Spirit, is the Lord Christ said to <hi>come down like Rain upon the mown Grass, as Showers that water the Earth,</hi> Psal. 72. 6. The good Lord give us alwayes of these Waters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing Showers.</p>
               <p>And these are the wayes in general whereby the Dispensation of the Spirit from God, for what End or Purpose soever it be, is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> Fifthly; He is said to <hi>depart</hi> from some Persons. So it is said of
<hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 16. 14. The <hi>Spirit of the Lord departed from him.</hi> And
<hi>David</hi> prayes that God would not <hi>take his Holy Spirit from him.</hi> Psal. 51. 11. And this is to be understood answerably unto what we have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed before about his <hi>coming</hi> and his <hi>being sent.</hi> As he is said to
<hi>come</hi> so is he said to <hi>depart;</hi> and as he is said to be <hi>sent</hi> so is he said to be <hi>taken away.</hi> His <hi>departure</hi> from men therefore is his ceasing to work in them and on them as formerly; and as far as this is <hi>penal</hi> he is said to be <hi>taken away.</hi> So he <hi>departed</hi> and was
<hi>taken away</hi> from <hi>Saul</hi> when he no more helped him with that Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for Kingly Government which before he had by his Assistance. And this <hi>departure</hi> of the Holy Ghost from any is either <hi>total</hi> or <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> onely. Some on whom he hath been bestowed for the working of sundry <hi>Gifts</hi> for the good of others, with manifold convictions by Light and general Assistance unto the performance of Duties, He <hi>utterly deserts</hi> and gives them up unto themselves and their own hearts lusts. Examples hereof are common in the World. Men who have been made
<hi>Partakers</hi> of many <hi>Gifts of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and been in an especial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>enlightned,</hi> and under the Power of their Convictions carried out unto the Profession of the Gospel and the performance of many Duties of Religion; yet being entangled by <hi>Temptations</hi> and overcome by the power of their lusts, relinquish all their Beginnings and Engagements and turn wholly unto Sin and Folly. From such Persons the Holy Ghost
<hi>utterly departs,</hi> all their Gifts dry up and wither; their Light goeth out and they have Darkness in stead of a Vision. The Case of such is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable;
<hi>for it had been better for them not to have known the way of Righteousness, than after they have known it to turn from the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment delivered unto them,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 21. And some of these add
<hi>despight</hi> and contempt of that whole Work of the Spirit of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of themselves were made Partakers unto their Apostasie. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of such profligate Sinners is for the most part irrecoverable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Chap. 10. v.</hi> 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. From some He with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth and departeth <hi>partially</hi> only, and that mostly but for a season. And this Departure respects the Grace Light and Consolation which he administers unto Believers, as to the <hi>degrees</hi> of them and the Sense of them in their own Souls. On whom He is bestowed to work these things in a saving way, from them he never <hi>utterly</hi> or <hi>totally</hi> departs. This our Blessed Saviour plainly promiseth and asserteth; John 4. 14. <hi>Whosoever drinketh of the Water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I shall give him shall be in him a Well of Water springing up into Everlasting Life.</hi> That this Well of Living Water is his Sanctifying Spirit himself declares, <hi>John</hi> 7. 37, 38. He who hath received him,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48389:55"/> shall never have a thirst of <hi>total Want</hi> and Indigence any more. Besides He is given unto this end by vertue of the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> And the Promise is express therein, that he shall <hi>never depart from them</hi> to whom he is given, <hi>Isa. 59. 21. Jer. 31. 33. Chap. 32. 39, 40. Ezek.</hi> 11. 19, 20, But now as to the <hi>degrees</hi> and sensible Effects of these Operations, He may depart and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hdraw from Believers for a Season. Hence they may be left unto many <hi>Spiritual Decays</hi> and much weakeness, the things of Grace that <hi>remain in them</hi> being as it were <hi>ready to die,</hi> Revel. 3. 2. and they may apprehend themselves deserted and forsaken of God. So did <hi>Sion,</hi> Isa. 40. 27. <hi>Chap.</hi> 49. 15. For therein doth God <hi>hide himself,</hi> Isa. 44. 15. or forsake his <hi>People for a moment,</hi> Chap. 54. 7. He <hi>hides himself and his wrath,</hi> Chap. 57. 17. These are the things which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> so often and so bitterly complaineth of, and which with so much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness he contendeth and wrestleth with God to be delivered from. These are those <hi>spiritual Desertions</hi> which some of late have laden with reproach contempt and scorn. All the apprehensions and complaints of the People of God about them, they would represent as nothing but the
<hi>idle Imaginations</hi> of <hi>distempered Brains,</hi> or the Effects of some disorder in their <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Animal Spirits.</hi> I could indeed easily allow that Men should despise and laugh at what is declared as the <hi>Experience</hi> of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors at present. Their prejudice against their Persons will not allow them to entertain any thoughts of them but what are suited unto Folly and Hypocrisie. But at this I acknowledg I stand <hi>amazed;</hi> that whereas these things are so plainly, so fully and frequently declared in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both as to the actings of God and his Holy Spirit in them, and as to the <hi>sense</hi> of those concerned about them; whereas the <hi>whole</hi> of God's dealings, and Believers application of themselves to him in this Matter, are so <hi>graphically</hi> exemplified in sundry of the Holy Saints of old, as
<hi>Joh, David, Heman,</hi> and others; and great and plentiful Provision is made in the Scripture for the Direction, Recovery, Healing and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of Souls in such a condition; yet men professing themselves to be <hi>Christians,</hi> and to believe the Word of God at least not to be a Fable, should dare to cast such opprobrious Reproaches on the Wayes and and Works of God. The end of these Attempts can be no other but to decry all <hi>real entercourse</hi> between God and the Souls of Men, leaving only an outside form or shape of Religion, not one jot better than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is it only what concerns <hi>Spiritual Desertions,</hi> whose Nature, Causes, and Remedies, are professedly and at large handled by all the
<hi>Casuistical Divines</hi> even of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> but the whole Work of the Spirit of God upon the Hearts of Men, with all the Effects produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in them with respect unto Sin and Grace, that some men by their odious and <hi>scurrilous Expressions</hi> endeavour to expose to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and scorn; <hi>S. P.</hi> p. 339, 340, 341, 342. Whatever trouble befals the minds of men upon the account of a <hi>sense of the guilt of Sin,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Darkness and Disconsolation they may undergo through the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of God and his withdrawing of the wonted influences of his Grace Love and Favour towards them, whatever Peace Comfort or Joy they may be made Partakers of by a <hi>sense of the Love of God</hi> shed abroad in their Hearts by the Holy Ghost, it is all ascribed in most <hi>opprobrious Language</hi> unto Melancholy <hi>reeks</hi> and <hi>vapours,</hi> whereof a certain and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48389:55"/> mechanical <hi>account may be given by them who understand the Anatomy of the Brain.</hi> To such an height of <hi>Profane Atheism</hi> is the daring Pride and Ignorance of some in our dayes arrived.</p>

That va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Gifts and Graces wherewith Believers are endowed and adorned are these <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <hi>Distributions</hi> of the Holy Spirit. Hence the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal respect that we have unto him immediately in our Worship of him under the New Testament is, as he is the Author of these various Gifts and Graces. So <hi>John</hi> saluting the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> prayeth for Grace for them <hi>from God the Father, and the seven Spirits that are before his Throne,</hi> Rev. 1. 4. That is, the Holy Spirit of God considered in his care of the Church, and his yielding supplies unto it as the Author of that <hi>Perfection of Gifts</hi> and Graces which are and are to be bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. So doth the number of <hi>Seven</hi> denote. And therefore whereas our Lord Jesus Christ as the Foundation of his Church was anointed with all the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit in their Perfection, it is said that upon that one Stone should be <hi>seven Eyes, Zech.</hi> 3. 9. all the Gifts of the Seven Spirits of God, or of that Holy Spirit which is the Author of them all.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> All therefore that is pleaded for the <hi>Division of the Holy Ghost</hi> from this place, is built on the Supposition that we have before rejected; namely, that he is not a Divine Person, but an Arbitrary Emanation of Divine Power; and yet neither so can the <hi>division</hi> of the Holy Ghost pleaded for be with any tolerable sense maintained. <hi>Crellius</hi> sayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that all Divine Inspirations may be considered as <hi>one Whole,</hi> as <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Waters make up one Sea.</hi> In this respect the Holy Ghost is <hi>One,</hi> that is, <hi>one Universal</hi> made up of many <hi>Species,</hi> this is <hi>totum logicum.</hi> And so He may be divided into his <hi>Subordinate Species.</hi> But what Ground or Colour is there for any such Notions in the Scripture? Where is it said that all the Gifts of the Holy Ghost do constitute or make up <hi>one Holy Ghost?</hi> Or the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is <hi>one in general,</hi> because many Effects are ascribed unto him? Or that the several Gifts of the Spirit are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny distinct kinds of it? The contrary unto all these is expresly taught; namely, that the One Holy Spirit worketh all these things as he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, so that they are all of them external Acts of his Will and Power. And it is to as little purpose pleaded by the same Author, that he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided as a <hi>Natural Whole</hi> into its Parts, because there is mention of a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48389:56"/> Measure and Portion of him. So God is said not to give him to Jesus Christ by Measure, <hi>John</hi> 3. 34. And to every one of us is given Grace <hi>according to the Measure of the Gift of Christ;</hi> as though one Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of him were granted unto One, and another Measure to another. But this Measure is plainly of his Gifts and Graces. These were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on the Lord Christ in all their fulness, without any limitation either as to Kinds or Degrees. They were poured into him according unto the utmost extent and capacity of Humane Nature, and that under an inconceivable advancement by its Union unto the Son of God. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers receive his Gifts and Graces in limited proportion both as to their Kinds and Degrees. To turn into a <hi>Division of the Spirit himself</hi> is the greatest madness. And casting aside Prejudices there is no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the understanding of that saying of God to <hi>Moses,</hi> Numb. 11. 17.
<hi>I will take of the Spirit that is on thee and put it on the Elders.</hi> For it is evidently of the Gifts of the Spirit enabling Men for Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that God speaketh and not of the Spirit himself. Without any diminution of that Spirit in him, that is of the Gifts that He had received, <hi>God</hi> gave unto them, as lighting their Candle by his. And so also the <hi>double Portion</hi> of the Spirit of <hi>Elijah,</hi> which <hi>Elisha</hi> requested for himself, was only a large and peculiar measure of Prophetical Light, above what other Prophets which he left behind him had received; 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2. 9. He asked <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. This Expression is first used <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 17. where the <hi>double Portion</hi> of the First-Born is intended.

This was the sole Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Cause of all true Divine Prophecy thatever was given or gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Use of the Church. And in particular the <hi>Coming</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God upon the Prophets enabling them unto their Work is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned. <hi>Micah</hi> declares in his own Instance how it was with them all, <hi>Chap. 3. 8. But truly I am full of Power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of Judgment, and of Might, to declare unto Jacob his Transgression, and to Israel his Sin.</hi> It was from the Spirit of God alone, that he had all his Ability for the discharge of that <hi>Prophetical Office</hi> whereunto he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And when God would endow <hi>Seventy Elders</hi> with a Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; he tells <hi>Moses</hi> that he would <hi>take of the Spirit that was upon him,</hi> and give unto them for that Purpose; that is, he would communicate of the same Spirit unto them as was in Him. And where it is said at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time, that God spake by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> or that the Word of God
<hi>Came</hi> to them, of God <hi>spake</hi> to them; it is always intended that this was the immediate Work of the Holy Ghost. So says <hi>David</hi> of Himself; <hi>The Spirit of the Lord spake by Me,</hi> or in me; <hi>and his word was in my Tongue.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 2. Hence our Apostle repeating his words ascribes them direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Holy Ghost; <hi>Heb. 3. 7. Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, to day if you will hear his voice;</hi> and Chap. 4. 7. <hi>Saying in David.</hi> So the Words which are ascribed unto the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> Isa. 6. 9. are asserted to be the Words of the <hi>Holy Ghost, Acts</hi> 28. 25. He spake <hi>to them,</hi> or <hi>in them</hi> by his holy <hi>Inspirations;</hi> and he spake <hi>by them</hi> in his effectual infallible gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them, to utter, declare, and write what they received from Him, without Mistake or Variation.</p>

First, precisely for the <hi>Prediction</hi> or foretelling things to Come, as the <hi>Greek</hi> word and the <hi>Latine</hi> traduced from thence do signify. So <hi>Prophecy</hi> is a Divine Prediction of future things proceeding from Divine Revelation. But the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>he word signifies no more, but to <hi>speak</hi> out, <hi>interpret</hi> and declare the Minds or Words of another. So God tells <hi>Moses;</hi> that He would <hi>make Him a God unto Pharaoh;</hi> One that should deal with him in the Name, stead and Power of God; and <hi>Aaron his Brother should be his Prophet;</hi> Exod. 7. 1. that is, one that should <hi>interpret</hi> his meaning and declare his Words unto <hi>Pharaoh, Moses</hi> having complained of the Defect of his own Utterance. So Prophets are the <hi>Interpreters,</hi> the Declarers of the Word Will, Mind or Oracles of God unto others. Such an One is described
<hi>Job.</hi> 33. 23. Hence those who expounded the Scripture unto the Church under the <hi>New Testament</hi> were called <hi>Prophets,</hi> and their work <hi>Prophecy;</hi> Rom. 12. 6. 1 Cor. 14. 31, 32. And under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> those that

And two things concerning it may be considered. (1.) Its <hi>General Nature.</hi> (2.) The particular wayes whereby especial Revelation was granted unto any. First, For its Nature in general it consisted in Inspiration.
<note n="*" place="margin">Sed &amp; hoc notandum ex eo quod dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat; ut videam quid loquatur, in me; Prophetiam Visionem &amp; Eloquium Dei non extrinsecus ad Prophetas fieri, sed intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus &amp; interiori homini respondere.

                  </gap>.
<hi>Divine Inspiration</hi> was the Original and Cause of it. And the acting of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in communicating his Mind unto the Prophets was called <hi>Inspiration</hi> on a double account. First, in answer unto his Name and Nature. The
<hi>Name</hi> whereby He is revealed unto us signifieth <hi>Breath;</hi> and He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Breath of God</hi> whereby his Essential Relation to the Father and Son, with his Eternal Natural Emanation from them, is expressed. And therefore when our Saviour gave Him unto his Disciples as a proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
<hi>Emblem</hi> of what he gave he <hi>breathed</hi> upon them, <hi>John</hi> 20. 22. So also in the great Work of the <hi>Infusion</hi> of the Reasonable Soul into the Body of Man, it is said, <hi>God breathed into him the Breath of Life,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. From hence I say it is, namely from the <hi>Nature and Name</hi> of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48389:60"/> Holy Spirit, that his immediate actings on the Minds of Men in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Communication of Divine Revelations unto them is called
<hi>Inspiration</hi> or <hi>Inbreathing.</hi> And the <hi>Unclean Spirit</hi> counterfeiting his Actings, did <hi>inspire</hi> his Worshippers with a preternatural <hi>Afflatus,</hi> by wayes suited unto his own filthy Vileness. Secondly; This Holy Work of the Spirit of God, as it is expressed suitable to his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> so the <hi>Meekness, Gentleness Facility</hi> wherewith he works is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended hereby. He did as it were <hi>gently</hi> and <hi>softly breath</hi> into them the Knowledg and Comprehension of Holy Things. It is an especial and immediate Work wherein he acts suitably unto his <hi>Nature</hi> as a <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Spirit or Breath of God; and suitably unto his peculiar Personal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>Meekness</hi> Gentleness and Peace. So his Acting is <hi>Inspiration,</hi> whereby he came within the Faculties of the Souls of Men, <hi>acting</hi> them with a Power that was not their own. It is true when He had thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired any with the Mind of God, they had <hi>no Rest</hi> nor could have unless they declared it in its proper Way and Season; Jer. 20. 9. <hi>Then I said I will not make mention of him, nor speak in his Name any more; but his Word was in mine heart as a burning Fire shut up in my Bones, and I was weary with forbearing I could not stay.</hi> But this Disturbance was from a <hi>moral sense</hi> of their Duty, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> from any <hi>violent Agitations</hi> of his upon their Natures. And whereas sometimes trouble and consternation of Spirit did befal some of the <hi>Prophets</hi> in and under the Revelations they received from Him; it was on a double account. First, Of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Representations of things that were made unto them in Visions. Things of great dread and terror were represented unto their Fancies and Imaginations. Secondly, Of the greatness and dread of the Things themselves revealed, which sometimes were terrible and destructive,

                  </note> Hence although the <hi>Prophets</hi> under the Old Testament were made use
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48389:61"/> of to communicate the clearest Revelations and Predictions concerning Jesus Christ, yet in the Knowledg and Understanding of the meaning of them, they were all inferior to <hi>John Baptist,</hi> as he was in this Matter to the meanest Believer, or <hi>least in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Therefore for their own <hi>Illumination</hi> and Edification did they diligently enquire by the
<hi>ordinary means</hi> of Prayer and Meditation, into the meaning of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in those <hi>Prophesies</hi> which themselves received by extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Revelation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. Nor did <hi>Daniel</hi> who had those express Representations and glorious Visions concerning the Monarchies of the World, and the providential Alterations which should be wrought in them, understand what and how things would be in their Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That account he doth give of himself in the close of his Visions,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 12 8, 9. But he so raised and prepared their Minds, as that they might be capable to receive and retain those impressions of things which he communicated unto them. So a Man Tunes the Strings of an
<hi>Instrument,</hi> that it may in a due manner receive the Impressions of his
<hi>Finger</hi> and give out the Sound he intends. He did not speak in them or by them, and leave it unto the Use of their Natural Faculties their Minds or Memories, to understand and remember the things spoken by Him, and so declare them to others. But he himself <hi>acted</hi> their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, making use of them to express his Words not their own Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And herein besides other things consists the difference between the Inspirations of the Holy Spirit and those so called of the Devil. The utmost that Satan can do is, to make strong impressions on the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, or influencing their Faculties by possessing, wresting, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting the Organs of the Body and Spirits of the Blood. The Holy Spirit is in the Faculties and useth them as his Organs. And this he did secondly with that Light and Evidence of Himself, of his Power, Truth and Holiness, as left them lyable to no <hi>suspicion,</hi> whether their Minds were under his <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> or no. Men are subject to fall so far under the Power of their own <hi>Imaginations,</hi> through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of a corrupt distempered Fancy, as to suppose them Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Revelations. And <hi>Satan</hi> may and did of old, and perhaps doth so still impose on the minds of some, and communicate unto them such a conception of his Insinuations, as that they shall for a while think them to be from God himself. But in the <hi>Inspirations</hi> of the Holy Spirit, and his actings of the Minds of the Holy Men of old, he gave them <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Assurance</hi> that it was himself alone by whom they were acted, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 28. If any shall ask by what <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Infallible Tokens,</hi> they might know assuredly the <hi>Inspirations of the Holy Spirit,</hi> and be satisfied with such a perswasion as was not liable to mistake, that they were not imposed upon? I must say plainly, That cannot tell; for these are things whereof we have no Experience. Nor is any thing of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whatever some falsly and foolishly impute unto them who profess and avow an interest in the ordinary gracious workings of the Holy Ghost, pretended unto. What some <hi>Phrenetical</hi> Persons in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers or under their Delusions have boasted of, no sober or wise Man esteems worthy of any sedate Consideration. But this I say, It was the Design of the Holy Ghost to give those whom He did thus <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily inspire,</hi> an Assurance sufficient to bear them out in the discharge of their Duty that they were acted by himself alone. For in the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48389:61"/> pursuit of their Work which they were by Him called unto, they were to
<hi>encounter various Dangers,</hi> and some of them to lay down their Lives for a Testimony unto the Truth of the Message delivered by them. This they could not be ingaged into without as full an evidence of his acting them, as the Nature of Man in such Cases is capable of; The Case of
<hi>Abraham</hi> fully confirms it. And it is impossible but that in these extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary workings there was such an <hi>impression of Himself,</hi> his Holiness and Authority left on their Minds, as did secure them from all fear of Delusion. Even upon the Word as delivered by them unto others, he put those <hi>Characters</hi> of Divine Truth, Holiness and Power, as rendred it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> worthy to be believed, and not to be rejected without the highest sin by them unto whom it came. Much more was there such an evidence in it unto them who enjoyed its Original Inspiration. Secondly, He <hi>acted and guided</hi> them as to the very <hi>Organs</hi> of their Bodies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they expressed the Revelation which they had received by Inspiration from Him. They spake as they were <hi>acted by the Holy Ghost.</hi> He guided their <hi>Tongues</hi> in the Declaration of his Revelations, as the Mind of a Man guideth his Hand in writing to express its Conceptions. Hence
<hi>David</hi> having received Revelations from Him, or being inspired by Him, affirms in his Expression of them, That <hi>his Tongue was the Pen of a ready Writer,</hi> Psal. 45. 2. that is, it was so guided by the Spirit of God to express the Conceptions received from Him. And on this account God is said to <hi>speak by their Mouths,</hi> as he spake by the <hi>Mouth of the Holy Prophets,</hi> Luke 1. 70. all of whom had but <hi>one Mouth</hi> on the account of their absolute Consent and Agreement in the same Predictions; For this is the meaning of <hi>one Voice</hi> or <hi>one Mouth</hi> in a Multitude. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost spake by the <hi>Mouth of David,</hi> Acts 1. 16. For whatever they received by Revelation they were but the <hi>Pipes</hi> through which the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it were conveyed, without the least mixture with any allay from their Frailties or Infirmities.

By <hi>Objects</hi> of their Senses as by audible Voices. (2.) By <hi>Impressions</hi> on the Imagination in Dreams and Visions. (3.) By <hi>Illustration</hi> or enlightning of their Minds. But as this last way expresseth Divine <hi>Inspiration,</hi> I cannot acknowledg it as a distinct way of Revelation by it self.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> First, God sometimes made use of an <hi>Articulate Voice,</hi> speaking out those things which he did intend to declare in words significant of them. So he revealed Himself or his Mind unto <hi>Moses</hi> when he spake to him <hi>face to face</hi> as a Man <hi>speaketh unto his Friend,</hi> Exod. 33. 11. Numb. 12. 8. And as far as I can observe the whole Revelation made unto <hi>Moses,</hi> was by outward audible <hi>articulate Voices,</hi> whose Sense was impressed on his Mind by the Holy Spirit. For an <hi>external Voice</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an <hi>inward Elevation</hi> and Disposition of Mind, is not sufficient to give security and assurance of Truth unto him that doth receive it. So God spake to <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 Kings 19. 12, 13, 14. as also to <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi> and it may be to all the rest of the Prophets at their first Calling and Entrance into their Ministry. For words formed <hi>miraculously</hi> by God, and conveighed sensibly unto the outward Ears of Men, carry a great Majesty and Authority with them. This was not the usual way of God's revealing his Mind, nor is it signified by that Phrase of Speech, The <hi>Word of the Lord came unto me;</hi> whereby no more is intended but an immediate Revelation by what way or means soever it was granted. Mostly this was by that Secret effectual Impression on their Minds which we have before described. And these <hi>Voices</hi> were either immediately created by God himself as when he spake unto <hi>Moses,</hi> wherein the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the Revelation made unto him principally consisted, or the Ministry of Angels was used in the Formation and Pronunciation of them. But, as we observed before, the <hi>Divine Certainty</hi> of their Minds to whom they were spoken with their Abilities infallibly to declare them unto others, was from an immediate <hi>internal Work</hi> of the Spirit of God upon them. Without this the Prophets might have been imposed on by external audible Voices; nor would they by themselves give their minds an infallible assurance.</p>

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:48389:62"/> Secondly; <hi>Dreams</hi> were made use of under the Old Testament to the same purpose, and unto them also I refer all those <hi>Visions</hi> which they had in their <hi>sleep</hi> though not called Dreams.<note place="margin">Sunt autem multa genera Prophetandi, quorum u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num est Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Hence in the Promise of the Plentiful <hi>Pouring out of the Spirit</hi> or Communication of his Gifts, mention is made of <hi>Dreams,</hi> Acts 2. 17. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your Sons and your Daughters shall Prophesie, your young Men shall see Visions, and your old Men shall dream Dreams.</hi> Not that God intended much to make use of this way of <hi>Dreams</hi> and
<hi>Nocturnal Visions</hi> under the New Testament; but the intention of the words is to shew, that there should be a <hi>plentiful E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>usion</hi> of that Spirit which acted by those various Wayes and Means then under the Old. Only as to some particular Directions God did sometimes continue his Intimations by <hi>Visions in the Rest of the Night.</hi> Such a <hi>Vision</hi> had <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 16. 10. But of old this was more frequent. So God made a signal Revelation unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> when the <hi>horrour of a deep sleep fell upon him,</hi> Gen. 15. 12, 13, 14. And <hi>Daniel</hi> heard the Voice of the words of him that spake unto him, <hi>when he was in a deep Sleep,</hi> Dan. 10. 9. But this
<hi>Sleep</hi> of theirs I look not on as Natural, but as that which God sent and cast them into, that therein he might represent the <hi>Image</hi> of things unto their Imaginations. So of old he caused a <hi>deep sleep</hi> to fall on <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 2. 21. The Jews distinguish between <hi>Dreams</hi> and those <hi>Visions</hi> in Sleep as they may be distinctly considered; but I cast them together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Head of Revelation in Sleep.

And this way was so frequent, that it bare the Name for a Season of all Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Revelations.

<hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. and partly it may be from the <hi>Evidence</hi> of the things revealed unto him, which were cleared as fully to his Mind as if he had had an ocular inspection of them. So from the Matter of them, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies began in common to be called the <hi>Burden of the Lord.</hi> For he burdened their Consciences with his Word, and their Persons with its Execution. But when false Prophets began to make frequent use and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48389:63"/> to serve themselves of this Expression it was forbidden, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 33, 36. And yet we find that there is mention hereof about the same Time it may be by <hi>Habbakuk,</hi> Chap. 1. 1. as also after the return from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
<hi>Zech. 9. 1. Mal.</hi> 1. 1.

And to this Head I refer <hi>Daniel</hi>'s and the <hi>Apocalyptical</hi> Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Especially I do so all those wherein a Representation was made of
<hi>God</hi> himself and his Glorious Throne. Such as that of <hi>Micaiah,</hi> 1 Kings 22. 18. and <hi>Isa. 6. 1. Ezek.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5. It is evident that in all these there was no use of the <hi>bodily Senses of the Prophets,</hi> but onely their Minds were affected with the <hi>Idea's</hi> and Representation of Things. But this was so effectual, as that they understood not but that they also made use of their <hi>visive Faculty.</hi> Hence <hi>Peter</hi> when he was actually delivered out of Prison, thought a good while that he had only <hi>seen a Vision,</hi> Acts 12. 9. for he knew how powerfully the Mind was wont to be affected by them. Now these <hi>Visions</hi> of both sorts were granted unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to confirm their Minds in the Apprehension of the Things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto them for the instruction of others. For hereby they were deeply affected with them, whereunto a clear <hi>Idea</hi> and Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48389:63"/> on of things doth effectually tend. But yet two things were required to render these <hi>Visions</hi> direct and compleat Parts of Divine Revelation. (1.) That the <hi>Minds</hi> of the Prophets were acted guided and raised in a due manner by the Holy Spirit for the receiving of them; this gave them their Assurance that their <hi>Visions</hi> were from God. (2.) His enabling them faithfully to retain, and <hi>infallibly</hi> to declare what was so represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them, For instance, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> receiveth a <hi>Vision</hi> by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation unto his Mind of a Glorious Fabrick of a <hi>Temple,</hi> to instruct the Church in the Spiritual Glory and Beauty of Gospel-Worship which was to be introduced, <hi>Chap. 44. 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.</hi> It seems utterly impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Mind of Man to <hi>conceive</hi> and retain at once all the <hi>Harmonious Structure, Dimensions,</hi> and Laws of the Fabrick represented. This was the peculiar Work of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> namely to implant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Idea</hi> presented unto him on his Mind, and to enable him accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and <hi>infallibly</hi> to declare it. So <hi>David</hi> affirms that the Spirit of God made him to understand the Pattern of the Temple built by <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>writing by his hand upon him.</hi>

<hi>Isaiah</hi> was commanded to <hi>walk naked and bare-foot,</hi> Isa. 20. 1, 2, 3.
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> to dispose of a <hi>Linnen Girdle,</hi> Chap. 13. 1, 2. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to lie in the <hi>Siege,</hi> Chap. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. and to remove the <hi>Stuff of his House,</hi> Chap. 12. 3, 4. <hi>Hosea</hi> to take a Wife of <hi>Whoredoms, and Children of Whoredoms,</hi> Hos. 1. 2. I shall be brief in what is frequently spoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Some of these things, as <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s going <hi>Naked,</hi> and <hi>Hoseah</hi>'s taking a
<hi>Wife of Whoredoms,</hi> contain things in them against the Light of Nature and the express Law of God, and of evil example unto others. None of these therefore can be granted to have been <hi>actually done;</hi> only these things were represented unto them in <hi>Visions</hi> to take the deeper impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them. And what they saw or did in Vision, they speak <hi>positively</hi> of their so seeing or doing, see <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 3, 4. For the other Instances, I know nothing but that the things reported might be really performed and not in <hi>Vision</hi> only. And it is plain that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was commanded to do the things he did in the sight of the People for their more evident conviction, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. and on the sight whereof they made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry what those things belonged unto them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. 19.</p>

And it is expresly said, that it was in the Visions of God. Falling by Divine Dispensation into a
<hi>Trance or Extasie,</hi> wherein their outward Senses were suspended their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, their Minds and Understandings were unto their own Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension carried in a Holy Rapture from one place unto another, which was effected only by a Divine and Efficacious <hi>Representation</hi> of the things unto them, which were done in the places from whence they were really absent. And these are some of those <hi>Accidents of Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Revelations</hi> which are recorded in the Scripture; and it is possible that some other Instances of the like nature may be observed.

                  </note> And yet on the other hand we shall find that
<hi>true Prophesies</hi> have been given out by Men seeming utterly void of all sanctifying Grace. And to increase the difficulty, it is certain that
<hi>great Predictions,</hi> and those with respect unto Christ himself, have been given and made by Men guided and acted for the most part by the
<hi>Devil.</hi> So was it with <hi>Balaam</hi> who was a <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer,</hi> that gave himself to Diabolical Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Divinations, and as such a one was destroyed by God's Appointment. Yea at or about the same time wherein he uttered a most Glorious Prophesie concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi> the
<hi>Star of Jacob;</hi> being left unto his own Spirit and Inclination, he gave cursed Advice and Counsel for the drawing of the People of God into destructive and Judgment-procuring sins,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 33. 16. And in the whole of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize he thought to have satisfied his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness with a reward for cursing them by his
<hi>Enchantments.</hi> And yet this Man not onely professeth of himself that he <hi>heard</hi> the <hi>Words of God and saw the Visions of the Almighty.</hi> Numb. 24. 4. but did actually foretel and prophesie Glorious Things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ and his Kingdom. Shall we then think that the Holy Spirit of God will immix his own <hi>Holy Inspirations</hi> with the wicked suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil in a South-sayer? Or shall we suppose that the <hi>Devil</hi> was the Author of those Predictions, whereas God reproacheth false Gods and their Prophets acted by them, that they could not <hi>declare the things that should happen, nor shew the things that were to come afterwards?</hi> Isa. 41. 22, 23. So also it is said of <hi>Saul</hi> that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him, and an Evil Spirit vexed him; and yet afterwards that the <hi>Spirit of God came upon him and he prophesied,</hi> 1 Sam. 19. 24. The
<hi>Old Prophet at Bethel</hi> who lyed unto the Prophet that came from <hi>Judah,</hi> and that in the Name of the Lord, seducing him unto Sin and Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and probably defiled with the Idolatry and false Worship of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> was yet esteemed a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and did foretel what came to pass, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.</p>

                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:48389:64"/> Sundry things may be offered for the Solution of this Difficulty. For (1.) as to that place of the Apostle <hi>Peter;</hi> (1.) It may not be taken
<hi>Universally,</hi> that all who prophesied at any time were <hi>Personally Holy,</hi> but only that for the most part so they were. (2.) He seems to speak parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of <hi>them only</hi> who were <hi>Pen-men of the Scripture,</hi> and of those Prophesies which remain therein for the Instruction of the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom I no way doubt but that they were all <hi>Sanctified and Holy.</hi> (3.) It may be that he understandeth not <hi>real inherent Holiness,</hi> but only a Separation and Dedication unto God by especial Office, which is a thing of another nature. (2.) The <hi>Gift of Prophesie</hi> is granted not to be in it self and its own Nature a <hi>Sanctifying Grace,</hi> nor is the Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so whereby it is wrought. For whereas it consists in an affecting of the Mind with a <hi>transient irradiation</hi> of Light in hidden things, it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did nor could of it self produce <hi>Faith, Love,</hi> or <hi>Holiness</hi> in the Heart. Another Work of the Holy Ghost was necessary hereunto.</p>
               <p>(3.) There is therefore no Inconsistency in this Matter, that God should grant an <hi>immediate Inspiration</hi> unto some that were not really sanctified. And yet I would not grant this to have been actually done without a just Limitation. For whereas some were <hi>established to be Prophets</hi> unto the Church in the whole course of their Lives after their first Call from God, as <hi>Samuel, Elijah, Elisha, Jeremiah,</hi> and the rest of the Prophets men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scripture; in like manner I no way doubt but they were all of them <hi>really sanctified</hi> by the Holy Spirit of God. But others there were who had only some occasional Discoveries of <hi>hidden</hi> or <hi>future things</hi> made unto them, or fell into some Extasies or Raptures with a Supernatural Agitation of their Minds (as it is twice said of <hi>Saul</hi>) for a short Season. And I see no Reason why we may not grant, yea from Scripture-Testimonies we must grant, that many such Persons may be so acted by the Holy Spirit of God. So was it with wicked <hi>Caiaphas</hi> who is said to Prophesie, <hi>John</hi> 11. 51. And a great Prophesie indeed it was which his words expressed, greater than which there is none in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But the Wretch himself knew nothing of the <hi>Importance</hi> of what was uttered by him. A suddain Impression of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> caused him against his Intention to utter a <hi>Sacred Truth,</hi> and that because he was
<hi>High Priest</hi> whose words were of great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the People.<note n="*" place="margin">

(5.) For the Difficulty about <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> himself who was a <hi>Sorcerer</hi> and the <hi>Devil's Prophet,</hi> I acknowledg it is of Importance. But sundry things may be offered for the removal of it. (1.) Some do contend that <hi>Balaam</hi> was a Prophet of God only. That indeed he gave himself unto <hi>Judicial Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> and the Conjectures of future Events from Natural Causes. But as to his Prophesies they were all Divine; and the Light of them affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the <hi>Speculative Part</hi> of his Mind; had no influence upon his Will, Heart, and Affections which were still corrupt. This <hi>Tostatus</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:48389:65"/> pleadeth for. But as it is expresly said, That he <hi>sought for Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Numb. 24. 1. So the whole Description of his Course and End gives him up as a <hi>Cursed Sorcerer,</hi> and he is expresly called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Sooth-sayer,</hi> John. 12. 22. Which word though we have once rendred by <hi>Prudent,</hi> that is, One who prudently conjectureth at future Events according unto present appearing Causes, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 2. yet it is mostly used for a <hi>Diabolical Diviner</hi> or Sooth-sayer. And for what he said of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, That he <hi>heard the Voice of God, and saw the Visions of the Most High,</hi> it might be only his own boasting to procure veneration to his <hi>Diabolical</hi> Incantations. But in Reputation we find he was in those dayes in the World, and supposed he was to utter Divine Oracles unto Men. This God in his Providence made use of to give out a Testimony to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Report whereof was then almost lost amongst Men. In this condition it may be granted, that the
<hi>Good Spirit of God,</hi> without the least Reflection on the Majesty and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own Holiness did over-rule the Power of the Devil, cast out his Suggestions from the Man's Mind, and gave such an <hi>Impression of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Truths</hi> in the room of them, as he could not but utter and declare. For that instant he did as it were take the <hi>Instrument</hi> out of the Hand of Satan, and by his Impression on it caused it to give a sound according to his Mind, which when he had done he left it again unto his Possession. And I know not but that he might do so sometimes with others among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were professedly given up to receive and give out the Oracles of the Devil. So he made the <hi>Damsel</hi> possessed with a <hi>Spirit of Divination</hi> and Sooth-saying to acknowledg <hi>Paul</hi> and his Companions to be Servants of the most High God, and to shew to Men <hi>the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Acts 16. 16, 17. And this must be acknowledged by them who suppose that the <hi>Sybills</hi> gave out Predictions concerning Jesus Christ, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole strain of their <hi>Prophetical Oracles</hi> were expresly Diabolical. And no Conspiracy of Men or Devils shall cause him to forego his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty over them, and the using of them to his own Glory. (6.) The Case of <hi>Saul</hi> is plain. The Spirit of the Lord who departed from him, was the <hi>Spirit of Wisdom,</hi> Moderation and Courage to fit him for Rule and Government, that is, the Gifts of the Holy Ghost unto that purpose, which he withdrew from him. And the <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> that was upon him, proceeded no farther but to the stirring up Vexatious and disquieting Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Mind. And notwithstanding this molestation and punishment inflicted on him, the Spirit of God might at a <hi>season</hi> fall upon him so as to cast him into a <hi>Rapture</hi> or Extasie wherein his Mind was acted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in an extraordinary manner, and himself transported into Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were not at all according unto his own Inclinations.

<hi>distinct Gift</hi> from Prophesie in general, or rather a distinct <hi>Species</hi> or kind of Prophesie. For many Prophets there were Divinely Inspired, who yet never wrote any of their <hi>Prophesies,</hi> nor any thing else for the use of the Church.

Now this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry was first committed unto <hi>Moses,</hi> who besides the <hi>Five Books of the Law,</hi> probably also wrote the Story of <hi>Job.</hi> Many Prophets there were before Him, but he was the first who committed the Will of God to
<hi>Writing,</hi> after God himself who wrote the Law in Tables of Stone, which was the Beginning and Pattern of the Scriptures.

<hi>Prophets.</hi> For although they wrote in an <hi>Historical</hi> manner, as did
<hi>Moses</hi> also, concerning things past and gone in their Dayes, or it may be presently acted in their own Times, yet they did not Write them either from their own <hi>Memory,</hi> nor from <hi>Tradition,</hi> nor from the <hi>Rolls</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> of Times, (although they might be furnished with and skilled in these things) but by the Inspiration, Guidance and Direction of the Holy Ghost. Hence are they called <hi>Prophets</hi> in such a Latitude as the Word may be used in, to signifie any that are <hi>Divinely Inspired,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive immediate Revelations from God. And thus was it with all the Pen-men of the Holy Scripture. As their Minds were under that full assurance of <hi>Divine Inspiration</hi> which we before described, so their <hi>words which they wrote</hi> were under the especial care of the same Spirit, and were of his Suggestion or Inditing.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> There were therefore three things concurring in this Work. (1.) The

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48389:66"/> was concerned, who can secure us that <hi>nihil Humani</hi> no Humane Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection mixed it self therewithal. I know some think that the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> of things only was communicated unto them; but as for the <hi>words</hi> whereby it was to be expressed, that was left unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their own Abilities. And this they suppose is evident from that <hi>variety of Stile</hi> which according to their various Capacities, Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Abilities, is found amongst them. This argues, as they say, that the <hi>wording</hi> of their Revelations was left unto themselves, and was the Product of their <hi>Natural Abilities.</hi> This in general I have spoken unto elsewhere, and manifested what mistakes sundry have run into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Stile of the Holy Pen-Men of the Scripture.</hi> Here I shall not take up what hath been argued and evinced in another place. I only say that the <hi>variety</hi> intended ariseth mostly from the <hi>variety</hi> of the Subject Matters treated of; nor is it such as will give any countenance to the prophaneness of this Opinion. For the Holy Ghost in his Work on the Minds of Men doth not put a <hi>force</hi> upon them, nor acts them any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than they are in their own Natures, and with their present Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Qualifications <hi>meet</hi> to be acted and used. He leads and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts them in such Paths wherein they are <hi>able to walk.</hi> The words therefore which he suggests unto them are such as they are accustomed unto, and he causeth them to make use of such Expressions as were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar unto themselves. So he that useth <hi>divers Seals</hi> maketh different Impressions, though the guidance of them all be <hi>equal</hi> and the same. And he that toucheth skilfully several <hi>Musical Instruments</hi> variously tuned, maketh several Notes of Musick. We may also grant and do, That they used their own <hi>Abilities of Mind</hi> and Understanding in the choice of Words and Expressions. So the <hi>Preacher</hi> sought to find out
<hi>acceptable words,</hi> Eccles. 12. 10. But the Holy Spirit who is more intimate unto the Minds and Skill of Men than they are themselves, did so guide act and operate in them, as that the words they fixed upon were as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and certainly from him, as if they had been spoken to them by an <hi>audible Voice.</hi> Hence that which was written was upright, even Words of Truth, as in that place. This must be so or they could not speak as they <hi>moved by the Holy Ghost,</hi> nor could their <hi>Writing</hi> be said to be of <hi>Divine Inspiration.</hi> Hence oft-times in the <hi>Original</hi> great Senses and Significations depend on a single <hi>Letter,</hi> as for instance in the change of the Name of <hi>Abraham;</hi> And our Saviour affirms that every
<hi>Apex</hi> and <hi>Iota</hi> of the Law, is under the care of God as that which was given by Inspiration from himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. But I have on other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions treated of these things, and shall not therefore here enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> The third sort of the immediate <hi>extraordinary Operations</hi> of the Holy Ghost absolutely exceeding the actings and compliance of Humane Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are <hi>Miracles</hi> of all sorts, which were frequent under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. Such were many things wrought by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua, Elijah</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> with some others; those by <hi>Moses</hi> exceeding, if the <hi>Jews</hi> fail not in their Computation, all the rest that are recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now these were all the <hi>immediate Effects</hi> of the Divine Power of the Holy Ghost. He is the sole Author of all <hi>real</hi> miraculous Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For by <hi>Miracles</hi> we understand such Effects as are <hi>really</hi> beyond and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48389:66"/> above the Power of Natural Causes however applyed unto Operation. Now it is said expresly that our Lord Jesus Christ <hi>wrought Miracles</hi> (for Instance, the casting out of Devils From Persons possessed) by the <hi>Holy</hi> Ghost. And if their <hi>immediate Production</hi> were by him in the Humane Nature of Jesus Christ personally united unto the Son of God; how much more must it be granted that it was <hi>He alone</hi> whose Power they were wrought in those who had no such Relation unto the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And therefore where they are said to be wrought by the <hi>Hand</hi> or
<hi>Finger</hi> of God, it is the <hi>Person of the Holy Spirit</hi> which is precisely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as we have declared before; And the Persons by whom they were wrought were never the <hi>real Subjects</hi> of the Power whereby they were wrought, as though it should be inherent and residing in them as a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 12, 16. Only they were infallibly directed by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> by Word or Action to presignifie their Operation. So was it with <hi>Joshua</hi> when he commanded the <hi>Sun and Moon to stand still,</hi> Josh. 10. 12. There was no Power in <hi>Joshua,</hi> no not extraordinarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Him, to have such a real influence upon the whole frame of Nature as to effect so great an Alteration therein. Onely he had a
<hi>Divine Warranty</hi> to speak that which God himself would effect; whence it is said that therein <hi>God hearkned unto the Voice of a Man,</hi> v. 14. It is a vanity of the greatest magnitude in some of the Jews as <hi>Maimonides More Nebuch.</hi> p. 2. cap. 35. <hi>Levi B. Gerson</hi> on the place, and others who deny any fixation of the Sun or Moon, and judge that it is only the speed of <hi>Joshua</hi> in subduing his Enemies before the close of that day which is intended. This they contend for lest <hi>Joshua</hi> should be thought to have wrought a greater Miracle than <hi>Moses.</hi> But as the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> is express to the contrary, <hi>c.</hi> 3. 11. and their own <hi>Sirachides,</hi> c. 45. 56. so it is no small prevarication in some Christians to give countenance unto such a putid Fiction, see <hi>Grot.</hi> in loc. It is so in all other <hi>miraculous</hi> Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even where the Parts of the Bodies of Men were made instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the <hi>Miracle</hi> it self, as in the <hi>Gift of Tongues.</hi> They who had that Gift did not so speak from any Skill or Ability residing in them, but they were meerly <hi>Organs</hi> of the Holy Ghost which he moved at his Pleasure. Now the end of all these <hi>miraculous Operations</hi> was to give reputation to the Persons, and to confirm the <hi>ministry of them</hi> by whom they were wrought. For as at first they were the occasion of <hi>wonder</hi> and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so upon their consideration they evidenced the respect and regard of God unto <hi>such Persons</hi> and their Work. So when God sent <hi>Moses</hi> to declare his Will in an extraordinary manner unto the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> he commands him to work several Miracles or Signs before them that they might believe that he was sent of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 8. And such Works were called <hi>Signs,</hi> because they were Tokens and Pledges of the Presence of the Spirit of God with them by whom they were wrought. Nor was this Gift ever bestowed on any Man <hi>alone</hi> or for its own sake, but it was alwayes subordinate unto the Work of Revealing or Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Mind of God. And these are the general Heads of the <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Operations</hi> of the Holy Spirit of God in Works exceeding all Humane or Natural Abilities in their whole kind.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>22</label> The next sort of the Operations of the Holy Ghost under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament whose Explanation was designed, is of those whereby he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48389:67"/> proved through immediate impression of his own Power, the <hi>Natural Faculties</hi> and Abilities of the Minds of Men. And these as was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated have respect to things <hi>Political, Moral, Natural,</hi> and <hi>Intellectual,</hi> with some of a mixed Nature. First, He had in them respect unto things <hi>Political,</hi> such were his <hi>Gifts</hi> whereby he enabled sundry Persons unto <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Civil Government</hi> amongst Men. Government or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Rule is of great concernment unto the Glory of God in the World and of the highest usefulness unto Mankind. Without it the whole World would be filled with <hi>violence,</hi> and become a <hi>Stage</hi> for all Wickedness visibly and openly to act it self upon in disorder and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And all Men confess that unto a due management hereof unto its proper Ends, sundry <hi>peculiar Gifts</hi> and Abilities of Mind are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>in</hi> them and needful <hi>for</hi> them who are called thereunto. These are they themselves to endeavour after and sedulously to improve the
<hi>Measures</hi> which they have attained of them. And where this is by any neglected, the <hi>World and themselves</hi> will quickly feed on the Fruits of that Negligence. But yet because the utmost of what Men may of this kind obtain by their ordinary endeavours and an ordinary Blessing thereon, is not sufficient for some <hi>especial ends</hi> which God aimed at in and by their Rule and Government; the Holy Ghost did oftentimes give an <hi>especial Improvement</hi> unto their Abilities of Mind by his own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and extraordinary Operation. And in some Cases he manifested the Effects of his <hi>Power</hi> herein by some <hi>external visible Signs</hi> of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them in whom he so wrought. So in the first Institution of the
<hi>Sanhedrim</hi> or Court of <hi>Seventy Elders,</hi> to bear together with <hi>Moses</hi> the Burden of the People in their Rule and Government; the Lord is said
<hi>to put his Spirit upon them,</hi> and that <hi>the Spirit rested on them,</hi> Numb. 11. 16, 17. <hi>And the Lord said unto</hi> Moses, <hi>Gather unto me Seventy Men of the Elders of</hi> Israel, <hi>whom thou knowest to be Elders of the People and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers over them. And I will take of the Spirit that is upon thee and put it upon them, and they shall bear the burden of the People with thee,</hi> vers. 25.
<hi>And the Lord took of the Spirit that was on</hi> Moses <hi>and gave it unto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Elders, and the Spirit rested on them.</hi> That which these Elders were called unto, was a share in the Supream Rule and Government of the People, which was before intirely in the hand of <hi>Moses.</hi> This the occasion of their Call declares, <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. and they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>inferior Officers</hi> before; such as they had in <hi>Egypt</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced the People by their Counsel and <hi>Arbritration,</hi> Exod. 3. 16. Chap. 5. 6. Chap. 24. 1, 9. Now they had a Supream Power in Judgment committed to them, and were thence called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Gods.</hi> For these were they unto whom the <hi>Word of God came</hi> who were thence called Gods, <hi>John 10. 34, 35. Psal.</hi> 82. 6. and not the <hi>Prophets</hi> who had neither Power nor Rule. And on them the Spirit of God that was in <hi>Moses</hi> rested; that is, wrought the <hi>same Abilities</hi> for Government in them as he had received. That is, <hi>Wisdom, Righteousness, Diligence, Courage</hi> and the like; that they might judge the People wisely, and look to the Execution of the Law impartially. Now when the Spirit of God thus <hi>rested</hi> on them, it is said they <hi>Prophesied and ceased not,</hi> v. 25, 26. That is, they <hi>sang</hi> or spake forth the <hi>Praises of God</hi> in such a way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as made it evident unto all that they were <hi>extraordinarily acted</hi> by the Holy Ghost. So is that Word used 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 10. and elsewhere.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48389:67"/> But this <hi>Gift</hi> and <hi>Work of Prophesie</hi> was not the especial End for which they were endowed by the Spirit, for they were now called as hath been declared unto <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi> But because their <hi>Authority</hi> and
<hi>Rule</hi> was <hi>new</hi> among the People, God gave that visible Sign and Pledg of his calling them to their Office, that they might have a <hi>due Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their Persons and acquiesce in their Authority. And hence from the Ambiguity of that word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which we render and <hi>ceased not,</hi> they <hi>Prophesied and ceased not,</hi> vers. 25. which may signifie to <hi>add</hi> as well as to <hi>cease;</hi> many of the Jews affirm that they <hi>so prophesied no more</hi> but that day only; they prophesied then and <hi>added not,</hi> that is, to do so any more. So when God would erect a <hi>Kingdom</hi> amongst them, which was a new kind of Government unto them, and designed <hi>Saul</hi> to be the Person that should Reign, it is said that he <hi>gave him another heart;</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 9. that is, the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> came upon him as it is elsewhere expressed to endow him with that Wisdom and Magnanimity that might make him meet for Kingly Rule. And because he was new called from a <hi>Low Condition</hi> unto <hi>Royal Dignity;</hi> the Communication of the Spirit of God unto him was accompanied with a <hi>Visible sign</hi> and <hi>Token,</hi> that the People might acquiesce in his Government who were ready to despise his Person. For he had also an extraordinary <hi>Afflatus</hi> of the Spirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing it self in a <hi>Visible Rapture,</hi> vers. 10, 11. And in like manner he dealt with others. For this cause also he instituted the Ceremony of <hi>Anointing</hi> at their Inauguration; for it was a Token of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the <hi>Gifts of the Holy Ghost</hi> unto them; though respect were had therein to Jesus Christ who was to be <hi>anointed with all his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> of whom they were <hi>Types</hi> unto that People. Now these Gifts for Government are <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Abilities of the Minds of Men, such as are Prudence, Righteousness, Courage, Zeal, Clemency and the like. And when the Holy Ghost fell upon any Persons to enable them for <hi>Political</hi> Rule and the Administration of Civil Power, he did not Communicate Gifts and <hi>Abilities</hi> unto them quite of another kind, but only gave them an extraordinary <hi>improvement</hi> of their own ordinary Abilities. And indeed so great is the <hi>Burden</hi> wherewith a just and useful Government is attended, so great and many are the <hi>Temptations</hi> which Power and a Confluence of Earthly Things will invite and draw towards them, that without some <hi>especial Assistance</hi> of the Holy Spirit of God, Men cannot chuse but either <hi>sink</hi> under the weight of it, or wretchedly miscarry in its Exercise and Management. This made <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> when God in the beginning of his Reign, gave him his <hi>option</hi> of all earthly desirable things, to prefer <hi>Wisdom</hi> and Knowledg for Rule before them all, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 10, 11, 12. And this he received from him who is the <hi>Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding,</hi> Isa. 11. 3. And if the <hi>Rulers of the Earth</hi> would follow this Example, and be earnest with God for such supplies of his Spirit as might enable them unto an Holy Righteous discharge of their Office, it would in many places be better with <hi>them</hi> and <hi>the World,</hi> than it is or can be where is the state of things described, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 3, 4, 5. Now God of old did carry this Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>out of the Pale of the Church</hi> for the effecting of some especial Ends of his own; and I no way question but that he continueth still so to do. Thus he anointed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and calls him his <hi>Anointed</hi> accordingly,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48389:68"/>
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 1. For <hi>Cyrus</hi> had a double Work to do for God in both parts whereof he stood in need of his especial Assistance. He was to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Judgements and Vengeance on <hi>Babylon,</hi> as also to deliver his People that they might re-edifie the Temple. For both these he stood in need and did receive <hi>especial Aid from the Spirit of God,</hi> though he was in himself but a <hi>ravenous Bird of prey,</hi> Isa. 46. 11. For the Gifts of this Holy One in this kind wrought no real Holiness in them on whom they were bestowed; they were only given them for the <hi>good</hi> and benefit of others, with their own <hi>success</hi> in what they attempted unto that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Yea, and many on whom they are bestowed never consider the
<hi>Author</hi> of them, but sacrifice to their <hi>own Nets</hi> and Drags, and look on themselves as the Springs of their own Wisdom and Ability. But it is no wonder that all regard unto the <hi>Gifts of the Holy Ghost</hi> in the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World</hi> is despised, when his whole Work in and towards the
<hi>Church</hi> it self is openly derided.</p>

So He came upon <hi>Gideon</hi> and upon <hi>Jeptha</hi> to anoint them unto the Work of delivering the People from their Adversaries in Battel, <hi>Judg. 6. 34. Chap.</hi> 11. 29. It is said before of them both, That they were <hi>Men of Valour,</hi> Chap. 6. 12. Chap. 11. 1. This coming therefore of the Spirit of God upon them and <hi>cloathing</hi> of them, was his especial Excitation of their <hi>Courage,</hi> and his fortifying of their Minds against those Dangers they were to conflict withal. And this he did by such an <hi>efficacious impression</hi> of his Power upon them, as that both themselves received thereby a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their Call, and others might discern the presence of God with them. Hence it is said that the <hi>Spirit of the Lord cloathed</hi> them, they being warmed in themselves, and known to others by his Gifts and Actings of them.</p>

Chap. 15. 14. or wrought pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully in him. And he gave him this strength in the way of an <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> appointing the <hi>growing of his Hair</hi> to be the Sign and Pledg of it; the Care whereof being violated by him, he lost for a season the Gift it self.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>25</label> Fourthly; He also communicated <hi>Gifts intellectual</hi> to be exercised in and about things <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Artificial.</hi> So he endowed <hi>Bezaliel and Aholiab with Wisdom and Skill</hi> in all manner of curious Workmanship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all sorts of things for the building and beautifying of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 2, 3. Whether <hi>Bezaliel</hi> were a Man that had before given himself unto the <hi>Acquisition</hi> of those Arts and Sciences is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48389:68"/> uncertain. But certain it is that his present Endowments were <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</hi> The Spirit of God heightned improved and strengthned the <hi>Natural Faculties</hi> of his Mind, to a Perception and Understanding of all the <hi>curious Works</hi> mentioned in that place, and unto a skill how to contrive and dispose of them into their Order deigned by God himself. And therefore although the <hi>skill and wisdom</hi> mentioned differed not in the <hi>kind</hi> of it from that which others attained by industry; yet he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it by an immediate <hi>Afflatus</hi> or Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, as to that <hi>degree</hi> at least, which he was made Partaker of.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>28</label> And thus I have briefly passed through the <hi>Dispensation of the Spirit of God under the Old Testament.</hi> Nor have I aimed therein to gather up his whole Work and all his Actings; for then every thing that is
<hi>praise-worthy</hi> in the Church must have been enquired into; For all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him is Death and Darkness and Sin. All Life Light and Power are from him alone. And the instances of things expresly assigned unto him which we have insisted on, are sufficient to manifest that the whole
<hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Welfare</hi> of the Church <hi>depended</hi> solely on his Will and his Operation. And this will yet be more evident when we have also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered those other Effects and Operations of his, which being <hi>common to both States</hi> of the Church under the Old Testament and the New, are purposely here omitted, because the Nature of them is more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared in the Gospel wherein also their Exemplifications are more illustrious. From him therefore was the <hi>Word of Promise</hi> and the <hi>Gift of Prophesie</hi> whereon the Church was founded and whereby it was built. From him was the <hi>Revelation and Institution</hi> of all the Ordinances of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Whorship; from him was that <hi>Communication</hi> of Gifts and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Abilities which any Persons received for the Edification, Rule, Protection, and Deliverance of the Church. All these things were wrought by that <hi>one</hi> and <hi>self-same Spirit,</hi> which divideth to every Man severally as he will. And if this were the state of things under the
<hi>Old Testament,</hi> a Judgment may thence be made how it is under the <hi>New.</hi> The principal Advantage of the present State above that which is past next unto the coming of Christ in the Flesh, consists in the <hi>pouring out of the Holy</hi> upon the Disciples of Christ in a larger manner than formerly. And yet I know not how it is come to pass that some Men think that neither <hi>He</hi> nor his Work are of any great use unto us. And whereas we find every thing that is <hi>good</hi> even under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> assigned unto him as the sole immediate Author of it, it is hard to perswade with many that he continues now to do almost
<hi>any good</hi> at all. And what he is allowed to have any hand in, it is sure
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48389:69"/> to be so stated, as that the principal praise of it may redound unto our selves; So diverse, yea so <hi>adverse</hi> are the thoughts of God and Men in these things, where our Thoughts are not captivated unto the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith. But we must shut up this Discourse. It is a common saying among the <hi>Jewish Masters,</hi> That the Gift of the Holy Ghost ceased under the <hi>second Temple</hi> or after the finishing of it. Their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must be, that it did so as to the <hi>Gifts of Ministerial Prophesie,</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> and of <hi>Writing</hi> the Mind of God by Inspiration for the Use of the Church; Otherwise there is no Truth in their Observation. For there were afterwards <hi>especial Revelations</hi> of the Holy Ghost granted unto many as unto <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> Luke 1. And others constantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of his Gifts and Graces to enable them unto Obedience, and fit them for their Employments. For without a continuance of these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Church it self must absolutely cease.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> VVE are now arrived at that part of our Work which was principally intended in the Whole; and that because our Faith and Obedience is principally therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. This is the Dispensation and Work of the Holy Ghost with respect to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or the <hi>New Creation</hi> of all things in and by Jesus Christ. And this if any thing in the Scripture is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our most diligent Enquiry and Meditation; nor is there any more important <hi>Principle</hi> and Head of that Religion which we do profess. The Doctrine of <hi>Being</hi> and Unity of the Divine Nature is common to us with the rest of Mankind, and hath been so from the Foundation of the World; however some like <hi>bruit Beasts</hi> have herein also corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves. The Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> or the Subsistence of three Persons in the one Divine Nature or Being, was known to all who enjoyed <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> even under the Old Testament, though to us it be manifested with more Light and convincing Evidence. The <hi>Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Son of God</hi> was promised and expected from the first entrance of Sin, and received its actual Accomplishment in the <hi>fulness of Time,</hi> during the continuance of the <hi>Mosaical Paedagogie.</hi> But this Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> whereof we now proceed to treat, is so peculiar unto the <hi>New Testament,</hi> that the <hi>Evangelist</hi> speaking of it sayes, <hi>The Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified,</hi> Joh. 7. 39. And they who were instructed in the Doctrine of <hi>John the Bapist</hi> only, knew not whether there <hi>were any Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 19. 2. Both which saying concerned his <hi>Dispensation</hi> under the New Testament; for his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48389:70"/> eternal <hi>Being and Existence</hi> they were not ignorant of, nor did he then first begin to <hi>be</hi> as we have fully manifested in our foregoing Discourse. To stir us up therefore unto <hi>diligence</hi> in this Enquiry unto what was in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral laid down before, I shall add some Considerations evidencing the
<hi>Greatness</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> of this Duty, and then proceed to the Matter it self that we have proposed to handle and explain.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> 1. The <hi>plentiful Effusion of the Spirit</hi> is that which was principally prophesied of, and foretold as the great Priviledg and Pre-eminence of the Gospel-Church State; This was that <hi>good Wine</hi> which was kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the last; This all Prophets bear witness unto, see <hi>Isa. 35. 7. Chap. 44. 3. Joel. 2. 28. Ezek. 11. 19. Chap.</hi> 36. 27. with other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces innumerable. The great Promise of the Old Testament was that concerning the coming of <hi>Christ in the Flesh.</hi> But he was so to come as to put an end unto that whole Church-State, wherein his coming was expected. To prove this was the principal Design of the Apostle in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> But this <hi>Promise of the Spirit</hi> whose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment was reserved for the Times of the Gospel, was to be the Foundation of <hi>another Church-State</hi> and the means of its Continuance. If therefore we have any interest in the <hi>Gospel it self</hi> or desire to have; if we have either Part or Lot in this Matter, or desire to be made Partakers of the Benefits which attend thereon, which are no less than our Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with God here and our Salvation hereafter; it is our Duty to
<hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> and enquire diligently into these things. And let no Man deceive us with vain words, as though the things spoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> and his Work towards them that do believe, are <hi>fanatical</hi> and <hi>unintelligible</hi> by rational Men, for because of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of him the Wrath of God will come on the Children of Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And if the <hi>World in Wisdom</hi> and their <hi>Reason</hi> know him not, nor
<hi>can receive him,</hi> yet they who believe do know him, for <hi>he dwelleth with them and shall be in them,</hi> John 14. 17. And the present <hi>practice of the World</hi> in despising and sleighting the Spirit of God and his Work, gives Light and Evidence unto those words of our Saviour, <hi>that the World cannot receive him.</hi> And it cannot do so because it neither <hi>seeth him nor knoweth him,</hi> or hath no Experience of his Work in them or of his Power and Grace. Accordingly doth it, is it come to pass. Wherefore not to avow the Spirit of God in his Work, is to be <hi>ashamed of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> and of the Promise of Christ, as if it were a thing not to be owned in the World.</p>

The <hi>Ministry of the Gospel</hi> whereby we are begotten again that we should be a kind of first Fruits of his Creatures unto God, is from his promised Presence with it and Work in it, called the <hi>Ministry of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> even of the Spirit that giveth Life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. And it is so in opposition to the <hi>ministration of the Law,</hi> wherein yet there were a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Ordinances of Worship and Glorious Ceremonies. And he who knows no more of the <hi>Ministry of the Gospel</hi> but what consists in an attendance unto the <hi>Letter of Institutions,</hi> and the manner of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, knows nothing of it. Nor yet is there any <hi>extraordinary Affla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> or Inspiration now intended or attended unto, as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we pretend. But there is that <hi>present
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48389:70"/> of the Spirit of God</hi> with the <hi>Ministry of the Gospel,</hi> in his Authority, Assistance, Communication of Gifts and Abilities, Guidance and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as without which it will be useless and unprofitable in and unto all that take the Work thereof upon them. This will be more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared afterwards. For;</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> 3. The Promise and <hi>Gift of the Spirit</hi> under the Gospel, is not made nor granted unto any <hi>peculiar sort of Persons</hi> only, but unto all Believers as their Conditions and Occasions do require. They are not therefore the especial Interest of a few but the common concern of all Christians. The <hi>Papists</hi> grant that this Promise is continued; but they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it to their <hi>Pope</hi> or their <hi>Councils,</hi> things no where mentioned in the Scripture, nor the Object of any one Gospel-Promise whatever. It is
<hi>all Believers</hi> in their Places and Stations, Churches in their <hi>Order,</hi> and Ministers in their <hi>Office,</hi> unto whom the Promise of him is made, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom it is accomplished as shall be shown. Others also grant the <hi>continuance</hi> of this Gift, but understand no more by it but an <hi>ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary blessing</hi> upon Mens rational endeavours, common and exposed unto all alike. This is no less than to overthrow his whole <hi>Work,</hi> to take his Sovereignty out of his Hand, and to deprive the Church of all especial Interest in the Promise of Christ concerning him. In this enquiry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we look after what at present belongs unto our selves, if so be we are Disciples of Christ and do expect the fulfilling of his Promises. For whatever Men may pretend, unto this day, if <hi>they have not the Spirit of Christ they are none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. For our Lord Jesus Christ hath promised him as a <hi>Comforter</hi> to abide with his Disciples <hi>for ever,</hi> Joh. 14. And by him it is that he is present with them and among them to the end of the World, <hi>Mat. 28. 20. Chap.</hi> 18. 20. That we speak no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as yet of his <hi>sanctifying Work,</hi> whereby we are enabled to believe and are made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that Holiness without which no Man shall see God. Wherefore without him all Religion is but a <hi>Body</hi> without a <hi>Soul,</hi> a Carcase with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an animating Spirit. It is true in the continuation of his Work he ceaseth from putting forth those <hi>extraordinary Effects</hi> of his Power which were needful for the laying the Foundation of the Church in the World. But the whole Work of his Grace according to the Promise of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is no less truly and really carried on at this day in and towards all the <hi>Elect of God,</hi> than it was on the day of <hi>Pentecost</hi> and onwards; and so is his communication of Gifts necessary for the edification of the Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12, 13. The owning therefore and avowing the Work of the Holy Ghost in the Hearts and on the Minds of Men, according to the Tenor of the Convenant of Grace, is the principal part of that <hi>Profession</hi> which at this day all Believers are called unto.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> 4. We are taught in an especial manner <hi>to pray</hi> that God would <hi>give his Holy Spirit</hi> unto us, that through his <hi>Aid and Assistance</hi> we may live unto God in that Holy Obedience which he requires at our hands, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 9, 10, 12, 13. Our Saviour enjoyning an <hi>importunity</hi> in our Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. and giving us encouragement that we shall succeed in our Requests, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. makes the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of them to be the
<hi>Holy Spirit; Your Heavenly Father shall give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> v. 13. Which in the other <hi>Evangelists is good things,</hi> Mat. 7. 11.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48389:71"/> because he is the Author of them all in us and to us; Nor doth God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow any good thing on us, but by his Spirit. Hence the Promise of bestowing the Spirit is accompanied with a Prescription of Duty unto us that we should <hi>ask</hi> him or pray for him; which is included in every Promise where his sending, giving, or bestowing is mentioned. He therefore is the <hi>great Subject Matter</hi> of all our Prayers. And that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Promise of our Blessed Saviour to <hi>send him</hi> as a <hi>Comforter</hi> to abide with us for ever, is a <hi>Directory</hi> for the Prayers of the Church in all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. Nor is there any Church in the World fallen under such a total Degeneracy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that in their <hi>Publick Offices</hi> there are Testimonies of their ancient Faith and Practice in praying for the coming of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto them, according to this Promise of Christ. And therefore our Apostle in all his most solemn Prayers for the Churches in his dayes makes this the chief Petition of them, That God would give unto them and increase in them the Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit, with the
<hi>Spirit</hi> himself for sundry especial Effects and Operations whereof they stood in need, <hi>Ephes. 1. 17. Chap. 3. 16. Col.</hi> 2. 2. And this is a full conviction of what importance the Consideration of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> and his <hi>Work</hi> is unto us. We must deal in this Matter with that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which the Truth instructs us unto, and therefore say, That he who prayeth not constantly and diligently for <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> that he may be made partaker of him for the Ends for which he is promised, is a <hi>Stranger from Christ</hi> and his Gospel. This we are to attend unto as that whereon our Eternal Happiness doth depend. God knows our State and Condition, and we may better learn our Wants from his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> of what we ought to pray for, than from our own Sense and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. For we are in the <hi>Dark</hi> unto our own Spiritual Concerns, through the Power of our Corruptions and Temptations, and <hi>know not what we should pray for as we ought,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. But our Heavenly Father knows perfectly what we stand in need of. And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be our present Apprehensions concerning our selves which are to be examined by the Word, our Prayers are to be regulated by what God hath enjoyned us to ask, and what he hath promised for to bestow.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> 5. What was before mentioned may here be called over again and farther improved, yea it is necessary that so it should be. This is the
<hi>solemn Promise</hi> of Jesus Christ when he was to leave this World by Death. And whereas he therein made and confirmed his Testament,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17, He <hi>bequeathed his Spirit</hi> as his great Legacy unto his Disciples. And this he gave unto them as the great Pledg of their future Inheritance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. which they were to live upon in this World. All other good things he hath indeed <hi>bequeathed</hi> unto Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as he speaks of Peace with God in particular. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you,</hi> John 14. 27. But he gives particular Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Mercies for particular Ends and Purposes. The Holy Spirit he
<hi>bequeaths</hi> to supply his own Absence, <hi>John</hi> 16. 17. that is, for all the Ends of Spiritual and Eternal Life. Let us therefore consider this Gift of the Spirit either <hi>formally,</hi> under this Notion that he was the principal
<hi>Legaoy</hi> left unto the Church by our dying Saviour, or <hi>materially,</hi> as to the Ends and Purposes for which he is so <hi>bequeathed,</hi> and it will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent what valuation we ought to have of Him and his Work. How
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48389:71"/> would some rejoice if they could possess any <hi>Relique</hi> of any thing that belonged unto our Saviour in the dayes of his Flesh, though of no use or benefit unto them? Yea, how great a part of Men called Christians do boast in some <hi>pretended Parcels</hi> of the Tree whereon he suffered. <hi>Love</hi> abused by Superstition lies at the bottom of this Vanity. For they would embrace any thing left them by their dying Saviour. But he left them no such things, nor did ever bless and Sanctify them unto any holy or
<hi>Sacred</hi> Ends. And therefore hath the abuse of them been punished with blindness and Idolatry. But this is openly testified unto in the Gospel then when his Heart was overflowing with <hi>Love</hi> unto his Disciples, and Care for them, when he took an Holy <hi>Prospect</hi> of what would be their Condition, their Work, Duty, and Temptations in the World, and thereon made Provision of all that they could stand in need of; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to leave and give unto them his Holy Spirit to abide with them for ever, directing us to look unto Him for all our Comforts and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. According therefore unto our valuation and esteem of Him, of our <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and Acquiescency in Him, is our regard to the <hi>Love,</hi> Care and Wisdom of our Blessed Saviour to be measured. And indeed it is only in his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> wherein we can either honour or despise him in this World. In his own Person he is exalted at the Right Hand of God far above all Principalities and Powers; So that nothing of <hi>ours</hi> can immediately reach him or affect him. But it is in our regard to these that he makes a <hi>Tryal</hi> of our Faith Love and Obedience. And it is a matter of Lamentation to consider the contempt and <hi>scorn</hi> that on vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretences is cast upon this Holy Spirit, and the Work whereunto he is sent by God the Father and by Jesus Christ. For there is included there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a contempt of them also. Nor will a pretence of <hi>honouring God in their own way</hi> secure such Persons as shall contract the guilt of this Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. For it is an <hi>Idol</hi> and not the God and Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, who doth not work effectually in the Elect by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> according to the Scriptures. And (2.) if we consider this Promise of the Spirit to be given unto us as to the <hi>Ends</hi> of it; Then,</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">

He is promised and given as the <hi>sole Cause and Author of all the Good</hi> that in this<note n="*" place="margin">Gratias ago tibi elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissime Deus, quia quod quaesivi mane prior ipse do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasti. <hi>Cypri.</hi> de Baptism.

For (1.) there is no good communicated unto us from God, but it is bestowed on us or wrought in us by the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> No Gift, no Grace, no Mercy, no Priviledg, no Consolation, do we receive possess or use, but it is wrought in us. <hi>collated on us,</hi> or manifested unto us by him alone. Nor (2.) is there any <hi>good in us</hi> towards God, any Faith, Love, Duty, Obedience, but what is effectually wrought in us by <hi>Him,</hi> by him alone. <hi>For in us that is in our flesh</hi> (and by Nature we are but flesh) <hi>there dwelleth no good thing.</hi> All these things are from him and by him, as shall God assisting be made to appear by Instances of all sorts in our ensuing Discourse. And these Considerations I thought meet to premise unto our <hi>Entrance</hi> into that Work which now lyeth before us.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> The great Work whereby God designed to glorifie himself ultimately in this World, was that of the <hi>New Creation</hi> or of the Recovery and Restauration of all things by Jesus Christ, <hi>Heb. 1. 1, 2, 3. Ephes.</hi> 1. 10. And as this is in general confessed by all Christians, so I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48389:72"/> insisted on the Demonstration of it. (2.) That which God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth and designeth as the principal means for the manifestation of his Glory, must contain the most perfect and absolute <hi>Revelation</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Himself, his Nature, his Being, his Existence and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies. For from their discovery and manifestation, with the Duties which as known they require from rational Creatures, doth the <hi>Glory</hi> of God arise and no otherwise. (3.) This therefore was to be done in this great Work, and it was done accordingly. Hence is the Lord Christ in his Work of Mediation said to be the <hi>Image of the Invisible God,</hi> Col. 1. 15. The <hi>brightness of his Glory, and the express Image of his Person,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. in whose <hi>Face the Knowledg of the Glory of God shineth forth</hi> unto us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. Because in and by him in his Work of the New Creation all the glorious Properties of the Nature of God are manifested and displayed incomparably above what they were in the Creation of all things in the beginning. I say therefore in the Contrivance, Projection, Production, carrying on, disposal and accomplishment of this <hi>great Work,</hi> God hath made the most eminent and glorious Discovery of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto <hi>Angels</hi> and Men, <hi>Ephes. 3. 8, 9, 10. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11, 12. That we may Know, Love, Trust, Honour and Obey him in all things as God and according to his Will. (4.) In particular in this <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> he hath revealed himself in an especial manner as <hi>Three in One.</hi> There was no one more glorious Mystery brought to Light in and by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ than that of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> or the Subsistence of the Three Persons in the Unity of the same Divine Nature. And this was done not so much in <hi>express Propositions</hi> or verbal Testimonies unto that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, which yet is done also, as by the Declaration of the <hi>mutual Divine Internal Acts</hi> of the Persons towards one another, and the distinct imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Divine external Actings of each Person in the Work which they did and do perform. For God revealeth not himself unto us meerly <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally</hi> and <hi>Dogmatically,</hi> but by the <hi>Declaration</hi> of what he doth for us, in us, towards us, in the accomplishment of the Counsel of his Will; see <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. And this Revelation is made unto us, not that our minds might be possessed with the <hi>Notions</hi> of it, but that we may know aright how to place our <hi>Trust</hi> in Him, how to
<hi>Obey</hi> him and Live unto him, how to obtain and exercise Communion with him, until we come to the enjoyment of him.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> We may make <hi>Application</hi> of these things unto, and exemplifie them yet farther in the Work under Consideration. Three things in general are in it proposed unto our Faith. (1.) The <hi>Supream Purpose</hi> Design Contrivance and Disposal of it. (2.) The <hi>Purchasing</hi> and Procuring Cause and Means of the Effects of that Design; with its Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>in it Self</hi> and with respect unto God. (3.) The <hi>Application</hi> of the Supream Design and actual Accomplishment of it to make it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al unto us. The first of these is absolutely in the Scripture assigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Father,</hi> and that <hi>Uniformely</hi> and every where. His Will, His Counsel, His Love, His Grace, His Authority, His Purpose, His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign are constantly proposed as the Foundation of the whole Work, as those which were to be pursued, effected, accomplished; see <hi>Isa 42. 1, 2, 3. Psal. 40. 6, 7, 8. John 3. 16. Isa. 53. 10, 11, 12. Ephes.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. and other places innumerable. And on this Account, because the Son
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48389:72"/> undertook to <hi>effect</hi> what-ever the Father had so <hi>designed</hi> and purposed, there were many Acts of the Will of the Father towards the Son in
<hi>sending, giving, appointing</hi> of Him, in preparing him a Body, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting and Supporting Him, in rewarding and giving a People unto Him which belong unto the <hi>Father</hi> on the account of the Authority, Love and Wisdom that were in them, their <hi>actual Operation</hi> belonging particularly unto another Person. And in these things is the <hi>Person of the Father</hi> in the Divine Being proposed unto us to be known and adored. Secondly; The <hi>Son</hi> condescendeth, consenteth, and engageth to do and accomplish in his <hi>own Person,</hi> the whole Work which in the Authority, Counsel and Wisdom of the Father was appointed for him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7, 8. And in these Divine Operations is the <hi>Person of the Son</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us to be <hi>honoured even as we honour the Father.</hi> Thirdly, The
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> doth immediately Work and Effect what-ever was to be done in reference unto the <hi>Person of the Son,</hi> or the Sons of Men, for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and <hi>Accomplishment</hi> of the <hi>Father's Counsel,</hi> and the <hi>Son's Work,</hi> in an especial Application of both unto their especial Effects and Ends. Hereby is <hi>he made known unto us,</hi> and hereby our Faith concerning him and in him is directed. And thus in this great Work of the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jesus Christ doth God cause <hi>all his Glory</hi> to pass before us, that we may both <hi>know him</hi> and worship him in a due manner. And what is the peculiar Work of the <hi>Holy Ghost herein</hi> we shall now declare.</p>

<hi>without the Concurrence</hi> of the others. And the Reason of it is, because the <hi>Nature of God</hi> which is the Principle of all Divine Operations, is one
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48389:74"/> and the same individed in them all. Whereas therefore they are the Effects of <hi>Divine Power,</hi> and that Power is essentially the same in each Person, the Works themselves belong equally unto them. As if it were possible that <hi>Three Men</hi> might see by the <hi>same Eye,</hi> the Act of seeing would be but One, and it would be equally the Act of all Three. But the Things we insist on are ascribed <hi>eminently</hi> unto the Holy Ghost on the account of the Order of his Subsistence in the Holy Trinity, as he is the Spirit of the Father and the Son; whence in every Divine Act, the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Father, the <hi>Love</hi> and Wisdom of the Son, with the immediate <hi>Efficacy</hi> and Power of the Holy Ghost are to be considered. Yea, and there is such a distinction in their Operations, that one <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Act</hi> may produce a peculiar <hi>Respect and Relation</hi> unto one Person and not unto another; as the Assumption of the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> did to the Son, for he only was <hi>incarnate.</hi> And such are the especial <hi>Actings</hi> of the Holy Ghost towards the <hi>Head of the Church</hi> our Lord Jesus Christ in this Work of the New Creation, as we shall demonstrate in sundry Instances.</p>

                  <hi>Womb of the Blessed Virgin,</hi> was the peculiar and especial Work of the Holy Ghost. This Work I acknowledg in respect of
<hi>Designation</hi> and the Authoritative Disposal of things is ascribed unto the Father. For so the Lord Christ speaketh unto him; <hi>A Body hast thou prepared me,</hi> Heb. 10. 6. But this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> doth not signifie the <hi>actual forming</hi> and making ready of that Body, but the Eternal Designation of it; It was prepared in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and Love of the Father. As to <hi>voluntary Assumption</hi> it is ascribed to the Son himself; Heb. 2. 14. <hi>Forasmuch as the Children were Partakers of Flesh and Blood, he also himself pertook of the same;</hi> he took unto him a Body and Soul, entire Humane Nature, as the Children or all Believers have the same,
<hi>Synecdochically</hi> expressed by Flesh and Blood; v. 16. <hi>He took on him the Seed of</hi> Abraham. But the immediate Divine <hi>Efficiency</hi> in this Matter was the Peculiar Work of the Holy Ghost. Matth. 1. 18. <hi>When his Mother</hi> Mary <hi>was espoused to</hi> Joseph, <hi>before they came together she was found to be with Child of the Holy Ghost;</hi> v. 20. <hi>That which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost:</hi> Luk. 1. 35. <hi>The Angel answered and said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon Thee, and the Power of the Highest shall overshadow Thee; therefore also that Holy Thing which shall be born of Thee shall be called the Son of God.</hi> (1.) The Person working is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost. He is the wonderful <hi>Operator</hi> in this Glorious Work; and therein the <hi>Power of the most High</hi> was exerted. For the <hi>Power of the most High</hi> is neither explicatory of the former expression, the Holy Ghost, as though he were only the Power of the most High; nor is it the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning of a <hi>Distinct Agent</hi> or Cause unto him, as though the Holy Ghost and the Power of the most High were different <hi>Agents</hi> in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Only the manner of his effecting this wonderful Matter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the Blessed Virgin had made that enquiry, v. 34. <hi>How can
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48389:75"/> this be seeing I know not a Man?</hi> is expressed. The Holy Ghost, saith the Angel, acting <hi>the Power of the most High,</hi> or in the Infinite Power of God shall accomplish it. (2.) For his <hi>access</hi> unto his Work; it is expressed by his <hi>coming</hi> upon her. The importance of this Expression and what is signified thereby, hath been declared before. And it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten used to declare his <hi>Actings</hi> with reference unto the Production of
<hi>Miraculous</hi> Works. <hi>Acts 1. 8. Ye shall receive Power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you.</hi> He will so <hi>come upon you</hi> as to put forth the Power of the most High in you and by you, in Gifts and Operations miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. For he is said to <hi>come</hi> with respect unto his <hi>beginning</hi> of any mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous Operation, where before he did not work to the like purpose. (3.) The Act of the Holy Ghost in this Matter was a <hi>Creating Act;</hi> not indeed like the first <hi>Creating Act</hi> which produced the Matter and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>all things</hi> out of <hi>nothing,</hi> causing that to be, which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither in Matter nor Form, nor passive Disposition; but like those subsequent <hi>Acts</hi> of Creation, whereby <hi>out of Matter</hi> before made and prepared, things were made <hi>that</hi> which before they were not, and which of themselves they had no <hi>active Disposition</hi> unto nor concurrence in. So Man was created or <hi>formed of the Dust of the Earth,</hi> and Woman of a <hi>Rib</hi> taken from Man. There was a previous Matter unto their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but such as gave no assistance, nor had any <hi>active Disposition</hi> to the Production of that particular kind of Creature whereinto they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Creating Power of God. Such was this <hi>Act</hi> of the Holy Ghost in <hi>forming the Body</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ. For although it was effected by an <hi>Act</hi> of Infinite Creating Power, yet it was formed or made of the <hi>Substance of the Blessed Virgin.</hi> That it should be so was absolutely necessary (1.) For the accomplishment of the <hi>Promises</hi> made unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be of their Seed and proceed from their Loyns. (2.) So was it also on the account of the first Original Promise, That the <hi>Seed of the Woman should break the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents Head.</hi> For the Word was to be <hi>made Flesh,</hi> John 1. 14. to be
<hi>made of a Woman,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. or made of the <hi>Seed of David</hi> according to the Flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. and take upon him the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2. 16. (3.) To confirm the Truth hereof is his <hi>Genealogie</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Flesh given us by two of the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> which were neither to the purpose nor true, if he were not made of the <hi>Substance or Flesh</hi> of the Blessed Virgin. (4.) Besides all our <hi>Cognation</hi> and <hi>Alliance</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whence he was meet to be our Saviour suffering in the <hi>same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> wherein we have sinned, do depend hereon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. For if he had not been made <hi>like us</hi> in all things sin only excepted, if he had not been Partaker of our Nature, there had been no Foundation for the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting</hi> that unto us which he did suffered and wrought, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. And hence these things are accounted unto us, and cannot be so unto <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> whose Nature he did not take upon him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. This therefore was the Work of the Holy Ghost in reference unto the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of Christ in the Womb of his Mother. By his Omnipotent Power he
<hi>formed it</hi> of the Substance of the Body of the Holy Virgin, that is as unto his Body. And hence sundry things do ensue.</p>

And yet in the Ancient Creed commonly called the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and generally received by all Christians as a Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Religion, it is said he <hi>was Conceived by the Holy Spirit,</hi> and only
<hi>Born of the Virgin Mary.</hi> An. The same Work is assigned to both as Causes of a different kind, unto the Holy Spirit as the <hi>active efficient Cause,</hi> who by his Almighty Power produced the Effect. And the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes managed by some of the Ancients about <hi>de Spiritu Sancto,</hi> and <hi>ex Spiritu Sancto,</hi> were altogether needless. For it is his Creating Efficiency that is intended. And his <hi>Conceiving</hi> is ascribed unto the Holy Virgin as the <hi>passive material Cause;</hi> for his Body was formed of her Substance as was before declared. And this Conception of Christ was after her
<hi>Solemn Espousals</hi> unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> and that for sundry Reasons. For (1.) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covering of her Marriage to him she was to receive a Protection of her <hi>Spotless Innocency.</hi> And besides (2.) God provided one that should take <hi>care of her</hi> and <hi>her Child</hi> in his infancy. And hereby (3.) also was our Blessed Saviour freed from the imputation of an <hi>illegitimate Birth;</hi> until by his own <hi>Miraculous Operations</hi> he should give Testimony unto his Miraculous Conception, concerning which before his Mother could not have been believed. (4.) That he might have one on whose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count his <hi>Genealogie</hi> might be recorded, to manifest the accomplishment of the Promise unto <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; <hi>David.</hi> For the Line of a <hi>Genealogie</hi> was not legally continued by the Mother only. Hence <hi>Matthew</hi> gives us his
<hi>Genealogie</hi> by <hi>Joseph,</hi> to whom his Mother was legally espoused; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Luke</hi> give us the true Natural Line of his Descent by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors of the Blessed Virgin, yet he nameth her not, only mentioning her Espousals, he begins with <hi>Heli</hi> who was her Father, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 23.

We have not only the Depravation of our Natures in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but the obliquity of our <hi>particular Constitutions</hi> to conflict withal. Hence it is that one is disposed to <hi>Passion</hi> Wrath and Anger, another to
<hi>Vanity</hi> and Lightness, a third of <hi>Sensuality</hi> and fleshly Pleasures, and so others to Sloth and Idleness. And although this Disposition so far as it is the Result of our <hi>especial Constitutions</hi> and Complexion is not sin in it self, yet it dwells at the next Door unto it, and as it is excited by the
<hi>Moral Pravity</hi> of our Natures, a continual occasion of it.

Being not begotten by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Generation,</hi> it derived no taint of <hi>Original Sin</hi> or Corruption from <hi>Adam,</hi> that being the only Way and Means of its Propagation. And being not in the Loyns of <hi>Adam morally</hi> before the Fall, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of his <hi>Incarnation</hi> being not given until afterwards, the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> could on no account be imputed unto him. All Sin was charged on him as our <hi>Mediator,</hi> and Surety of the Covenant; but on his own account he was obnoxious to no charge of Sin <hi>Original</hi> or <hi>Actual.</hi> His Nature therefore as miraculously created in the manner described, was absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>innocent, spotless,</hi> and free from sin, as was <hi>Adam</hi> in the day wherein he was Created. But this was not all; It was by the Holy Spirit posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48389:77"/> endowed with all Grace. And hereof it was afterwards only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of farther degrees as to actual Exercise, but not of any new kind of Grace. And this Work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> or the Original Infusion of all Grace into the Humane Nature of Christ, was the immediate Work of the Holy Spirit which was necessary unto him. For let the Natural Faculties of the Soul, the Mind Will and Affections be created <hi>pure</hi> innocent undefiled, as they cannot be otherwise immediately created of God, yet this is not enough to enable any rational Creature <hi>to live to God;</hi> much less was it all that was in Jesus Christ. There is moreover required hereunto <hi>supernatural</hi> Endowments of Grace, superadded unto the Natural Faculties of our Souls. If we live unto God there must be a principle of <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> in us as well of Life Natural. This was the Image of God in <hi>Adam,</hi> and was wrought in Christ by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3. And <hi>there shall come forth a Rod out of the Stem of</hi> Jesse, <hi>and a Branch shall grow out of his Roots. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of Counsel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledg and of the Fear of the Lord; and shall make him of quick Understanding in the Fear of the Lord.</hi> It is granted that the following Work of the Spirit in and upon the Lord Christ, in the execution of his Office as the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, is included in these words. But his first <hi>Sanctifying Work</hi> in the Womb is principally intended. For those Expressions, a <hi>Rod out of the Stem of</hi> Jesse, and a <hi>Branch out of his Roots,</hi> with respect whereunto the Spirit is said to be communicated unto him, do plainly regard his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation. And the <hi>Soul</hi> of Christ from the first moment of its Infusion was a Subject capable of a <hi>Fulness of Grace,</hi> as unto its <hi>habitual</hi> Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Inbeing, though the actual exercise of it was suspended for a while until the <hi>Organs</hi> of the Body were fitted for it. This therefore it received by this <hi>first Unction</hi> of the Spirit. Hence from his Conception he was <hi>Holy</hi> as well as <hi>harmless</hi> and <hi>undefiled,</hi> Heb. 7. 26. An <hi>Holy Thing,</hi> Luke 1. 35. radically filled with a Perfection of Grace and Wisdom; Inasmuch as the Father <hi>gave him not the Spirit by Measure,</hi> John 3. 34.

And Two Things are to be here diligently observed. (1.) That the Lord Christ as Man, did and was to exercise all Grace by the Rational Faculties and Powers of his Soul, his Understanding Will and Affections. For he acted Grace as <hi>a Man made of a Woman,</hi> made under the Law. His Divine Nature was not unto him in the place of a Soul, nor did <hi>immediately operate</hi> the things which he performed, as some of old vainly imagined. But being <hi>a perfect Man</hi> his Rational Soul was in him the immediate principle of all his Moral Operations, even as ours are in us. Now in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and Exercise of these Faculties and Powers of his Soul, he had and made a Progress after the manner of other Men. For
<hi>he was made like unto us in all things</hi> yet without sin. In <hi>their Encrease,</hi> Enlargement and Exercise there was required a <hi>Progression in Grace</hi> also. And this he had continually by the Holy Ghost. Luke

<hi>as such,</hi> as it is to be weary or hungry, and no <hi>vice</hi> or blameable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

And he applies these words unto himself with respect unto his Preaching of the Gospel, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. For this was that Office which he principally attended unto here in the World, as that whereby he instructed Men in the Nature and Use of his other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

Nor did he perform any Act of his

Hereunto was he fitted by this Unction of the Spirit.

<hi>full of the Holy Ghost.</hi> He was actually possessed of and furnished with all that <hi>fulness</hi> of Spiritual Gifts which were any way needful for him or useful unto him, or which Humane Nature is <hi>capable</hi> of receiving.

                  </gap>, John 3. 34. <hi>For God giveth not the Spirit by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi> That it is the Lord Jesus Christ who is here intended unto whom the Spirit is thus given, is evident from the <hi>Context,</hi> although it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press in the <hi>Text.</hi> He is spoken of, and is the Subject of the whole Discourse, <hi>v. 31. He that cometh from Above is above all. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from Heaven is above all.</hi> None doubts but that this is a Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Person of Christ. And in the beginning of this Verse, <hi>He whom God hath sent speaketh the Words of God;</hi> which is the usual <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasis</hi> of the Lord Christ used at least twenty times in this Gospel. Of him this account is given that he <hi>testifieth what he hath seen and heard,</hi> v. 32. and that he <hi>speaketh the Words of God,</hi> v. 3, 4. Different events are also marked upon his Testimony, for many refused it, <hi>v.</hi> 32. but some received it who therein set to <hi>their Seal that God is true,</hi> vers. 33. For he that <hi>believeth not the Record that he gave of his Son hath made him a lyar,</hi> 1 John 5. 1. As a Reason of all this it is added, That God
<hi>gave not the Spirit unto him by Measure;</hi> So that he was fully enabled to speak the Words of God, and those by whom his Testimony was reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were justly liable to Wrath, <hi>v.</hi> 36. Vain therefore is the attempt of <hi>Crellius de Spirit. Sanct.</hi> followed by <hi>Sclictingius</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> on this Place, who would exclude the Lord Christ from being intended in these words. For they would have them signifie no more but only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, That God is not bound up to <hi>Measures</hi> in the Dispensation of the Spirit, but gives to one according unto one measure, and to another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to another. But as this gloss overthrows the coherence of the words, disturbing the Context, so it contradicts the Text it self. For God's not giving the Spirit <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>by Measure,</hi> is his giving of him

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>immeasurably,</hi> without known Bounds or Limits, and so the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was given unto <hi>the Lord Christ</hi> only. For unto every one of us is
<hi>given Grace according to the Measure of the Gift of Christ,</hi> Ephes. 4. 7. That is, in what Measure he pleaseth to communicate and distribute it. But the Effects of this giving of the Spirit unto the Lord Christ <hi>not by Measure,</hi> belonged unto that <hi>fulness</hi> from whence we <hi>receive Grace for Grace,</hi> John 1. 16. For hereby the Father accomplished his Will, when <hi>it pleased him, that in him all fulness should dwell,</hi> Col. 1. 19. that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48389:79"/> he in all things might have the Pre-eminence. Nor can any Difficulty of weight be cast on this Interpretation from the use of the word in the
<hi>present Tense,</hi> which is by <hi>Crellius</hi> insisted on, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>he giveth.</hi> For Christ, they say, had before received the Spirit, for this is spoken of him after his Baptism. If therefore he had been intended, it should rather have been, he <hi>hath given,</hi> or he hath not given unto him by Measure. But (1.) this was <hi>immediately on his Baptism,</hi> and therefore the collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fulness of the Spirit might be spoken of as a thing present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but newly past, which is an ordinary kind of Speech on all occasions. Besides (2.) the <hi>collation of the Spirit</hi> is a <hi>continued Act,</hi> in that he was given him to abide with him, to rest upon him, wherein there was a continuance of the Love of God towards, and his care over him in his Work. Hence the Lord Christ saith of himself, or the Prophet in his Person, that the Spirit <hi>sent</hi> him. <hi>Now the Lord God and his Spirit hath sent me,</hi> Isa. 48. 16. The same Work in <hi>sending</hi> of Christ is ascribed unto the Lord God, that is the Father, and to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner. He was sent by the Father <hi>authoritatively,</hi> and the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he received by the Spirit, of Gifts for his Work and Office, is called his <hi>sending of him.</hi> As the same Work is assigned unto different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the <hi>Trinity</hi> on different accounts.</p>

Some few Instances on this Head may suffice. Presently after his <hi>Baptism</hi> when he was full of the Holy Ghost, he was <hi>led by the Spirit</hi> into the Wilderness, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 1. The Holy Spirit <hi>guided</hi> him to begin his Contest and Conquest with the Devil. Hereby he made an entrance into his Ministry; and it teacheth us all what we must look for, if we solemnly engage our selves to follow him in the Work of Preaching the Gospel. The word used in <hi>Mark</hi> to this purpose hath occasioned some doubt, <hi>what Spirit is</hi> intended in those words, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>to drive him,</hi> is not so easie to be apprehended. But the Word in <hi>Luke</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which denotes a <hi>guiding and rational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</hi> And this cannot be ascribed unto any <hi>other Spirit</hi> with respect unto our <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> but onely the Spirit of God. <hi>Matthew</hi> expresseth the same effect by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of that Spirit, namely which descended on him, and rested on him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 17. And the Continuation of the Discourse in <hi>Luke</hi> will not admit that any other Spirit be intended. And <hi>Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit, returned from</hi> Jordan <hi>and was led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the Wilderness;</hi> namely, by that Spirit which he was full of. By

                  </gap> therefore in <hi>Mark,</hi> no more is intended but the sending of him forth by an high and strong impression of the Holy Spirit on his Mind. Hence the same word is used with respect unto the <hi>sending</hi> of others by the powerful impression of the Spirit of God on their Hearts, unto the Work of Preaching the Gospel. Matth. 9. 38. <hi>Pray you therefore the Lord of the Harvest,</hi>

So did he enter upon his Preparation unto his Work under his Conduct. And it were well if others would endeavour after a conformity unto them within the <hi>Rules</hi> of their Calling. (2.) By his assistance was he carried triumphantly through the course of his <hi>Temptations</hi> unto a perfect Conquest of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, as to the present Conflict wherein he sought to divert him from his Work, which afterwards he endeavoured by all wayes and means to oppose and hinder. (3.) The <hi>Temptation</hi> being finished he returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain out of the Wilderness to Preach the Gospel <hi>in the Power of the Spirit,</hi> Luk. 4. 14.

The issue was, That they <hi>all bare him Witness, and wondred at the gracious Words that proceeded out of his Mouth,</hi> v. 22. And as he thus began his Ministry in the <hi>Power of the Spirit,</hi> so having received him not by measure, he continually on all occasions put forth his Wisdom, Power, Grace and Knowledg, to the astonishment of all, and the stopping of the Mouths of his Adversaries, shutting them up in their Rage and Unbelief. (4.) By him was he directed strengthned and comforted in his whole Course, in all his Temptations, Troubles and Sufferings from first to last. For we know that there was a <hi>confluence</hi> of all those upon him in his whole Way and Work, a great part of that whereunto he humbled himself for our sakes consisting in these things. In and under them he stood in need of mighty Supportment and strong Consolation. This God promised unto him and this he expected, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 7, 8. &amp; 42. 4, 6. &amp; 49. 5, 6, 7, 8.

I know many Learned Men do judge that by the <hi>Eternal Spirit</hi> in that place, not the <hi>Third Person</hi> is intended, but the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Son himself. And there is no doubt but that also may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called the <hi>Eternal Spirit.</hi> There is also a Reason in the words themselves strongly inclining unto that sense and acceptation of them. For the Apostle doth shew whence it was that the Sacrifices of the Lord Christ had an Efficacy beyond and above the Sacrifices of the Law; and whence it would certainly produce that great <hi>Effect of purging our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences from dead Works.</hi> And this was from the Dignity of his Person on the account of his Divine Nature. It arose I say from the Dignity of his Person, his Deity giving <hi>sustentation</hi> unto his Humane Nature in the Sacrifice of himself. For by reason of the indissoluble Union of both his Natures, his Person became the <hi>Principle</hi> of all his Mediatory Acts, and from thence had they their Dignity and Efficacy. Nor will I oppose this Exposition of the words. But on the other side many <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Persons,</hi> both of the Ancient and Modern Divines, do judg that it is the <hi>Person of the Holy Spirit</hi> that is intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> And because this is a Matter of great Importance, namely how the Lord Christ <hi>offered up himself</hi> unto God as a Sacrifice by the Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I shall farther explain it though but briefly. Those who look only on the <hi>outward part</hi> of the Death of Christ can see nothing but suffering in it. The <hi>Jews</hi> took him, and they with the Souldiers both <hi>scourged</hi> and <hi>slew him,</hi> hanging him on the Tree. But the principal Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, is his own <hi>offering himself</hi> a Sacrifice unto God as the great High Priest of the Church, to make Atonement and Reconciliation for Sinners, which was <hi>hid</hi> from the World by those outward <hi>Acts of Violence</hi> which were upon him. And this he did by the <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> wherein we may take notice of the ensuing Instances.</p>
               <p>1. He <hi>Sanctified,</hi> Consecrated or Dedicated himself unto God for to be an Offering or Sacrifice; John 17. 19. <hi>For their sakes,</hi> that is the Elect, <hi>I sanctifie my self.</hi> The Lord Christ was before this perfectly
<hi>sanctified</hi> as to all Inherent Holiness, so that he could not speak of <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himself</hi> afresh in that sense. Neither was it the Consecration of himself unto his Office of a Priest. For this was the Act of him who called him, <hi>He glorified not himself to be made an High Priest, but he that said unto Him, Thou art my Son,</hi> Heb. 5. 6. He made him a Priest by his Death, after the Power of an Endless Life, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 16, 20, 21. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he consecrated himself to be a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as the Beast to be Sacrificed of old was first devoted unto that purpose. Therefore it is said that he thus Sanctified or Consecrated himself, that we might be Sanctified. Now we are Sanctified by the Offering of the Body of Christ once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. This was his first Sacerdotal Acts. He dedicated himself to be an Offering to God. And this he did through the Effectual Operation of the <hi>Eternal Spirit</hi> in him.</p>
               <p>2. He went voluntarily and of his own accord to the <hi>Garden,</hi> which answered the <hi>Adduction</hi> or bringing of the Beast to be Sacrificed unto the Door of the Tabernacle according to the Law; for there he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give up himself into the hands of those who were to shed his Blood;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48389:81"/> but also actually entred upon the <hi>offering up</hi> of himself unto God in his
<hi>Agony,</hi> when he <hi>offered up Prayers and Supplications with strong Crying and Tears, Heb.</hi> 5. 7. which declares not the <hi>Matter</hi> but the <hi>Manner</hi> of his Offering.</p>
               <p>3. In all that ensued, all that followed hereon, unto his <hi>giving up the Ghost,</hi> he offered himself to God in and by those Actings of the Grace of the Holy Spirit in him, which accompanied him to the last. And these are diligently to be considered, because on them depends the <hi>Efficacy of</hi> the Death of Christ, as to Atonement and <hi>Merit,</hi> as they were enhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and rendred excellent by the Worth and Dignity of his Person. For it is not the Death of Christ meerly as it was <hi>penal</hi> and undergone by the way of <hi>Suffering,</hi> that is the Means of our Deliverance, but the
<hi>Obedience</hi> of Christ therein, which consisted in his offering of himself through the Eternal Spirit unto God, that gave efficacy and success unto it. We may therefore enquire what were those <hi>Principal Graces</hi> of the Spirit which he acted in this offering of himself unto God. And they were,</p>
               <p>(1.) Love to Man-kind, and Compassion towards Sinners. This the Holy Soul of the Lord Jesus was then in the highest and most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Exercise of. This therefore is frequently expressed where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of this Offering of Christ; Gal. 2. 20. <hi>Who loved me and gave himself for me;</hi> Rev. 1. 5. <hi>Who loved us and washed us in his own Blood.</hi> And <hi>Compassion</hi> is the first Grace required in an High Priest or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 2. God being now upon a Design of Love, (for it was in the pursuit of Eternal Love that Christ was sent into the World,
<hi>John 3. 16. Tit.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6.) This <hi>Love</hi> that was now in its most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Advancement in the Heart of Christ, was most grateful and acceptable unto him. And this Intenseness of Love did also support the Mind of Christ under all his Sufferings, as <hi>Jacob</hi> through the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Love unto <hi>Rachel,</hi> made light of the seven years Service that he endured for her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 20. And so did the Lord Christ <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Cross and despise the shame for the Joy</hi> of saving his Elect which was set before him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. And this was <hi>one Grace</hi> of the Eternal Spirit whereby he offered himself unto God.</p>
               <p>2. That which principally acted him in the Whole, was his <hi>unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Zeal,</hi> for and <hi>Ardency of Affection unto the Glory of God.</hi> These were the Coals which with a Vehement Flame as it were consumed the Sacrifice. And there were two things that he aimed at with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Glory of God. (1.) The <hi>manifestation of his Righteousness,</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Severity against Sin. His Design was to repair the Glory of God, wherein it had seemed to suffer by sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 6, 7, 8. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7. He came to do that with full desire of Soul, (expressed in those words, <hi>Lo I come</hi>) which Legal Sacrifices could not do, namely to make satisfaction to the Justice of God for sin, to be a <hi>propitiation</hi> to declare his Righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. And this he doth as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it with inexpressible <hi>Ardency of Zeal</hi> and Affections; v. 8. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy Will, O my God, yea thy Law is in the midst of my Bowels;</hi> he doubles the Expression of the Intenseness of his Mind hereon. And therefore when he was to prepare himself in his last Passeover for his Suffering, he expresseth the highest ingagement of <hi>Heart</hi> and Affections unto it; Luke 22. 15. <hi>With desire have I desired to eat this Passeover with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48389:81"/> you before I suffer.</hi> As with respect unto the same Work he had before exprest it. <hi>I have a Baptism to be Baptized withal, and how am I strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or pained, till it be accomplished?</hi> Luke 12. 50. His <hi>Zeal</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Glory of God in the manifestation of his Righteousness and Holiness, by the <hi>offering</hi> up himself as a Sin-Offering to make Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gave him no Rest and Ease until he was engaged in it, whence it wrought unto the utmost. (2.) The <hi>Exercise of his Grace and Love.</hi> This he knew was the way to open the Treasures of Grace and Love that they might be poured out on Sinners to the Everlasting Glory of God. For this was the <hi>Design</hi> of God in the whole, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25, 26. This Zeal and Affection unto the Glory of God's Righteousness, Faithfulness and Grace, which was wrought in the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> by the <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> was that wherein principally he offered up himself unto God.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>His Holy Submission and Obedience unto the Will of God,</hi> which were now in the height of their Exercise, and Grace advanced unto the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in them, was another especial part of this his Offering up himself. That this was wrought in him by the <hi>Holy</hi> or Eternal Spirit was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. And it is frequently expressed as that which had an especial Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into the Efficacy and Merit of his Sacrifice. Psal. 2. 8. <hi>He hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himself, and became Obedient unto Death, the Death of the Cross.</hi> And when he offered up Prayers and Supplications, <hi>though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things that he suffered, Heb.</hi> 5. 8. That is, he experienced Obedience in Suffering. It is true, that the Lord Christ in the whole course of his Life yeelded <hi>Obedience</hi> unto God, as he was
<hi>made of a Woman, made under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. But now he came to the great Tryal of it, with respect unto the especial command of the Father, <hi>to lay down his Life,</hi> and to make <hi>his Soul an Offering for sin,</hi> Isa. 53. 10. This was the highest <hi>Act of Obedience</hi> unto God that ever was or ever shall be to all Eternity. And therefore doth God so express his satisfaction therein and acceptance of it, <hi>Isa. 53. 11, 12. Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10. This was wrought in him, this he was wrought unto by the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and therefore by him offered himself unto God.</p>
               <p>4. There belongs also hereunto that <hi>Faith and Trust in God,</hi> which with fervent Prayers, Cries &amp; Supplications, he now acted on God and his Promises, both with respect unto himself, and to the Covenant which he was sealing with his Blood. This our Apostle represents as an especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Work of his testified unto in the Old Testament; <hi>Heb. 2. 13. I will put my trust in him.</hi> And this (1.) respected himself, namely that he should be supported, assisted, and carried through the Work he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken unto a blessed Issue. Herein I confess he was <hi>horribly</hi> assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted until he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Psal. 22. 1. But yet after and through all his dreadful Tryal, his Faith and Trust in God were <hi>Victorious.</hi> This he expressed in the Depth and Extremity of his Tryals, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 9, 10, 11. and made such an open Profession of it, that his Enemies when they supposed him lost and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, reproached him with it, <hi>v. 8. Matth.</hi> 27. 43. To this purpose be declared himself at large, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 7, 8, 9. So his <hi>Faith and Trust in God,</hi> as to his own supportment and deliverance, with the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Promises that were made unto him upon his ingagement into the Work of Mediation, were victorious. (2.) They respected the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> and all the Benefits that the Church of the Elect was to be made
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48389:82"/> Partaker of thereby. The <hi>Blood</hi> that he now shed was the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Covenant, and it was shed for his Church; namely, that the Blessings of the Covenant might be communicated unto them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13, 14. With respect hereunto did he also exercise <hi>Faith in God,</hi> as appears fully in his Prayer which he made when he entred on his Oblation, <hi>John</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Now concerning these Instances we may observe three Things to our present purpose.</p>
               <p>(1.) These and the like gracious Actings of the Soul of Christ, were the Wayes and Means whereby in his Death and Bloodshedding, which was violent and by force inflicted on him as to the outward Instruments, and was penal as to the Sentence of the Law, he <hi>voluntarily</hi> and <hi>freely</hi> offered up himself a Sacrifice unto God for to make Atonement. And these were the things which from the <hi>dignity of his Person</hi> became Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Victorious. Without these his Death and Bloodshedding had been no <hi>Oblation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) These were the things which rendred his Offering of himself, to be a <hi>Sacrifice of a sweet sm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lling Savour unto God,</hi> Ephes. 5. 2. God was so absolutely delighted and pleased with these high and glorious Acts of Grace and <hi>Obedience</hi> in Jesus Christ, that he <hi>smelt</hi> as it were a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Rest towards Mankind, or those for whom he offered himself; so that he would be angry with them no more, curse them no more: As it is said of the Type of it in the Sacrifice of <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 8. 20, 21. God was more pleased with the Obedience of Christ, than he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with the Sin and Disobedience of <hi>Adam,</hi> Rom. 5. 17, 18, 19. It was not then the outward suffering of a violent and bloody Death which was inflicted on him, by the most horrible wickedness that ever Humane Nature brake forth into, that God was atoned, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. Nor yet was it meerly his enduring the <hi>Penalty</hi> of the Law, that was the means of our Deliverance. But the <hi>voluntary</hi> giving up of himself to be a Sacrifice in these Holy Acts of Obedience, was that upon which in an especial manner God was reconciled unto us.</p>
               <p>All these things being wrought in the Humane Nature by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who in the time of his Offering acted all his Graces unto the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most; He is said thereon to <hi>offer himself unto God through the Eternal Spirit,</hi> by whom as our High Priest he was Consecrated, Spirited, and Acted thereunto.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> Eighthly; There was a peculiar Work of the Holy Spirit towards the Lord Christ whilst he was in the <hi>State of the Dead.</hi> For here our precedeing Rule must be remembred; namely, that notwithstanding the Union of the Humane Nature of Christ with the Divine in the Person of the Son, yet the Communications of God unto it, beyond Subsistence, were <hi>voluntary.</hi> Thus in his Death the Union of his Natures in his Person was not in the least impeached; but yet for his Soul or Spirit he recommends that in an especial manner into the <hi>Hands of God his Father,</hi> Psal. 31. 5. Luke 23. 46. <hi>Father into thy Hands I commend my Spirit;</hi> for the Father had ingaged himself in an Eternal Covenant, to take care of him, to preserve and protect him even in Death, and to shew him again the <hi>Way and Path of Life,</hi> Psal. 16. 11. Notwithstanding then the Union of his Person, his Soul in its separate State was in an especial
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48389:82"/> manner under the care protection and power of the <hi>Father,</hi> preserved in his Love until the Hour came wherein he <hi>shewed him again</hi> the Path of Life. His Holy Body in the <hi>Grave</hi> continued under the especial care of the Spirit of God, and hereby was accomplished that great Promise,
<hi>That his Soul should not be left in Hell, nor the Holy One see Corruption,</hi> Psal. 16. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 31. It is the Body of Christ which is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the Holy One;</hi> as it was made an <hi>holy Thing</hi> by the Conception of it in the Womb by the Power of the Holy Ghost. And it is here spoken of in contradistinction unto his Soul, and opposed by <hi>Peter</hi> unto the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of David,</hi> which when it died saw Corruption, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 29. This Pure and Holy Substance was preserved in its Integrity by the overshadowing Power of the Holy Spirit, without any of those Accidents of change which attend the dead Bodies of others. I deny not but there was use made of the Ministry of <hi>Angels</hi> about the dead Body of Christ whilst it was in the Grave; even those which were seen sitting afterwards in the place where he lay, <hi>John</hi> 20. 12. by these was it preserved from all outward Force and Violation; But this also was under the peculiar care of the Spirit of God, who how he worketh by Angels hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> Ninthly; There was a peculiar Work of the Holy Spirit in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> this being the compleating <hi>Act</hi> in laying the Foundation of the Church whereby Christ entred into his Rest, the great Testimony given unto the finishing of the Work of Redemption, with the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God therein, and his acceptation of the Person of the Redeemer. It is on various accounts assigned distinctly to <hi>each Person</hi> in the Trinity. And this not only as all the <hi>external Works</hi> of God are <hi>individed,</hi> each Person being equally concerned in their Operation, but also upon the account of their especial respect unto and interest in the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, in the manner before declared. Unto the Father it is ascribed on the account of his <hi>Authority,</hi> and the declaration therein of Christ's perfect accomplishment of the Work committed unto him; Acts 2. 24.
<hi>Him hath God raised up, having loosed the Pains of Death, because it was not possible that he should be holden of it;</hi> it is the Father who is spoken of. And he is said, as in other places, to raise Christ from the Dead; but this he doth with respect unto <hi>his loosing the Pains of Death,</hi>

                  </gap> are the <hi>Cords of Death,</hi> see <hi>Psal. 18. 4. Psal.</hi> 116. 3. And these <hi>Sorrows</hi> of Death here intended were the <hi>Cords</hi> of it, that is, the Power it had to bind the Lord Christ for a season under it. For the <hi>Pains of Death,</hi> that is the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, tormenting <hi>Pains,</hi> ended in his death it self. But the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of them are here reckoned unto them, or the continuance under the Power of Death according unto the Sentence of the Law. These God <hi>loosed</hi> when the Law being fully satisfied the Sentence of it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and the Lord Christ was acquitted from its whole Charge. This was the Act of God the Father, as the Supream Rector and Judg of all. Hence he is said <hi>to raise him from the Dead,</hi> as the Judg by his Order de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth an acquitted Prisoner, or one who hath answered the Law. The same Work he also takes unto himself; John 10. 17, 18. <hi>I lay down my
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48389:83"/> Life that I may take it again, no Man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my self, I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</hi> For although Men by violence took away his Life, <hi>when with wicked hands they crucified and slew him,</hi> Acts 2. 23. Chap. 3. 15; Yet because they had neither Authority nor Ability so to do without his own consent, he saith, <hi>No Man could or did take away his Life,</hi> that is, against his Will, by Power over him, as the lives of other Men are taken away; for this neither Angels nor Men could do. So also although the <hi>Father</hi> is said to raise him from the Dead by <hi>taking off the Sentence of the Law,</hi> which he had answered; yet he himself also <hi>took his Life again</hi> by an Act of the Love, Care, and Power of his Divine Nature; his living again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Act of his Person, although the Humane Nature only died. But the peculiar efficiency in the reuniting of his most Holy Soul and Body was an Effect of the Power of the Holy Spirit; 1 Pet. 3. 18. <hi>He was put to death in the Flesh, but quickned in the Spirit,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>he was restored to Life by the Spirit;</hi> and this was that Spirit whereby he preached unto them that were disobedient in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> v. 19, 20. or that Spirit of Christ which was in the Prophets from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11, 12. by which he preached in <hi>Noah</hi> unto that disobedient Generation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. whereby the Spirit of God strove for a season with those Inhabitants of the Old World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. that is the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God. To the same purpose we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by our Apostle; Rom. 8. 11. <hi>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the Dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the Dead shall also quicken your Mortal Bodies by his Spirit which dwelleth in you.</hi> God shall quicken our Mortal Bodies also, by the same Spirit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he raised Christ from the Dead. For so the Relation of the one Work to the other, requires the words to be understood. And he asserts again the same expresly, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19, 20. he prayes that God would give his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> unto them, as a Spirit of Wisdom and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
<hi>v.</hi> 17. The Effects thereof in them and upon them are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
<hi>v.</hi> 18. and this he desires that they may so be made Partakers of, that by the <hi>Work of the Spirit of God</hi> in themselves renewing and quickning of them, they might have an experience of that exceeding greatness of his Power, which he put forth in the Lord Christ when he
<hi>raised him from the Dead.</hi> And the Evidence or Testimony given unto his being the Son of God, by his Resurrection from the Dead, is said to be <hi>according to the Spirit of Holiness,</hi> or the Holy Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. He was <hi>positively declared</hi> to be the Son of God by his Resurrection from the Dead, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, by the <hi>powerful working of the Holy Spirit.</hi> This also is the intendment of that Expression, 1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>Justified in the Spirit.</hi> God was <hi>manifest in the Flesh</hi> by his Incarnation and Passion therein, and <hi>justified in the Spirit</hi> by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his acquitment from the Sentence of Death, and all the Evils which he underwent, with the Reproaches wherewith he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously used, by his Quickning and Resurrection from the Dead, through the mighty and effectual working of the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48389:83"/> believe on him. He who first made his Nature <hi>Holy,</hi> now made it <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> And as we are made conformable unto him in <hi>our Souls</hi> here, his Image being renewed in us by the Spirit, so he is in his Body now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Effectual Operation of the same Spirit, the <hi>Exemplar</hi> and Pattern of that Glory which in our Mortal Bodies we shall receive by the same Spirit. For <hi>when he appears we shall be like him,</hi> 1 John 3. 2. see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>he will change our vile Bodies, that they may be fashioned like unto his Glorious Body, according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself,</hi> Phil. 3. 21. And these are some of the <hi>principal Instances</hi> of the Operations of the Holy Spirit on the Humane Nature of the Head of the Church. The whole of them all, I confess, is a Work that we can look but <hi>little</hi> into, only what is plainly revealed we desire to receive and imbrace; considering that if we are his, we are <hi>predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to</hi> be <hi>made conformable</hi> in all things unto him, and that by the powerful and effectual Operation of that Spirit which thus wrought all things in him to the Glory of God. And as it is a matter of unspeakable
<hi>consolation</hi> unto us, to consider what hath been done in and upon our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the Application of the Love and Grace of God through his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> unto it; so it is of great Advantage, in that it directs our Faith and Supplications in our Endeavours after <hi>Conformity</hi> with him, which is our next End, under the enjoyment of God in Glory. What therefore in these Matters we apprehend we embrace; and for the depth of them they are the Object of our Admiration and Praise.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> Secondly; There is yet another Work of the Holy Spirit, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in and upon the Person of the Lord Christ, but <hi>towards him</hi> and on his behalf with respect unto his Work and Office. And it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizeth the Head and Fountain of the whole Office of the Holy Spirit
<hi>towards the Church.</hi> This was his <hi>witness-bearing</hi> unto the Lord Christ; namely, that he was the Son of God, the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> and that the Work which he performed in the World, was committed unto him by God the Father to accomplish. And this same Work he continueth to attend unto, unto this day, and will do so to the consummation of all things. It is known how the Lord Christ was reproached whilst he was in this World, and how <hi>ignominiously</hi> he was sent out of it by Death. Hereon a great contest ensued amongst mankind, wherein Heaven and Hell were deeply ingaged. The greatest part of the World, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Rulers, and Wise Men of it, affirmed that he was an <hi>Impostor,</hi> a Seducer, a Malefactor, justly punished for his Evil Deeds. He on the other side chose <hi>twelve Apostles</hi> to bear Testimony unto the Holiness of his Life, the Truth and Purity of his Doctrine, the Accomplishment of the Prophesies of the Old Testament in his Birth, Life, Work, and Death; and in especial unto his <hi>Resurrection from the Dead,</hi> whereby he was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified and acquitted from all the Reproaches of Hell and the World, and their Calumnies refelled. But what could the Testimony of <hi>twelve poor Men,</hi> though never so honest, prevail against the <hi>confronting Suffrage</hi> of the World? Wherefore this Work of <hi>bearing witness</hi> unto the Lord Christ, was committed unto <hi>him</hi> who is above and over all, who knoweth how, and is able to make his Testimony prevalent; John 15. 26. <hi>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testifie of me.</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:48389:84"/> Accordingly the Apostles plead his concurring Testimony; Acts 5. 32.
<hi>And we are his Witnesses of these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</hi> And how he thus gave <hi>his</hi> Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our Apostle declares, <hi>Heb. 2. 4. God also bearing witness with them,</hi> (that is, the Apostles) <hi>both with Signs and Wonders, and with divers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Gifts of the Holy Spirit according to his Will.</hi> The first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal End why God gave the Holy Spirit to work all those miraculous Effects in them that believed in <hi>Jesus,</hi> was to <hi>bear witness</hi> unto his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that he was indeed the Son of God, owned and exalted by him. For no Man not utterly forsaken of all Reason and Understanding, not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly blinded, would once imagine that the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God would work such marvelous Operations in and by them who believed on him, if he designed not to <hi>justifie his Person,</hi> Work, and Doctrine thereby. And this in a short time, together with that effectual Power which he put forth in and by the Preaching of the Word, carried not only his Vindication against all the <hi>Machinations</hi> of Satan, and his Instruments throughout the World, but also subdued the generality of Mankind unto Faith in him and Obedience unto him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Testimony it is, that there is <hi>real Faith</hi> in him yet maintained in the World. This is that which he promised unto his Disciples whilst he was yet with them in the World, when their hearts were solicitous how they should bear up against their Adversaries upon his absence. <hi>I will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> saith he, <hi>send the Comforter unto you, and when he is come he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the World of Sin, and of Righteousness, and of Judgment; of sin, because they believe not on me; of Righteousness, because I go to my Father and ye see me no more; of Judgment, because the Prince of this World is Judged,</hi> John 16. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The Reason why the World believed not on Christ, was because they believed not that he was sent of God,
<hi>John</hi> 9. 29. By his Testimony the Spirit was to reprove the World of their Infidelity, and to convince them of it by evidencing the Truth of his Mission. For hereon the whole issue of the Controversie between him and the World did depend. Whether he were Righteous or a Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, was to be determined by his being <hi>sent,</hi> or not <hi>sent</hi> of God, and consequently God's Acceptance or Disapprobation of him. That he was so sent, so approved, the Holy Spirit convinced the World by his Testimony, manifesting that he <hi>went to the Father,</hi> and was exalted by him; for it was upon his Ascention and Exaltation that he received and poured out the Promise of the Spirit to this purpose, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 33. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over whilst he was in the World, there was an <hi>unrighteous Judgment</hi> by the instigation of Satan passed upon him. On this Testimony of the Spirit, that <hi>Judgment</hi> was to be <hi>reversed,</hi> and a contrary Sentence passed on the Author of it, the Prince of this World. For by the Gospel so testified unto, was he Discovered, Convicted, Judged, Condemned, and cast out of that Power and Rule in the World, which by the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Minds of Men within, and Idolatry without, he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and exercised. And that the Holy Spirit continueth to do the same Work, though not absolutely by the same means unto this very day, shall be afterwards declared.</p>
               <p>And by these Considerations may we be led into that Knowledg of, and Acquaintance with our Lord Jesus Christ, which is so necessary, so
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48389:84"/> useful, and so much recommended unto us in the Scripture. And the
<hi>utter neglect</hi> of Learning the Knowledg of Christ, and of the Truth as it is in him, is not more pernicious unto the Souls of Men, than is the learning of it by <hi>undue means,</hi> whereby false and mischievous <hi>Ideas</hi> or Representations of him are infused into the Minds of Men. The <hi>Papists</hi> would learn and teach him by Images, the Work of Mens Hands, and Teachers of Lies. For besides that they are forbidden by God himself to be used unto any such purposes, and therefore cursed with barrenness and uselesness as to any end of Faith or Holiness; they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves suited only to ingenerate <hi>low</hi> and carnal Thoughts in depraved su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Minds. For as the Worshippers of such Images know not what is the proper Cause nor the proper Object of that Reverence, and those Affections they find in themselves, when they approach unto them and adore before them; So the Apprehensions which they can have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, tend but to the <hi>knowing after the flesh,</hi> which the Apostle looked on as no part of his Duty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. But the Glory of the Humane Nature, as united unto the Person of the Son of God, and ingaged in the discharge of his Office of Mediator, consists alone in these eminent, peculiar, ineffable Communications of the Spirit of God unto him, and his powerful Operations in him; This is represented unto us in the Glass of the Gospel, which we beholding by Faith are changed into the same Image by the same Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>

It is true, it is the Person of Christ as God and Man, that is the Proper and Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Object of our Love towards him. But a clear distinct Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Natures and their Excellencies is effectual to stir up and draw forth our Love towards him. So the <hi>Spouse</hi> in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring a Reason of her intense Affections towards him, sayes, That <hi>he is White and Ruddy, the chiefest of ten thousand;</hi> that is, perfect in the Beauty of the Graces of the Holy Spirit, which rendred him exceeding amiable. So also <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 2. Would you therefore propose Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Affections, so as that your Love unto him may be <hi>sincere</hi> and without corruption as it is required to be, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 24. that you may not lavish away the Actings of your Souls upon a <hi>false Object,</hi> and think you love Christ, when you love only the Imaginations of your own Breasts; consider his Humane Nature, as it was rendred beautiful and lovely by the Work of the Spirit of God upon it before described. Do you love him because he was and is so <hi>full of Grace,</hi> so <hi>full of Holiness,</hi> because in him there was an All-fulness of the Graces of the Spirit of God? Consider aright what hath been delivered concerning him, and if you can and do on the account thereof <hi>delight in him,</hi> and love him, your Love is Genuine and Spiritual. But if your Love be meerly out of an apprehension of his being now Glorious in Heaven, and there able to do you Good or Evil, it differs not much from that of the <hi>Papists,</hi> whose Love is much regulated in its Actings, by the good or bad pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Images whereby they represent him. You are often pressed to direct your Love unto the Person of Christ, and it is that which is your principal Duty in this World. But this you cannot do without a distinct Notion and Knowledg of him. There are therefore three things in general that you are to consider to this purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:48389:85"/> (1.) The <hi>Blessed Union</hi> of his two Natures in the same Person. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is singular, God having taken that especial State on him, which in no other thing or way had any Consideration; This therefore is to have a specialty in our Divine Love to the Person of Christ.</p>
               <p>(2.) The <hi>Uncreated Glories</hi> of the Divine Nature, whence our Love hath the same Object with that which we owe unto God absolutely.</p>
               <p>(3.) That Perfection and Fulness of Grace which dwelt in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, as communicated unto him by the Holy Spirit whereof we have treated.</p>
               <p>If you love the Person of Christ, it must be on these Considerations. Which whilst some have neglected, they have doted on their own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; and whilst they have thought themselves even sick of Love for Christ, they have only languished in their own Fancies.</p>
               <p>Secondly; We are to know Christ so, as to labour after <hi>conformity</hi> unto him. And this Conformity consists only in a Participation of those Graces whose fulness dwells in him. We can therefore no other way regularly press after it, but by an Acquaintance with, and due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Work of the Spirit of God upon his Humane Nature, which is therefore worthy of our most diligent enquiry into.</p>
               <p>And so have we given a brief <hi>delineation</hi> of the Dispensation and Work of the Holy Spirit, in and towards the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church; his preparation of a <hi>Mystical Body</hi> for him, in his Powerful Gracious Work on the <hi>Elect of God,</hi> doth nextly ensue.</p>

Concerning which before we come to consider particular Instances, some things in general must be premised; which are these that follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> First; Unto the Work of the Holy Spirit <hi>towards the Church,</hi> some things are <hi>supposed</hi> from whence it proceeds, which it is built upon, and resolved into. It is not an <hi>Original</hi> but a <hi>Perfecting Work;</hi> some things it supposeth, and bringeth <hi>all</hi> things to perfection; And these are,</p>
               <p>First; The <hi>Love,</hi> Grace, Counsel and Eternal Purpose of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. (2.) The whole Work of the <hi>Mediation</hi> of Jesus Christ, which things I have handled elsewhere. For it is the <hi>peculiar Work</hi> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, to make <hi>those things</hi> of the Father and Son effectual unto the Souls of the Elect, to the Praise of the Glory of the Grace of God. God doth <hi>all things for himself,</hi> and his Supream End is the manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own Glory. And in the <hi>Old</hi> or First Creation, he seems prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally or firstly to intend the Demonstration and Exaltation of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Essential Properties</hi> of his Nature, his Goodness, Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the like: as <hi>Psal. 19. 1, 2, 3, 4. Rom. 1. 19, 20, 21. Acts</hi> 14. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 24, 25, 26, 27. leaving only on the Works of his Hands some obscure Impressions of the <hi>distinction of Persons,</hi> subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Unity of that Being, whose Properties he had displayed and glorified. But in the Work of the New Creation, God firstly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intends the especial Revelation of <hi>each Person of the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> distinctly, in their peculiar distinct Operations; all which tend ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately to the manifestation of the Glory of his Nature also. And herein consists the principal Advantage of the New Testament above the Old; for although the Work of the <hi>New Creation</hi> was begun and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on Secretly and Virtually under the Old Testament; yet they had not a full discovery of the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Holy Trinity therein, which was not evidently manifest until the whole Work was illustriously brought to Light by the Gospel. Hence although there appear a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous acting of Faith, and ardency of Affection in the Approaches of the Saints unto God, under the Old Testament; yet as unto a clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to the Father through the Son by the Spirit, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 18. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Life and Comfort of our Communion with God doth consist, we hear nothing of it. Herein therefore God plainly declares, that the Foundation of the Whole was laid in the Counsel, Will, and Grace of the Father, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 3 4, 5, 6. Then that the making way for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing of that Counsel of his, so that it might be brought forth to the praise of his Glory, is by the Mediation of the Son; God having designed in this Work to bring things so about, that all Men should <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Son, even as they honour the Father,</hi> John 5. 23. There yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the <hi>actual Application</hi> of all to the Souls of Men, that they may be Partakers of the Grace designed in the Counsel of the Father, and prepared in the Mediation of the Son. And herein is the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48389:87"/> be manifested and glorified, that He also, together with the Father and the Son, may be Known, Adored, Worshipped, according unto his own Will. This is the Work that he hath undertaken. And hereon upon the solemn <hi>Initiation</hi> of any Person into the Covenant of God, in answer unto this Design and Work, he is <hi>Baptized into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</hi> Matth. 28. 18. And these things have been discoursed of before, though necessarily here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over again.</p>

                     </gap>. Jobius <hi>apud</hi> Photium. lib. 122.</note> Thus when our Lord Jesus Christ was ascended into Heaven, and began conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously and gloriously to carry on the building of his Church upon himself the Rock and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it, it is said, That <hi>being exalted by the Right Hand of God, he received of the Father the Promise of the Holy Spirit,</hi> Acts 2. 33. which must be a little opened. Before he departed from his Disciples, as hath been mentioned on several occasions, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and cheared their drooping Spirits, with the Promise of <hi>sending him</hi> unto them, which he often repeated and inculcated on their minds,
<hi>John</hi> 14. 15, 16. And (2.) when he was actually leaving of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Resurrection he gives them order to sit still, and not to ingage in the publick Work of building the Church, whereunto he had designed them, until that <hi>Promise were actually accomplished</hi> towards them, <hi>Acts 1. 4. Being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>but wait for the Promise of the Father;</hi> and Vers. 8. <hi>Ye shall receive Power after the Holy Spirit is come upon you, and ye shall be Witnesses unto me, both in</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and in all</hi> Judea, <hi>and in</hi> Samaria, <hi>and unto the utmost parts of the Earth.</hi> He would have them look neither for Assistance in their Work, nor success unto it, but from the <hi>promised</hi> Spirit alone; and lets them know also, that by his Aid they should be enabled to carry their Testimony of him to the uttermost parts of the Earth. And herein lay, and herein doth lie the Foundation of the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the Church, as also its Continuance and Efficacy. The Kingdom of Christ is Spiritual, and in the animating Principles of it, invisible. If we fix our Minds only on outward Order, we lose the Rise and Power of the whole; it is not an <hi>outward visible Ordination by Men,</hi> though that be necessary by Rule and Precept, but Christ's Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Spirit, the Everlasting Promise whereof he received of the Father, that gives <hi>Being, Life, Usefulness,</hi> and success to the Ministry. Wherefore also (3.) upon his Ascention in the Accomplishment of the great Promises given unto the Church under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> Isa. 44. 3. Joel 1. 18. as also of his own <hi>newly given</hi> unto his Disciples, he poured forth his Spirit on them. This the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> declares in this place; <hi>Being exalted by the right Hand of God, and having received of the Father the Promise of the Holy Spirit; he shed forth what they
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48389:87"/> then saw and heard,</hi> in the Miraculous Operations and Effects of it. And he is said <hi>then to receive the Promise of the Father,</hi> because he then received the <hi>thing promised.</hi> The Promise was not then first <hi>given unto</hi> him, nor did he then <hi>receive it</hi> for himself; For as the Promise was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven long before, so in his own Person he had received the <hi>fulness of the Spirit</hi> from his Incarnation, as hath been declared. But now he had Power given him actually to fulfil and <hi>accomplish the Promise</hi> in the Collation of the thing promised, and is thence said <hi>to receive the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13, 39. it is said of all Believers under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, That they died in Faith, <hi>having not received the Promise;</hi> that is, the thing promised was not actually exhibited in their dayes, though they <hi>had the Promise of it;</hi> as it is expresly said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Chap. 7. 6. The Promise therefore it self was given unto the Lord Christ, and actually received by him in the Covenant of the Mediator, when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the great Work of the Restauration of all things to the Glory of God. For herein had he the Ingagement of the Father that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit should be <hi>poured out on the Sons of Men,</hi> to make effectual unto their Souls, the whole Work of his Mediation; wherefore he is said now
<hi>to receive this Promise,</hi> because on his account, and by him as exalted, it was now solemnly accomplished, in and towards the Church. In the same manner the same thing is described, Psal. 68. 18. <hi>Thou hast ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on High, thou hast led Captivity captive, thou hast received Gifts for Men;</hi> which is rendred, Ephes. 4. 8. <hi>Thou hast given Gifts unto Men,</hi> for he <hi>received</hi> the Promise at this time, <hi>only to give</hi> out the Spirit and his Gifts unto Men. And if any are so fond as to expect Strength and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the Work of the Ministry without him, or such success in their Labours as shall find Acceptance with God; they do but deceive their own Souls and others.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> Here lay the Foundation of the Christian Church. The Lord Christ had called his Apostles to the great Work of <hi>building</hi> his Church, and the propagation of his Gospel in the World. Of themselves they were plainly and openly <hi>defective</hi> in all Qualifications and Abilities that might contribute any thing thereunto. But whatever is wanting in themselves, whether Light, Wisdom, Authority, Knowledg, Utterance, or Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he promiseth to supply them withal. And this he would not do, nor did any otherwise, but by <hi>sending the Holy Spirit</hi> unto them, on whose presence and assistance alone depended the whole success of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry in the World. It was <hi>through the Holy Ghost that he gave Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto them,</hi> Acts 1. 2. Those Commandments concern the whole Work in Preaching the Gospel and Founding of the Church; and these he gives unto them through the acting of Divine Wisdom in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature by the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> And on their part, without <hi>his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> he forbids them to attempt any thing, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 8, 9. In this Promise then the Lord Christ <hi>founded</hi> the Church it self, and by it he <hi>builded</hi> it up; And this is the Hinge whereon the whole weight of it doth turn and depend unto this day. Take it away, suppose it to cease as unto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Accomplishment, and there will be an absolute <hi>end of the Church</hi> of Christ in this World. No Dispensation of the Spirit, no Church. He that would utterly separate the Spirit from the <hi>Word,</hi> had as good burn his Bible. The bare <hi>Letter of the New Testament</hi> will no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48389:88"/> Faith and Obedience in the Souls of Men, no more constitute a Church-State among them who enjoy it, than the <hi>Letter of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi> doth so at this day among the <hi>Jews,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6, 8. But blessed be God who hath knit these things together towards his Elect in the Bond of an Everlasting Covenant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 21. Let Men therefore cast themselves into what <hi>order</hi> they please, institute what Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Religious Worship they think good, let them do it either by an attendance according unto the best of their understandings unto the <hi>Letter of the Scripture,</hi> or else in an Exercise of their own Wills, Wisdom and Invention; if the Work of the Spirit of God <hi>be disowned or disclaimed by them,</hi> if there be not in them and upon them such a Work of his as he is promised by our Lord Jesus Christ, there is not
<hi>Church-State</hi> amongst them; nor as such is it to be owned or esteemed. And on the Ministry and the Church do all ordinary Communications of Grace from God depend.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> Thirdly; It is the Holy Spirit who supplies the <hi>bodily absence</hi> of Christ; and by him doth he accomplish all his Promises to the Church. Hence some of the Ancients call him <hi>Vicarium Christi,</hi> the <hi>Vicar of Christ,</hi> or he who represents his Person, and dischargeth his promised Work;
<hi>Operam navat Christo Vicariam.</hi> When our Lord Jesus was leaving the World he gave his Disciples command to <hi>Preach the Gospel,</hi> and to
<hi>Disciple the World</hi> into the Faith and Profession thereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. For their incouragement herein, he promiseth his <hi>own presence</hi> with them in their whole Work, where-ever any of them should be called unto it, and that whilst he would have the Gospel preached on the Earth; so saith he, <hi>I am with you alwayes even unto the end of the World, or the Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all things,</hi> v. 20. Immediately after he had thus spoken unto them, <hi>while they beheld he was taken up, and a Cloud received him out of their sight, and they looked stedfastly towards Heaven as he went up,</hi> Acts 1. 9, 10. Where now is the Accomplishment of his Promise, that he would be with them unto the end of all things, which was the sole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement he gave them unto their great undertaking? It may be that after this his <hi>triumphant Ascention</hi> into Heaven to take possession of his Kingdom and Glory, he came again unto them, and made his abode with them: <hi>No,</hi> saith <hi>Peter, the Heavens must receive him until the time of the restitution of all things,</hi> Acts 3. 21. How then is this Promise of his made good, which had such a peculiar respect unto the Ministry and Ministers of the Gospel, that without it none can ever <hi>honestly</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously engage in the Dispensation of it; or expect the least <hi>success</hi> upon their so doing? Besides he had promised unto the Church it self, That where ever <hi>two or three were gathered together in his Name, that he would be in the midst of them,</hi> Matth. 18. 19, 20. Hereon do all their Comforts and all their Acceptance with God depend. I say, all these Promises are <hi>perfectly fulfilled</hi> by his <hi>sending of the Holy Spirit.</hi> In and by him he is present with his Disciples in their Ministry and their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. And when-ever <hi>Christ leaves the World,</hi> the Church must do so too. For it is his Presence alone which puts Men into that condition, or invests them with that Priviledg. For so he saith, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my People,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16. Levit. 26. 12. Their being the <hi>People of God,</hi> so as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48389:88"/> therewithal to be the <hi>Temple of the Living God,</hi> that is, to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Sacred Church-State for his Worship, depends on his <hi>dwelling in them,</hi> and walking in them; and this he doth by his <hi>Spirit</hi> alone. <hi>For know you not that you are Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 16. He therefore so far represents the Person, and supplies the <hi>bodily absence</hi> of Christ, that on his Presence the Being of the Church, the Success of the Ministry, and the Edification of the whole do absolutely depend. And this if any thing in the whole Gospel deserves our serious Consideration. For (1.) the Lord Jesus hath told us that his <hi>presence</hi> with us by his Spirit is better and <hi>more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> for us than the continuance of his Bodily Presence. Now who is there that hath any Affection for Christ, but thinks that the Carnal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Humane Nature of Christ would be of unspeakable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage unto him? And so no doubt it would, had any such thing been design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or appointed in the Wisdom and Love of God. But so it is not; and on the other side we are commanded to look for <hi>more Advantage</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> by his Spiritual Presence with us, or his Presence with us by the Holy Ghost. It is therefore certainly incumbent on us, to inquire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently what Valuation we have hereof, and what Benefit we have hereby. For if we find not that we really receive Grace, Assistance, and Consolation from <hi>this presence of Christ</hi> with us, we have no benefit at all by him, nor from him, for he is now no otherwise for those ends with any but by his Spirit. And this they will one day find, whose Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is made up of such a sottish Contradiction as to avow an honour for Jesus Christ, and yet blaspheme his Spirit in all his Holy Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. (2.) The Lord Christ having expresly promised to be present with us to the end of all things, there are great Enquiries <hi>how</hi> that Promise is accomplished. Some say he is present with us <hi>by his Ministers</hi> and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; but how then is he present with those <hi>Ministers themselves,</hi> unto whom the Promise of his Presence is made in an especial manner? The <hi>Papists</hi> would have him Carnally and Bodily present in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But he himself hath told us, that <hi>the Flesh</hi> in such a sense <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing,</hi> John 6. 63. and that it is the <hi>Spirit alone that quickneth.</hi> The <hi>Lutherans</hi> sancy an Omnipresence or <hi>Ubiquity</hi> of his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by virtue of its Personal Union. But this is destructive of that Nature it self; which being made to be every where as such a Nature, is truly <hi>no where.</hi> And the most Learned among them are ashamed of this Imagination.

                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:48389:89"/> Fourthly; As he represents the <hi>Person,</hi> and supplies the Room and Place of Jesus Christ, so he worketh and effecteth what-ever the Lord Christ hath <hi>taken upon himself</hi> to Work and Effect towards his Disciples. Wherefore as the Work of the Son was not his <hi>own Work,</hi> but rather the <hi>Work of the Father who sent him,</hi> and in whose Name he performed it; so the Work of the Holy Spirit is not his <hi>own Work,</hi> but rather the
<hi>Work of the Son,</hi> by whom he is sent, and in whose Name he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish it. John 16. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Howbeit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth. For he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that he shall speak, and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorifie me, for he shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto you. all things that the Father hath are mine; therefore said I that he shall take of mine, and shew it unto you.</hi> He comes to reveal and communicate <hi>Truth and Grace</hi> to the Disciples of Christ. And in his so doing he speaks not of himself; that is, of himself only. He comes not with any absolute <hi>new Dispensation</hi> of Truth or Grace, distinct or different from that which is in and by the Lord Christ, and which they had heard from him. The Holy Spirit being promised unto the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and all their Work and Duty being suspended on the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Promise, whereas he is God, they might suppose that he would come with some <hi>absolute new Dispensation</hi> of Truth, so that what they had learned and received from Christ should pass away and be of no use unto them. To prevent any such Apprehensions, he lets them know that the Work he had to do, was only to carry on and build on the
<hi>Foundation</hi> which was laid in his Person or Doctrine, or the Truth which he had revealed from the Bosom of the Father. And this I take to be the meaning of that Expression. <hi>For he shall not speak of himself,</hi> he shall reveal <hi>no other Truth,</hi> communicate <hi>no other Grace</hi> but what is in from and by my self. This was the Holy Spirit to do, and this he did; and hereby may we <hi>try every Spirit whether it be of God.</hi> That Spirit which revealeth any thing or pretendeth to reveal any Thing, any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, any Grace, any Truth, that is contrary unto, that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to, yea that is not the Doctrine, Grace, or Truth of Christ, as now revealed in the Word, that brings any thing new, his own, or of himself, that Spirit is not of God. So it is added, (2.) Whatsoever
<hi>he shall hear that shall he speak.</hi> This which he hears, is the whole Counsel of the Father and the Son concerning the Salvation of the Church. And how is he said to <hi>hear it,</hi> which word in its proper signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication hath no place in the mutual internal Actings of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Holy Trinity. Being the Spirit of the Father and the Son, proceeding from both, he is <hi>equally participant</hi> of their Counsels. So the outward Act of Hearing is mentioned as the <hi>sign</hi> of his Infinite Knowledg of the Eternal Counsels of the Father and Son; He is no
<hi>stranger</hi> unto them. And this is a general Rule, That those words which with respect unto us express the <hi>means</hi> of any thing, as applyed unto God, intend no more but the <hi>signs</hi> of it. Hearing is the means whereby we come to know the mind of another who is distinct from us. And when God is said to hearken or hear, it is a <hi>sign</hi> of his knowledg, not the <hi>means</hi> of it. So is the Holy Spirit said to <hi>hear</hi> those things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knows them. As he is also on the same account said to search the deep things of God. Add hereunto that the Counsel of these things
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48389:89"/> is originally peculiar to the Father, and unto him it is every where pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly ascribed; therefore is the participation of the Spirit therein as a distinct Person called his <hi>hearing.</hi> Hereunto (3.) his great Work is subjoyned. He, <hi>saith Christ, shall glorifie me.</hi> This is the Design that he is sent upon; this is the Work that he comes to do, even as it was the Design and Work of Jesus Christ to glorifie the Father by whom he was sent. And this are they alwayes to bear in mind, who stand in need of or pray for his Assistance in their Work or Office in the Church of God. He is given unto them that through him they may give and bring Glory to Jesus Christ. And (4.) how the Holy Spirit doth glorifie the Lord Christ is also declared. <hi>He shall receive of mine and shew it unto you;</hi> The Communication of Spiritual Things from Christ by the Spirit is here called his <hi>receiving of them;</hi> as the communication of the Spirit from the Father by the Lord Christ to his Disciples, is called the <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Promise.</hi> The Spirit cannot receive any thing <hi>subjectively</hi> which he had not, as an addition unto him. It is therefore the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of these things that is here intended. He is not said to <hi>receive them</hi> as though before he had them not. For what can he who is God so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? only when he begins to give them unto us, because they are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly the things of <hi>Christ,</hi> he is said to receive them. For we can give nothing of anothers but what we receive of him. Good things are given unto us from Christ by the Spirit. For so it is added, <hi>and shall shew them unto you.</hi> He shall make them known unto you; so declare them and manifestly evidence them to you, and in you, that you shall understand and have <hi>experience</hi> of them in your selves; shew them by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, instructing you in them, by communication imparting them to you. And what are these things that he shall so declare? They are
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>my things,</hi> saith our Saviour. The things of <hi>Christ</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto two Heads, His Truth and His Grace, <hi>John</hi> 1. 17. The first he shews by Revelation, the latter by Effectual Communication. His Truth he shewed unto them by Revelation, as we have declared him to be the Immediate Author of all Divine Revelations. This he did unto the Apostles by his Inspirations, enabling them infallibly to receive under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and declare, the whole Counsel of God in Christ. For so according unto the Promise, <hi>He led them into all Truth.</hi> And his <hi>Grace he shewed</hi> unto them in his pouring out both of his Sanctifying Graces and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Gifts upon them in an abundant measure. And so he still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to shew the Truth and Grace of <hi>Christ</hi> unto all Believers, though not in the same manner as unto the former, nor unto the same Degree as unto the latter. For he shews unto us the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> or the
<hi>Truth that came by Jesus Christ,</hi> by the Word as Written and Preached, instructing us in it, and enlightning our Minds Spiritually and Savingly to understand the Mind of God therein. And of his <hi>Grace</hi> he imparts unto us in our Sanctification, Consolation, and Communication of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gifts, according unto the measure of the Gift of <hi>Christ</hi> unto every one of us, as the present use of the <hi>Church</hi> doth require, which things must be afterwards declared. And the Reason of the Assertion is added in the last place. <hi>All things that the Father hath are mine; therefore said I, that he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you.</hi> Two things may be observed in these words. 1. The Extent of the <hi>Things of Christ,</hi> which are to be shewed unto Believers by the Spirit; and they are <hi>all the things
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48389:90"/> that the Father hath.</hi> They are mine, saith our Saviour; And these <hi>All things</hi> may be taken either <hi>absolutely</hi> and personally, or with a restriction unto Office. (1.) All things that the Father hath <hi>absolutely,</hi> were the <hi>Son's</hi> also. For receiving his <hi>Personality</hi> from the Father, by the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the whole entire Divine Nature, all the <hi>things</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must needs be his. Thus as the Father hath <hi>Life</hi> in himself, so he hath <hi>given unto the Son to have Life in himself,</hi> John 5. 26. and the like may be said of all other Essential Properties of the God-head. But these seem not to be the <hi>All Things</hi> here intended. They are not the <hi>All things</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> which he had by Eternal Generation; but the <hi>All Things</hi> of Spiritual Grace and Power which he had by voluntary Donation; Matth. 11. 27. Joh. 3. 35. <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</hi> That is, all the Effects of the Love, Grace, and Will of the Father, what-ever he had purposed in himself from Eternity, and what-ever his Infinite Power and Goodness would produce in the pursuit thereof, was <hi>all</hi> given and committed unto Jesus Christ; so <hi>All things</hi> that the Father hath were his.</p>
               <p>2. That these things may be rightly understood and apprehended, we must consider a <hi>two-sold Operation</hi> of God as <hi>Three in One.</hi> The first hereof is absolute in all Divine Works what-ever; the other respects the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Operations of God in our Salvation. In those of the first sort, both the Working and the Work, do in common and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dly belong unto and proceed from each Person. And the Reason hereof is, because they are all Effects of the Essential Properties of the same Divine Nature; which is in them all, or rather which is the one Nature of them all. But yet as they have <hi>one Nature,</hi> so there is an Order of <hi>subsistence</hi> in that Nature, and the distinct Person Work in the Order of their Subsistence; John 5. 19, 20. <hi>Verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do; for whatsoever things he doth, those also doth the Son likewise.</hi> The Father doth not first work in order of <hi>Time,</hi> and then the Son <hi>seeing of it</hi> work another Work like unto it. But the Son doth the <hi>same Work</hi> that the Father doth. This is absolutely necessary, because of their Union in Nature. But yet in the Order of their Subsistence, the <hi>Person of the Father</hi> is the Original of all Divine Works, in the principle and beginning of them, and that in order of Nature, <hi>antecedently</hi> unto the Operation of the Son. Hence he is said <hi>to see</hi> what the Father doth; which according unto our former Rule in the Exposition of such Expressions, when ascribed unto the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is the <hi>sign</hi> and <hi>evidence,</hi> and not the <hi>means</hi> of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. He sees what the Father doth, as he is his Eternal Wisdom. The like must be said of the Holy Spirit, with respect both unto the Father and Son. And this <hi>Order of Operation</hi> in the Holy Trinity is not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, but <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> from the one Essence and distinct Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences thereof. Secondly; There are those Operations, which with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto our Salvation, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, do graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously condescend unto, which are those treated of in this place. Now though the designing of this Work was absolutely <hi>voluntary,</hi> yet upon a supposition thereof, the order of its Accomplishment was made <hi>necessary</hi> from the Order of the Subsistence of the distinct Persons in the Deity; and that is here declared. Thus (1.) the things to be declared unto us, and bestowed on us, are originally the <hi>Father's Things.</hi> He is the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48389:90"/> peculiar Fountain of them all. His Love, His Grace, His Wisdom, His Goodness, His Counsel, His Will, is their Supream Cause and Spring. Hence are they said to be the <hi>things that the Father hath.</hi> (2.) They are made the <hi>Things of the Son,</hi> that is, they are given and granted in and unto his disposal, on the account of his Mediation; for thereby they were to be prepared for us, and given out unto us, to the Glory of God. Answerable hereunto as the Lord Christ is Mediator, all the things of Grace are originally the Fathers, and then given unto him. (3.) They are <hi>actually communicated</hi> unto us by the Holy Spirit,
<hi>Therefore said I, he shall take of mine and shew unto you.</hi> He doth not communicate them unto us immediately from the Father. We do not so receive any Grace from God that is the Father; nor do we so make any return of Praise or Obedience unto God. We have nothing to do with the Person of the Father <hi>immediately.</hi> It is <hi>by the Son</hi> alone by whom we have an Access unto him, and by the Son alone that he gives out of his Grace and Bounty unto us. He <hi>that hath not the Son hath not the Father.</hi> With him as the great Treasurer of Heavenly Things, are all Grace and Mercy entrusted. The Holy Spirit therefore <hi>shews them unto us,</hi> works them in us, bestows them on us, as they are the <hi>Fruits of the Media<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion</hi> of Christ, and not meerly as Effects of the Divine Love and Bounty of the Father; and this is required from the Order of Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence before mentioned. Thus the Holy Spirit supplies the <hi>bodily Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of Jesus Christ, and Effects what he hath to do and accomplish to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his in the World; so that what-ever is done by him, it is the same as if it were wrought immediately by the Lord Christ himself in his own Person; whereby all his Holy Promises are fully accomplished towards them that believe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> And this instructs us in the Way and Manner of that <hi>Communion</hi> which we have with God by the Gospel. For herein the Life, Power, and Freedom of our Evangelical State doth consist, and an acquaintance herewith gives us our Translation <hi>out of Darkness into the marvelous Light of God.</hi> (1.) The Person of the <hi>Father</hi> in his Wisdom, Will, and Love, is the Original of all Grace and Glory. But nothing hereof is communicated immediately unto us from him. It is the <hi>Son</hi> whom he loves and hath given all things into his hand. He hath <hi>made way</hi> for the Communication of these things unto us unto the Glory of God. And he doth it immediately by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as hath been declared. Hereby are all our Returns unto God to be regulated. The Father who is the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> of all Grace and Glory, is ultimately intended by us in our Faith, Thankfulness, and Obedience; yet not so, but that the Son and Spirit are considered as one God with him. But we cannot address our selves with any of them <hi>immediately</hi> unto him. There is no <hi>going to the Father,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>but by me,</hi> John 14. 6. <hi>Through him we believe in God,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 21. But yet neither can we do so, unless we are enabled thereunto by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Author in us, of Faith, Prayer, Praise, Obedience, and what-ever our Souls tend unto God by. As the <hi>descending</hi> of God towards us in Love and Grace, issues or ends in the Work of the Spirit in us and on us; so all our <hi>ascending</hi> towards him begins therein. And as the first Instance of the proceeding of Grace and Love towards us from the Father, is in and by the Son; so the first <hi>step</hi> that we take towards
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48389:91"/> God, even the Father, is in and by the Son. And these things ought to be explicitly attended unto by us, if we intend our Faith, and Love, and Duties of Obedience should be <hi>Evangelical.</hi> Take an Instance of the <hi>Prayer</hi> of Wicked Men under their Convictions, or their Fears, Troubles and Dangers; and the Prayers of Believers. The former is meerly, <hi>Vox Naturae Clamantis ad Dominum Naturae;</hi> an out-cry that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Nature makes to the God of it, and as such alone it considers him. But the other is, <hi>Vox Spiritus Adoptionis clamantis per Christum, Abba Pater;</hi> It is the Voice of the Spirit of Adoption addressing it self in the Hearts of Believers unto God as a Father. And a due attendance unto this <hi>Order</hi> of things, gives Life and Spirit unto all that we have to do with God. Wo to Professors of the Gospel who shall be seduced, to believe that all they have to do with God, consists in their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance unto <hi>Moral Vertue.</hi> It is fit for them so to do, who being weary of Christianity, have a mind to turn <hi>Pagans.</hi> But our <hi>Fellowship</hi> is in the way described, <hi>with the Father and his Son Christ Jesus.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the highest importance unto us, to enquire into, and secure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our selves the <hi>promised workings</hi> of the Holy Spirit. For by them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are the Love of the Father, and the Fruits of the Mediation of the Son communicated unto us, without which we have no interest in them. And by them alone are we enabled to make any acceptable Returns of Obedience unto God. It is sottish Ignorance and Infidelity to suppose that under the Gospel there is no <hi>communication</hi> between God and us, but what is on his part in Laws, Commands, and Promises; and on ours by Obedience performed in our own Strength, and upon our Convictions unto them. The exclude hence the real <hi>internal Operations</hi> of the Holy Ghost, is to destroy the Gospel. And as we shall see farther afterwards, this is the true Ground and Reason why there is a <hi>sin against</hi> the Holy Spirit, that is irremissible; for the coming unto us to make Application of the Love of the Father, and Grace of the Son unto our Souls; in the contempt of him, there is a contempt of the whole actings of God towards us, in a way of Grace, for which there can be no Remedy.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> Fifthly; Whereas the Holy Spirit is the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Efficient Cause of all Grace, and Gracious Effects in Men; where-ever there is mention made of <hi>them,</hi> or any fruits of them, it is to be looked on as a <hi>part of his Work,</hi> though he be not expresly named, or it be not particularly attributed unto him. I know not well, or do not well understand what some Men begin to talk about <hi>Moral Vertue;</hi> Some thing they seem to aim at, (if they would once leave the old <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian</hi> ambiguous Expressions, and learn to speak clearly and <hi>intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>) that is in their own Power, and so consequently of all other Men. At least it is so with an <hi>ordinary blessing</hi> upon their own endeavours, which things we must afterwards enquire into. But for Grace, I think all Men will grant, that as to our participation of it, it is of the Holy Spirit, and of him alone. Now Grace is taken two wayes in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; (1.) For the <hi>gracious free Love</hi> and Favour of God towards us: And (2.) for <hi>gracious</hi> free effectual Operations in us, and upon us. In both senses the Holy Spirit is the Author of it, as unto us. In the first as to its manifestation and Application; in the latter, as to the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self. For although he be not the principal Cause, nor procurer
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48389:91"/> of Grace in the first sense, which is the free Act of the Father; yet the Knowledg, Sense, Comfort, and all the Fruits of it are by him alone communicated unto us, as we shall see afterwards. And the <hi>latter</hi> is his proper and peculiar Work. This therefore must be taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that where-ever any gracious actings of God in or towards Men are mentioned, it is the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> who is peculiarly and principally intended.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> Sixthly; It must be duly considered, with reference unto the whole Work of the Holy Spirit, that in what-ever he doth, he Acts, Works, and Distributes <hi>according to his own Will.</hi> This our Apostle expresly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth. And sundry things of great moment do depend hereon in our walking before God. As;</p>
               <p>1. That the <hi>Will and Pleasure of the Holy Spirit</hi> is in all the Goodness, Grace, Love, and Power, that he either communicates unto us, or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us. He is not as a <hi>meer Instrument</hi> or Servant disposing of the things wherein he hath no Concern, or over which he hath no Power. But in all things he worketh towards us according <hi>to his own Will.</hi> We are therefore in what we receive from him, and by him, no less to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg his <hi>Love,</hi> Kindness, and Sovereign Grace, than we do to those of the Father, and the Son.</p>
               <p>2. That he doth not work as a natural Agent, <hi>ad ultimum virium,</hi> to the utmost of his Power, as though in all he did, he came and did what he could. He moderates all his Operations by his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Wisdom.</hi> And therefore whereas some are said to <hi>resist the Holy Spirit,</hi> Acts 7. 51. and so to frustrate his Work towards them, it is not because they can do so absolutely, but only they can do so as to <hi>some way,</hi> kind, or degree, of his Operations. Men may <hi>resist</hi> some sort or kind of means that he useth, as to some certain end and purpose; but they cannot resist him as to his purpose and the end he aims at. For he is God, and <hi>who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted his Will?</hi> Rom. 9. 19. Wherefore in any Work of his, two things are to be considered; (1.) What the means he maketh use of tend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in their own Nature; And (2.) what he intends by it; The first may be resisted and frustrated, but the latter cannot be so. Sometimes in and by that word which in its own Nature tends to the Conversion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he intendeth by it only their hardning, <hi>Isa. 6. 9, 10. John</hi> 12. 40, 41. <hi>Acts 18. 26. Rom.</hi> 11. 8. And he can, when he pleaseth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert that Power and Efficacy in working, as shall take away all Resistance. Sometimes he will only take order for the Preaching and Dispensation of the Word unto Men; for this also is his Work, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2. Herein Men may <hi>resist</hi> his Work, and reject his Counsel concerning themselves. But when he will put forth his Power in and by the Word, to the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a new</hi> heart in Men, and the <hi>opening of the Eyes</hi> of them that are blind, he doth therein so take away the Principle of Resistance, that he is not, that he cannot be resisted.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> 3. Hence also it follows that his Works may be of <hi>various kinds,</hi> and that those which are of the <hi>same kind</hi> may yet be carried on unequally as to Degrees. It is so in the Operations of all <hi>voluntary Agents,</hi> who work by Choice and Judgment. They are not confined <hi>to one sort of</hi> Works, nor to the Production of the same kind of Effects; and where
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48389:92"/> they design so to do, they <hi>moderate them</hi> as to degrees according to their Power and pleasure. Thus we shall find some of the Works of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to be such as may be <hi>perfect in their kind,</hi> and Men may be made <hi>Partakers</hi> of the whole End and Intention of them, and yet no
<hi>saving Grace</hi> be wrought in them. Such are his Works of Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Conviction, and sundry others. Men, I say, may have a <hi>Work of the Holy Spirit</hi> on their Hearts and Minds, and yet not be Sanctified and Converted unto God. For the Nature and Kind of his Works are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by his <hi>own Will</hi> and Purpose; if he intends no more but their
<hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Illumination,</hi> no more shall be effected. For he works not by a <hi>necessity of Nature,</hi> so that all his Operations should be of the same kind, and have their especial Form from his Nature, and not from his Will. So also where he doth work the <hi>same Effect</hi> in the Souls of Men, I mean the same in the <hi>kind</hi> of it, as in their <hi>Regeneration</hi> he doth; yet he doth it by <hi>sundry means,</hi> and carrieth it on to a great inequality, as to the strengthening of its Principle, and increase of its Fruits unto Holiness; And hence is that great difference as to <hi>Light, Holiness,</hi> and
<hi>Fruitfulness,</hi> which we find among Believers, although all alike Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the same Grace for the <hi>kind</hi> thereof. The Holy Spirit worketh in all these things <hi>according to his own Will;</hi> whereof there neither is nor can be any other Rule but his own Infinite Wisdom. And this is that which the Apostle minds the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of, to take away all Emulation and Envy about <hi>Spiritual Gifts,</hi> that every one should orderly make use of what he had received to the Profit and Edification of others. They are, saith he, <hi>given and distributed</hi> by the same Spirit according <hi>to his own Will,</hi> to one after one manner, unto another after another; so that it is an unreasonable thing for any to contend about them.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> But it may be said, that if not only the <hi>working</hi> of Grace in us, but also the <hi>Effects</hi> and Fruits of it, in all its variety of <hi>Degrees,</hi> is to be ascribed unto the Holy Spirit, and his Operations in us according to his own Will, then do we signifie <hi>nothing our selves;</hi> nor is there any need that we should either use our endeavours and diligence, or at all take any care about the furtherance or growth of Holiness in us, or attend unto any Duties of Obedience. To what end and purpose then serve all the
<hi>Commands, Threatnings, Promises,</hi> and Exhortations of the Scripture, which are openly designed to excite and draw forth our own Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours? And this is indeed the principal <hi>Difficulty</hi> wherewith some Men seek to intangle and perplex the Grace of God. But I Answer.</p>
               <p>(1.) Let Men imagine what absurd Consequences they please there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet that the Spirit of God is the Author and Worker of all Grace in us, and of all the Degrees of it, of all that is <hi>spiritually good</hi> in us, is a Truth which we must not forgo, unless we intend to part with our <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> also. For in them we are taught, <hi>That in us, that is, in our flesh, there dwelleth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7. 18. That <hi>we are not sufficient of our selves to think any thing, as of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. <hi>Who is able to make all Grace abound towards us, that we may alwayes have All-sufficiency in all things abounding to every good work,</hi> Chap. 9. 8. But <hi>without Christ we can do nothing,</hi> John 15. 5. <hi>For it is God which worketh in us both to Will and to Do of his good Pleasure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. To grant therefore that there is any <hi>spiritual good</hi> in us, or <hi>any
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48389:92"/> Degree</hi> of it, that is not wrought in us by the Spirit of God, both over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the Grace of the Gospel, and denies God to be the <hi>only First, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream,</hi> and <hi>chiefest Good;</hi> as also the immediate cause of what is so, which is to deny his very Being. It is therefore certain, what-ever any pertend, that nothing can hence ensue, but what is <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and useful to the Souls of Men: For from Truth, especiall such great and
<hi>important Truths,</hi> nothing else will follow.</p>
               <p>2. It is <hi>brutish Ignorance</hi> in any to argue in the Things of God, from the <hi>Effectual Operations</hi> of the Spirit, unto a <hi>sloth</hi> and <hi>negligence</hi> of our own Duty. He that doth not know that God hath <hi>promised to work in us,</hi> in a way of <hi>Grace,</hi> what he requires from us in a <hi>way of Duty,</hi> hath either never read the Bible, or doth not believe it, or never Prayed, or never took notice of what he prayed for. He is a <hi>Heathen,</hi> he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Christian</hi> in him, who doth not <hi>pray</hi> that God would work in him what he requires of him. This we know that what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and prescribes unto us, what he encourageth us unto, we ought with all diligence and earnestness, as we value our Souls and their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare, to <hi>attend</hi> unto and comply withal. And we do know that what-ever God hath <hi>promised,</hi> that he will do himself in us, towards us, and upon us: It is our Duty to <hi>believe</hi> that he will so do. And to fancy an inconsistency between these things, is to charge God foolishly.</p>
               <p>3. If there be an Opposition between these things, it is either because the Nature of Man is not <hi>meet to be commanded,</hi> or because it <hi>needs not to be assisted.</hi> But that both these are false and vain Suppositions, shall be afterwards declared. The Holy Spirit so worketh <hi>in us,</hi> as that he worketh <hi>by us;</hi> and what <hi>He</hi> doth <hi>in us,</hi> is done <hi>by us;</hi> Our <hi>Duty</hi> it is to apply our selves unto his Commands, according to the Conviction of our Minds; and his <hi>Work</hi> it is to enable us to perform them.</p>
               <p>4. He that will indulge, or can do so, unto <hi>sloth</hi> and negligence in himself on the account of the promised working of the Spirit of Grace, may look upon it as an evidence, that he hath <hi>no interest</hi> or concern therein. For he ordinarily giveth not out his <hi>Aids</hi> and Assistances any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but where he prepares the Soul with Diligence in Duty. And whereas he acts us no otherwise but in and by the Faculties of our own Minds, it is ridiculous, and implies a Contradiction, for a Man to say he
<hi>will do nothing,</hi> because the Spirit of God doth all; For where <hi>he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> the Spirit of God doth <hi>nothing,</hi> unless it be meerly in the infusion of the <hi>first Habit</hi> or Principle of Grace, whereof we shall treat after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>For Degrees of Grace</hi> and Holiness which are enquired after, they are peculiar unto <hi>Believers.</hi> Now these are furnished with an Ability and Power to attend unto and perform those Duties, whereon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Grace and Holiness doth depend. For although there is no Grace, nor Degree of Grace or Holiness in Believers, but what is wrought in them by the Spirit of God; yet ordinarily and regularly the
<hi>Increase</hi> and <hi>Growth</hi> of Grace, and their thriving in Holiness and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, depend upon the Use and Improvement of Grace received, in a diligent Attendance unto all those Duties of Obedience which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7. And me-thinks it is the most unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and sottish thing in the World, for a Man to be <hi>slothful</hi> and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in attending unto those Duties which God requireth of him, which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48389:93"/> all his Spiritual Growth depends upon, which the eternal welfare of his Soul is concerned in, on pretence of the efficacious <hi>Aids</hi> of the Spirit, without which he can do nothing, and which he neither hath, nor can have, whilst he doth nothing.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> Seventhly; We may observe that in the Actings and Works of the Holy Spirit, some things are <hi>distinctly</hi> and <hi>separately</hi> ascribed unto him, although some things be of the same kind wrought by the Person in and by whom he Acts; or he is said at the same time to do the same thing distinctly by himself, and in and by others. So <hi>John 15. 26, 27. I will,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>send the Spirit of Truth, and he shall testifie of me, and ye also shall bear witness.</hi> The Witness of the Spirit unto Christ is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>separate</hi> from the witness given by the Apostles. He
<hi>shall testifie of me,</hi> and <hi>ye also shall bear witness.</hi> And yet they also were enabled to give their witness by him alone. So it is expresly declared, Acts 1. 8. <hi>Ye shall receive Power after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you, and ye shall be Witnesses unto me.</hi> Their <hi>witnessing unto Christ</hi> was the Effect of the Power of the Holy Spirit upon them, and the Effect of his Work in them. And he himself gave no other Testimony but in and by them. What then is the distinct Testimony that is ascribed unto him? It must be somewhat that in or by whomsoever it was wrought, it did of its own Nature discover its <hi>Relation</hi> unto him as <hi>his</hi> Work. So it was in this Matter; For it was no other but those <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Effects which he wrought, in the confirmation of the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny given by the Apostles, all which clearly evidenced their own Original. So our Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4. The word was confirmed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>God co-witnessing by Signs and Wonders.</hi> He enabled the Apostles to bear witness unto Christ by their Preaching, Sufferings, Holiness, and constant Testimony which they gave unto his Resurrection. But in this he appeared not, he evidenced not himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, though he did so in and by them in whom he wrought. But moreover he wrought such visible miraculous Works by them, as evidenced themselves to be Effects of his Power, and were his distinct Witness to Christ. So our Apostle tells us, <hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it self beareth witness with our Spirits that we are the Children of God.</hi> The Witness which our <hi>own Spirits</hi> do give unto our Adoption, is the Work and Effect of the Holy Spirit in us. If it were not, it would be false, and not confirmed by the Testimony of the Spirit himself, who is the Spirit of Truth. and none <hi>knoweth the things of God, but the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 11. If he declare not our <hi>Sonship</hi> in us, and to us, we cannot know it. How then doth he <hi>bear witness</hi> with our Spirits? What is his distinct Testimony in this Matter? It must be some such Act of his, as evidenceth it self to be from him immediately, unto them that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48389:93"/> are concerned in it, that is, those unto whom it is given. What this is in particular, and wherein it doth consist, we shall afterwards enquire. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. The <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Bride say come.</hi> The <hi>Bride</hi> is the Church, and she prayeth for the coming of Christ. This She doth by his Aid and Assistance, who is the Spirit of Grace and Supplications. And yet distinctly and separately the <hi>Spirit saith come;</hi> that is, he puts forth such earnest and fervent desires, as have upon them an Impression of his immediate efficiency. So <hi>v.</hi> 20. carrieth the sense of the place, namely, that it is Christ himself, unto whom She sayes <hi>come,</hi> or they pray for the hastning of his coming. Or they say <hi>come</hi> unto others, in their Invitation of them unto Christ, as the end of <hi>v.</hi> 17. seems to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it. Then is it the Prayers and Preaching of the Church for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of Souls that is intended. And with both the Spirit works emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to make them effectual. Or it may be in this place, the <hi>Spirit</hi> is taken for the <hi>Spirit in the Guides and Leaders of the Church.</hi> They praying by his especial Guidance and Assistance, say, <hi>Come;</hi> or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers say unto others. <hi>Come,</hi> and the <hi>Bride,</hi> or the Body of the Church acted by the same Spirit, joyn with them in this great Request and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; and thereunto all Believers are invited in the following words; and <hi>let him that heareth, say, Come.</hi>

<hi>New Creation,</hi> the Foundation of the Gospel-State and Church. But this was not the whole of the Work he had to do. As he had provided and prepared the <hi>Natural Body</hi> of Christ, so he was to prepare his <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Body</hi> also. And hereby the Work of the New Creation was to be compleated and perfected.

Neither was there in any Man living the least Principle of Spiritual Life, or any Disposition thereunto. In this State of things the Holy Spirit undertaketh to create <hi>a New World,</hi> New Heavens, and a New Earth, wherein Righteousness should dwell. And this in the first place was by his Effectual Communication of a New Principle of <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> unto the Souls of God's Elect, who were the Matter designed of God for this Work to be wrought upon.

Although the Work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> by the Holy Spirit was wrought under the Old Testament, even from the Foundation of the World; and the Doctrine of it was recorded in the Scriptures, yet the Revelation of it was but obscure in comparison of that <hi>Light</hi> and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which it is brought forth into by the Gospel. This is evident from the Discourse which our Blessed Saviour had with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> on this Subject. For when he acquainted him clearly with the Doctrine of it, he was surprized and fell into that enquiry which argued some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement;
<hi>How can these things be?</hi> But yet the Reply of our Saviour manifests, That he might have attained a better acquaintance with it out of the Scripture than he had done. <hi>Art thou</hi> saith he, <hi>a Master in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and knowest not these things?</hi> Dost thou take upon thee to Teach others what is their State and Condition, and what is their Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and art ignorant thy self of so Great and Fundamental a Doctrine, which thou mightest have learned from the Scripture? For if he might not so have done, there would have been no just cause of the Reproof given him by our Saviour. For it was neither Crime nor Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in him to be ignorant of what God had not revealed. This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therefore, namely, That every one who will enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God must be <hi>born again</hi> of the Holy Spirit, was contained in the Writings of the Old Testament. It was so in the Promises, That God
<hi>would circumcise the Hearts of his People, that he would take away their Heart of Stone,</hi> and <hi>give them a Heart of Flesh,</hi> with his <hi>Law written in it,</hi> and other wayes as shall be afterwards proved.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> But yet we see that it was so obscurely declared, that the principal Masters and Teachers of the People knew little or nothing of it. Some
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48389:96"/> indeed would have this <hi>Regeneration,</hi> if they knew what they would have, or as to what may be gathered of their minds, out of their great swelling words of vanity, to be nothing but <hi>Reformation of Life,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of the Scripture. But <hi>Nicodemus</hi> knew the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Reformation of Life well enough, if he had ever read either
<hi>Moses</hi> or the Prophets. And to suppose that our Lord Jesus Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto him the thing which he knew perfectly well, only under a new Name or Notion which he had never heard of before: So to take an advantage of charging him with being ignorant of what indeed he full well knew and understood, is a blasphemous Imagination. How they can free themselves from the Guilt hereof, who look on <hi>Regeneration</hi> as no more but a <hi>Metaphorical Expression</hi> of Amendment of Life, I know not. And if it be so, if there be no more in it, but as they love to speak, <hi>becoming a new Moral Man,</hi> a thing which all the World, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> understood; our Lord Jesus was so far from bringing it forth into more <hi>Light,</hi> and giving it more perspicuity, by what he teacheth concerning <hi>Regeneration,</hi> the Nature, Manner, Causes and Effects of it, that he cast it thereby into more darkness and obscurity than ever it was delivered in, either by <hi>Jewish</hi> Masters, or <hi>Gentile Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</hi> For although the Gospel do really teach all Duties of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with more exactness and clearness, and press unto the Observance of them, on motives incomparably more cogent than any thing that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise ever befel the Mind of Man to think or apprehend; yet if it must be supposed to intend nothing else in its Doctrine of the New Birth or Regeneration, but those Moral Duties and their Observance, it is dark and unintelligible; I say, if there be not a <hi>secret mysterious</hi> Work of the Spirit of God, in and upon the Souls of Men intended in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the New Testament, but only a <hi>Reformation of Life,</hi> and the Improvement of Mens Natural Abilities in the Exercise of <hi>Moral Virtue,</hi> through the Application of outward means unto their Minds and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, conducting and perswading thereunto; they must be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be obscure, beyond those of any other Writers whatsoever, as some have not feared already to publish unto the World concerning the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of <hi>Paul.</hi> But so long as we can obtain an acknowledgment from Men, that they are <hi>true,</hi> and in any sense the <hi>Word of God,</hi> we doubt not but to evince that the things intended in them, are clearly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly expressed, so as they ought to be, and so as they are capable to be expressed; The Difficulties which seem to be in them, arising from the <hi>Mysterious Nature</hi> of the things themselves contained in them, and the weakness of our Minds in apprehending such things, and not from any obscurity or intricacy in the Declaration of them. And herein indeed consists the main Contest whereunto things with the most are reduced. Some judg that all things are so expressed in the Scripture with a conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sension unto our Capacity, so as that there is still to be conceived an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible Grandure in many of them beyond our Comprehension. Others judg on the other hand, That under a Grandure of Words and Hyperbolical Expressions, things of a meaner and a lower sense are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and to be understood. Some judg the Things of the Gospel to be deep and mysterious, the Words and Expressions of it to be plain and proper: Others think the Words and Expressions of it to be Mystical

                  </gap>s of much or less Fruit, the Work it self in its own Nature is of the <hi>same kind,</hi> one and the same. The Elect of God were not regenerate one way, by one kind of Operation of the Holy Spirit, under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and those under the New Testament another. They who were miraculously Converted, as <hi>Paul,</hi> or who upon their Conversion had miraculous Gifts bestowed on them, as had multitudes of the Primitive Christians, were no otherwise regenerate, nor by any other <hi>internal Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Holy Spirit,</hi> then every one is at this day, who is really made Partaker of this Grace and Priviledg. Neither were those Miraculous Operations of the Holy Spirit, which were visible unto others, any part of the Work of Regeneration, nor did they belong necessarily unto it. For many were the Subjects of them, and received miraculous Gifts by them, who were <hi>never</hi> Regenerate; and many were Regenerate who were never Partakers of them. And it is a Fruit of the highest Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Unacquaintedness imaginable with these things, to affirm that in the <hi>Work of Regeneration,</hi> the Holy Spirit wrought of old <hi>miraculously</hi> in and by outwardly visible Operations, but now only in an <hi>humane and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way,</hi> leading our Understanding by the Rules of Reason, unless the more external <hi>Mode</hi> and <hi>Sign</hi> of his Operation be intended. For all ever were and ever shall be Regenerate by the same kind of Operation, and the same Effect of the Holy Spirit on the Faculties of their Souls. Which will be farther manifest if we consider;</p>
               <p>1. That the Condition of all Men as Unregenerate is <hi>absolutely the same,</hi> One is not by Nature more <hi>unregenerate</hi> than another. All Men since the Fall, and the corruption of our Nature by sin, are in the same State and Condition towards God. They are all alike alienated from him, and all alike under his Curse, <hi>Psal. 51. 5. John 3. 5, 36. Rom. 3. 19. Chap. 5. 15, 16, 17, 18. Ephes. 2. 3. Tit.</hi> 3, 3. 4. There are <hi>Degrees of Wickedness</hi> in them that are Unregenerate; but there is no difference as to <hi>State</hi> and Condition between them, all are Unregenerate alike. As amongst those who are Regenerate, there are different <hi>Degrees of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> and Righteousness, one it may be far exceeding another; yet there is between them no difference of State and Condition, they are all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48389:98"/> equally Regenerate. Yea some may be in a greater forwardness and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the Work it self, and thereby in a greater <hi>nearness</hi> to the State of it than others; but the State it self is incapable of such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Now it must be the <hi>same Work</hi> for the Kind and Nature of it, which relieves and translates Men out of the <hi>same State</hi> and Condition. That which gives the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of the change of their State, of their Translation from Death to Life is and must be the same in all. If you can fix on any Man from the Foundation of the World, who was not equally <hi>born in sin,</hi> and by Nature dead in Trespasses and Sins with all other Men, the Man Christ Jesus only excepted, I would grant that he <hi>might</hi> have another kind of Regeneration than others have, but that I know he would stand in need of none at all.</p>

Nor is it in its Essence or Nature capable of Degrees, so that one should be more Regenerate than another. Every one that is born of God is equally so, though one may be more beautiful than another, as having the Image of his Heavenly Father more <hi>evidently</hi> impressed on him, though not more <hi>truly.</hi> Men may be more or less Holy, more or less Sanctified; but they cannot be more or less Regenerate. All Children that are born into the World, are <hi>equally born,</hi> though some quickly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip others in the Perfections and Accomplishments of Nature. And all born of God are <hi>equally so,</hi> though some speedily out-go others in the Accomplishments and Perfections of Grace. There was then never but one kind of Regeneration in this World, the Essential Form of it being
<hi>specifically</hi> the same in all.</p>
               <p>3. That the Efficient Cause of this Work, the Grace and Power whereby it is wrought, with the internal manner of the Communication of that Grace, are the same, shall be afterwards declared. To this Standard then all must come. Men may bear themselves high, and despise this whole Work of the Spirit of God, or set up an Imagination of their own in the room thereof; but whether they will or no, they must be tryed by it; and no less depends on their interest in it, than their Admission into the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi> And let them pretend what they please, the true Reason why any despise the <hi>New Birth,</hi> is because they hate a <hi>New Life.</hi> He that cannot endure to <hi>live to God,</hi> will as little endure to hear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

For the dispute in this Matter is not whether the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the Gospel, as Baptism, do really communicate internal Grace unto them, that are, as to their outward manner of their Administration, duly made Partakers of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

For the present the ensuing Reasons will serve to remove it out of our way.</p>

Regeneration doth not consist in these things which are only <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Signs</hi> and Tokens of it, or at most, instituted means of effecting it. For the <hi>Nature</hi> of thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is different and distinct from the <hi>Means,</hi> and Evidences or Pledges of them. But such only is <hi>Baptism,</hi> with the Profession of the Doctrine of it, as is acknowledged by all who have Treated of the Nature of that Sacrament. (2.) The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally states this Case, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 21. In answer whereunto even Baptism doth also now save us; not the putting away of the filth of the Flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience towards God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</hi> The outward Administration of this Ordinance considered <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially,</hi> reacheth no farther, but to the washing away of the filth of the Flesh, but more is signified thereby. There is denoted in it the Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of a <hi>good Conscience</hi> unto God, by the Resurrection of Christ from the Dead, or a Conscience purged from Dead Works to serve the Living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. and quickned by vertue of his Resurrection unto Holy Obedience; see <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. (3.) The Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly distinguish between the <hi>outward</hi> Ordinances, with what belongs unto a due participation of them, and the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation it self; Gal. 6. 15. <hi>In Jesus Christ neither Circumcision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth any thing, nor Uncircumcision availeth any thing, but a New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> For as by Circumcision the whole System of <hi>Mosaical</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances is intended, so the state of <hi>Uncircumcision,</hi> as then it was in the Professing Gentiles, supposed a Participation of all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Gospel. But from them all he distinguisheth the <hi>New Creation,</hi> as that which they may be without, and which being so, they are not available in Christ Jesus. (4.) It this were so, then all that are
<hi>duly Baptized,</hi> and do thereon make profession of the Doctrine of it, that is, of Repentance for the forgiveness of Sins, must of <hi>necessity</hi> be
<hi>Regenerate.</hi> But this we know to be otherwise. For instance; <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Megician</hi> was rightly and duly Baptized, for he was so by <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Evangelist;</hi> which he could not be without a Profession of Faith and Repentance; accordingly it is said that <hi>he believed,</hi> Acts 8. 13. that is, made a profession of his Faith in the Gospel. Yet he was not
<hi>Regenerate,</hi> for at the same time he had <hi>no part or lot in that Matter,</hi> his Heart not being right in the sight of God, but was in the <hi>Gall of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness, and Bond of Iniquity,</hi> v. 21, 23. which is not the Description of a Person newly Regenerate and Born again. Hence the <hi>Cabbalistical Jews,</hi> who grope in darkness after the old Notions of Truth that were among their Forefathers, do say, That at the same instant wherein a Man is made <hi>a Proselyte of Righteousness,</hi> there comes a <hi>New Soul</hi> into him from Heaven, his old <hi>Pagan Soul</hi> vanishing or being taken away. The Introduction of a New Spiritual Principle, to be <hi>that</hi> unto the Soul which the Soul is unto the Body naturally, is that which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48389:99"/> or they chuse thus to express the reiterated Promise of taking away the <hi>Heart of Stone,</hi> and giving an Heart of Flesh in the place of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> Secondly; Regeneration doth not consist in a <hi>Moral Reformation</hi> Life and Conversation. Let us suppose such a <hi>Reformation</hi> to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive unto all known Instances. Suppose a Man be changed from Sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality unto Temperance, from Rapine to Righteousness, from Pride and the Dominion of Irregular Passions, unto Humility and Moderation, with all Instances of the like Nature which we can imagine, or are prescribed in the Rules of the strictest <hi>Moralists?</hi> Suppose this change be laboured, exact and accurate, and so of great use in the World. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose also that a Man hath been brought and perswaded unto it, through the <hi>preaching of the Gospel,</hi> so escaping the <hi>Pollutions that are in the World through Lust, even by the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> or the Directions of his Doctrine delivered in the Gospel; yet I say all this, and all this added unto <hi>Baptism,</hi> accompanied with a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith and Repentance,</hi> is not <hi>Regeneration,</hi> nor do they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize it in them. And I have extended this Assertion beyond what some among us, so far as I can see, do so much as pretend unto, in their confused Notions and sophistical Expressions about Morality, when they make it the same with Grace. But what-ever there may be of <hi>Actual</hi> Righteousness in these things, they do not express an inherent <hi>habitual</hi> Righteousness, which whosoever denies, overthrows the Gospel, and all the whole Work of the Spirit of God, and of the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>But we must stay a while. This Assertion of ours is by some not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyed but derided. Neither is that all, but who-ever maintains it, is exposed as an Enemy to <hi>Morality,</hi> Righteousness, and Reformation of Life. All <hi>Vertue,</hi> they say, is hereby excluded, to introduce I know not what <hi>imaginary Godliness.</hi> But whether we oppose or exclude
<hi>Moral Vertue</hi> or no, by the Doctrine of Regeneration or any other, God and Christ will in due time judg and declare. Yea, were the confession of the Truth consistent with their Interests, the decision of this doubt might be referred unto their own Consciences. But being not free to commit any thing to that <hi>Tribunal,</hi> unless we had better security of its freedom from corrupt Principles and Prejudices than we have, we shall at present leave all the World to judg of our Doctrine, with respect unto <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> by the Fruits of it, compared with theirs, by whom it is denied. In the mean time we affirm that we design nothing in
<hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> but to improve them by fixing them on a proper Foundation, or ingraf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And for the Assertion laid down, I desire that those who despise and reproach it, would attempt an Answer unto the ensuing Arguments whereby it is confirmed; with those other which shall be insisted on in our Description of the Nature of the Work of Regeneration it self; and that upon such Grounds and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48389:100"/> Principles as are not destructive of Christian Religion, nor introductive of <hi>Atheism,</hi> before they are too confident of their success.</p>

Three things are to be observed for the clearing of this Assertion, before we come to the Proof and Confirmation of it. As, (1.) That this <hi>Reformation of Life,</hi> which we say is not Regeneration, or that Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not consist therein, is a <hi>necessary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> indispensibly required of all Men. For we shall take it here for the whole course of <hi>Actual Obedience</hi> unto God, and that according to the Gospel. Those indeed by whom it is urged and pressed in the room of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or as that wherein Regeneration doth consist, do give such an Account and Description of it, as that it is, or at least may be Foreign unto true Gospel-Obedience, and so not contain in it one <hi>Acceptable Duty</hi> unto God, as shall afterwards be declared. But here I shall take it in our present enquiry, for that whole <hi>Course of Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

This Doctrine I am sure was not learned from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> whereof some used to boast: Nay, it is much more fulsome than any thing ever taught by <hi>Pelagius</hi> himself, who indeed ascribed more unto Grace than these Men do, although he denied this Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a New Principle of Grace in us, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent unto Acts of Obedience.<note n="*" place="margin">Adjuvat nos Deus (<hi>the words of</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius) per doctrinam &amp; revelationem suam, dum cordis nostri oculos aperit, dum nobis, ne praesentibus occupemure, futura demonstrat, dum Diaboli pandit insidias, dum nos multiformi &amp; ineffabili dono gratiae caelestis illuminat. <hi>August.</hi> lib. de Grat. cont. <hi>Pelag.</hi> &amp; <hi>Caelest.</hi> cap. 7.</note> And this turning all Scripture-Expressions of Spiritual Things into <hi>Metaphors,</hi> is but a way to turn the whole into a Fable, or at least to render the Gospel the most obscure and improper way

(1.) The Foundation of the whole is laid in our being <hi>renewed in the Spirit of our Mind;</hi> which the same Apostle else-where calls, being <hi>transformed in the Renovation of our Minds,</hi> Rom. 12. 2.

And (2.) the Principle it self infused into us, created in us, is called the <hi>New Man,</hi> v. 24. That is the <hi>New Creature</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; and called the <hi>New Man,</hi> because it consists in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal change of the whole Soul, as it is the principle of all Spiritual and Moral Actions. And (1.) it is opposed unto the <hi>Old Man,</hi> vers. 23. put off the Old Man and put on the New Man, vers. 22, 24. Now this <hi>Old Man</hi> is the corruption of our Nature, as that Nature is the Principle of all Religious, Spiritual and Moral Actions, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. It is not a <hi>corrupt Conversation,</hi> but the Principle and Root of it. For it is distinguished both from the Conversation of Men, and those corrupt lusts which are exercised therein as to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise. And (2.) it is called the <hi>New Man,</hi> because it is the Effect and Product of God's Creating Power, and that in a way of <hi>a New Creation;</hi> see <hi>Ephes. 1. 18. Col. 2. 12, 13. 2 Thess.</hi> 1. 11. and it is here said to be <hi>Created after God,</hi> v. 24. Now the Object of a Creating Act is an <hi>instantaneous Production.</hi> What-ever preparations there may be for it, and dispositions unto it, the bringing forth of a new Form and Being by Creation, is in an instant. This therefore cannot consist in a mere Reformation of Life. So are we said herein to be the <hi>Workmanship of God created in Christ Jesus unto good Works,</hi> Ephes. 2. 10. There is a Work of God in us precedeing all our good Works towards him. For before we can work any of them, in order of Nature, we must be the

Now this did not consist in <hi>Reformation of Life,</hi> no nor in a course of vertuous Actions; For he was created in the Image of God, before he had done any one good thing at all, or was capable of so doing. But this Image of God consisted principally, as we have evinced elsewhere, in the Uprightness, Rectitude, and Ability of his whole Soul, his Mind, Will, and Affections, in, unto, and for the Obedience that God required of him. This he was endowed withal <hi>antecedently</hi> unto all voluntary Actions whereby he was to live to God. Such therefore must be our Regeneration, or the Creation of this New Man in us.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>23</label> Hereunto accords that of our Saviour, <hi>Luk. 6. 43. A good Tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not forth corrupt Fruit, neither doth a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit;</hi> compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 18. The Fruit followeth the Nature of the Tree. And there is no way to change the Nature of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> but by changing the Nature of the <hi>Tree</hi> which brings it forth. Now all Amendment of Life in Reformation is but <hi>Fruit,</hi> Matth. 3. 10. But the changing of our Nature is antecedent hereunto. This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Course and Tenor of the Scripture, to distinguish between the
<hi>Grace of Regeneration,</hi> which it declares to be an immediate supernatural Work of God in us and upon us, and all that Obedience, Holiness, Righteousness, Vertue, or what-ever is good in us, which is the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, Product, and Effect of it. Yea, God hath declared this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Covenant, <hi>Ezek. 36. 25, 26, 27. Jer. 31. 33. Chap.</hi> 32. 39, 40. The Method of God's proceeding with us in his Covenant is, that he first <hi>washeth</hi> and <hi>cleanseth</hi> our <hi>Natures,</hi> takes away the Heart of Stone, gives an Heart of Flesh, writes his Law in our Hearts, puts his Spirit in us, wherein as shall be evidenced the Grace of Regeneration doth consist. The Effect and Consequent hereof is, That we shall <hi>walk in his Statutes,</hi> keep <hi>his Judgments and do them;</hi> that is, reform our Lives, and yeeld all Holy Obedience unto God; wherefore these things are distinguished as
<hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Effects.</hi> See to the same purpose, <hi>Rom. 6. 3, 4, 5, 6. Col.</hi> 3. 1, 5. <hi>Ephes. 2. 10. Chap.</hi> 4. 23, 24, 25. This I insist upon still, on supposition, that by <hi>Reformation of Life,</hi> all Actual Obedience is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For as to that kind of Life which is properly called a <hi>moral course of Life,</hi> in opposition to open Debaucheries and Unrighteousness, which doth not proceed from an internal Principle of Saving Grace; It is so far from being Regeneration or Grace, as that it is a thing of no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with God absolutely, what-ever Use or Reputation it may be of in the World.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>24</label> And yet further; This Work is described to consist in the <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48389:102"/> of the whole Spirit, Soul, and Body,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 23. And if this be that which some men intend by <hi>Reformation of Life</hi> and Moral Vertue, they must needs win much esteem, for their clearness and perspicuity in teaching Spiritual Things. For who would not admire them for such a Definition of <hi>Morality,</hi> namely, that it is the principal Sanctification of the whole Spirit, Soul and Body of a Believer by the Holy Ghost? But not to dwell longer on this Subject, There is no description of the Work of Regeneration in the Scripture, in its <hi>Nature, Causes,</hi> or <hi>Effects,</hi> no
<hi>Name</hi> given unto it, no <hi>promise</hi> made of it, nothing spoken of the Wayes, Means, or Power by which it is wrought, but is inconsistent with this bold <hi>Pelagian Figment,</hi> which is destructive of the Grace of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>The ground of this Imagination, that <hi>Regeneration consists in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reformation of Life,</hi> ariseth from a denial of Original Sin, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent habitual corruption of Nature. For the <hi>Masters</hi> unto the Men of this Perswasion tell us, that what-ever is of <hi>vice</hi> or <hi>defilement</hi> in us, it is contracted by a custom of sinning only. And their Conceptions hereof do regulate their Opinions about Regeneration. For if Man be not originally corrupted and polluted, if his Nature be not depraved, if it be not possessed by, and under the Power of evil Dispositions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, it is certain that he stands in no need of an <hi>inward Spiritual Renovation of it.</hi> It is enough for such a one, that by change of Life he renounce a <hi>custom of sinning,</hi> and reform his Conversation according to the Gospel, which in himself he hath power to do. But as it hath been in part already manifested, and will fully, God assisting, be evinced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that in our Regeneration the native <hi>Ignorance,</hi> Darkness and Blindness of our Minds are dispelled, Saving and Spiritual Light being introduced by the Power of God's Grace into them, That the <hi>pravity</hi> and stubbornness of our Wills are removed and taken away, a new principle of Spiritual Life and Righteousness being bestowed on them, and that the <hi>Disorder</hi> and Rebellion of our Affections are cured, by the infusion of the Love of God into our Souls; so the corrupt Imagination of the contrary Opinion directly opposite to the Doctrine of the Scriptures, the Faith of the Antient Church, and the Experience of all sincere Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, hath amongst us of late nothing but Ignorance and ready Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence produced to give countenance unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>25</label> Thirdly; The Work of the Holy Spirit in Regeneration doth not consist in <hi>Enthusiastical Raptures, Extasies, Voices,</hi> or any thing of the like kind. It may be some such things have been by some deluded Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons apprehended or pretended unto. But the countenancing of any such Imaginations, is falsly and injuriously charged on them, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the powerful and <hi>effectual Work</hi> of the Holy Spirit in our Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this some are prone to do, wherein whether they discover more of their Ignorance, or of their Malice I know not, but nothing is more common with them. All whom in this Matter they dissent from, so far as they know what they say, or whereof they affirm, do teach Men to look after <hi>Enthusiastick Inspirations,</hi> or unaccountable <hi>Raptures,</hi> and to esteem them for Conversion unto God, although in the mean time they live in a <hi>neglect of Holiness and Righteousness</hi> of Conversation. I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48389:102"/> Answer, if there be those who do so, we doubt not but that without their Repentance, the Wrath of God will come upon them as upon other Children of Disobedience. And yet in the mean time we cannot but call aloud, that others would discover their diligence in attendance unto these things, who as far as I can discern, do cry up the Names of
<hi>Virtue and Righteousness,</hi> in opposition to the Grace of Jesus Christ, and that Holiness which is a Fruit thereof. But for the Reproach now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Consideration, it is as applyed, no other but a <hi>Calumny</hi> and false Accusation. And that it is so, the Writings and Preachings of those who have most diligently laboured in the Declaration of the Work of the Holy Spirit in our Regeneration, will bear Testimony at the great Day of the Lord. We may therefore as unto this <hi>Negative Principle</hi> observe three things. (1.) That the Holy Spirit in this Work doth ordinarily put forth his Power in and by the <hi>use of Means.</hi> He worketh also on Men suitably unto their Natures, even as the Faculties of their Souls, their Minds, Wills, and Affections, are meet to be affected and wrought upon. He doth not come upon them with <hi>involuntary Raptures,</hi> using their Faculties and Powers, as the Evil Spirit wrests the Bodies of them whom he possesseth; His whole Work therefore is <hi>rationally</hi> to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, by and unto them who believe the Scripture, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive. The <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal efficiency</hi> of the Spirit indeed, in the putting forth the exceeding greatness of his Power, in our <hi>quickning;</hi> Which the Ancient Church constantly calleth his <hi>Inspiration</hi> of Grace, both in private Writing, and Canons of Councils, is no otherwise to be comprehended by us, than any other Creating Act of Divine Power: for as we hear the Wind but know not from whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth, so is every one that is born of God; yet these two things are certain herein. First, That he worketh nothing, nor any other way, nor by any other means, than what are determined and declared in the <hi>Word.</hi> By that therefore may, and must every thing, really belonging, or pretended to belong unto this Work of Regeneration, be tryed and examined. Secondly; That he acts nothing contrary unto, puts no force upon any of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of our Souls, but works in them and by them suitably to their Natures; and being more intimate unto them, as <hi>Austin</hi> speaks, than they are unto themselves, by an Almighty Facility he produceth the Effect which he intendeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> This great Work therefore, neither in part nor whole, consists in
<hi>Raptures, Extasies, Visions, Enthusiastick Inspirations,</hi> but in the Effect of the Power of the Spirit of God on the Souls of Men, by and according to his Word, both of the Law and the Gospel. And those who charge these things on them, who have asserted, declared, and preached it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, do it probably to countenance themselves in their hatred of them, and of the Work it self. Wherefore 2dly, where by Reason of <hi>Distempers of Mind,</hi> Disorder of Fancy, or long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of distressing Fears and Sorrows, in and under such Preparatory Works of the Spirit, which sometimes <hi>cut Men to their Hearts</hi> in the sense of their sin, and sinful lost condition, any do fall into Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or Imaginations of any thing <hi>extraordinary</hi> in the wayes before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, if it be not quickly and strictly brought unto the Rule, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48389:103"/> discarded thereby, it may be of great danger unto their Souls, and is never of any solid Use or Advantage. Such Apprehensions for the most part are either Conceptions of distempered Minds, <hi>and discomposed Fancies,</hi> or Delusions of Satan transforming himself into an Angel of Light, which the Doctrine of Regeneration ought not to be accountable for. Yet I must say, (3dly,) That so it is come to pass, that many of those who have been really made Partakers of this gracious Work of the Holy Spirit, have been looked on in the World, which knows them not, as <hi>mad, Enthusiastick</hi> and <hi>Fanatical.</hi> So the Captains of the Host esteemed the Prophet that came to anoint <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 Kings 9. 11. And the Kindred of our Saviour, when he began to Preach the Gospel, said, He was <hi>besides himself,</hi> or <hi>extatical,</hi> Mark 3. 21. and they went out to lay hold of him. So <hi>Festus</hi> judged of <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 26. 24, 25. And the Author of the Book of <hi>Wisdom</hi> gives us an account what acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments some will make when it shall be too late, as to their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; Chap. 5. 3, 4, 5. <hi>They shall say, crying out, because of the trouble of their Minds; This is he whom we accounted a scorn, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reproach, We Fools esteemed his Life madness, and his latter End to have been shameful; but how is he reckoned among the Sons of God, and his Lot is among the Holy Ones.</hi> From what hath been spoken it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>26</label> Fourthly; That the Work of the Spirit of God in Regenerating the Souls of Men, is diligently to be enquired into by the <hi>Preaching of the Gospel,</hi> and all to whom the Word is dispensed. For the former sort, there is a peculiar Reason for their Attendance unto this Duty. For they are used and employed in the Work it self by the Spirit of God, and are by him made <hi>instrumental</hi> for the effecting of this New Birth and Life. So the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> stiles himself the <hi>Father</hi> of them who were Converted to God, or <hi>Regenerate</hi> through the Word of his Ministry: 1 Cor. 4. 15. <hi>Though you have ten thousand Instructers in Christ, yet have you not many Fathers, for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel.</hi> He was used in the Ministry of the Word for their Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore was their <hi>Spiritual Father,</hi> and he only, though the Work was afterwards carried on by others. And if Men are Fathers in the Gospel to no more than are Converted unto God by their Personal Ministry, it will be no Advantage unto any, one day, to have assumed that Title, when it hath had no Foundation in that Work as to its effectual success. So speaking of <hi>Onesimus,</hi> who was Converted by him in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he calls him <hi>his Son whom he had begotten in his Bonds,</hi> Philem. 10. and this he declared to have been prescribed unto him as the Principal End of his Ministry, in the Commission he had for Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<hi>Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18. Christ said unto him, <hi>I send thee unto the Gentiles to open their Eyes, to turn them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God;</hi> which is a Description of the Work under Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And this is the principal End of <hi>our</hi> Ministry also. Now certainly it is the Duty of Ministers to understand the Work about which they are employed, as far as they are able, that they may not Work in the Dark, and Fight Uncertainly, as Men beating the Air, What the Scripture hath revealed concerning it, as to its Nature, and the manner of its Operation; as to its Causes, Effects, Fruits, Evidences, they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48389:103"/> ought diligently to enquire into. To be <hi>spiritually skilled</hi> herein, is one of the principal Furnishments of any for the Work of the Ministry, without which they will never be able to <hi>divide the Word aright,</hi> nor shew themselves Workmen that need not be ashamed. Yet is it scarcely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable with what rage and perversity of Spirit, with what scornful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions this whole Work is traduced, and exposed to contempt. Those who have laboured herein, are said <hi>to prescribe long and tedious trains of Conversion, to set down nice and subtile Processes of Regeneration, to fill Peoples Heads with innumerable Swarms of Superstitious Fears and Scruples about the due Degrees of Godly Sorrow, and the certain Symptoms of a through-Humiliation,</hi> p. 306, 307. Could any mistake be charged on particular Persons in these things, or the prescribing of Rules about Conversion to God and Regeneration, that are not warranted by the Word of Truth, it were not amiss to reflect upon them, and refute them. But the intention of these Expressions is evident, and the reproach in them is cast upon the Work of God it self. And I must profess, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Degeneracy from the Truth and Power of Christian Religion; the Ignorance of the principal Doctrines of the Gospel, and that scorn which is cast in these and the like Expressions on the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, by such as not only profess themselves to be Ministers, but of an higher Degree than ordinary, will be sadly ominous unto the whole State of the Reformed Church amongst us, if not timely repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and corrected. But what at present I affirm in this Matter is, That it is a Duty indispensibly incumbent on all <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themselves throughly with the Nature of this Work, that they may be able to comply with the Will of God, and Grace of the Spirit in the Effecting and Accomplishment of it, upon the Souls of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom they dispense the Word. Neither without some competent knowledg hereof, can they discharge <hi>any one part</hi> of their Duty and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in a right manner. If all that hear them are born dead in Trespasses and Sins, if they are appointed of God to be the Instruments of their Regeneration, It is a madness which must one day be accounted for, to neglect a sedulous enquiry into the Nature of this Work, and the means whereby it is wrought. And the ignorance hereof, or negligence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with the want of an Experience of the Power of this Work in their own Souls, is one great cause of that lifeless and unprofitable Ministry which is among us.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>27</label> Secondly; It is likewise the Duty of all to whom the Word is Preached to enquire also into it; It is unto such to whom the Apostle speaks, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Examine your selves whether you be in the Faith, prove your own selves; know you not your own Selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be Reprobates.</hi> It is the Concernment of all individual Christians, or Professors of Christian Religion, to try and examine themselves what Work of the Spirit of God, there hath been upon their hearts; and none will deter them from it, but those who have a design to hoodwink them to Perdition. And (1.) the Doctrine of it is revealed and taught us. <hi>For secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our Children for ever, that we may do all the Words of the Law,</hi> Deut. 29. 29. And we
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48389:104"/> speak not of curious Enquiries into, or after hidden things, or the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret veiled Actions of the Holy Spirit; but only of an upright endeavour to search into, and comprehend the Doctrine concerning this Work, to this very end, that we might understand it. (2.) It is of such Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto all our Duties, and all our Comforts, to have a due Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the Nature of this Work, and of our own Concernment therein, that an enquiry into the one and the other cannot be neglected without the greatest folly and madness. Whereunto we may add, (3.) the danger that there is of Mens being <hi>deceived</hi> in this Matter, which is the <hi>Hinge</hi> whereon their Eternal State and Condition doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely turn and depend. And certain it is, that very many in the World do deceive themselves herein. For they evidently live under one of these pernicious Mistakes; namely, That (1.) either Men may go to Heaven, or enter into the Kingdom of God, and not be <hi>born again;</hi> contrary to that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 3. 6. or that Men may be <hi>born again,</hi> and yet live in sin, contrary to 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label>(1.) There are some things required of us in a way of Duty in order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Regeneration, which are so in the <hi>power of our own natural Abilities,</hi> as that nothing but corrupt prejudices and stubbornness in sinning, doth keep or hinder Men from the performance of them. And these we may reduce unto two Heads. (1.) An <hi>outward Attendance</hi> unto the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Word of God, with those other external means of Grace, which accompany it, or are appointed therein. <hi>Faith cometh by Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Hearing by the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 17. that is, it is Hearing the Word of God which is the ordinary means of ingenerating Faith in the Souls of Men. This is required of all to whom the Gospel doth come, and this they are able of themselves to do, as well as any other Natural or Civil Action. And where Men do it not, where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the Word at a distance, yea, where they do it not with diligence and choice, it is meerly from <hi>supine negligence</hi> of Spiritual Things, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal security and contempt of God, which they must answer for. (2.) A diligent <hi>Intension</hi> of Mind, in attendance on the Means of Grace, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand and receive the things revealed and declared as the Mind and Will of God. For this end hath God given Men their <hi>Reasons</hi> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, that they may use and exercise them about their Duty towards him, according to the Revelation of his Mind and Will. To this purpose he calls upon them to <hi>remember that they are Men, and to turn unto him.</hi> And there is nothing herein but what is in the Liberty and Power of the rational Faculties of our Souls, assisted with those
<hi>common Aids,</hi> which God affords unto all Men in general. And great Advantages both may be, and are daily attained hereby. Persons, I say, who diligently apply their <hi>Rational Abilities</hi> in and about Spiritual Things, as externally revealed in the Word, and the Preaching of it, do usually attain great Advantages by it, and excel their Equals in other things; as <hi>Paul</hi> did when he was brought up at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel.</hi> Would Men be but as intent and diligent in their endeavours after knowledg in Spiritual Things, as revealed in a way suited unto our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities and Understandings, as they are to get skill in Crafts, Sciences, and other Mysteries of Life, it would be much otherwise with many than it is. A neglect herein also is the Fruit of Sensuality, Spiritual Sloth,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48389:105"/> love of Sin, and contempt of God, all which are the voluntary Frames and Actings of the Minds of Men.</p>

Complaints hereof against themselves will make up a great part of their last dreadful cry. (2.) In the most diligent use of outward means, Men are not <hi>able of themselves</hi> to attain unto Regeneration, or compleat Conversion to God, without an especial, effectual, internal Work of the Holy Spirit of Grace on their whole Souls. This, containing the substance of what is principally proposed unto confirmation in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Discourses, needs not here be insisted on. (3.) <hi>Ordinarily</hi> God in the effectual Dispensation of his Grace meeteth with them, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with Diligence on the outward Administration of the means of it.

<hi>previous</hi> unto Regeneration, and materially disposing the Mind thereunto. Now all the <hi>Light</hi> which by any means we attain unto, or
<hi>Knowledg</hi> that we have in or about Spiritual Things, things of superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Revelation, come under this Denomination of <hi>Illumination.</hi> And hereof there are three Degrees. (1.) That which ariseth meerly from an industrious Application of the <hi>Rational Faculties</hi> of our Souls, to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48389:106"/> know, perceive, and understand, the Doctrines of Truth as revealed unto us. For hereby much knowledg of Divine Truth may be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which others, through their negligence, sloth, and pride, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with. And this knowledg I refer unto <hi>Illumination,</hi> that is, a Light superadded to the innate conceptions of Mens Minds, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what of themselves they can extend unto; because it is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such things as the heart of Man could never of it self conceive, but the very knowledg of them is communicated by their Revelation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 11. And the reason why so very few do exercise themselves to the attaining of this Knowledg, according to their Abilities, is, because of the Enmity which is in the <hi>Carnal Minds</hi> of all Men by Nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the things themselves that are revealed. And within the compass of this Degree, I comprize all knowledg of Spiritual Things that is mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Natural. (2.) There is an <hi>Illumination</hi> which is an especial Effect of the Holy Ghost by the Word on the Minds of Men. With respect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, some who fall totally from God, and perish Eternally, are said to have been <hi>once enlightned,</hi> Heb. 6. 4. This Light variously affects the Mind, and makes a great Addition unto what is <hi>purely natural</hi> or attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the meer exercise of our Natural Abilities.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> For (1.) it adds <hi>Perspicuity</hi> unto it, making the things discerned in it more clear and perspicuous to the Mind. Hence Men endowed with it, are said to <hi>know the Way of Righteousness,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 21. clearly and distinctly to apprehend the Doctrine of the Gospel as the way of Righteousness. They know it not only or meerly as <hi>true,</hi> but as a way of <hi>Righteousness;</hi> namely, the way of God's Righteousness, which is therein revealed from Faith to Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. and the way of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness for sinners in the sight of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3, 4. (2.) It adds a greater <hi>Assent</hi> unto the Truth of the things revealed, than meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reason can rise up unto. Hence those thus <hi>Illuminated</hi> are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to <hi>believe;</hi> their Faith being only the naked Assent of their Minds unto the Truth revealed to them. So it is said of <hi>Simon</hi> the
<hi>Magician,</hi> Acts 8. 12. and of sundry of the <hi>Jews,</hi> John 2. 23, 24. Chap. 12. 42. (3.) It adds unto them some kind of <hi>evanid Joy.</hi> These receive the <hi>Word with Joy,</hi> and yet have <hi>no Root in themselves,</hi> Luke 18. 13. <hi>They rejoyce in the Light of it,</hi> at least for a Season, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 35. Persons that are thus <hi>enlightned,</hi> will be variously affected with the Word, so as they are not whose Natural Faculties are not Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Excited. (4.) It adds oft-times <hi>Gifts</hi> also, wherof this Spiritual Light is as it were the common Matter, which in Exercise is formed and fashioned in great variety. I say, this kind of <hi>Spiritual Light,</hi> the Effect of this <hi>Ilumination</hi> is the Subject Matter, and contains in it the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of all Spiritual Gifts. <hi>One sort of Gift</hi> it is, when put forth and exercised in one way, or one kind of Duty, and another as in another. And where it is improved into <hi>Gifts,</hi> which principally it is by Exercise, there it wonderfully affects the Mind, and raiseth its Apprehensions in and of Spiritual Things. Now concerning this Degree of <hi>Illumination,</hi> I say, (1.) That it is not Regeneration, nor doth it consist therein, nor doth necessarily or infallibly ensue upon it. <hi>A third Degree</hi> is required thereunto, which we shall afterwards explain. Many therefore may be thus enlightned, and yet never be converted. (2.) That in order of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48389:106"/> Nature it is <hi>previous</hi> unto a full and real Conversion to God, and is <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially preparatory</hi> and dispositive thereunto. For Saving Grace enters into the Soul by Light. As it is therefore a Gift of God, so it is the Duty of all Men, to labour after a participation of it, however by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it be abused.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> Secondly; <hi>Conviction of Sin</hi> is another Effect of the Preaching of the Word, <hi>antecedaneous</hi> unto real Conversion to God. This in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the Apostle describes, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 24, 25. If ye prophesie, and one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in who believeth not, he is convinced of all; and thus are the Secrets of his Heart made manifest, and so falling down on his Face he will Worship God.</hi> And sundry things are included herein, or do accompany it. As (1.) a <hi>disquieting sense of the guilt of Sin,</hi> with respect unto the Law of God, with his Threatnings and future Judgments. Things that before were slighted and made a <hi>mock</hi> of, do now become the Soul's Burthen and constant Disquietment. <hi>Fools make a mock of Sin;</hi> they traverse their ways, and snuff up the Wind like the wild Ass; but in their Month, when Conviction hath burthened them, you may find them. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are the Minds of Men variously affected with<note n="*" place="margin">Heu miserum nimisque miserum quem torquet Conscientia sua, quam fugere not potest; nimis miserum quem expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat Damnatio sua quam vitare non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, nisi Deus eripiat.

                  <hi>fears</hi> and anguish in various degrees, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Impressions are made upon them by the Word. And these Degrees are <hi>not prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed</hi> as necessary Duties unto Persons under their Conversions, but only <hi>described</hi> as they usually fall out to the relief and direction of such as are concerned in them. As a Man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give Directions unto another, how to guide his Course in a Voyage at Sea; he tells him, That in such a place he will meet with Rocks and Shelves, Storms and cross Winds, so that if he Steer not very heedfully, he will be in danger to miscarry and to be cast away. He doth not prescribe it unto him as his Duty, to go among such Rocks, and into such Storms, but only directs him how to guide himself in them, where he doth meet with them, as assuredly he will, if he miss not his proper Course. (2.) Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or Grief for Sin committed, because past and irrecoverable, which is the formal Reason of this condemning Sorrow. This the Scripture calls <hi>sorrow of the World,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 10. Divines usually <hi>legal sorrow,</hi> as that which in Conjunction with the sense of the guilt of sin menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, brings Men into bondage under <hi>fear,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. (3.) <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for Sin;</hi> which is the exercise or working of Sorrow and Fear in outward Acts of Confession, Fasting, Praying, and the like. This is the true Nature of Legal Humiliation, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 29. (4.) Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by these things the Soul be <hi>swallowed</hi> up in despair, it cannot be but that it will be filled with Thoughts, Desires, Enquiries, and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances about a <hi>Deliverance</hi> out of that State and Condition wherein it is; as <hi>Acts 2. 27. Acts</hi> 16. 30.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; Oftentimes a <hi>great Reformation of Life,</hi> and Change in Affections doth ensue hereon; as <hi>Matth. 13. 20. 2 Pet. 2. 20. Matth.</hi> 12. 43.</p>

                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:48389:107"/> All these things may be wrought in the Minds of Men by the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Word, and yet the Work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> be never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in them. Yea, although they are <hi>good</hi> in themselves, and Fruits of the kindness of God towards us, they may not only be <hi>lost</hi> as unto any Spiritual Advantage, but also be abused unto our great disadvantage. And this comes not to pass but by our own Sin, whereby we contract a new Guilt upon our Souls. And it commonly so falls out one of these three wayes. For (1.) some are no way careful or wise to <hi>improve this Light</hi> and Conviction unto the end whereunto they tend and are design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Their Message is to turn the Minds of Men, and to take them off from their self-confidence, and to direct them unto Christ. Where this is not attended unto, where they are not used and improved unto the pursuit of this End, they insensibly wither, decay, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. (2.) In some they are overborn by the Power and Violence of their Lusts, the Love of Sin, and Efficacy of Temptation. They are sinned away every day, and leave the Soul in <hi>ten-times a worse condition</hi> than they found it. (3.) Some rest in these things as though they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the whole Work of God towards them, and guided them in all the Duties required of them. This is the State of many where they extend their Power, in the last Instance, unto any considerable <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Life, and Attendance unto Duties of Religious Worship. But this, as was said, falls out through the <hi>abuse</hi> which the Carnal Minds of Men, retaining their Enmity against God, do put these things unto. In their own Nature they are good, useful, and <hi>material Preparations</hi> unto Regeneration, disposing the Mind unto the reception of the Grace of God.</p>

Unto that <hi>Light</hi> which they received into them from the infallible Word of Truth, they joyned those <hi>Experiences</hi> which they had observed in their own Hearts, and the Consciences of others with whom they had to do, which were suitable thereunto. And in the Dispensation of this Truth, according to the <hi>measure of the Gift of the Grace of Christ,</hi> which they severally received, they had an useful and fruitful Ministry in the World, to the Converting of many unto God.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48389:107"/> due unto Sin, all Troubles and Distressed of Mind, by reason of these things, are <hi>foolish Imaginations, the Effects of bodily Diseases and Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Enthusiastick Notions arising from the disorders of Mens Brains; and I know not what untoward Humours in their Complexions and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The same or the like account is also given concerning <hi>all Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Desertions, or Joys and Refreshments.</hi> And the whole Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these things is branded with <hi>novelty,</hi> and hopes expressed of its sudden vanishing out of the World. This contempt and scorn of the Gospel have we lived to see, whereof it may be other Ages and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have not had Experience. For as all these things are plentifully taught by some of the Ancients, in their Expositions of the Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are expressed, especially by <hi>Austin,</hi> who had occasion particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to enquire into them; so the Doctrine concerning them is in a great measure retained in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self. Only some amongst our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selves are weary of them; who being no way able to oppose the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Foundations whereon they are Built, nor to disprove them by Scripture or Reason, betake themselves to these Revilings and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. And as if it were not enough for them to proclaim their own Ignorance and Personal unacquaintance with those things which insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably accompany that Conviction of Sin, Righteousness and Judgment, which our Lord Jesus Christ hath promised to sent the Holy Spirit to Work in all that should believe, they make the reproaching of it in others a Principal Effect of that Religion which they profess. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless the Foundation of God standeth sure; God knoweth who are his.</hi> But we must return to our purpose.</p>

The Word it self, under a bare proposal to the Minds of Men will not so affect them. We need go no further for the Confirmation hereof, than meerly to consider the <hi>Preaching,</hi> (with the Effects which it had towards many) of the <hi>Prophets</hi> of old, <hi>Isa. 49. 4. Jer. 15. 30. Ezek.</hi> 33. 31, 32. of
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself, <hi>John</hi> 8. 59. And of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> Acts 13. 41, 45, 46. Hence to this day the <hi>Jews</hi> who enjoy the Letter of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> without the Administration of the Spirit, are as full of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, hardness, and obstinacy, as any in the World who are utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it. Many amongst our selves fit <hi>all their dayes</hi> under the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, and yet have none of the Effects mentioned wrought upon them, when others their Associates in Hearing, are really Affected, Convinced, and Converted. It is therefore the <hi>Ministration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> in and by the Word, which produceth all or any of these Effects on the Minds of Men. He is the Fountain of all <hi>Illumination.</hi> Hence they that are enlightned are said to be made <hi>Partakers of the Holy Spirit,</hi> Heb. 6. 4. And he is promised by our Saviour <hi>to Convince the World of Sin,</hi> John 16. 8. which although in that place it respects only one kind of Sin, yet it is sufficient to establish a general Rule, that <hi>all Conviction</hi> of Sin is from and by him. And no wonder if Men live securely in their Sins, to whom the <hi>Light</hi> which he gives, and the Convictions which he worketh are a Scorn and Reproach.</p>

                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:48389:108"/> There is indeed an Objection of some Moment, against the Ascripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Work, unto the <hi>energie</hi> of the Holy Spirit. For whereas it is granted, that all these things may be wrought in the Minds and Souls of Men, and yet they may come short of the <hi>Saving Grace of God;</hi> How can he be thought to be the Author of such a Work? Shall we say that he designs only a <hi>weak and imperfect Work</hi> upon the Hearts of Men? Or that he deserts and gives over the Work of Grace which he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken towards them as not <hi>able</hi> to accomplish it?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) In many Persons, it may be in the most who are thus affected,
<hi>real Conversion</hi> unto God doth ensue; The Holy Spirit by these <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Actings</hi> making way for the Introduction of the new Spiritual Life into the Soul. So they belong unto a Work that is <hi>perfect</hi> in its kind. (2.) Where-ever they fail and some short of what in their own Nature they have a <hi>tendency</hi> unto; it is not from any weakness and imperfection in themselves, but from the sins of them in whom they are wrought. For Instance, even common Illumination and Conviction of sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have in their own Nature a <hi>tendency</hi> unto sincere Conversion. They have so in the same kind, as the Law hath to bring us unto Christ. Where this end is not attained, it is alwayes from the Interposition of an Act of
<hi>wilfulness</hi> and stubbornness in those Enlightned and Convicted. They do not sincerely improve what they have received, and faint not meerly for want of strength to proceed, but by a <hi>free Act of their own Wills,</hi> they refuse the Grace which is further tendred unto them in the Gospel. This Will, and its actual <hi>Resistency</hi> unto the Work of the Spirit, God is pleased in some to take away; It is therefore of Sovereign Grace when, and where it is removed; but the Sin of Men and their Guilt is in it, where it is continued. For no more is required hereunto, but that it be
<hi>voluntary;</hi> It is <hi>Will</hi> and not <hi>Power,</hi> that gives Rectitude or Obliquity unto Moral Actions. (3.) As we observed before, The Holy Spirit in his whole Work is a <hi>Voluntary Agent.</hi> He worketh what, when, and how he pleaseth. No more is required unto his Operations, that they may be such as become him but these two things. First That in themselves they be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy.</hi> Secondly, That they be <hi>effectual</hi> as unto the ends whereunto by him they are designed. That he should alwayes design them to the utmost length of what they have a <hi>moral tendency</hi> towards, though no real efficiency for, is not required. And these things are found in these Operations of the Holy Spirit. They are in their own Nature
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy;</hi> Illumination is so, so is Conviction, and Sorrow for Sin, with a subsequent change of Affections and Amendment of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> Again, what he worketh in any of these, effectually and infallibly accomplisheth the <hi>end</hi> aimed at; which is no more, but that Men be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, Convinced, Humbled, and reformed, wherein he faileth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. In these things he is pleased to take on him the <hi>management of the Law,</hi> so to bring the Soul into <hi>bondage</hi> thereby, that it may be stirred up to seek after Deliverance: And he is thence actively called the <hi>Spirit of Bondage unto Fear,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. And this <hi>Work</hi> is that which constitutes the
<hi>third ground</hi> in our Saviours Parable of the <hi>Sower.</hi> It receives the Seed and Springs up hopefully until by <hi>cares</hi> of the World, Temptations and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48389:108"/> occasions of Life it is choaked and lost, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 22. Now because it oftentimes maketh a great Appearance and Resemblance of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it self, or of real Conversion to God, so that neither the <hi>World</hi> nor the <hi>Church</hi> are able to distinguish between them, it is of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment unto all Professors of the Gospel, to enquire diligently whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have in their own Souls been made Partakers of <hi>any other Work</hi> of the Spirit of God or no. For although this be a <hi>good Work,</hi> and do lie in a good subserviency unto Regeneration, yet if Men attain no more, if they proceed no farther, they will perish, and that eternally. And multitudes do herein actually deceive themselves, speaking peace unto their Souls on the Effects of this Work, whereby it is not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to <hi>save them,</hi> as it is to all Persons at all times, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a means of their present security and future destruction. I shall therefore give some few <hi>Instances</hi> of what this Work in the Conjunction of all the parts of it, and in its utmost improvement cannot <hi>effect,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Men may make a Judgment how things stand in their own Souls in respect unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> 1. It may be observed, that we have placed all the Effects of this Work in the <hi>Mind, Conscience, Affections,</hi> and <hi>Conversation.</hi> Hence it follows, notwithstanding all that is or may be spoken of it, that the
<hi>Will</hi> is neither really changed, nor internally renewed by it. Now the Will is the <hi>ruling,</hi> governing Faculty of the Soul, as the Mind is the
<hi>guiding</hi> and leading. Whilst this abides unchanged, <hi>unrenewed,</hi> the Power and Reign of Sin continues in the Soul; though not undisturbed, yet unruined. It is true, there are many <hi>checks</hi> and <hi>controuls</hi> from the Light of the Mind, and Reflections of Conscience cast in this State up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Actings of <hi>the Will,</hi> so that it cannot put it self forth in and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sin, with that freedom, security, and <hi>licentiousness,</hi> as it was wont to do; Its <hi>fierceness</hi> and <hi>rage</hi> rushing into Sin, as the Horse into the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
<hi>running on God, and the thick Bosses of his Buckler,</hi> may be broken and abated, by those <hi>Hedges of Thorns</hi> which it finds set in its way, and those <hi>buffettings</hi> it meets withal from Light and Convictions. Its delight and <hi>greediness in sinning,</hi> may be calmed and quieted by those frequent Representations of the <hi>terror of the Lord</hi> on the one hand, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Eternal Rest on the other, which are made unto it. But yet still, setting aside all Considerations <hi>forreign</hi> unto its own Principle, the Bent and Inclination of the Will it self is to Sin and Evil alwayes and continually. The Will of sinning may be restrained upon a <hi>thousand Considerations,</hi> which Light and Convictions will administer; but it is not taken away. And this discovers it self where the very <hi>first Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the Soul towards sinful Objects have a sensible <hi>complacency,</hi> until they are controuled by Light and Fear. This argues an <hi>unrenewed Will,</hi> if it be constant and universal.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> 2. The Effects of this Work on the <hi>Mind,</hi> which is the first Subject affected with it, proceeds not so far as to give it <hi>Delight, Complacency,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> in the lively Spiritual Nature and Excellencies of the things revealed unto it. The true Nature of <hi>Saving Illumination</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in this, that it gives the Mind such a direct <hi>intuitive</hi> insight and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect into Spiritual Things, as that in their own Spiritual Nature they
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48389:109"/> suit, please, and satisfie it. So that it is <hi>transformed</hi> into them, <hi>cast into the Mould of them,</hi> and rests in them, <hi>Rom. 6. 17. Chap.</hi> 12. 2. 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 13, 14. 2 Cor. 3. 18. Chap.</hi> 4. 6. This the Work we have insisted in reacheth not unto. For notwithstanding any discovery that is made therein of Spiritual Things unto the Mind, it finds not an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate direct Spiritual Excellency</hi> in them, but onely with respect unto some Benefit or Advantage which is to be attained by means thereof. It will not give such a Spiritual insight into the Mystery of God's Grace by Jesus Christ, called, <hi>his Glory shining in the Face of Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6. as that the Soul in its first direct view of it, should for what it is in it self admire it, <hi>delight</hi> in it, approve it, and find <hi>Spiritual Solace</hi> with refreshment in it. But such a Light, such a Knowledg it communicates, as that a Man may <hi>like it well</hi> in its Effects, as a way of Mercy and Salvation.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> 3. This Work extends it self to the <hi>Conscience</hi> also; but yet it doth not <hi>purge the Conscience from dead Works, that we should serve the living God.</hi> This is the effect of a real Application of the Blood of Christ by Faith unto our Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. Two things it effects upon the Conscience. (1.) It renders it more <hi>ready, quick,</hi> and <hi>sharp</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and condemning of all Sin than it was before. To condemn Sin according unto its Light and Guidance, is <hi>natural</hi> unto, and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Conscience of Man. But its <hi>Readiness</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise this condemning Power, may by custom and course of sinning in the World, be variously weakned and impeded. But when Conscience is brought under the Power of this Work, having its <hi>directing Light</hi> augmented, whereby it sees more of the evil of sin than formerly, and having its self-reflections sharpned and multiplyed, it is more <hi>ready</hi> and
<hi>quick</hi> in putting forth its Judging and Condemning Power than it was. (2.) Conscience is assisted and directed hereby to condemn <hi>many things in Sin,</hi> which before it approved of. For its Judging Power is still com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate unto its Light. And many things are thereby now discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>sinful,</hi> which were not so by the meer natural guidance under which before it was. But yet notwithstanding all this, it doth not <hi>purge the Conscience from Dead Works;</hi> that is, Conscience is not hereby wrought unto such an Abhorrency of Sin for it self, as continually to direct the Soul unto an Application to the Blood of Christ, for the <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> of itself, and the purging of it out. It contents it self to keep all things in a <hi>tumult,</hi> disorder, and confusion, by its constant condemning both Sin and Sinners.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label>(4.) This Work operates greatly on the <hi>Affections;</hi> We have given Instances in the <hi>Fear, Sorrow, Joy</hi> and <hi>Delight,</hi> about Spiritual Things, that are stirred up and acted thereby. But yet it comes short in two things of a through-Work upon the Affections themselves. For (1.) it doth not <hi>fix</hi> them. And (2.) it doth not <hi>fill</hi> them. (1.) It is required that our Affections be <hi>fixed</hi> on Heavenly and Spiritual Things, and true Grace will effect it. Col. 3. 1, 2. <hi>If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are Above, where Christ sitteth on the Right Hand of God. Set your Affections on things Above.</hi> The Joys, the Fears, the Hopes, the Sorrows, with reference unto Spiritual and Eternal Things,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48389:109"/> which the Work before mentioned doth produce, are <hi>evanid,</hi> uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, unstable; not onely as to the Degrees, but as to the very Being of them. Sometimes they are as a River ready to over-flow its Banks, Men cannot but be pouring them out on all occasions. And sometimes as <hi>Waters</hi> that <hi>fail,</hi> no drop comes from them. Sometimes they are hot, and sometimes cold; sometimes up, and sometimes down; sometimes all Heaven, and sometimes all World, without equality, without stability. But true Grace <hi>fixeth the Affections</hi> on Spiritual Things. As to the
<hi>Degrees of their Exercise,</hi> there may be and is in them great variety, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they may be excited, aided, assisted, by Grace, and the means of it, or obstructed and impeded by the interposition of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Diversions. But the <hi>constant bent</hi> and inclination of renewed Affections is unto Spiritual Things, as the Scripture every-where testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and Experience doth confirm. (2.) The fore-mentioned Work doth not <hi>fill the Affections;</hi> how-ever it may serve to take them up and pacifie them. It come like <hi>many Strangers</hi> to an <hi>Inn</hi> to Lodg, which take up a great deal of room, and make an Appearance, as if none were in the House but themselves; and yet they turn not out the <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> which dwelleth there, but there they make their abode still. Light and Conviction with all their Train and Attendants come into the <hi>Mind and Affections,</hi> as if they would fill them and possess them for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves alone. But yet when they have done all, they leave the <hi>quiet Places</hi> of the House for the World, and Sin, and Self; they do not thrust them out of the Affections, and fill up their places with Spiritual Things. But Saving-Grace <hi>fills up</hi> the Affections with Spiritual Things, fills the Soul with Spiritual Love, Joy, and Delight, and exerciseth all other Affections about their proper Objects. It denies not a room to any other Things, Relations, Possessions, Enjoyments, meerly as they are <hi>natural,</hi> and are content to be subordinate unto God, and Spiritual Things. But if they would be <hi>carnal, disorderly,</hi> or <hi>predominant,</hi> it casts them out.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> 5. This Work is often-times carried on very far in <hi>Reformation of Life,</hi> and Conversation, so that it will express the whole <hi>form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> therein. But herein also it is subject unto a <hi>three-fold Defect</hi> and Imperfection. For (1.) it will consist with and allow of <hi>raging</hi> and
<hi>reigning</hi> sins of Ignorance. The conducting Light in this Work not leading into the Abhorrency of all sin as sin, nor into a pursuit of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, out of a design to be <hi>universally conformable</hi> unto Christ; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered up from this and that particular Command, it oft-times leaves behind it great <hi>sins</hi> unregarded. So it left <hi>Persecution in Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Conversion; and so it leaves hatred and a desire of Persecution in many at this day. And other Sins of the like Nature may escape its utmost search to the ruine of the Soul. (2.) Its Reformation of the Conversation is seldom <hi>universal</hi> as to all <hi>known sins,</hi> unless it be for a season, whilst the Soul is under a <hi>flagrant pursuit</hi> of Self-Righteousness.
<hi>Paul</hi> in that condition had preserved himself, so as that according to the Law he was <hi>blameless;</hi> and the young Man thought he had <hi>kept all the Commandments</hi> from his youth. But setting aside this Consideration, notwithstanding the utmost that this Work can attain unto, after the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48389:110"/> efficacy of its first Impressions begin to abate. <hi>Lust</hi> will reserve some peculiar way of venting and discovering it self, which is much spoken unto. (3.) The <hi>Conversations</hi> of Persons who live and abide under the Power of this Work only, is assuredly fading and decaying; Coldness, Sloth, Negligence, Love of the World, Carnal-Wisdom and Security do every day get ground upon them. Hence although by a long course of abstinence from <hi>open sensual sins,</hi> and stating of a contrary Interest, they are not given up unto them; yet by the decayes of the Power of their Convictions, and the ground that Sin gets upon them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>walking and talking Sceletons</hi> in Religion, dry sapless, useless Worldlings. But where the Soul is inlaid with real Saving-Grace, it is in a state of thriving continually. Such a one will go on from
<hi>Strength to Strength,</hi> from <hi>Grace to Grace,</hi> from <hi>Glory to Glory,</hi> and will be fat and flourishing in Old Age. By these things may we learn to distinguish in our selves between the <hi>preparatory Work</hi> mentioned, and that of real <hi>Saving-Conversion</hi> unto God. And these are some of the Heads of those <hi>Operations</hi> of the Holy Spirit on the Minds of Men, which often-times are <hi>preparatory</hi> unto a real Conversion unto God; and sometimes their Contempt and Rejection, a great Aggravation of the sin and misery of them in whom they were wrought.</p>

But this is publickly declared, avowed, and vended as allowed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine amongst us, and therefore deserves to be noticed, though the person that gives it out, be at irreconcilable feuds with himself and his Church.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> We may to this purpose first consider the Testimonies given in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48389:112"/> unto the Assertion as laid down in general; Matth. 4. 16. <hi>The People which sat in darkness saw great Light, and to them that sat in the Region and Shadow of Death, Light is sprung up.</hi> Of what kind this Darkness was in particular shall be afterwards declared. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it answers what is proposed, That before the Illumination given them by the Preaching of the Gospel, the People mentioned <hi>sat in Darkness,</hi> or lived under the Power of it. And such as was the <hi>Light</hi> whereby they were relieved, of the same kind was the <hi>Darkness</hi> under which they were detained. And in the same sense when Christ preached the Gospel, <hi>the Light shined into Darkness, &amp; the Darkness comprehended it not,</hi> John 1. 5. gave not place to the Light of the Truth declared by him, that it might be received in the Souls of Men. The Commission which he gave to <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle when he sent him to Preach the Gospel, was
<hi>to open the Eyes of Men, and to turn them from Darkness to Light,</hi> Acts 26. 18. not a Light within them; for <hi>Internal Light</hi> is the <hi>Eye,</hi> or see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul. But the <hi>Darkness</hi> was such as consisted in their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in not having their eyes open. <hi>To open their Eyes, and turn them from Darkness,</hi> Ephes. 5. 8. <hi>Ye were sometimes Darkness, but now are ye Light in the Lord.</hi> What is the Change and Alteration made in the Minds of Men intended in this Expression will afterwards appear. But that a great Change is proposed none can doubt; Col. 1. 13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the Power of Darkness;</hi> as also 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 9. Who hath called us out of Darkness into his marvelous Light.</hi> And the <hi>Darkness</hi> which is in these Testimonies ascribed unto Persons in an unregenerate Condition, is by <hi>Paul</hi> compared to that which was at the beginning, before the Creation of Light; Gen. 1. 2. <hi>Darkness was upon the Face of the Deep.</hi> There was no Creature that had a Visive Faculty, there was Darkness <hi>Subjectively</hi> in all, and there was no Light to see by, but all was
<hi>objectively</hi> wrapt up in Darkness. In this state of things, God by an Almighty Act of his Power created Light; vers. 3. <hi>God said, Let there be Light, and there was Light.</hi> And no otherwise is it in this new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
<hi>God who commanded</hi> then <hi>Light to shine out of Darkness, shines into the Hearts of Men to give them the knowledg of his Glory in the Face of Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6. <hi>Spiritual Darkness</hi> is <hi>in</hi> and <hi>upon all</hi> Men, until God by an Almighty and Effectual Work of the Spirit shine into them, or Create Light in them.

               <p>First; The Term of Darkness in this case is <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from that which is <hi>Natural.</hi> What Natural Darkness is, and wherein it consists all Men know; if they know it not in its Cause and Reason, yet they know it by its Effects. They know it is that which hinders Men from all Regular Operations, which are to be guided by the outward Senses. And it is two-fold; (1.) When Men have not Light to see by; or when the usual Light, the only <hi>external Medium</hi> for the discovery of distant Objects is taken from them. So was it with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> during the <hi>three dayes darkness</hi> that was on their Land.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48389:113"/> They could not see for want of Light; they had their <hi>Visive Faculty</hi> continued unto them; yet having <hi>no Light,</hi> they <hi>saw not one another, nor arose any from his place,</hi> Exod. 10. 23. For God probably to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the terror of his Judgment, restrained the vertue of <hi>Artificial</hi> Light, as well as he did that which was Natural. (2.) There is Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto Men when they are <hi>blind,</hi> either born so, or made so. <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 29. <hi>Let their Eyes be darkned that they may not see.</hi> So the Angel smote the <hi>Sodomites</hi> with blindness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 11. and <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> Acts 13. 11.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> Answerable hereunto, <hi>Spiritual Darkness</hi> may be referred unto two Heads. For there is an <hi>Objective Darkness,</hi> a Darkness that is <hi>on</hi> Men; and a <hi>Subjective Darkness,</hi> a Darkness that is <hi>in</hi> them. The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the want of those Means whereby alone they may be enlightned in the Knowledg of God and Spiritual Things. This is intended, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 16. This Means is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the preaching of it. Hence it is called <hi>a Light,</hi> Psal. 119. 105. and is said to <hi>give Light,</hi> Psal. 19. 8. or to be <hi>a Light shining in a dark place,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19. And it is so term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because it is the outward Means of Communicating the Light of the Knowledg of God unto the Minds of Men. What the <hi>Sun</hi> is unto the World, as unto things natural, that is the Word and the Preaching of it unto Men as to Things Spiritual. And hence our Apostle applies what is said of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the Firmament, as to the enlightning of the World, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3, 4. unto the Gospel, and the Preaching of it,

What-ever knowledg therefore of God may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the means mentioned, as he is the <hi>God of Nature</hi> ruling over Men, and requiring Obedience from them according to the Covenant and Law of their Creation, yet the knowledg of him as a God in Christ pardoning Sin and saving Sinners, is attainable by the Gospel only.

That long course of Sin having blinded their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, so that they see not that which by the Light of Nature they are enabled to see, and by that gross Ignorance and obduration of Heart, run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Impiety, are far removed from that Life which God and Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them.</hi> It is supposed in this Exposition, (1.) That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle hath respect in the first place to the <hi>Practices</hi> of the Gentiles, not to their State and Condition. (2.) That this Practice concerns only their
<hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Idol-Worship.</hi> (3.) That what is here ascribed unto them, came upon them by a <hi>long course of sinning.</hi> (4.) That the <hi>Darkness</hi> mentioned consists in a not discerning of what might be seen by the
<hi>Light of Nature.</hi> (5.) That their Alienation from the Life of God, consisted in running into that <hi>Impiety</hi> which was distant or removed from the Life that God and Nature require. But all these <hi>Sentiments</hi> are so far from being contained in the Text, as that they are expresly contrary unto it. For (1.) although the Apostle doth carry on his Description of this State of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> unto the <hi>vile Practices</hi> that ensued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48389:114"/> on, <hi>v.</hi> 19. Yet it is their State by Nature, with respect unto the <hi>Life of God,</hi> which is first intended by him. This is apparent from what he prescribes unto Christians in opposition thereunto; namely, <hi>The New Man which after God is created in Rightcousness and true Holiness,</hi> v. 24. (2.) The <hi>Vanity</hi> mentioned is <hi>subjective</hi> in their Minds, and so hath no respect to <hi>Idol-Worship</hi> but as it was an Effect thereof. The vanity of their Minds is the Principle whereof this <hi>walking,</hi> be what it will, was the Effect and Consequent. (3.) Here is no mention nor intimation of any <hi>long course of sinning,</hi> much less that it should be the cause of the other things ascribed to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whereof indeed it was the Effect. The Description given, is that of <hi>the state of all Men</hi> by Nature, as is plain from <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. (4.) The Darkness here mentioned, is opposed unto being <hi>Light in the Lord,</hi> Chap. 5. 8. which is not meer
<hi>Natural Light,</hi> nor can any by that Light alone discern Spiritual Things, or the Things that belong to the Life of God. (5.) The <hi>Life of God</hi> here is not that Life which <hi>God and Nature require,</hi> but that Life which God reveals in, requires and communicates by the Gospel through Jesus Christ, as all Learned Expositors acknowledg. Wherefore the Apostle treateth here of the State of Men by Nature, with respect unto Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Supernatural Things. And three Heads he reduceth all things in Man unto.

(1.) Its natural Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto things that are <hi>vain;</hi> that is, such as are not a proper nor use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Object unto the Soul and its Affections. It seeks about to lead the Soul to rest and satisfaction, but alwayes unto <hi>vain things,</hi> and that in great variety. Sin, the World, Pleasures, the Satisfaction of the Flesh, with Pride of Life, are the things which it naturally pursues. And in actings of this Nature <hi>a vain Mind</hi> abounds; it multiplies <hi>vain</hi> Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, like the Sand on the Sea-shore. These are called the <hi>Figments</hi> of the Hearts of Men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. which are found to be <hi>only evil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi> These it feigns and frames, abundantly bringing them forth as the Earth doth Grass, or as a Cloud pours out drops of Water. And
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48389:115"/> herein (2.) it is <hi>unstable.</hi> For that which is vain is various, inconstant, unfixed, light, as a natural Mind is; so that it is like Hell it self for Confusion and Disorder; or the Whorish Woman described by <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 7. 11, 12. And this hath befallen it by the loss of that <hi>fixed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi> which it was created in. There was the same <hi>cogitative</hi> or <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative</hi> Faculty in us in the State of Innocency, as there remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of Sin. But then all the Actings of it were <hi>orderly</hi> and regular. The Mind was able to direct them all unto the end for which we were made. God was and would have been the principal Object of them, and all other things in order unto him. But now being turned off from him, the Mind in them engageth in all manner of <hi>Confusion;</hi> and they all end in <hi>vanity</hi> or disappointment. They offer, as it were, their Service unto the Soul, to bring it in Satisfaction. And although they are rejected one after another, as not answering what they pretend unto, yet they constantly arise under the same Notion, and keep the whole Soul under Everlasting Disappointments. And from hence it is that the Mind cannot <hi>assent</hi> unto the common Principles of Religion in a due manner, which yet it cannot deny. This will be further cleared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Hereon in Conversion unto God, we are said to have <hi>our Minds renewed,</hi> Rom. 12. 2. and to be <hi>renewed in the Spirit of our Minds,</hi> Ephes. 4. 23. By the Mind the Faculty it self is intended, the rational Principle in us of Apprehension, of Thinking, Discoursing, and <hi>Assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> This is <hi>renewed</hi> by Grace, or brought into another <hi>Habitude</hi> and Frame, by the implantation of a Ruling, Guiding, Spiritual Light in it. The <hi>Spirit of the Mind</hi> is the Inclination and Disposition in the Actings of it. These also must be regulated by Grace.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> And by the way, it may not be amiss to divert here a little unto the Consideration of that Exposition which the whole World and all things in it, give unto this Text and Testimony, concerning the Minds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men being under the Power of <hi>Vanity,</hi> for this is the Spring and inexhaustible Fountain of all that <hi>Vanity</hi> which the World is filled with. There is indeed a Vanity which is <hi>penal,</hi> namely, that vexation and disappointment which Men finally meet withal in the pursuit of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing things, whereof the Wise Man treats at large in his <hi>Ecclesiastes.</hi> But I intend that <hi>sinful Vanity</hi> which the Mind it self produces, and that in all sorts of Persons, Ages, Sexes, and Conditions in the World. This some of the <hi>Heathens</hi> saw, complained of, reproved and derided, but yet could never reach to the cause of it, nor free themselves from being under the Power of the same <hi>Vanity,</hi> though in a way peculiar and distinct from the common sort, as might easily be demonstrated. But the thing is apparent, almost all that our Eyes see, or our Ears hear of in the World is altogether <hi>vain.</hi> All that which makes such a Noise, such a Business, such an Appearance and Shew among Men, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced unto two Heads. (1.) The <hi>Vanity</hi> that they bring into the things that are, and that are either good in themselves, and of some use, or at least indifferent. So Men do variously corrupt their Buildings and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, their Trading, their Conversation, their Power, their Wealth, their Relations; they joyn innumerable Vanities with them, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them loathsome and contemptible, and the meanest condition to be the most suitable to rational Satisfaction. (2.) Men find out, and as it were,
<hi>create</hi> things to be meer Supporters, Countenancers, and Nourishers of Vanity. Such in Religion are carnal pompous Ceremonies, like those of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which have no end, but to bring in some kind of Provision for the satisfaction of <hi>vain</hi> Minds; Stage-Playes, Mimicks, with innumerable other things of the same nature, which are nothing but Theatres for Vanity to act it self upon. It were endless but to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the common Effects of <hi>Vanity</hi> in the World; and Men are mightily divided about these things. Those engaged in them, think it strange that others run not out into the <hi>same compass of excess, and riot with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, speaking evil of them,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 4. They wonder at the perverse stubborn and froward Humour which befals some Men, that they delight not in, that they approve not of those Things and Wayes wherein they find so great a suitableness unto their own Minds. Others again are ready
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48389:116"/> to admire whence it is that the World is <hi>mad</hi> on such vain and foolish things as it is almost wholly given up unto. The Consideration we have insisted on, gives us a satisfactory account of the Grounds and Reasons hereof. The Mind of Man by Nature is wholly <hi>vain,</hi> under the Power of Vanity, and is an endless fruitful! Womb of all mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Births. The World is now growing towards six thousand years old, and yet is no nearer the bottom of the Springs of its <hi>vanity,</hi> or the drawing out of its supplies, than it was the first day that Sin entred into it. New Sins, new Vices, new Vanities break forth continually; and all is from hence, that the Mind of Man by Nature is altogether vain. Nor is there any way or means for putting a stop hereunto in <hi>Persons, Families, Cities, Nations,</hi> but so far as the Minds of Men are cured and <hi>renewed</hi> by the Holy Ghost. The World may alter its shape, and the outward appearances of things, it may change its Scenes, and act its Part in new Habits and Dresses, but it will still be altogether <hi>vain</hi> so long as natural <hi>uncured vanity</hi> is predominant in the Minds of Men, and this will sufficiently secure them from attaining any saving acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Spiritual Things.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> Again, it is one of the principal Duties incumbent on us to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with and diligently to watch over the <hi>remainders</hi> of this Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our own Minds. The sinful Distempers of our Natures are not presently cured at once, but the healing and removing of them is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by degrees unto the consummation of the course of our obedience in this World. And there are <hi>three Effects</hi> of this natural Vanity of the Mind in its depraved condition to be found among Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. (1.) An <hi>instability</hi> in Holy Duties, as Meditation, Prayer, and Hearing of the Word; How ready is the Mind to wander in them, and to give entertainment unto vain and fond Imaginations, at least un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Thoughts and Apprehensions of things unsuited to the Duties where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are ingaged? How difficult is it to keep it up unto an <hi>even fixed stable frame</hi> of acting spiritually in Spiritual Things? How is it ready at every breath to unbend and let down its Intension? All we experience or complain of in this kind, is from the uncured Reliques of this <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> (2.) This is that which inclines and leads Men towards a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with and unto a <hi>vain</hi> World, in its Customs, Habits, and ordinary Converse, which are all vain and foolish. And so prevalent is it herein, and such Arguments hath it possessed it self withal to give it counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that in many instances of <hi>vanity</hi> it is hard to give a distinction between them and the whole World that lies under the Power of it. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors it may be will not comply with the World in the things before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, that have no other use nor end, but meerly to support, act, and nourish <hi>vanity;</hi> but from other things which being indifferent in themselves; are yet filled with Vanity in their use; How ready are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for a complyance with the course of the World which lyeth in evil and passeth away? (3.) It acts it self in <hi>fond and foolish Imaginations,</hi> whereby it secretly makes provision for the Flesh and the Lusts thereof, for they all generally lead unto Self-Exaltation and Satisfaction. And these, if not carefully checkt, will proceed to such an excess as greatly to taint the whole Soul. And in these things lies the principal Cause and Occasion of all other Sins and Miscarriages. We have therefore
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48389:116"/> no more important Duty incumbent on us, than mightily to oppose this Radical Distemper. It is so also to attend diligently unto the remedy of it. And this consists (1.) in an holy fixedness of Mind, and an <hi>habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inclination</hi> unto Things Spiritual, which is communicated unto us by the Holy Ghost, as shall be afterwards declared, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 23, 24. (2.) In the due and constant improvement of that gracious Principle. (1.) By constant <hi>watchfulness</hi> against the Minds acting it self in vain, foolish, unprofitable Imaginations, so far at least that <hi>vain thoughts may not lodg in us.</hi> (2.) By exercising it continually unto Holy <hi>Spiritual</hi> Meditations, <hi>minding alwayes the things that are above,</hi> Col. 3. 3. (3.) By a constant <hi>conscientious humbling of our Souls,</hi> for all the vain actings of our Minds that we do observe; All which might be usefully enlarged on, but that we must return.</p>

Gal. 2. 20. I live by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> Rom. 6. 7. (2.)

It is the Life whereby we live to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 7. whereof God is the Supream and Absolute End, as he is the principal efficient Cause of it. And two things are contained herein; (1.) That we do

Acts</hi> 5. 20. (6.) A Life, all whose Fruits are Holiness and Spiritual Evangelical Obedience, <hi>Rom. 6. 22. Phil.</hi> 1. 11.

For although the work of our Conversion is called a <hi>turning of stones into children of Abraham;</hi> because of the greatness of the change, and because of our selves we contribute nothing thereunto: yet if we were every way as such, as to the capacity of our natures, it would not become the Wisdom of God to apply the means mentioned for effecting of that Work.

               <p>1. The first Reason taken from the Nature of the things themselves with respect unto the mind, is, <hi>that they are foolishness.</hi> In themselves they are the <hi>Wisdom of God, 2. Cor.</hi> 2. 7. Effects of the Wisdom of God, and those which have the impress of the Wisdom of God upon them; and when the Dispensation of them was said to be <hi>foolishness,</hi> the Apostle contends not about it, but tells them how-ever it is the foolishness of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 15. which he doth to cast contempt on all the Wisdom of Men, whereby the Gospel is despised: And they are the <hi>hidden Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of God; such an effect of Divine Wisdom as no Creature could make any discovery of, <hi>Ephes. 3. 9, 10. Job</hi> 28. 20, 21, 22. And they are the <hi>Wisdom of God in a Mystery,</hi> or full of deep mysterious Wisdom. But to the <hi>Natural Man</hi> they are <hi>foolishness,</hi> not only <hi>although</hi> they are the Wisdom of God, but peculiarly <hi>because</hi> they are so, and as they are so; for the Carnal Mind is <hi>Enmity against God.</hi> Now that is esteemed
<hi>foolishness,</hi> which is looked on either as weak and impertinent, or as that which contains or expresseth Means and Ends <hi>disproportionate,</hi> or as that which is <hi>undesirable</hi> in comparison of what may be set up in competition with it, or is on any other consideration not <hi>eligible,</hi> or to be complyed with on the <hi>terms whereon</hi> it is proposed.

For they profess the Faith of it, and avow a Subjection to the Rules and Laws of it. But the <hi>things</hi> declared in the Gospel may be reduced unto two Heads, as was before observed; (1.) Such as consist in the confirmation, direction, and improvement of the <hi>moral Principles</hi> and Precepts of the Law of Nature. (2.) Such as flow immediately from the Sovereign Will and Wisdom of God, being no way communicated unto us, but by Supernatural Revelation only. Such are all the Effects of the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grace of God, as he was in Christ reconciling the World unto himself; the Offices of Christ, his Administration of them, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation of the Spirit, with the especial Evangelical <hi>Supernatural</hi> Graces and Duties which are required in us with respect thereunto. The first sort of these things many will greatly praise and highly extol. And they will declare how consonant they are to Reason, and what Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons suitable unto them may be found in the Ancient <hi>Philosophers.</hi> But it is evident that herein also they fall under a double Inconvenience; For (1.) mostly they <hi>visibly</hi> transgress what they boast of as their Rule, and that above others. For where shall we meet with <hi>any,</hi> at least with
<hi>many</hi> of these sort of Men, who in any measure comply with that Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, Humility, Meekness, Patience, Self-denial, Abstinence, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Contempt of the World, Love of Mankind, Charity and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which the Gospel requires under this Head of Duties? Pride, Ambition, Insatiable desires after Earthly Advantages and Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Scoffing, Scorn and Contempt of others, Vanity of <hi>Converse,</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Wrath, Revenge, Railing, are none of the <hi>Moral Duties</hi> required in the Gospel. And (2.) no pretence of an esteem for any <hi>one part</hi> of the Gospel, will shelter Men from the Punishment due to the rejection of the <hi>whole,</hi> by whom any essential part of it is refused. And this is the condition of many. The Things which most properly belong to the Mysteries of the Gospel, or the unsearchable Riches of the Grace of God in Christ Jesus, are <hi>foolishness</hi> unto them; and the Preaching of them is called <hi>Canting</hi> and <hi>Folly.</hi> And some of these, although they go not so far as the <hi>Frier at Rome,</hi> who said, That <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>fell into great excesses in these things;</hi> yet they have dared to accuse his Writings of
<hi>Darkness and Obscurity,</hi> for no other reason, so far as I can understand, but because he insists on the Declaration of these Spiritual Mysteries. And it is not easie to express what contempt and reproach is cast by some Preachers on the Preaching of them. But it is not amiss that some have proclaimed their own shame herein, and have left it on Record to the abhorrency of Posterity.</p>

The Event of the Dispensation of the Gospel manifesteth, That the Spiritual things of it are foolishness to the most, for as such are they rejected by them: <hi>Esa.</hi> 53. 1, 2, 3. Suppose a Man of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for Wisdom and Sobriety, should go unto others, and inform them, and that with Earnestness, Evidence of Love to them, and care for them, with all kind of Motives to beget a belief of what he proposeth,

<hi>Divine</hi> Authority and Wisdom: Yet after all this we see, how few
<hi>Eventually</hi> do apply themselves with any industry to receive them, or at least actually do receive them; <hi>for many are called but few are chosen.</hi> And the Reason is, because indeed unto their <hi>darkened</hi> Minds, these things are <hi>Foolishness,</hi> whatsoever they pretend unto the contrary.</p>

The <hi>Natural Man</hi> he informs us, will by a <hi>Natural</hi> light discern <hi>Natural</hi> things. The things of a Man knoweth the Spirit of a Man. And the Spiritual Man by a Spiritual light received from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, discerneth <hi>Spiritual</hi> Things. For none knoweth the things of God, but the Spirit of God, and he to whom He will reveal them. This Ability the Apostle denies unto a Natural Man. And this he proves (1) Because it is the <hi>Work of the Spirit of God,</hi> to endow the Minds of Men with that ability, which there were no need of, in case Men had it of themselves by Nature. And (2) (as he shews plentifully elsewhere) The <hi>Light</hi> it self, whereby alone Spiritual things can be Spiritually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, is wrought, effected, created in us, by an Almighty Act of the Power of God, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>

<hi>study of their own,</hi> but of what they did, and would do, and could do no otherwise, when the Gospel was <hi>proposed,</hi> declared, and preached unto them. They did not, they <hi>could</hi> not receive, give assent unto, or believe the Spiritual Mysteries therein revealed. (4.) This Preaching of the Gospel unto them, was accompanied with, and managed with those Evidences mentioned; namely, the <hi>Testimonies of the Prophesies of Scripture,</hi> Miracles, and the like, in the same way and manner, and unto the same degree as it was towards them by whom it was received and believed.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>45</label> An Evidence of the Power and Efficacy of this Darkness, we may find in the Devil himself. The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, That the Angels who sinned are <hi>kept unto Judgment under Chains of Darkness,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 4. It is plain that there is an allusion in the words unto the dealings of Men with stubborn and hainous Malefactors. They do not presently execute them upon their Offences, nor when they are first apprehended. They must be kept unto a solemn day of Tryal and Judgment. But yet to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them that they make no escape, they are bound with <hi>Chains</hi> which they cannot deliver themselves from. Thus God deals with fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. For although yet they go to and fro in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and walk up and down in it, as also in the <hi>Air,</hi> in a seeming Liberty and at their pleasure, yet are they under such <hi>Chains</hi> as shall securely hold them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great Day of their Judgment and Execution. That they may not escape their appointed Doom, they are held in <hi>Chains of Darkness.</hi> They are alwayes so absolutely and universally under the Power of God, as that they are not capable of the Vanity of a Thought for the subducting themselves from under it. But whence is it that in all their Wisdom, Experience, and long-continued Prospect which they have had of their future eternal Misery, none of them ever have attempted, or ever will, a mitigation of their Punishment or Deliverance from it, by Repentance and Complyance with the Wild of God? This is alone from their <hi>own Darkness,</hi> in the Chains whereof they are so bound; that although they believe their own everlasting ruine, and tremble at the Vengeance of God therein, yet they cannot but continue in their course of Mischief, Disobedience and Rebellion. And although Natural Men are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same obdurateness with them, as having a way of Escape and Deliverance provided for them, and proposed unto them which they have not; yet this <hi>Darkness</hi> is no less effectual to bind them in a State of Sin, without the powerful Illumination of the Holy Ghost, than it is in the Devils themselves. And this may be farther manifested by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Instances wherein it puts forth its Efficacy in them.</p>

               <p>(3.) Our only aim is to prove the <hi>indispensible necessity</hi> of a saving Work of Illumination on the Mind, to enable it to receive Spiritual Things spiritually, which appears sufficiently from the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of this

               <p>(1.) The Mind from the Darkness that is in it, apprehends that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Things, the Things of the Gospel as they are proposed, have an

<hi>satisfie</hi> their Minds and fill their Desires. And this commonly before they have had any great Consideration of the Proposals of the Gospel, they suppose themselves in the <hi>way at least</hi> unto, by those little Tastes of Satisfaction unto their Lusts, which they have obtained in the wayes of the World. And these hopeful Beginnings they will not forgo. Isa. 57. 10. <hi>Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope; Thou hast found the Life of thine Hand, therefore thou wast not grieved.</hi> They are ready oft-times to faint in the pursuit of their Lusts, because of the Disappointments which they find in them, or the Evils that attend them. For which way soever they turn themselves in their Course, they cannot but see or shrewdly suspect that the end of them is, or will be <hi>Vanity</hi> and Vexation of Spirit. But yet they <hi>give not over</hi> the pursuit wherein they are engaged; they say not, <hi>There is no hope.</hi> And the Reason hereof is, because they <hi>find the Life of their Hand.</hi> Something or other comes in daily, either from the Work that they do, or the Company they keep, or the Expectation they have, which preserves their <hi>Hope</hi> alive, and makes them unwilling to forgo their present Condition. They find it to be none of the best, but do
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48389:125"/> not think there can be a better. And therefore their only design is to
<hi>improve</hi> or to thrive in it. If they might obtain more Mirth, more Wealth, more Strength and Health, more Assurance of their Lives, more Power, more Honour, more suitable Objects unto their sensual Desires, <hi>then</hi> they suppose it would be better than it is; but as for any thing which differeth from these in the <hi>whole kind,</hi> they can entertain no respect for it. In this State and Condition, <hi>Spiritual Things,</hi> the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mysterious things of the Gospel are proposed unto them. At first view they judg that these Things will not assist them in the pursuit or improvement of their Carnal Satisfactions. And so far they are in the
<hi>Right,</hi> they judg not amiss. The things of the Gospel will give nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countenance nor Help to the Lusts of Men. Nay, it is no hard matter for them to come to a discovery, that the Gospel being admitted in the Power of it, will <hi>crucifie</hi> and mortifie those corrupt Affections, which hitherto they have been given up to the pursuit of. For this it plainly declares, <hi>Col. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>54</label> There are but two things wherein Men seeking after Contentment and Satisfaction are concerned. First, The <hi>Objects</hi> of their Lusts or Desires, and then those <hi>Lusts</hi> and Desires themselves. The former may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in their <hi>own Nature,</hi> so they are indifferent, or as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being <hi>abused</hi> to corrupt and sinful ends. In the <hi>first way,</hi> as the Gospel <hi>condemns</hi> them not, so it adds nothing to them unto those by whom it is received. It gives not Men more Riches, Wealth, or Honour, than they had before in the World. It promises no such thing unto them that do receive it, but rather the contrary. The latter considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, it <hi>condemns</hi> and takes away. And for the <hi>desires</hi> of Men themselves, the avowed Work of the Gospel is to <hi>mortifie</hi> them. And hereby the naturally corrupt <hi>Relation</hi> which is between these Desires and their Objects, is broken and dissolved. The Gospel leaves Men unless upon <hi>extraordinary occasions,</hi> their Names, their Reputations, their Wealth, their Honours, if lawfully obtained and possessed. But the
<hi>League</hi> that is between the Mind and these things in all Natural Men must be broken. They must no more be looked on as the <hi>Chiefest Good,</hi> or in the place thereof, nor as the Matter of Satisfaction, but must give place to spiritual, unseen, eternal Things. This secretly <hi>alienates the Carnal Mind,</hi> and a Prejudice is raised against it, as that which would deprive the Soul of all its present Satisfaction, and offers nothing in the room of them that is suitable to any of its Desires or Affections. For by reason of the <hi>Darkness</hi> that it is under the Power of, it can neither
<hi>discern</hi> the Excellency of the Spiritual and Heavenly Things which are proposed unto it, nor have any Affections whereunto they are proper and suited, so that the Soul should go forth after them. Hereby this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> becomes invincible in their Souls. They neither do, nor can, nor will admit of those things which are utterly inconsistent with all things wherein they hope or look for Satisfaction. And Men do but please themselves with Dreams and Fancies, who talk of such a <hi>reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and excellency in Gospel-Truths, as that the <hi>Mind of a Natural Man</hi> will discern such a suitableness in them unto it self, so as thereon to receive and embrace them. Nor do any for the most part give a greater Evidence of the Prevalency of the Darkness and Enmity that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48389:126"/> is in Carnal Minds against the Spiritual Things of the Gospel, as to their Life and Power, than those who most <hi>pride</hi> and please themselves in such Discourses.</p>

The <hi>hidden Spiritual Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God</hi> in it as Natural Men cannot receive, so they do despise it; and all the parts of its Declaration they look upon as empty and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Notions. And this is that <hi>Prejudice</hi> whereby this Darkness prevails in the Minds of Men otherwise knowing and learned; it hath done so in all Ages, and in none more effectually than in that which is present. But there is a Sacred, Mysterious <hi>Spiritual Wisdom in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> and the Doctrine of it. This is <hi>Fanatical, Chimerical,</hi> and <hi>Foolish</hi> to the wisest in the World whilst they are under the Power of this Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. To demonstrate the Truth hereof, is the Design of the Apostle
<hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 1, &amp; 2. For he directly affirms that the Doctrine of the Gospel is the <hi>Wisdom of God in a Mystery;</hi> that this Wisdom cannot be discerned nor understood by the Wise and Learned Men of the World who have not received the Spirit of Christ; and therefore that the things of it are weakness and foolishness unto them. And that which is foolish is to be despised; yea, Folly is the only object of Contempt. And hence we see that some with the greatest Pride, Scorn and Contempt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, do despise the <hi>Purity, Simplicity,</hi> and whole Mystery of the Gospel, who yet profess they believe it. But to clear the whole Nature of this <hi>Prejudice,</hi> some few Things may be distinctly observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>56</label>(1.) There are two sorts of Things declared in the Gospel. First, Such as are <hi>absolutely</hi> its <hi>own,</hi> that are proper and peculiar unto it; Such as have no footsteps in the Law or in the Light of Nature, but are of a pure Revelation peculiar to the Gospel. Of this Nature are all Things concerning the Love and Will of God in Christ Jesus. The <hi>Mystery</hi> of his Incarnation, of his <hi>Offices</hi> and whole Mediation, of the Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Spirit, and our Participation thereof, and our Union with Christ thereby; our Adoption, Justification and Effectual Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thence proceeding: in brief, every thing that belongs unto the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase and Application of Saving-Grace is of this sort. These things are purely and properly <hi>Evangelical,</hi> peculiar to the Gospel alone. Hence the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> unto whom the Dispensation of it was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, puts that eminency upon them, that in comparison he resolved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on nothing else in his Preaching, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2. And to that purpose doth he describe his Ministry, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>57</label>(2.) There are such Things declared and enjoyned in the Gospel, as have their Foundation in the <hi>Law and Light of Nature.</hi> Such are all the
<hi>Moral Duties</hi> which are taught therein. And two things may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served concerning them; (1.) That they are in some measure known unto Men <hi>aliunde</hi> from other Principles. The inbred concreated Light of Nature doth, though obscurely, teach and confirm them. So the Apostle speaking of Mankind in general, saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Rom. 1. 19. <hi>That which may be known of God, is manifested in themselves.</hi> The Essential Properties of God rendring our Moral
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48389:126"/> Duty to him necessary, are known by the Light of Nature. And by the same Light are Men able to make a judgment of their Actions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Good or Evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. And this is all the Light which some boast of, as they will one day find to their disappointment. (2.) There is on all Men an <hi>obligation unto Obedience</hi> answerable to their Light concerning these things. The same Law and Light which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth these things, doth also enjoyn their Observance. Thus is it with all Men antecedently unto the Preaching of the Gospel unto them.</p>
               <p>In this Estate of Gospel <hi>superadds</hi> two things unto the Minds of Men. (1.) It directs us unto a right performance of these things; from a right Principle, by a right Rule, and to a right End and Purpose, so that they and we in them may obtain acceptance with God. Hereby it gives them a new <hi>Nature,</hi> and turns <hi>Moral Duties</hi> into <hi>Evangelical Obedience.</hi> (2.) By a communication of that Spirit which is annexed unto its Dispensation, it supplies us with strength for their Performance, in the manner it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>58</label> Hence it follows that this is the Method of the Gospel. First, It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth and declareth things which are <hi>properly</hi> and peculiarly its own. So the Apostle sets down the constant Entrance of his Preaching, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3. It reveals its <hi>own Mysteries</hi> to lay them as the Foundation of Faith and Obedience. It inlayes them in the Mind, and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the whole Soul unto them; See <hi>Rom. 6. 17. Gal. 4. 19. Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 11. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 18. This Foundation being laid, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it hath as it were nothing to do with the Souls of Men, nor will proceed unto any other thing, with them by whom this its first Work is refused, it then <hi>grafts all Duties</hi> of Moral Obedience on this stock of Faith in Christ Jesus. This is the Method of the Gospel, which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> observeth in all his Epistles. First, He declares the <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Faith</hi> that are peculiar to the Gospel, and then descends unto those
<hi>Moral Duties</hi> which are regulated thereby.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Prejudice</hi> we mentioned inverts the <hi>Order</hi> of these things. Those who are under the Power of it, when on various accounts they give admittance unto the Gospel in general, yet they fix their Minds <hi>firstly and principally</hi> on the things which have their Foundation in the <hi>Law and Light</hi> of Nature. These they know and have some acquaintance with in themselves, and therefore cry them up, although not in their proper place, nor to their <hi>proper</hi> end. These they make the <hi>foundation</hi> according to the place which they held in the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> and Covenant of Works, whereas the Gospel allows them to be only <hi>necessary Superstructions</hi> on the Foundation. But resolving to give unto Moral Duties the Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence in their Minds, they consider afterwards the peculiar Doctrines of the Gospel with one or other of these Effects: For (1.) some in a manner <hi>wholly despise them,</hi> reproaching those by whom they are singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly professed. What is contained in them, is of no importance in their Judgment, compared with the <hi>more necessary Duties of Morality</hi> which they pretend to embrace; and to acquit themselves of the trouble of a search into them, reject them as unintelligible or unnecessary. Or (2.) they will by forced Interpretations, enervating the Spirit, and perverting the Mystery of them, <hi>square</hi> and fit them to their own low and Carnal Apprehensions. They would reduce the Gospel and all the Mysteries of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48389:127"/> it, to their <hi>own Light</hi> as some, to Reason as others, to <hi>Philosophy</hi> as the rest; And let them who comply not with their weak and carnal Notions of things, expect all the <hi>contemptuous Reproaches</hi> which the proud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders unto <hi>Science and Wisdom</hi> of old, cast upon the Apostles and first Preachers of the Gospel. Hereby advancing <hi>Morality</hi> above the <hi>Mystery</hi> and Grace of the Gospel, they at once reject the Gospel, and destroy Morality also; for taking it off from its <hi>proper Foundation,</hi> it falls into the Dirt, whereof the Conversation of the Men of this Perswasion is no small Evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>59</label> From this Prejudice it is, that the <hi>Spiritual Things of the Gospel</hi> are by many despised and contemned. So God spake of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hos. 8. 12.
<hi>I have written to him the great things of the Law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</hi> The things intended were, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>great, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,</hi> various things of the Law. That which the Law was then unto that People, that is the Gospel now unto us. The <hi>Torah</hi> was the intire Means of God's communicating his Mind and Will unto them, as his whole Counsel is revealed unto us by the Gospel. These things he
<hi>wrote unto them,</hi> or made them in themselves and their Revelation plain and perspicuous. But when all was done they were esteemed by them
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as is also the Gospel, <hi>a thing forreign</hi> and alien unto the Minds of Men, which they intend not to concern themselves in. They will heed the things that are <hi>cognate</hi> unto the Principles of their Nature, things <hi>morally Good</hi> or Evil; but for the <hi>hidden Wisdom of God</hi> in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospel, it is esteemed by them as a <hi>strange thing.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable other <hi>Prejudices</hi> of the same Nature doth this Darkness fill the Minds of Men withal, whereby they are powerfully, and as unto any Light or Strength of their own, invincibly kept off from receiving of <hi>Spiritual Things in a spiritual manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>60</label> Again, the Power and Efficacy of this Darkness in and upon the Souls of Unregenerate Men, will be farther evidenced by the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of its especial Subject, or the Nature and Use of that Faculty which is affected with it. This is the Mind or Understanding. Light and Knowledg, are intellectual Vertues or Perfections of the Mind; and that in every kind what-ever, whether in things Natural, Moral or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. The Darkness whereof we treat, is the Privation of Spiritual Light, or the want of it. And therefore are they opposed unto one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
<hi>You were Darkness, but are Light in the Lord,</hi> Ephes. 5. 8. It is therefore the <hi>Mind</hi> or Understanding, which is affected with this Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is vitiated and depraved by it.</p>
               <p>Now the Mind may be considered two ways; (1.) As it is <hi>Theoretical</hi> or Contemplative, discerning and judging of things proposed unto it. So it is its office to find out, consider, discern and apprehend the truth of Things. In the Case before us, it is the duty of the Mind to apprehend, understand and receive the Truths of the Gospel as they are proposed unto it, in the <hi>manner</hi> of, and unto the <hi>end</hi> of their proposal. This, as we have manifested, by reason of its Depravation it neither doth nor is able to do, <hi>John 1. 5. 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 14. (2.) It may be considered as it is
<hi>practical,</hi> as to the Power it hath to direct the whole Soul, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Will unto actual Operation according to its Light. I shall not
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48389:127"/> enquire at present whether the Will as to the <hi>specification</hi> of its Acts, do necessarily follow the determination of the Mind or practical Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. I am at no more, but that it is the <hi>directive Faculty</hi> of the Soul as unto all Moral and Spiritual Operations. Hence it follows;</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>61</label>(1.) That nothing in the Soul, not the Will and Affections, can will, desire, or cleave unto any good, but what is presented unto them by the
<hi>Mind,</hi> and as it is presented. That Good what-ever it be which the
<hi>Mind</hi> cannot discover, the Will cannot chuse, nor the Affections cleave unto. All their actings about and concerning them, are not such as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer their Duty. This our Saviour directs us to the consideration of, Mat. 6. 22, 23. <hi>The Light of the Body is the Eye; if therefore thine Eye be single, the whole Body shall be full of Light. But if thine Eye be evil, the whole Body shall be full of Darkness; if therefore the Light that is in thee be Darkness, how great is that Darkness?</hi> As the Eye is naturally the Light of the Body, or the means thereof, so is the Mind unto the Soul. And if Darkness be in the Eye, not only the Eye but the whole Body is in Darkness, because in the Eye alone is the Light of the whole; so if the <hi>Mind</hi> be under Darkness, the whole Soul is so also, because it hath no Light but by the Mind. And hence both is <hi>Illumination</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken for the whole Work of Conversion unto God, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Actings of the Mind by the Renovation of the Holy Ghost, are constantly proposed, as those which precede any gracious Actings in the
<hi>Will,</hi> Heart and Life; as we shall shew afterwards.</p>
               <p>(2.) As the Soul can no way by any other of its Faculties receive, embrace or adhere unto that <hi>Good</hi> in a saving manner, which the Mind doth not savingly apprehend; so where the Mind is <hi>practically</hi> deceived, or any way captivated under the Power of Prejudices, the Will and the Affections, can no way free themselves from entertaining that <hi>evil</hi> which the Mind hath perversly assented unto. Thus where the Mind is <hi>repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi> or void of a sound Judgment; so as to call God Evil, and Evil Good; the Heart, Affections, and Conversation will be conformable thereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28, 29. And in the Scripture, the <hi>deceit</hi> of the Mind is commonly laid down as the Principle of all Sin what-ever, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 14. Heb. 3. 12, 13. 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 3.</p>

<hi>depraved,</hi> vitiated and corrupted, that it is not able upon the proposal of Spiritual Things unto it in the Dispensation and Preaching of the Gospel, to understand, receive and embrace them in a spiritual and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving manner, so as to have the <hi>sactifying Power</hi> of them thereby brought into and fixed in the Soul, without an internal, especial, immediate, supernatural, effectual enlightning Act of the Holy Ghost; which what it is, and wherein it doth consist, shall be declared.</p>

Wherefore to declare this aright we must consider the nature of <hi>Life and Death natural,</hi> in Allusion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Spiritual estate of <hi>Unregenerate</hi> Men is thus described.</p>
               <p>Life in general, or the Life of a Living Creature is, <hi>Actus Vivifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis in Vivificatum per unionem utriusque, The Act of a quickning Principle on a Subject to be quickened, by Virtue of their Union.</hi> And three things are to be considered in it.</p>
               <p>(1) The <hi>Principle</hi> of Life it self. And this in man is the <hi>Rational living Soul;</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Gen. 2. 7. God breathed into his nostrils the breath of Life, and Man became a living Soul.</hi> Having formed the Body of man of the Dust of the Earth, he designed him a Principle of Life <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> unto that of bruit Creatures, which is but the Exurgency and Spirit of their Temperature and Composition, though peculiarly educed by the formative Vertue and Power of the Holy Ghost, as hath been before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. He creates for him therefore a separate, distinct, <hi>animating soul,</hi> and infuseth it into the matter prepared for its Reception. And as he did thus in the Beginning of the Creation of the <hi>Species</hi> or Kind of humane Race in its first Individuals, so he continueth to do the same in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary course of the Works of his Providence for the continuation of it. For having ordained the Preparation of the Body by <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he immediately infuseth into it the <hi>Living Soul,</hi> the Breath of Life.</p>
               <p>(2) There is the <hi>Actus primus,</hi> or the quickning act of this Principle on the Principle quickned in and by Vertue of <hi>Union.</hi> Hereby the whole man becomes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, a person
<hi>quickned by a Vital Principle,</hi> and enabled for all naturally Vital Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>(3.) There are the <hi>Acts of this Life it self.</hi> And they are of two sorts.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48389:129"/> (1) Such as flow from Life, <hi>as Life:</hi> (2) Such as proceed from it, as such a Life, from the Principle of a Rational Soul. Those of the first sort are natural and necessary; as are all the <hi>Actings,</hi> and <hi>Energies</hi> of the Senses, of the <hi>locomotive</hi> Faculty, as also what belongs unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and improving of Nutriment. These are Acts of Life; whence the <hi>Psalmist</hi> proves Idols to be <hi>dead</hi> things, from the want of them; so far are they from having a <hi>Divine Life,</hi> as that they have no Life at all;
<hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 4, 5, 6, 7. These are Acts of <hi>Life as Life,</hi> inseparable from it, and their End is to preserve the Union of the whole, between the quickning and quickned Principles. (2) There are <hi>such Acts of Life</hi> as proceed from the especial nature of this quickning Principle. Such are all the <hi>elicit,</hi> and <hi>imperate Acts</hi> of our Understandings and Wills; all Actions that are voluntary, rational and peculiarly humane. These proceed from that <hi>special kind of Life,</hi> which is given by the especial quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Principle of a rational Soul.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> Hence it is evident wherein <hi>Death natural</hi> doth consist. And three things may be considered in it. (1) The Separation of the Soul from the Body. Hereby the Act of infusing the living Soul, ceaseth unto all its Ends. For as a Principle of Life unto the whole, it operates only by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>its Union</hi> with the subject to be quickned by it. (2) A Cessation of all <hi>Vital Actings</hi> in the quickned Subject. For that Union from whence they should proceed is dissolved. (3) As a Consequent of these, there is in the Body an <hi>Impotency</hi> for, and an <hi>Ineptitude</hi> unto all Vital Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Not only do all Operations of Life actually cease, but the Body is no more able to effect them. There remains in it indeed, <hi>Potentia obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientialis,</hi> a <hi>passive power</hi> to receive Life again, if communicated unto it by an external efficient Cause. So the body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> being dead, had a <hi>receptive Power</hi> of a living Soul. But an <hi>active Power</hi> to dispose it self unto Life or Vital Actions, it hath not.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> From these things we may be a just <hi>Analogie</hi> collect wherein Life and Death Spiritual do consist. And to that End some things must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viously observed. As 1: That <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of Innocency, besides his Natural life whereby he was a Living Soul, had likewise a <hi>Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life</hi> with respect unto its end whereby he lived unto God. This is called the <hi>Life of God, Ephes.</hi> 4. 18.; which Men now in the state of nature are alienated from; The Life which God requires, and which hath God for its Object and End. And this Life was in him <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi> for although it was concreated in, and with the <hi>rational Soul,</hi> as a perfection <hi>due</hi> unto it, in the state wherein, and with respect unto the End for which it was made; yet it did not <hi>naturally flow</hi> from the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the rational Soul; nor were the Principles, Faculties or Abilities of it inseparable from those of the Soul it self, being only <hi>accidental</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of them, inlaid in them by especial Grace. This Life was necessary unto him, with respect unto the state wherein, and the End for which he was made. He was made to <hi>live</hi> unto the living God, and that in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner; to live <hi>unto</hi> his glory in this World, by the discharge of the rational and moral Obedience required of him, and to live afterward
<hi>in</hi> his Glory, and the eternal Enjoyment of him, as his Cheifest Good and Highest Reward. That whereby he was enabled hereunto, was that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48389:129"/>
                  <hi>Life of God,</hi> which we are alienated from in the state of Nature. 2. In this Life, as in <hi>Life</hi> in General three things are to be considered; (1) Its Principle; (2) Its Operation; (3) Its Vertue; or Habit, Act, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label>(1.) There was a <hi>Quickning Principle</hi> belonging unto it. For every Life is an Act of a Quïckning Principle. This in <hi>Adam</hi> was the Image of God; or an habitual Conformity unto God his Mind and Will; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God himself was represented, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26, 27. In this <hi>Image</hi> he was created, or it was concreated with him, as a Perfection due to his Nature, in the Condition wherein he was made. This gave him an <hi>habitual disposition</hi> unto all duties of that Obedience that was required of him. It was the Rectitude of all the faculties of his Soul with respect unto his Supernatural End, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 20.</p>
               <p>(2) There belonged unto it <hi>continual Actings,</hi> from, or by Vertue of, and suitable unto this Principle. All the Acts of <hi>Adam's</hi> Life should have been subordinate unto his great moral End. In all that he did, he should have <hi>lived unto God,</hi> according unto the Law of that Covenant wherein he walked before him. And an Acting in all things, suitable unto the Light in his Mind, unto the Righteousness and Holiness in his Will and Affection, that Uprightness or Integrity, or Order that was in his Soul, was his <hi>Living unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">

And in these three did the <hi>Supernatural Life of Adam</hi> in Innocency consist. And it is that which the Life whereunto we are restored by Christ doth answer. It an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers unto it I say, and supplies its absence with respect unto the End of living unto God, according unto the New Covenant that we are taken into. For neither would the Life of <hi>Adam</hi> be sufficient for us, to live unto God according to the terms of the <hi>New</hi> Covenant; nor is the Life of Grace we now enjoy, suited to the Covenant wherein <hi>Adam</hi> stood before God. Wherefore some Differences there are between them, the Principal whereof may be reduced into two Heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> 1. That <hi>Principle of this Life</hi> was wholly and intirely in Man himself. It was the <hi>Effect</hi> of another Cause, of that which was without him, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Good Will and Power of God; but it was left to grow on no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Root</hi> but what was in Man himself. It was wholly implanted in his Nature, and therein did its Springs lye. Actual Excitations by Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Power from God, it should have had. For no Principle of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration can subsist in an Independence of God, nor apply it self unto Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration without his Concurence. But in the Life whereunto we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Jesus Christ, the <hi>Fountain</hi> and Principle of it is not in our selves but in him, as One common Head unto all that are made Partakers of him. <hi>He is our Life, Col.</hi> 1. 3. and our Life, (as to the Spring and Fountain of it) is hid with him in God. For he quickneth us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. And our <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> as in us consists in the <hi>Vital Actings</hi> of this Spirit of his in Us; for, <hi>without him we can do nothing,</hi> John 15. 3.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48389:130"/> By Vertue hereof we <hi>walk in newness of Life; Rom.</hi> 6. 4. We live therefore hereby, yet not <hi>so much we, as Christ liveth in us;</hi> Gal. 2. 20.</p>

<hi>Object</hi> of their Vital Acts. For the Life which we now lead by the faith of the Son of God, hath sundry <hi>Objects</hi> of its Actings, which the other had not. For whereas all the Actings of our Faith and Love, that is, all our Obedience doth respect the Revelation that God makes of himself and his Will unto us; there are now <hi>New Revelations</hi> of God in Christ, and consequently new Duties of Obedience required of us, as will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appear. And other such differences there are between them. The Life which we had in <hi>Adam</hi> and that which we are renewed unto in Christ Jesus, are so far of the same <hi>Nature</hi> and kind, as our Apostle manifests in sundry Places, <hi>Ephes. 4. 23, 24.

Now this in the first Place hath respect unto the Life we had in <hi>Adam:</hi> For the Deprivation of that Life, was in the Sanction of the <hi>Law, Thou shalt die the Death.</hi> This Spiritual Death is comprized therein, and that in the Privation of that Spiritual Life, or Life unto God, which Unregenerate Men, never had, neither <hi>de facto,</hi> nor <hi>de jure,</hi> in any state or condition. Wherefore with respect hereunto they are dead only <hi>negatively;</hi> they have it not; but with respect unto the Life we had in <hi>Adam,</hi> they are dead <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively,</hi> they have lost that Power of Living unto God which they had.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> From what hath been discoursed, we may discover the Nature of this Spiritual Death, under the Power whereof all Unregenerate Persons do abide. For there are three things in it. (1) A <hi>Privation</hi> of a Principle of Spiritual Life enabling us to live unto God; (2) A <hi>Negation</hi> of all Spiritual Vital Acts; that is, of all Acts and Duties of holy Obedience acceptable unto God, and tending to the Enjoyment of him. (3) A to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<hi>Defect</hi> and want of <hi>Power</hi> for any such Acts whatever. All these are in that Death which is a Privation of Life, such as this is.</p>
               <p>First, there is in it a <hi>Privation</hi> of a Principle of Spiritual Life, namely of that which we had before the Entrance of sin, or a Power of living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God according to the Covenant of Works; and a <hi>Negation</hi> of that which we have by Christ, or a Power of Living unto God according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace. Those therefore who are thus dead have no <hi>Principle</hi> or <hi>First Power</hi> of Living unto God, or the Performance of any Duty to be accepted with him, in order to the Enjoyment of him, according to either Covenant. It is with them as to all the Acts and Ends of <hi>Life Spiritual,</hi> as it is with the Body as to the <hi>Acts and Ends</hi> of <hi>Life Natural,</hi> when the Soul is departed from it. Why else are they said to be <hi>dead?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> It is objected that there is a wide difference between Death <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Spiritual.</hi> In Death <hi>Natural</hi> the soul it self is utterly removed and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48389:130"/> taken from the Body: but in Death Spiritual it continues. A man is still notwithstanding this <hi>Spiritual</hi> Death, endowed with an Understanding, Will, and Affections. And by these are Men enabled to perform their Duty unto God; and yield the Obedience required of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> (1) In Life <hi>Spiritual,</hi> the Soul is unto the Principle of it, as the Body is unto the Soul in Life <hi>Natural.</hi> For in Life <hi>Natural</hi> the Soul is the quickning Principle, and the Body is the Principle <hi>quickned.</hi> When the Soul departs it leaves the Body with all its own Natural Properties, but utterly deprived of <hi>them</hi> which it had by Vertue of its Union with the Soul. So in Life Spiritual the Soul is not in and by its Essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties the <hi>quickning Principle</hi> of it, but it is the <hi>Principle</hi> that is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And when the quickning Principle of Spiritual Life departs, it leaves the Soul with all its Natural Properties entire as to their Essence, though morally corrupted. But of all the Power and Abilities which it had by Virtue of its Union with a quickning Principle of Spiritual Life, it is deprived. And to deny such a <hi>quickning Principle</hi> of Spiritual Life super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added unto us by the Grace of Christ, distinct and separate from the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faculties of the Soul, is upon the matter to renounce the whole Gospel. It is all one, as to deny that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in the Image of God, which he lost, and that we are renewed unto the Image of God by Jesus Christ. Hence. (<hi>2ly</hi>) Whatever the Soul acts in Spiritual things by its Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Will, and Affections, as deprived of, or not quickned by this Principle of Spiritual Life, it doth it Naturally not <hi>Spiritually,</hi> as shall be instantly made to appear.</p>
               <p>There is therefore in the first Place a <hi>Disability</hi> or Impotency unto all Spiritual things to be performed in a Spiritual manner, in all Persons not
<hi>born again by the Spirit,</hi> because they are Spiritually dead. Whatever they can do; or however Men may call what they do, unless they are endowed with a <hi>quickning Principle</hi> of Grace, they can perform no Act
<hi>Spiritually</hi> vital, no Act of Life, whereby we live to God; or that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely accepted with him. Hence it is said, the <hi>Carnal Mind is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against God, it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can</hi> it be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. so then, <hi>they that are in the flesh cannot</hi> please God. v. 8. Men may cavil whilst they please about this <hi>carnal Mind,</hi> and contend that it is only the sensitive part of the Soul, or the Affections as corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Prejudices and depraved habits of Vice. Two things are plain in the Text. First, that this <hi>Carnal Mind,</hi> is in all mankind whoever they be, who are not partakers of the Spirit of God, and his Quickning Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Secondly; that where it is, there is a <hi>Disability</hi> of doing any thing that should please God; which is the Sum of what we contend for, and which Men may with as little a disparagement of their Modesty deny, as reject the Authority of the Apostle. So our Saviour as to one Instance tells us, that no Man <hi>can come</hi> unto him unless the Father draw him.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 4. 4. And so is it figuratively expressed where all Men being by Nature compared unto <hi>evil Trees,</hi> it is affirmed of them, that they <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring forth</hi> Good fruit unless their Nature be changed; <hi>Mat. 7. 18. Chap.</hi> 12. 33. And this Disability as to Good is also compared by the Prophet unto such Effects, as lye under a <hi>Natural Impossibility</hi> of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment,
<hi>Jerem.</hi> 13. 24. We contend not about Expressions. This is that which the Scripture abundantly instructeth us in. There is <hi>no
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48389:131"/> Power</hi> in Men by Nature whereby they are of themselves, upon the mere
<hi>proposal</hi> of their Duty in Spiritual Obedience, and Exhortations from the Word of God unto the Performance of it accompanied with all the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> which are meet and suited to prevail with them thereunto, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, know, will, or do any thing in such a Way or Manner, as that it should be accepted with God, with respect unto our Spiritual Life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him according to his Will, and future Enjoyment of him, without the
<hi>Efficacious Infusion</hi> into them, or Creation in them, of a <hi>new gracious Principle</hi> or Habit enabling them thereunto; and that this is according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought in all that believe by the Holy Ghost, we shall afterwards declare.</p>
               <p>But it will be Objected; and hath against this Doctrine been ever so, since the days of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> that a supposition hereof renders all <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Commands, Promises,</hi> and <hi>Threatnings,</hi> which comprize the whole Way of the external communication of the Will of God unto us, vain and useless. For to what purpose is it to exhort <hi>Blind Men</hi> to see, or
<hi>Dead Men</hi> to live, or to promise Rewards unto them upon their so doing? Should Men thus deal with <hi>stones,</hi> would it not be vain and ludicrous, and that because of their <hi>Impotency</hi> to comply with any such proposals of our Mind unto them.

But the Scripture every-where chargeth the <hi>Destruction</hi> of Men upon their wilful sin, not their weakness or disability.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> (1.) Mens Disability to live to God is their sin. What-ever therefore ensues thereon, may be justly charged on them. It is that which came on us by the <hi>Sin of our Nature</hi> in our first Parents; all whose Consequents are our sin and our misery, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. Had it befallen us without a guilt truly our own, according to the Law of our Creation and Covenant of our Obedience, the Case would have been otherwise. But on this Supposition, (sufficiently confirmed else-where) those who perish, do but <hi>feed on the Fruit of their own Wayes.</hi>

In the Transactions between God and the Souls of Men, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto their Obedience and Salvation, there is none of them but hath a <hi>Power</hi> in sundry things, as to some degrees and measures of them, to comply with his Mind and Will, which they voluntarily neglect. And this of it self is sufficient to <hi>bear the Charge</hi> of their eternal ruine. But;</p>
               <p>(3.) No Man is so <hi>unable</hi> to live unto God, to do any thing for him, but that withal he is <hi>able</hi> to do any thing against him. There is in all Men by Nature a depraved vitious habit of Mind wherein they are <hi>alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> from the Life of God. And there is no command given unto Men
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48389:132"/> for Evangelical Faith or Obedience, but they can and do put forth a free <hi>positive Act</hi> of their Wills in the rejection of it, either directly or

               <p>This is the Description which the Scripture giveth us, concerning the Power, Ability, or Disability of Men in the State of Nature as unto the Performance of Spiritual Things. By some it is traduced as <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> and senseless, which the Lord Christ must answer for, not we.

From this defect of Power, or the want of a <hi>Principle</hi> of Spiritual Life, it is, that Men in the state of Nature can perform no <hi>Vital Act</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Obedience; nothing that is <hi>spiritually</hi> Good, or Saving, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God according to the Tenor of the New Covenant; which we shall in the second place a little explain.</p>
               <p>The whole course of our Obedience to God in Christ is the <hi>Life of God,</hi> Ephes. 4. 18. That <hi>Life</hi> which is from him in a peculiar manner, whereof he is the especial Author, and whereby we <hi>live unto</hi> him which is our End. And the Gospel which is the Rule of our Obedience, is called the <hi>words of this Life,</hi> Acts 5. 20. That which guides and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us how to live to God. Hence all the Duties of this Life are <hi>Vital Acts,</hi> spiritually Vital Acts, Acts of that Life whereby we live to God.</p>
               <p>

They are so all of them, either in their <hi>own Nature,</hi> or with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by whom they are performed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. They are dead Works because they proceed not from a Principle of Life, are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as dead things, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 11. and end in death eternal, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
               <p>We may then consider how this <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> which enableth us unto these <hi>Vital Acts</hi> is derived and communicated unto us. (1.) The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Spring and Fountain of this Life is with God; Psal. 36. 9. <hi>With thee is the Fountain of Life;</hi> The sole Spring of our Spiritual Life is in an especial way and manner in God. And hence our Life is said to be
<hi>hid with Christ in God,</hi> Col. 3. 3. that is, as in its Eternal producing and preserving Cause. But it is thus also with respect unto <hi>all Life</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. God is the <hi>living God,</hi> all other things are in themselves but dead Things; their Life, what-ever it be, is in him efficiently and eminently, and in them is purely <hi>derivative.</hi> Wherefore;</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>23</label>(2.) Our Spiritual Life, as unto the <hi>especial Nature</hi> of it is <hi>specifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and discerned from a Life of any other kind, in that the <hi>fulness</hi> of it is communicated unto the Lord Christ as Mediator, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. And from his fulness we do receive it. <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. There is a Principle of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48389:132"/> Spiritual Life communicated unto us from his fulness thereof, whence he quickneth whom he pleaseth. Hence he is said to <hi>be our Life,</hi> Col. 3. 4. And in our Life, it is not so <hi>much we</hi> who live, as Christ that liveth in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. because we <hi>act nothing</hi> but as we are <hi>acted</hi> by Vertue and Power from him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10.</p>

That he is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate efficient Cause hereof, we shall afterwards fully evince and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.

               <p>4ly; This Spiritual Life is communicated unto us by the Holy Ghost according unto, and in order for the Ends of that <hi>New Covenant.</hi> For this is the Promise of it, That God will first <hi>write his Law</hi> in our Hearts, and then we shall walk in his Statutes; that is, the Principle of Life must precede all <hi>vital</hi> Acts. From this Principle of Life thus derived and conveyed unto us, are all those <hi>vital Acts</hi> whereby we live to God. Where this is not, as it is not in any that are dead in sin, for from the want hereof are they denominated <hi>dead,</hi> no Act of Obedience unto God can so be performed, as that it should be an <hi>Act of the Life of God;</hi> and this is the way whereby the Scripture doth express it. The same thing is intended, when we say in other words, that without an infused <hi>habit of internal inherent Grace,</hi> received from Christ by an efficacious Work of the Spirit no Man can <hi>believe</hi> or <hi>obey God,</hi> or perform any Duty in a saving manner, so as it should be accepted with Him. And if we abide not in this Principle, we let in the whole poysonous Flood of <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi> into the Church.

That it is accepted with God: And (2.) that it is sanctified in them that do it; but neither of these are in the Duties of Unregenerate Men. For they have not Faith; And <hi>without Faith it is impossible to please God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. And the Apostle also assures us; That unto the defiled and unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that is, all unsanctified Persons not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the Spirit of Grace, <hi>All things are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, because their Consciences and Minds are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,</hi> Tit. 1. 15.

<hi>approved</hi> and hath its Acceptation in its proper place. For Duties may be performed two wayes. (1.) In <hi>hypocrisie</hi> and pretence, so they are utterly abhorred of God in matter and manner; that is such a poisonous Ingredient as vitiates the whole, <hi>Isa. 1. 11, 12, 13, 14. Hos.</hi> 1. 4. (2.) In Integrity according unto present Light and Conviction, which for the substance of them are approved. And no Man is to be exhorted to do any thing in <hi>Hypocrisie;</hi> see <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 21. And on this account also, that the Duties themselves are acceptable, Men may be pressed to them. But (3ly,) it must be granted, that the same Duty for the substance of it in general, and performed according to the <hi>same</hi> Rule as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward manner of it, may be accepted in or from one, and rejected in or from another. So was it with the Sacrifices of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi> And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so, but the same rejected Duty may have Degrees of evil, for which it is rejected, and be more sinful in and unto one than unto another. But we must observe that the difference doth not relate meerly unto the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> States of the Persons by whom such are performed; as because one is in the <hi>state</hi> of Grace, whose Duties are accepted; and another in the
<hi>state</hi> of Nature, whose Duties are rejected as their Persons are. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Acceptation of our Persons be a necessary condition for the Acceptation of our Duties, as God first had respect unto <hi>Abel,</hi> and then unto his Offerings; yet there is alwayes a real <hi>specifical</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence between the Duties themselves, whereof one is accepted and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48389:133"/> the other rejected, although, it may be unto us, it be every way impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. As in the Offerings of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> that of <hi>Abel</hi> was offered in Faith, the defect whereof in the other caused it to be refused. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Duties therefore to be every way the <hi>same</hi> as to the Principles, Rule and Ends, or what-ever is necessary to render them good in their kind; and they would be all equally accepted with God, by whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are performed, for he is <hi>no accepter of Persons.</hi> But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but where those that perform them are partakers of the same Grace. It is therefore the Wills of Men only that <hi>vitiate</hi> their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are required of them as good; and if so they may justly be required of them. The defect is not immediately in their State, but in their <hi>Wills</hi> and their Perversity.</p>

This they are all bound to attend unto; and if what they do through their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect prove eventually sin unto them, yet the Commandment is just and holy, and the observance of it justly prescribed unto them. The Law is the <hi>moral cause</hi> of the performance of the Duties it requires, but not of the <hi>sinful manner</hi> of their performance. And God hath not lost his right of commanding Men, because they by their sin have lost their Power to fulfil his Commands. And if they equity of the Command doth arise from the proportioning of strength that Men have to answer it, He that by contracting the highest <hi>moral Disability</hi> that depraved ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of Mind can introduce, or a course of sinning produce in him, is freed from owning obedience unto any of God's Commands; seeing all confess that such an <hi>habit of sin</hi> may be contracted, as will deprive them in whom it is, of all Power of Obedience.

For (1.) it is the <hi>Will and Command of God</hi> that so they should do, and that is the Rule of all our Duties. They are not to consider what Man can do or will do, but what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. To make a judgment of Mens Ability, and to accommodate the Commands of God unto them accordingly, is not committed unto any of the Sons of Men. (2.) They have a <hi>double End</hi> in pressing on Men the observance of Duties, with a supposition of the State of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency described. (1.) To prevent them from such <hi>courses of sin,</hi> as would harden them, and so render their Conversion more difficult if not desperate. (2.) To exercise a means appointed of God for their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,</hi> or the Communication of Saving-Grace unto them. Such are God's Commands, and such are the Duties required in them. In and by them God doth use to communicate of his Grace unto the Souls of Men, not with respect unto <hi>them</hi> as their Duties, but as they are wayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and sanctified by <hi>him</hi> unto such ends. And hence it follows that even such Duties as are <hi>vitiated</hi> in their performance, yet are of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage unto them by whom they are performed. For (1.) by attendance unto them, they are preserved from many sins. (2.) In an especial manner from the great sin of <hi>despising God,</hi> which ends commonly in that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48389:134"/> which is unpardonable. (3.) They are hereby made <hi>useful</hi> unto others, and many ends of God's Glory in the World. (4.) They are <hi>kept in God's Way,</hi> wherein they may gradually be brought over unto a real Conversion unto him.</p>

There is not so in a <hi>dead Carcass</hi> unto Life Natural; It is a Subject meet for an External Power to introduce a Living Principle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; so the dead Body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was quickned and animated again by the introduction of his Soul. But in it self it had not the least <hi>active Disposition</hi> nor Inclination thereunto. And no otherwise is it with a Soul dead in Trespasses and Sins. There is in it <hi>Potentia Obedientialis,</hi> a Power rendring it meet to receive the Communications of Grace and Spiritual Life. But a Disposition thereunto of its own it hath not. There is in it a <hi>remote Power,</hi> in the nature of its Faculties <hi>meet to be wrought upon</hi> by the Spirit and Grace of God. But an <hi>immediate Power</hi> disposing and enabling it unto <hi>Spiritual Acts</hi> it hath not. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because Natural Corruption cleaves unto it, as an invincible <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Habit</hi> constantly inducing unto evil, wherewith the <hi>least Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> unto Spiritual Good is not inconsistent. There is in the Soul in the Scripture-Language (which some call <hi>Canting) the Body of the Sins of the Flesh,</hi> 2 Col. 11. which unless it be taken away by Spiritual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision through the vertue of the Death of Christ, it will lie dead in to Eternity. There is therefore in us that which may be <hi>quickned</hi> and
<hi>saved.</hi> And this is all we have to boast of by Nature. Though Man by Sin be made like the <hi>Beasts that perish,</hi> being bruitish and foolish in his Mind and Affections; yet he is not so absolutely, he retains that <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul,</hi> those <hi>intellectual Faculties</hi> which were the Subject of <hi>Original Righteousness,</hi> and are meet to receive again the Renovation of the Image of God by Jesus Christ.</p>

So <hi>Balaam</hi> desired to die the Death of the Righteous, and
<hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John Baptist</hi> gladly, doing many things willingly. And great Endeavours after Conversion unto God, we find in many who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain thereunto. So that to say there <hi>is no Disposition</hi> unto Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life in any Unregenerate Person, is to make them all equal, which is contrary to Experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> (1.) There is no doubt but that Unregenerate Men may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form many <hi>external</hi> Duties, which are good in themselves, and lie in the order of the outward Disposal of the means of Conversion. Nor is it questioned but they may have real Designs, Desires, and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after that which is presented unto them as their chiefest Good. But so far as these Desires or Actings are meerly <hi>Natural,</hi> there is no
<hi>Disposition</hi> in them unto Spiritual Life, or that which is Spiritually Good: So far as they are <hi>Supernatural,</hi> they are not of themselves. For;</p>

                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:48389:134"/> (2.) Although there are no <hi>preparatory Inclinations</hi> in Men, yet there are <hi>preparatory Works upon them.</hi> Those who have not the Word, yet may have Convictions of Good and Evil, from the <hi>Authority</hi> of God in their Consciences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. And the Law in the Dispensation of it, may work Men unto many Duties of Obedience; much more may the Gospel so do. But what-ever Effects are hereby produced, they are wrought by the <hi>Power of God</hi> exerted in the Dispensation of the Word. They are not <hi>educed</hi> out of the natural Faculties of the Minds of Men, but are Effects of the Power of God in them and upon them. For we know that <hi>in the flesh there dwelleth no good thing;</hi> And all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Men are no more; for that which is <hi>born of the flesh is flesh.</hi>

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48389:135"/> by their Ignorance of that state, which they will not learn either from the Scripture or Experience; For, <hi>Natura sic apparet vitiata ut hoc majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris vitii sit non videre,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> speaks. It is an Evidence of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Nature, that it disenables the Minds of Men to discern their own Corruption. We have previously discharged this work so far as it is necessary unto our present purpose. Many other things might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Explication of it, were that our direct Design. Particularly having confined my self to treat only concerning the Depravation of the
<hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> I have not insisted on that of the <hi>Affections,</hi> which yet is effectual to retain unregenerate Men under the Power of sin; though it be far enough from <hi>Truth</hi> that the whole <hi>Corruption of Nature</hi> consists therein, as some weakly and <hi>Athologically</hi> have Imagined. Much less have I treated concerning that encrease and heightning of the <hi>Depravation</hi> of Nature which is attracted by a Custom of sinning, as unto all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Ends of it. Yet this also the Scripture much insists upon, as that which naturally and necessarily ensues in all in whom it is not prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the effectual transforming Grace of the Spirit of God. And it is that which <hi>seals</hi> up the Impossibility of their turning themselves to God.
<hi>Jerom. 13. 23. Rom.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. But that the whole Difficulty of Conversion should arise from Mens contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Habit or Custom of sinning,</hi> is <hi>false,</hi> and openly contradictory to the Scripture. These things are <hi>Personal Evils</hi> and befal <hi>Individuals</hi> through their own default in various Degrees. And we see that amongst Men under the same use of means, some are converted unto God, who have been deeply immersed in an habitual course of open sins, whilst others kept from them by the Influence of their Education upon their Inclinations and Affections, remain uncoverted. So was it of old between the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> and Harlots on the one hand, and the <hi>Pharisees</hi> on the other. But my design was only to mention that which is common unto all; Or wherein all Men Universally are equally concerned, who are partakers of the same Humane Nature in its lapsed Condition. And what we have herein decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Scriptures will guide us in our Enquiry after the work of the Holy Spirit of Grace in our Deliverance from it.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> It is evident and needs no further confirmation that persons <hi>Living</hi> and <hi>Dying</hi> in this Estate cannot be saved. This hitherto hath been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all that are called Christians, nor are we to be moved that some who call themselves so, do begin to <hi>laugh</hi> at the disease and <hi>Despise</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of our Nature. Among those who lay any serious and real claim unto Christianity, there is nothing more certain, nor more acknowledged, than that there is no Deliverance from a state of <hi>misery</hi> for those who are not delivered from a state of <hi>sin.</hi> And he who denies the necessary pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing of all that live and dye in the state of Corrupted Nature, denies all the use of the Incarnation and Mediation of the Son of God. For if we may be <hi>saved</hi> without the <hi>Renovation of our Natures,</hi> there was no need, nor use of the <hi>New</hi> Creation of all things by Jesus Christ, which principally consists therein. And if Men may be saved under all the Evils that came upon us by the <hi>fail,</hi> then did Christ dye in vain. Besides, it is frequently expressed that Men in that state are <hi>Enemies</hi> to God, alienat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, Children of Wrath, under the Curse; and if such may be saved, so may <hi>Devils</hi> also. In brief, it is not consistent with the Nature
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48389:136"/> of God, his Holiness, Righteousness or Truth, with the Law or Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nor possible in the nature of the thing it self, that such persons should <hi>enter into,</hi> or be made possessors of Glory and Rest with God. A Deliverance therefore out of and from this Condition is indispensibly necessary to make us meet for the inheritance of the Saints in Light.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> This Deliverance must be, and is by Regeneration. The Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our Saviour is positive both in this and the necessity of it before assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Joh. 3. 3. Except a Man be born again,</hi> or from above, <hi>he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</hi> Whatever sense the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> is taken in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that of Grace here, or of Glory hereafter, it is all the same as unto our present purpose. There is no Interest in it to be obtained, no Participation of the Benefits of it, unless a man be <hi>born again,</hi> unless he be <hi>Regenerate.</hi> And this Determination of our Saviour, as it is absolute and decretory, so it is applicable unto and equally comprizeth every
<hi>Individual</hi> of mankind. And the Work intended by their <hi>Regeneration</hi> or in being born again, which is the Spiritual Conversion and Quickning of the Souls of Men, is everywhere ascribed unto them that shall be saved. And although Men may have through their ignorance and prejudices false <hi>Apprehensions</hi> about Regeneration and the Nature of it, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it doth consist; yet so far as I know, all Christians are agreed, that it is the way and means of our Deliverance from the state of Sin or Corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature, or rather our <hi>Deliverance</hi> it self. For this both express Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of Scripture, and the Nature of the thing it self, put beyond Contradiction, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. And those by whom it is exposed unto scorn, who esteem it a ridiculous thing for any one to enquire whether he be <hi>Regenerate</hi> or no, will one day understand the necessity of it; although it may be not before it is too late to obtain any Advantage thereby.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> The Holy Ghost is the <hi>immediate Author</hi> and Cause of this work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. And herein again as I suppose, we have in general the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all. Nothing is more in words acknowledged than that all the
<hi>Elect of God are sanctified by the Holy Ghost.</hi> And this Regeneration is the Head, Fountain or Beginning of our Sanctification virtually comprizing the whole in it self, as will afterwards appear. However that it is a part thereof, is not to be denied. Besides, as I suppose it is equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to be an Effect or Work of <hi>Grace,</hi> the Actual Dispensation whereof is solely in the hand of the Holy Spirit. This I say is in words acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all; although I know not how some can reconcile this Profession unto other notions and sentiments which they declare concerning it: For setting aside what Men do herein <hi>themselves,</hi> and what <hi>others</hi> do towards them in the Ministry of the Word, and I cannot see what remains as they express their loose Imaginations, to be ascribed unto the Spirit of God. But at present we shall make use of this general concession that <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is the Work of the Holy Ghost, or an Effect of his Grace. Not that we have any need so to do, but that we may avoid contesting about those things wherein Men may shrowd their false Opinions under general am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Expressions, which was the constant practice of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and those who followed him of Old. But the Scripture is express in Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48389:136"/> to our purpose. What our Saviour calls <hi>being born again, John</hi> 3. 3. He calls being <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> ver. 5. 6. because he is the sole principal efficient Cause of this <hi>new birth.</hi> For it is the <hi>Spirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, Joh. 6. v. 63. Rom.</hi> 8. 11. And God saveth us, <hi>according to his mercy by the washing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Tit. 3. 5. whereas therefore we are said to be born of God, or to be begotten again of his own will; <hi>John 1. 13. Jam. 1. 18. 1 John</hi> 3. 9. it is with respect unto the especial and peculiar Operation of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> These things are thus far confessed, even by the <hi>Pelagians</hi> themselves, both those of old, and those at present, at least in general; nor hath any as yet been so hardy as to deny Regeneration to be the Work of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit in us; unless we must except those deluded Souls who deny both him and his Work. Our sole Enquiry therefore must be after the
<hi>manner</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of this work; for the nature of it depends on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the working of the Spirit of God herein. This I acknowledg was variously contended about of old; and the truth concerning it, hath scarce escaped an open Opposition in any Age of the Church. And at present this is the great Ball of Contention, between the <hi>Jesuites</hi> and the
<hi>Jansenists,</hi> the latter keeping close to the Doctrine of the principal Ancient Writers of the Church, the former under new Notions, Expressions and Distinctions endeavouring the Reinforcement <hi>of Pelagianism,</hi> whereunto some of the Elder <hi>School-Men</hi> led the way, of whom our <hi>Bradwardine</hi> so long ago complained. But never was it with so much Impotence and Ignorance traduced and reviled as it is by some among our selves. For a sort of Men we have who by stories of <hi>wandring Jews, Rhetorical Declamations</hi> pert Cavillings and proud Revilings of those who dissent from them, think to scorn and banish Truth out of the World; though they never yet durst attempt to deal openly and plainly with any one Argument that is pleaded in its defence and confirmation.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> The Ancient Writers of the Church, who looked into these things with most diligence and laboured in them with most success, as <hi>Austin, Hilary, Prosper,</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> do represent the whole Work of the Spirit of God towards the Souls of Men under certain Heads or Distinctions of Grace. And herein were they followed by many of the more sober <hi>School-Men;</hi> and others of late without number. Frequent mention we find in them of Grace, as <hi>preparing, preventing,</hi> Working, <hi>Co-working</hi> and <hi>Confirming.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these Heads do they handle the whole Work of our Regeneration or Conversion unto God. And although there may be some Alteration in
<hi>Method</hi> and ways of Expression, which may be varied as they are found to be of Advantage unto them that are to be instructed; yet for the substance of the Doctrine, they taught the same which hath been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst us since the Reformation, which some have ignorantly tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as novel. And the whole of it is nobly and elegantly exemplifyed by <hi>Austin</hi> in his <hi>Confessions,</hi> wherein he gives us the Experience of the Truth he had taught in his own Soul. And I might follow their footsteps herein, and perhaps should for some Reasons have chosen so to have done; but that there have been so many differences raised about the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Application of these Terms and Distinctions; and the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48389:137"/> of the nature of the Acts and Effects of the Spirit of Grace intended in them; as that to carry the Truth through the intricate perplexities which under these notions have been cast upon it, would be a longer Work than I shall here ingage into; and too much divert me from my principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. I shall therefore in general refer the whole Work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God with respect unto the Regeneration of sinners unto two Heads. First, that which is <hi>preparatory</hi> for it; and secondly, that which is <hi>effective</hi> of it. That which is preparatory for it, is the <hi>Conviction</hi> of sin; This is the Work of the Holy Spirit. <hi>John</hi> 16. 8. 9. And this also may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly referred unto three Heads. (1) A Discovery of the <hi>True Nature of Sin,</hi> by the ministry of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. (2) An <hi>Application</hi> of that discovery made in the Mind or Understanding unto the <hi>Conscience</hi> of the sinner. (3) The <hi>Excitation</hi> of Affections suitable unto that Discovery and Application; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. But these Things so far as they belong unto our present Design have been before insisted on. Our principal Enquiry at present is after the Work it self, or the nature and manner of the working of the Spirit of God in and on the Souls of Men in their <hi>Regeneration.</hi> And this must be both negatively and positively declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> First; The Work of the Spirit of God in the Regeneration of sinners, or the quickning of them who are dead in trespasses and sins, or in their first Saving Conversion to God, doth not consist in a <hi>Moral Swasion</hi> only. By
<hi>Swasion</hi> we intend such a <hi>perswasion</hi> as, may, or may not be effectual; so absolutely we call that only <hi>perswasion</hi> whereby a Man is actually perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Concerning this we must consider, (1) What it is that is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by that <hi>Expression</hi> and wherein its Efficacy doth consist; and (2.) prove that the <hi>whole Work</hi> of the Spirit of God in the Conversion of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners doth <hi>not</hi> consist therein. And I shall handle this matter under this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that which is known unto those who are conversant in these things from the writings of the ancient and modern Divines. For it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to endeavour the reducing of the extravagant confused Discourses of some present Writers unto a certain and determinate stating of the things in difference among us. That which they seem to aim at and conclude may be reduced unto these Heads, (1.) That God administers Grace unto all in the Declaration of the Doctrine of the Law and Gospel. (2.) That the Reception of this Doctrine, the Belief and Practice of it, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by Promises and Threatnings. (3.) That the things revealed taught and commanded, are not only good in themselves, but so suited unto the Reason and Interest of Mankind, as that the Mind cannot but be disposed and enclined to receive and obey them, unless overpowered by Prejudices and a Course of Sin. (4.) That the Consideration of the Promises and Threatnings of the Gospel, is sufficient to remove these preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and reform that Course. (5.) That upon a compliance with the Doctrine of the Gospel and Obedience thereunto, Men are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Spirit with other Priviledges of the New Testament, and have a Right unto all the Promises of the present and future Life. Now this being a perfect systeme of <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> condemned in the ancient Church as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely exclusive of the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, will be fully removed out of our way in our present Discourse, though the loose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused expressions of some be not considered in particular. For if the Work of our Regeneration doth not consist in a Moral Swasion, which as we shall
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48389:137"/> see contains all that these Men will allow to Grace, their whole Fabrick falls to the ground of its own accord.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> 1. As to the nature of this <hi>Moral Swasion</hi> two things may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. (1.) The <hi>Means,</hi> Instrument, and Matter of it, and this is the Word of God; the Word of God or the Scripture in the Doctrinal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, Precepts, Promises, and Threatnings of it. This is that, and this is that <hi>alone</hi> whereby we are commanded, pressed, perswaded to turn our selves and live to God. And herein we comprize the whole, both the Law and the Gospel, with all the Divine Truths contained in them, as severally respecting the especial Ends whereunto they are designed. For although they are <hi>distinctly</hi> and peculiarly suited to produce <hi>distinct Effects</hi> on the Minds of Men, yet they all joyntly tend unto the general end of guiding Men how to live unto God, and to obtain the enjoyment of him. As for those <hi>Documents</hi> and Instructions which Men have concerning the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and the Obedience which he requires of them from the Light of Nature, with the Works of Creation and Providence, I shall not here take them into Consideration. For either they are <hi>solitary</hi> or without any super-addition of instructive Light by Revelation, and then I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny them to be a sufficient outward means of the Conversion of any one Soul; or they may be considered as improved by the <hi>written Word</hi> as dispensed unto Men, and so they are comprized under it, and need not to be considered apart. We will therefore suppose that those unto whom the Word is declared, have antecedaneously thereunto, all the help which the Light of Nature will afford.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> 2. The <hi>principal way</hi> of the Application of this means to produce its Effect on the Souls of Men, is the <hi>Ministry of the Church.</hi> God hath appointed the Ministry for the Application of the Word unto the Minds and Consciences of Men for their Instruction and Conversion. And concerning this we may observe two things. (1.) That the Word of God thus dispensed by the Ministry of the Church, is the only <hi>ordinary outward means</hi> which the Holy Ghost maketh use of in the Regeneration of the <hi>Adult</hi> unto whom it is preached. (2.) That it is every way <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> in its own kind; that is, <hi>as an outward means.</hi> For the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is made of God and his Mind thereby, is sufficient to teach Men all that is needful for them to believe and do, that they may be converted unto God, and yeeld him the Obedience that he requires. Hence two things do ensue:</p>
               <p>(1.) That the <hi>use of those means</hi> unto Men in the state of Sin, if they are not complyed withal, is sufficient on the grounds before laid down, to leave them by whom they are rejected inexcusable; so <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Prov. 29. 1. 2 Chron. 36. 14, 15. Joh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) That the effect of Regeneration or Conversion unto God, is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed unto the <hi>Preaching of the Word,</hi> because of its efficacy thereunto in its <hi>own kind</hi> and way as the outward means thereof, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 15.

For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; Suppose a Man to be convinced by the Word of God of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sin, of his own sinful Condition; of his danger from thence with respect unto the Sin of Nature, on which account he is a <hi>Child of Wrath,</hi> and of his actual Sin, which further renders him obnoxious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Curse of the Law,</hi> and the Indignation of God; of his Duty hereon to turn unto God, and the way whereby he may so do; there are in the Precepts, Exhortations, Expostulations, Promises and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Word, especially as dispensed in the Ministry of the Church, <hi>Powerful Motives</hi> to affect, and Arguments to prevail with the Mind and Will of such a Man, to endeavour his own Regeneration or Conversion unto God, rational and cogent above all that can be objected unto the contrary. On some it is acknowledged that these things have
<hi>no effect;</hi> they are not moved by them, they care not for them, they do despise them, and live and die in rebellion against the Light of them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their <hi>Eyes blinded by the God of this World.</hi> But this is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they are not powerful in themselves; although indeed it is that they are not so towards us <hi>of themselves,</hi> but only as the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is pleased to act them towards us. But in these <hi>Motives, Reasons,</hi> and <hi>Arguments,</hi> whereby Men are in and from the Word, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of it, urged and pressed unto Conversion to God, doth this <hi>Moral Perswasion</hi> whereof we speak consist. And the efficacy of it, unto the end proposed, ariseth from the things ensuing, which are all resolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God himself.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label>(1.) From an evidence of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the things from whence these Motives and Arguments were taken. The Foundation of all the Efficacy of the Dispensation of the Gospel lies in an evidence, that the things
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48389:138"/> proposed in it are <hi>not cunningly devised Fables,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 16. Where this is not admitted, where it is not firmly assented unto, there can be no perswasive Efficacy in it. But where this is, namely a prevalent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the Truth of the Things proposed, there the Mind is under a Disposition unto the things whereunto it is perswaded. And hereon the whole Efficacy of the Word in and upon the Souls of Men, is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Truth and Veracity of God. For the things contained in the Scripture are not proposed unto us meerly as <hi>true,</hi> but as <hi>Divine</hi> Truths, as immediate Revelations from God, which requires not only a rational, but a sacred <hi>Religious</hi> respect unto them. They are Things that the <hi>Mouth of the Lord hath spoken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) There is a proposal unto the <hi>Wills and Affections</hi> of Men in the Things so assented unto, on the one hand as Good, Amiable, and Excellent, wherein the chiefest Good, Happiness, and utmost End of our Natures are comprized, to be pursued and attained; and on the other of things
<hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Terrible,</hi> the utmost Evil that our Nature is obnoxious unto, to be avoided. For this is urged on them, that to comply with the Will of God in the proposals of the Gospel, to conform thereunto, to do what he requires, to turn from Sin unto him, is <hi>good</hi> unto Men, best for them, assuredly attended with present Satisfaction and future Glory. And therein is also proposed the most noble Object for our Affections, even
<hi>God</hi> himself as a Friend, as reconciled unto us in Christ, and that in a way suited unto his Holiness, Righteousness, Wisdom and Goodness, which we have nothing to oppose unto, nor to lay in the Ballance against. The way also of the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of Sinners unto God by Jesus Christ is set out, as that which hath such an Impress of <hi>Divine Wisdom</hi> and Goodness upon it, as that it can be refused by none, but out of a direct enmity against God himself. Unto the enforcing of these things on the Minds of Men, the Scripture abounds with <hi>Reasons, Motives,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi> the rendring whereof effectual, is the principal end of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry. On the other hand it is declared and evidenced, that <hi>Sin</hi> is the great <hi>Debasement</hi> of our Natures, the Ruine of our Souls, the only Evil in the World, in its Guilt and Punishment; that a Continuance in a state of it, with a Rejection of the Invitation of the Gospel unto Conversion to God, is a thing foolish, unworthy of a rational Creature, and that which will be everlastingly pernitious. Whereas therefore in the judgment of every rational Creature, Spiritual Things are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Natural, Eternal Things before Temporal, and that these things are thus disposed of in infinite Goodness, Love and Wisdom, they must needs be apt to affect the Wills, and take the Affections of Men. And herein the Efficacy of the Word on the Minds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of Men is resolved into the <hi>Authority</hi> of God. These Precepts, these Promises, these Threatnings are <hi>his,</hi> who hath <hi>right</hi> to give them and <hi>power</hi> to execute them. And with his Authority, his Glorious Greatness, and his Infinite Power come under consideration. So also doth his <hi>Goodness</hi> and Love in an especial manner, with many other things, even all the known <hi>Properties</hi> of his Holy Nature, all which concur in giving Weight, Power, and Efficacy unto these Motives and Arguments.</p>

<hi>working Miracles,</hi> contrary to the whole scope of the place, and consent of the best Expositors. But that by the first Clause, the <hi>Perswasive Act of Humane Oratory,</hi> is excluded from Use and Efficacy in the preaching of the Gospel, none as yet hath had the impudence to deny. But let this also be esteemed to be as useful and efficacious in this Work, as to the end of Preaching in the Conversion of the Souls of Men, as any can imagine, it shall be granted. Only I shall take leave to resolve the <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Preaching</hi> into two other Causes.</p>

And indeed this is that which some plead for. For they say, That in all Men, at least all unto whom the Gospel is Preached, there is that
<hi>Grace</hi> present, or with them, that they are able to comply with the Word <hi>if they please,</hi> and so believe, repent, or do any Act of Obedience unto God according to his Will.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48389:140"/> in their Sins. What this <hi>Grace</hi> is, or whence Men have this Power and Ability, by some is not declared. Neither is it much to be doubted but that many do imagine that it is purely <hi>Natural;</hi> only they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to be called <hi>Grace,</hi> because it is from <hi>God</hi> who made us. Others acknowledg it to be the Work or Effect of <hi>Grace Internal,</hi> wherein part of the difference lay, between the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semi-pelagians</hi> of old. But they all agree that it is absolutely in the <hi>Power of the Will</hi> of Man to make use of it or not; that is, of the whole Effect on them, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in them of this Grace communicated in the way described. For notwithstanding any thing wrought in us or upon us thereby, the Will is still left <hi>various, flexible,</hi> and undetermined. It is true, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Grace thus Administred, the Will hath <hi>Power to refuse it</hi> and to abide in Sin. But that there is <hi>no more Grace</hi> wrought in us, but what may be so refused, or that the Will <hi>can make use</hi> of that Grace for Conversion, which it <hi>can refuse,</hi> is false.</p>

For that Act of our Wills, on this Supposition, whereby we convert unto God, is meerly an <hi>Act of our own,</hi> and not of the Grace of God. This is evident, for if the Act it self were of Grace, then would it not be in the <hi>Power of the Will</hi> to hinder it. (2.) This would leave it absolutely uncertain, notwithstanding the purpose of God, and the purchase of Christ, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>ever any one in the World</hi> should be Converted unto God or no. For when the whole Work of Grace is over, it is absolutely in the Power of the Will of Man whether it shall be effectual or no; and so absolutely uncertain; which is contrary to the Covenant, Promise, and Oath of God, unto and with Jesus Christ. (3.) It is contrary to express Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture innumerable, wherein actual <hi>Conversion</hi> unto God is ascribed unto his Grace, as the immediate Effect thereof. This will further appear afterwards. <hi>God worketh in us to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2. 13.

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48389:140"/> Spirit of God in us and upon us, than can be effected by these Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But thus it is in this case as some suppose. The <hi>Mind</hi> of Man is affected with much <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and usually under the Power of many
<hi>Prejudices,</hi> which by the corrupt course of things in the World, possess it from its first actings in the state of Infancy. The <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> likewise are vitiated with depraved Habits, which by the same means are contracted. But when the Gospel is proposed and preached unto them, the Things contained in it, the Duties it requires, the Promises it gives, are so rational or so suited unto the Principles of our Reason, and the <hi>subject Matter</hi> of them is so good, desirable and beautiful unto an intellectual Appetite, that being well conveyed unto the Mind, they are able to discard all the Prejudices and Disadvantages of a <hi>corrupt course</hi> under which it hath suffered, and prevail with the Soul to desist from sin, that is, a course of sinning, and to become a <hi>new Man</hi> in all vertuous Conversation. And that this is in the Liberty and Power of the Will, is irrefragably proved by that Sophism of <hi>Biel</hi> out of <hi>Scotus</hi> and
<hi>Occam,</hi> which contains the substance of what they plead in this Cause.<note n="*" place="margin">Omni dictamini rectae rationis potest voluntas se conformare; sed diligore De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um super omnia est dictamen rectae ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis; ratio enim dictat inter omnia dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda esse aliquid summe diligendum.

And as sundry things are necessary to render the means of Grace thus seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and <hi>congruous</hi> unto the present Frame, Temper, and Disposition of the Mind, so in such a Congruity much of its Efficacy doth consist. And this, as it is said, is the Work of the Holy Ghost, and an Effect of the Grace of God. For if the Spirit of God did not by the Word, prevent, excite, stir up and provoke the Minds of Men; did he not help and assist them when endeavouring to turn to God, in the removal of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and all sorts of <hi>Moral Impediments,</hi> Men would continue and abide, as it were, dead in Trespasses and Sins, at least their endeavours after Deliverance would be weak and fruitless.</p>

How the things received, proposed, and prescribed in the Gospel, are so good, so rational, so every way suited unto the Principles of our Beings, the Nature of our intellectual Constitutions, or the Reason of Men, and those fortified with such rational and powerful Motives, in the Promises and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of it, representing unto us on the one hand the chiefest Good which our Nature is capable of, and on the other the highest evil to be avoided that we are obnoxious unto, that they can be refused or rejected by none, but out of a bruitish love of Sin, or the efficacy of depraved Habits contracted by a vitious course of living. And herein consists the Grace of God towards Men, especially as the Holy Ghost is pleased to make use of these things in the Dispensation of the Gospel by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the Church. For when the Reason of Men is by these means excited so far as to cast off Prejudice, and enabled thereby to make a right Judgment of what is proposed unto it, it prevails with them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to God, to change their Lives, and yield Obedience according to the Rule of the Gospel that they may be saved.</p>

So is it asserted, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 19, 20. <hi>That we may know what is the exceeding greatness of his Power towards us who believe, according to the working of his Mighty Power; which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the Dead.</hi> The Power here mentioned, hath an exceeding <hi>Greatness</hi> ascribed unto it, with respect unto the Effect produced by it.<note place="margin">Legant ergo &amp; intelligant, intueantur &amp; fatean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non lege atque Doctrina insonante forinsecus, sed intima atque occulta, mirabili atque inessabili po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate operari Deum in cordibus hominum non solum veras Revelationes, sed etiam bonas Voluntates. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</hi> lib. de Grat.

But some Effects are <hi>greater</hi> than others, and carry in them more than ordinary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of it. Such is that here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, whereby God makes Men to be Believers, and preserves them when they are so. And unto this Power of God, there is an <hi>Actual Operation</hi> or <hi>Efficiency</hi> ascribed, the <hi>working of his mighty Power.</hi> And the Nature of this <hi>operation</hi> or <hi>efficiency</hi> is declared to be of the same kind with that which <hi>exerted</hi> in the <hi>raising of Christ from the Dead.</hi> And this was by a real <hi>Physical Efficiency</hi> of Divine Power. This therefore is here testified, That the Work of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Believers, either to <hi>make them</hi> so, or <hi>preserve them</hi> such, for all is one as unto our present purpose, consists in the acting of his <hi>Divine Power</hi> by a real internal Efficiency. So God is said to fulfil <hi>in us all the good pleasure of his Goodness, and the Work of Faith with Power,</hi> 2 Thess. 1. 11. 2 Pet. 1. 3. And hence the Work of Grace in Conversion is constantly expressed by words denoting <hi>a real internal Efficiency,</hi> such are <hi>Creating, Quickning, Forming, Giving a new Heart,</hi> whereof af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. Where-ever this Work is spoken of, with respect unto an
<hi>Active Efficiency</hi> it is ascribed unto God. He <hi>Creates us anew,</hi> he
<hi>Quickens</hi> us, he <hi>Begets</hi> us of his own Will; but where it is spoke of with respect unto us, there it is <hi>passively</hi> expressed; we <hi>are Created in Christ Jesus,</hi> we are <hi>new Creatures,</hi> we are <hi>Born again;</hi> and the like; which one Observation is sufficient to evert the whole <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> Grace. Unless a Work wrought by Power, and that <hi>real,</hi> and immediate be intended herein, such a Work may neither be supposed pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, nor can be expressed. Wherefore it is plain in the Scripture, That the Spirit of God works internally, immediately, <hi>efficiently</hi> in and upon the Minds of Men in their Regeneration. The New Birth is the Effect of an Act of his Power and Grace; or, no Man is <hi>born again</hi> but it is by the inward Efficiency of the Spirit.</p>

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48389:146"/> And the manner how God bestows this Gift upon us, is declared <hi>v. 10. For we are his Workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good Works.</hi> Good Works, or Gospel-Obedience, are the things designed. These must proceed from <hi>Faith,</hi> or they are not acceptable with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.

Acts 11. 18. This is the whole of what we plead. God in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, by the exceeding greatness of his Power, as he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the Dead, actually worketh <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Repentance</hi> in us; gives them unto us, bestows them on us, so that they are meer Effects of his Grace in us. And his working in us, <hi>infallibly</hi> produceth the Effect intended, because it is <hi>actual Faith</hi> that he works; and not only a Power to believe, which we may either put forth and make use of, or suffer to be fruitless according to the pleasure of our own Wills.</p>

For this way is such, as that he thereby takes away all <hi>Repugnancy,</hi> all <hi>Resistance,</hi> all <hi>Opposition,</hi> every thing that lyeth in the way of the Effect intended; Deut. 30. 6.
<hi>The Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thine Seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and all thy Soul, that thou mayest live.</hi> A denyal of the Work here intended, is expressed <hi>Chap. 29. 4. The Lord hath not given you an Heart to perceive, and Eyes to see, and Ears to hear unto this day.</hi> What it is to have the <hi>Heart circumcised,</hi> the Apostle declares, <hi>Col. 2. 11. It is the putting off of the Body of the Sins of the Flesh by the Circumcision of Christ;</hi> that is, our Conversion to God. It is the giving an Heart to perceive, and Eyes to see, and Ears to hear, that is, Spiritual Light and Obedience by the removal of all Obstacles and Hindrances. This is the immediate Work of the Spirit of God himself. No Man ever <hi>circumcised his own heart.</hi> No Man can say he began to do it by the Power of his own Will, and then God only helped him by his Grace. As the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>outward Circumcision</hi> on the body of a Child, was the <hi>Act of another,</hi> and not of the Child who was onely passive therein, but the Effect was in the Body of the Child only; so is it in this <hi>Spiritual Circumcision.</hi> It is the <hi>Act of God</hi> whereof our Hearts are the Subject. And whereas it is the Blindness, Obstinacy, and Stubbornness in Sin, that is in us by Nature, with the Prejudices which possess our Minds and Affections, which hinder us from Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion unto God, by this <hi>Circumcision</hi> they are taken away.

And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes, and ye shall keep my Judgments and

I will pour Water upon him that is thirsty, and Floods upon the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Blessing on thy Off-spring, and they shall spring up as among the Grass, as Willows by the Water-courses. One shall say I am the Lord's.</hi> So <hi>Jer. 31. 33. I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts.</hi> I shall first enquire two things about these Concurrent Testimonies. (1.) Is it lawful for us, is it our duty to <hi>pray</hi> that God would do and effect what he had promised to do, and that both for our selves and others? For our selves, that the Work of our Conversion may be <hi>renewed,</hi> carried on and consummated in the way and by the means whereby it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; that so he who hath begun the good Work in us, may perfect it to the Day of Jesus Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. For those who are Converted and Regenerated, and are perswaded on good and infallible grounds that so they are, may yet pray for those things which God promiseth to work in their first Conversion. And this is, because the <hi>same Work</hi> is to be preserved and carried on in them by the same Means, the same Power, the same Grace wherewith it was begun. And the Reason is, because this Work, as it is meerly the Work of Conversion, is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately perfected and compleated as to the being of it; yet as it is the
<hi>beginning of a Work of Sanctification,</hi> it is continually to be renewed and gone over again, because of the remainder of Sin in us, and the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our Grace. For others that it may be both begun and finished in them. And do we not in such Prayers desire, That God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, powerfully, effectually, by the internal Efficiency of his Spirit, take away all Hindrances, Oppositions, and Repugnancy in our Minds and Wills, and actually collate upon us, give unto us, and work in us, a <hi>new Principle of Obedience,</hi> that we may assuredly love, fear, and trust in God alwayes? Or, do we only desire that God would so help us, as to leave us absolutely <hi>undetermined,</hi> whether we will make use of his help or no? Did ever any <hi>pious Soul</hi> couch such an Intention in his Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? He knows not how to pray, who prayes not that God would by his own <hi>immediate Power,</hi> work those things in him which he thus pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for. And unto this Prayer also Grace effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual is antecedently required.<note n="*" place="margin">Semper quidem adjutorium Gratiae nobis est a Deo poscendum, sed nec ipsum quod possumus viribus nostris assignem.

To this are all the Adversaries of the Grace of God brought by those

And to make it more plain yet, he affirms that he will <hi>write his Law in our Hearts.</hi> It is confessed that this is spoken with respect unto his <hi>writing of the Law of old in Tables of Stone.</hi> As then he wrote the Letter of the Law in the Tables of Stone, so that thereon and thereby they were actually engraven therein; so by <hi>writing the Law,</hi> that is, the matter and substance of it in our Hearts, it is as really fixed therein, as the Letter of it was of old in the Tables of Stone. And this can be not otherwise, but in a <hi>Principle of Obedience</hi> and Love unto it, which is actually wrought of God in us. And the Aids or Assistances which some Men grant, that are left unto the power of our own Wills to use or not to use, have no <hi>Analogie</hi> with the writing of the
<hi>Law in Tables of Stone.</hi> And the end of the Work of God described,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48389:148"/> is not a <hi>Power to obey,</hi> which may be exerted or not. But it is <hi>Actual Obedience</hi> in Conversion, and all the Fruits of it. And if God doth not in these Promises declare a real Efficiency of Internal Grace, taking away all <hi>Repugnancy</hi> of Nature unto Conversion, curing its Depravation actually and effectually, and communicating infallibly a Principle of Spiritual Obedience, I know not in what words such a Work may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.

I have proved before that this consists in a new spiritual supernatural vital Principle or Habit of Grace infused into the Soul, the Mind, Will and Affections by the Power of the Holy Spirit, disposing and enabling them in whom it is, unto Spiritual, Supernatural, Vital Acts of Faith and Obedience. Some Men seem to be inclined to deny all <hi>Habits</hi> of Grace. And on such a Supposition a Man is no longer a Believer, than he is in the <hi>Actual</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Faith. For there is nothing in him from whence he should be so denominated. But this would plainly overthrow the Covenant of God, and all the Grace of it. Others expresly deny all gracious su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
<hi>infused Habits,</hi> though they may grant such as are or may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the frequent Acts of those Graces or Vertues whereof they are the Habits. But the Scripture giveth us another Description of this Work of Regeneration, for it consists in the <hi>Renovation of the Image of God in us,</hi> Ephes. 4. 23, 24. Be <hi>renewed in the Spirit of your Mind, and put on that new Man, which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had a supernatural Ability of living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, habitually residing in him, is generally acknowledged. And although it were easie for us to prove, that whereas he was made for a supernatural End, namely to live to God and to come to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, it was utterly impossible that he should answer it or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it by the meer strength of his <hi>natural Faculties,</hi> had they not been endued with a supernatural Ability, which with respect unto that End, was created with them and in them. Yet we will not contend about Terms. Let it be granted that he was created in the <hi>Image of God,</hi> and that he had an Ability to fulfil all God's Commands, and that in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and no more shall be desired. This was lost by the <hi>Fall.</hi> When this is by any denyed it shall be proved. In our Regeneration there is a Renovation of this Image of God in us. <hi>Renewed in the Spirit of our Minds.</hi> And it is renewed in us by a Creating <hi>Act</hi> of Almighty Power, which after God, or according to his likeness, <hi>is created in Righteousness and true Holiness.</hi> There is therefore in it an Implantation of a new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Spiritual Life, of a Life unto God in Repentance Faith and Obedience, or Universal Holiness according to Gospel-Truth, or the Truth which came by Jesus Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1. 18. And the Effect of this Work is called <hi>Spirit;</hi> Joh. 8. 5. <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> It is the Spirit of God of whom we are born; that is, our new Life is wrought in us by his Efficiency. And that which in us is so born of him, <hi>is Spirit;</hi> not the Natural Faculties of our Souls, they are once Created, once Born, and no more; but a new Principle of Spiritual Obedience, whereby we live unto God. And this is the product of the internal immediate Efficiency of Grace.</p>

(1.) The leading condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Faculty of the Soul is the <hi>Mind</hi> or Understanding. Now this is corrupted and vitiated by the Fall, and how it continues depraved in the State of Nature, hath been declared before. The sum is, that it is not able to discern Spiritual Things in a Spiritual manner, for it is possessed with Spiritual Blindness or Darkness, and is filled with enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against God and his Law, esteeming the things of the Gospel to be foolishness, because it is alienated from the Life of God through the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that is in it: We must therefore enquire what is the Work of the Holy Spirit on our <hi>Minds</hi> in turning of us to God, whereby this Depravation is removed, and this vitious State cured; whereby we come to see and discern Spiritual Things in a Spiritual manner; that we may savingly know God and his Mind as revealed in and by Jesus Christ.

What Allusion is there between that Work, and the <hi>doctrinal proposal of Truth</hi> to the Minds of Men? It is therefore a confidence not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with, if any will deny that the Act of God in the <hi>Spiritual Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of our Minds,</hi> be not of the same Nature as to Efficacy and Efficiency, with that whereby he <hi>created Light</hi> at the beginning of all things. And because the Effect produced in us is called <hi>Light,</hi> the Act it self is described by <hi>shining.</hi> God <hi>hath shined into our Hearts,</hi> that is, our Minds, so he conveighs Light unto them by an Act of Omnipotent Efficiency.

<hi>Light,</hi> so the Apostle leaving his <hi>Metaphor</hi> plainly declares what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends hereby; namely, the <hi>actual knowledg of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ;</hi> that is, as God is revealed in Christ by the Gospel, as he declares <hi>v.</hi> 4. Having therefore (1.) compared the Mind of Man by Nature with a respect unto a Power of discerning Spiritual Things, to the state of all things under <hi>Darkness</hi> before the Creation of Light: And, (2.) the powerful working of God in Illumination, unto the Act of his Omnipotency in the Production or Creation of <hi>Light</hi> Natural, He ascribes our Ability to know, and our actual Knowledg of God in Christ unto his real Efficiency and Operation.

This therefore in our Conversion to God is renewed by the Holy Ghost, and that by an effectual implantation in it, of a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48389:151"/> Principle of Spiritual Life and Holiness in the room of that Original Righteousness which it lost by the Fall. That he doth so, is proved by all the Testimonies before insisted on. (1.) This is its Renovation as it is a rational vital Faculty; and of this Vivification see before. (2.) As it's a free Principle, it is determined unto its <hi>Acts</hi> in this case by the powerful Operation of the Holy Ghost, without the least impeachment of its Liberty or Freedom as hath been declared. And that this is so, might be fully evinced, as by others, so by the ensuing Arguments. For (1.) if the Holy Ghost doth not work <hi>immediately</hi> and effectually upon the <hi>Will,</hi> producing the creating in it a Principle of Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, infallibly <hi>determining</hi> it in its free Acts, then is all the Glory of our Conversion to be ascribed unto our selves, and we make our selves therein, by the obediential actings of our own free-will <hi>to differ from others</hi> who do not so comply with the Grace of God; which is denyed by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Neither can any purpose of God concerning the Conversion of any one Soul be certain and determinate, seeing after he hath done all that is to be done, or can be done towards it, the Will remaining <hi>undetermined</hi> may not be converted, contrary to those Testimonies of our Saviour, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. Mat. 11. 25, 26. John</hi> 6. 37. Neither can there be an Original <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the Promises of God made to Jesus Christ, concerning the <hi>multitudes</hi> that should believe in him; seeing it is possible <hi>no one</hi> may so do, if it depends on the <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined Liberty</hi> of their Wills whether they will or no. And then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so must Salvation of necessity be of <hi>him that willeth, and of him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and not of God that shews mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 15, 16. And the whole Efficacy of the Grace of God, is made thereby to <hi>depend</hi> on the <hi>Wills</hi> of Men, which is not consistent with our being the <hi>Workmanship of God created in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus unto good Works,</hi> Ephes. 2. 10. Nor on this Supposition do Men know what they pray for, when they pray for their own or other Mens Conversion to God, as hath been before declared.

<hi>Regeneration</hi> by the immediate powerful, effectual Operation of the Holy Spirit of Grace; so there is not scarce any thing more despised or scorned by many in the World, than that any should profess
<hi>that there hath been such a Work of God upon themselves,</hi> or on any Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion declare ought of the way and manner whereby it was wrought. The very mentioning hereof is grown a <hi>Derision</hi> among some that call themselves Christians; and to plead an interest or concern in this Grace, is to forfeit all a Mans <hi>Reputation</hi> with many who would be thought wise, and boast themselves to be rational. Neither is this a practice taken up of late in these declining times of the World; but seems to have been star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and followed from days of old, possibly from the beginning; yea the Enmity of <hi>Cain</hi> against <hi>Abel</hi> was but a branch of this proud and perverse Inclination. The Instance of <hi>Ishmael</hi> in the Scripture is Representative of all such as under an outward profession of the true Religion, did or do scoff at those who being as <hi>Isaac</hi> Children of the Promise do profess and evidence an interest in the <hi>internal Power</hi> of it which they are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withal. And the same practice may be traced in succeeding Ages. Hence Holy <hi>Austin</hi> entring upon the <hi>Confession</hi> of his greater sins, designing thereby to magnify the Glory and Efficacy of the Grace of God in his Conversion, provides against this scorn of Men, which he knew he should meet withal. <hi>Rideant,</hi> saith he, <hi>me arrogantes &amp; non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum salubriter prostrati &amp; elisi per te Deus meus, ego tamen confiteor tibi dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cora mea, in laude tua; Confess:</hi> lib. 4. cap. 1. <hi>let Arrogant Men deride or scorn me, who were never savingly cast down nor broken in pieces by thee my God, yet I will confess my own shame unto thy praise.</hi> Let none be offended with these expressions of being <hi>savingly</hi> or <hi>wholesomely cast down and broken of God;</hi> For in the Judgment of this great person they are not <hi>Fanatical.</hi> We may not therefore think it strange; if the same truth, the same practice,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48389:153"/> and profession of it, do still meet with the same Entertainment. Let them
<hi>deride</hi> and scorn it, who were never <hi>humbled savingly,</hi> nor broken with a sense of sin, nor relieved by Grace; the Holy Work of Gods Spirit is to be owned, and the truth to be avowed as it is in Jesus.</p>

So the wiseman tells us, that <hi>Childhood and Youth are Vanity,</hi> Eccl. 11. 10. The Mind of Man in the state of <hi>Childhood</hi> and <hi>Youth</hi> puts it self forth in all kinds of vain Actings, in foolish Imaginations, perverse and froward Appetites, falseness in words, with sensible effects of corrupt Inclinations in every kind. <hi>Austin's</hi> first book of <hi>Confessions,</hi> is an excellent comment on that Text wherein the <hi>Vanity of Childhood and Youth</hi> are <hi>graphically</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, with <hi>pathetical</hi> self-reflecting complaints concerning the Guilt of sin which is contracted in them. Some perhaps may think light of those ways of Folly and Vanity, wherein Childhood doth, or left alone, would consume it self; that there is no <hi>moral evil</hi> in those Childish Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. That <hi>Good Man</hi> was of an other Mind. <hi>Istane est</hi> (saith he) <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia puerilis? non est Domine, non est Oro te Deus meus, nam haec ipsa sunt quae a paedagogis &amp; magistris, a nucibus pitulis passeribus, ad Prefectos &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, aurum, praedia, mancipia haec ipsa omnino quae succedentibus majoribus aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus transeunt. lib. 1. cap,</hi> 19. This is not <hi>Innocency,</hi> it is not so. The same Principle and Habit of Mind carried over unto riper Age, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Occasions bring forth those greater Sins, which the lives of Men are filled withal in this World. And who is there who hath a serious Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of God, with any due apprehension of his Holiness and a clear conviction of the Nature of Sin, who is not able to call over such Actings in <hi>Childhood</hi> which most think meet to connive at, wherein they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that perversity whereof they are now ashamed. By this means is the Heart prepared for a further Obduration in Sin by the confirmation of native Obstinacy.</p>

<hi>Lying</hi> is such a sin, which the Depravation of Nature in <hi>Youth</hi> is prone to exert it self by, and that on sundry Reasons not now to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into: <hi>They go astray from the womb speaking lies.</hi> The first Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Nature unto Sin, was by a <hi>Lye;</hi> and we fell in <hi>Adam</hi> by giving credit thereunto.

And we find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that a sense of this sin, oft-times accompanies the first real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions that befal the Souls of men. For when they seriously reflect upon themselves, or do view themselves in the Glass of the Law, they are not only sensible of the nature of this Sin, but also how much they indulged themselves therein, partly whil'st they remember how on the least occasions they were surprized into it, which yet they neglected to watch against; and partly understanding how sometimes they made it their business by <hi>premeditated falshoods</hi> so to cover other sins, as to escape rebuke and correction. The mention of these things will probably be entertained with contempt and scorn in this Age, wherein the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious wickednesses of men are made but a sport; But God, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and his Truth are still the same, what-ever alternations there may be in the World. And the holy Psalmist seems to have some reflection on this Vice of Youth, when he prayes, that <hi>God would take from him the way of Lying.</hi> Of the same nature are those lesser <hi>Thesis</hi> in despoiling their Parents and Governours of such things which they are not allowed to take and make use of for themselves. <hi>They rob their Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and say it is no transgression,</hi> Prov. 28. 24. So saith the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<hi>furta etiam faciebam de cellario parentum &amp; de mensis vel gula impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itante, vel ut haberem quod darem pueris ludum suum mihi quo pariter dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctabantur tamen vendentibus.</hi> He sometimes <hi>stole</hi> from his Parents, either to gratify his own sensual Appetite, or to give unto his Companions. In such instances doth <hi>Original Pravity</hi> exert it self in <hi>Youth,</hi> or Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and thereby both increase its own power, and fortify the Mind and the Affections against the Light and Efficacy of Conviction.</p>

Such the Apostle treats concerning, <hi>Ephes. 4. 18, 19 Being past feeling, have given themselves over unto Lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</hi> Custom of sinning takes away the <hi>sense</hi> of it. The Course of the World takes away the <hi>shame</hi> of it; and Love <hi>to it</hi> makes Men <hi>greedy</hi> in the pursuit of it; see <hi>Confess. lib. 2. Cap.</hi> 6. And this last effect of sin, as incited, provoked, and assisted by Temptations, hath great variety in the Effects and Degrees of it. Hence are the various courses of unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled sinners in the world, wherein the Outrage and Excess of some seems to Justify others in their more sedate irregularities, and less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous provocations. Yea some who are not in any better state and condition as to their Interest in the Covenant of God than others, will yet not only startle at but <hi>really abhor</hi> those Outrages of sin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which they fall unto: Now this Difference ariseth not from hence that the nature of all men is not equally corrupt and depraved, but that
<hi>God</hi> is pleased to make his <hi>Restraining Grace</hi> effectual towards some, to keep them within those bounds of sinning which they shall not pass over, and to permit others so to fall under a <hi>Conjunction</hi> of their Lusts and Temptations as that they proceed unto all manner of Evil. Moreover there are peculiar Inclinations unto some sins, if not inlaid in, yet much enhaunced and made obnoxious unto incitations by the Temperature of the body. And some are more exposed unto Temptations in the World from their outward Circumstances and Occasions of Life. Hereby are some even precipitated to all manner of Evil. But still the <hi>old Man which is Corrupt according unto deceitful Lusts,</hi> is the same naturally in all. All difference as to Good from Evil, I mean not as to the nature of the things themselves, but as to Mens interest in them, so as to adhere to the one and avoid the other, is from the Will of God. Thus he secretly prepares for some a <hi>better Temperature</hi> of nature, docile and pliable unto such no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of things as may entertain their minds, and satisfy them above sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Delights. And some he disposeth in their <hi>Education,</hi> Callings, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, Aymes and Designs in the World, into wayes inconsistent with open
<hi>Lewdness,</hi> which will much ballance their Inclinations, besides his secret internal actings on their Hearts and Minds, whereof af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

It is almost incredible to apprehend, but that it is testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto by daily experience, how Men will live even where the Word is Read and Preached; how they will get a form of speaking of God, yea and of performing some Duties of Religion, and yet never come to have any <hi>steady thoughts</hi> of God, or of their Relation to him, or of their concernment in his Will. What-ever they speak of God, he <hi>is not in all</hi> their Thoughts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 4. What-ever they do in Religion, they do it not unto him, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 25.

So <hi>Waldo</hi> was affected when his Companion was stricken dead as he walked with him in the Fields; which proved the occasion of his Conversion unto God. So the <hi>Psalmist</hi> describes the Affections and Thoughts of Men; when they are surprized with a <hi>Storm at Sea,</hi> Psal. 107. 25, 26, 27, 28. An instance whereof we have in the <hi>Mariners of Jona's Ship,</hi> Chap. 1. 5, 6, 7. And that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> who despised one day, saying, <hi>Who is the Lord that I should regard him?</hi> Being the next day terrified with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightning, cries out, <hi>Intreat the Lord for me that it may be so no more,</hi> Exod. 9. 28.

It bespeaks it self to be God's Messenger to call Sin to remembrance, 1 <hi>Kings 17. 8. Gen.</hi> 42. 21, 22. The time of Affliction is a time of Consideration, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 14. And if Men be not obdurate and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned almost unto practical Atheism by a course of sinning, they cannot but bethink themselves who sends Affliction, and for what End it is sent. Hence great thoughts of the Holiness of God, and of his hatred of Sin, with some sense of Mens own Guilt and especial Crimes will arise. And these Effects many times prove preparatory and <hi>materially dispositive</hi> unto Conversion. And not what these things are in themselves able to operate is to be considered, but what they are designed unto, and made effectual for by the Holy Ghost.</p>

Sudden changes from great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Distresses by unexpected Reliefs, deeply affect the Minds of Men, convincing them of the Power, Presence, and Goodness of God. And this produceth a sense and acknowledgment of their own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of what they have received. Hence also some temporary Effects of submission to the Divine Will and Gratitude do proceed.</p>
               <p>4. An observation of the <hi>Conversation</hi> of others, hath affected many to seek into the Causes and Ends of it. And this inclines them unto imitation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 2.</p>

For those Convictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal not Men from the Word universally or promiscuously, but as the Holy Spirit willeth and designeth.

Yet we see by experience, that the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Law</hi> is despised by the most that hear it. Wherefore it hath not in it self a force or vertue alwayes to work conviction of Sin in them unto whom it is outwardly proposed.

Presumption of their present Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is as good as it need be, or as is convenient in their present Circumstances and Occasions, makes them neglect the improvement of their Warnings.

Wherefore in many they perish through meer sloth and negligence. (5.) Satan applies all his Engines to the defeatment of these beginnings of any Good in the Souls of Men. (6.)

And all these things by the guidance of the Good Spirit of God, and attendance unto the Word, did he exemplifie from his own Experience in the whole Work of God towards him.

(1.) The <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> which is the <hi>active noetical</hi> or <hi>contemplative</hi> Power and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of it. (1.) The <hi>Affections</hi> wherein its passive and sensitive Power doth consist. With respect hereunto there are two parts of the Work
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48389:158"/> of Conviction. (1) The <hi>Fixing</hi> of the Mind, the Rational contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative Power of it, upon a due Consideration of Sin. (2) The <hi>fixing</hi> of a due sense of Sin on the <hi>practical,</hi> passive, sensible part of the Mind, that is, the <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> as was said before.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> 1. It is a great work to fix the vain Mind of an Unregenerate Sinner on a due Consideration of sin, its nature and tendency. The Darkness of their own mind &amp; inexpressible Vanity, wherein I place the principal effect of our Apostacy from God, do disenable, hinder, and divert them from such Apprehensions. Hence God so often complains of the foolishness of the people that they <hi>would not consider,</hi> that they would not <hi>be wise</hi> to consider their latter end. We find by Experience this folly and vanity in many unto an Astonishment. No reasons, Arguments, Entreaties by all that is naturally dear to them, no Necessities can prevail with them to fix their minds on a due consideration of sin: Moreover Satan now employs all his Engines to beat off the Efficacy and Power of this Work. And when his Temptations and Delusions are mixed with Men's natural Darkness and Vanity, the Mind seems to be impregnably fortified against the power of <hi>Conviction</hi> For although it be real Conversion unto God. that overthrows the Kingdom of Satan in us; yet this Work of <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> raiseth such a Combustion in it, that he cannot but fear it will be its End. And this <hi>strong Man armed,</hi> would if possible keep his Goods and House in peace. Hence all sorts of persons have daily Experience in their Children, Servants, Relations, how difficult, yea how impossible it is to fix their Minds on a due Consideration of sin, until it be wrought in them by the exceeding Greatness of the power of the Spirit of God. Wherefore herein consists the first part of this Work of Conviction; it <hi>fixeth the mind</hi> on a due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of sin. So it is expressed; <hi>Psal. 51. 3. my sin is ever before me.</hi> God reproves Men and <hi>sets their sins in order</hi> before their eyes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. Hence they are necessitated as it were always to behold them, and that which way soever they turn themselves. Fain they would cast them behind their backs, or cast out thoughts of them, but the <hi>Arrows of God</hi> stick in them and they cannot take off their Minds from their consideration. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are three things in sin; (1) The <hi>Original</hi> of it and its native inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in us, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 5. (2) The <hi>state</hi> of it, or the Obnoxiousness of Men to the Wrath of God on the Account thereof; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. (3) The
<hi>particular sins</hi> of Mens Lives; in the first part of the Work of Conviction the Minds of Men are variously exercised with respect unto them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Spirit of God is pleased to engage and <hi>fix</hi> them.</p>
               <p>2. As the Mind is hereby fixed on the Consideration of sin, so a <hi>sense of sin</hi> must also be fixed on the Mind, that is, the <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi> A bare Contemplation of the Concernments of sin is of little use in this matter. The Scripture principally evidenceth this work of Conviction or placeth it in this Effect of a sense of sin, in Trouble, Sorrow, Disquietment of Mind, fear of Ruine and the like; see <hi>Acts 2. 37. Acts</hi> 24. 25. But this I must not enlarge upon.</p>

The principal efficient Cause of this Work is the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> the preaching of the Word, especially of the <hi>Law,</hi> being the Instrument which he maketh use of therein. The Knowledg of sin is
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48389:158"/> by the Law, both the Nature, Guilt, and Curse belonging to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. There is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ine of the Law, with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of its Power and a sense of its Curse. Other Means, as Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Dangers, Sicknesses, Fears, Disappointments, may be made use of, to excite, stir up, and put an edge upon the Minds and Affections of Men; yet it is by one means or other from the Law of God, that such a discovery is made of sin unto them, and such a sense of it wrought upon them, as belongs unto this work of Conviction. But it is the Spirit of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that is the <hi>principal efficient Cause</hi> of it, or he works these effects on the Minds of Men. God takes it upon himself as his own work to <hi>reprove Men</hi> and set their sins in order before their eyes; <hi>Psal.</hi> 50, 21. And that this same Work is done immediately by the Spirit is expresly declared, <hi>John.</hi> 16. 8. He alone it is who makes all means effectual unto this End and Purpose. Without his especial and immediate Actings on us to this End, we may hear the Law preached all the Days of our Lives and not be once affected with it.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>22</label> And it may by the way be worth our Observation, to consider how God designing the Calling <hi>or Conversion</hi> of the Souls of Men, doth in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise Providence over-rule all their outward Concernments, so as that they shall be disposed into such Circumstances, as conduce to to the end aymed at. Either by their own Inclinations and Choice, or by the Intervention of Accidents crossing their Inclinations, and frustrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Designes, he will lead them into such <hi>Societies, Acquaintances, Relations, Places,</hi> means, as he hath ordained to be useful unto them for the great ends of their Conviction and Conversion. So in particular <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> aboundeth in his Contemplation on the Holy, Wise Providence of God, in carrying of him from <hi>Carthage</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> where he heard <hi>Ambrose</hi> preach every <hi>Lords-day,</hi> which proved at length the Means of his through-Conversion to God. And in that whole Course, by his discourse upon it, he discovers Excellently as on the one hand, the variety of his own Projections and Designes, his Aymes and Ends, which oft-times were perverse and froward; so on the other, the constant guidance of divine Providence, working powerfully through all Occurrences towards the blessed End designed for him. And I no way doubt but that God exercised him unto those distinct <hi>Experiences</hi> of Sin and Grace in his own Heart and Wayes, because he had designed him to be the great <hi>Champion</hi> of the Doctrine of his Grace against all its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, and that not only in his own Age, wherein it met with a fierce Opposition, but also in all succeeding ages, by his Excellent <hi>Labours</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the use of the Church: see <hi>Confess. lib. 5. cap. 7. 8, 9, &amp;c.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:48389:159"/> the Dead Life in sin; here doing things outragious, there promising things desirable to vain Minds, whilst thou to correct and reform my ways didst secretly make use of their frowardness and mine.</hi>

It must be granted that many on whom this work hath been wrought producing great Resolutions of Amendment, and much Reformation of Life, do lose all the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of it, with all the impressions it had made on their Affections. And some of these wax worse and more profligate in sinning than ever they were before. For having broken down the Damm of their restraints, they pour out their lusts like a Flood, and are more senseless than ever of those Checks and Fears with which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were bridled and awed; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21. 22. So the person lately mentioned declares that after many Convictions which he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested and neglected, he was grown so obdurate and sensless, that falling into a <hi>feaver</hi> wherein he thought he should die and go immediately unto
<hi>Hell,</hi> he had not that endeavour after Deliverance and Mercy as he had many years before on lesser dangers. And this perverse Effect is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously brought about.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>24</label>(1.) It is with most an immediate <hi>product of the power of their own Lust.</hi> Especially is it so with them who together with their <hi>Convictions</hi> receive no Gifts of the Holy Ghost. For as we observed their Lusts being only checked and controuled, not subdued, they get new strength by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, and rebel with success against Conviction. Such as these fall away from what they have attained <hi>suddenly; Math.</hi> 13. 5. 21. One day they seem to lye in Hell by the Terror of their Convictions, and the next to be hasting towards it by their sins and pollutions. see <hi>Luke. 11. 24, 25, 26. Hos. 4. 6. cap.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
               <p>(2.) This Apostacy is promoted and hastned by others. As (1.) such as undertaking to be <hi>Spiritual Guides</hi> and Instructers of Men in their way towards Rest, who being unskilful in the Word of Righteousness, do heal their wounds slightly or turn them out of the way. <hi>Seducers</hi> also it may be interpose their crafty deceits whereby they lye in wait to deceive, and so turn Men off from those Good ways of God whereinto they would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise enter. So it fell out with <hi>Austin,</hi> who beginning somewhat to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after God, fell into the society and heresy of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> which frustrated all the Convictions which by any means he had received.

(3.) The Awe that is put on the Minds of Men in their Convictions, arising from a Dread of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Law, and the Judgments of God threatned therein, is apt of it self to wear off when the Soul is a little accustomed unto it, and yet sees no evil actually to ensue, <hi>Eccl. 8. 11. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</p>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48389:159"/> in the Minds of them who are so convinced. First, there will follow great and strange Conflicts between their <hi>Corruptions,</hi> and their <hi>Convictions.</hi> And this doth especially manifest it self in them who have been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed unto a course of sinning, or have any particular sin wherein they delight, and by which they have given satisfaction unto their Lusts. For the <hi>Law</hi> coming with Power and Terror on the Conscience, requires a relinquishment of all sins, at the eternal peril of the Soul. Sin hereby is incited and provoked,

From the <hi>secret insinuation of a Principle of Spiritual Life and Strength</hi> into the Will, whose Nature and Power the Soul is as yet unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withal. Of both these we have sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Instances in the Person before mentioned; for after all the means which God had used to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him for his Conversion, whilst yet he was detained under the Power of Sin, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on every Temptation to revert to his former Courses, he occasionally heard one <hi>Politianus</hi> giving an account of the Conversion of two eminent <hi>Courtiers</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately renounced the World and betook themselves wholly to the Service of God. This Discourse God was pleased to make use of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to awake him, and even to amaze him.

This therefore being designed to rule and bear sway in the Soul, begins its <hi>conflict</hi> effectually to eject Sin out of its Throne and Dominion. For whereas when we come under the Power of Grace, Sin can no longer have dominion over us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12.

There was upon bare <hi>conviction</hi> a
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48389:160"/> Contest before in the Soul, but it was meerly between the <hi>Mind</hi> and
<hi>Conscience</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Will</hi> on the other. The Will was still absolutely bent on Sin, only some Head was made against its Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations by the Light of the Mind before Sin, and rebukes of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence after it. But the <hi>Conflict</hi> begins now to be in the Will it self. A new <hi>Principle of Grace</hi> being infused thereinto, opposeth those habitual Inclinations unto Evil, which were before predominant in it. This fills the Mind with Amazement, and in some brings them to the very door of Despair, because they see not how nor when they shall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. So was it with the Person instanced in <hi>Lib. 8. Cap. 5. Voluntas nova quae mihi esse caeperit, ut te gratis colerem fruique te vellem, Deus sola certa jucunditas, nondum erat idonea ad superandam priorem vetustate ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratam. Ita duae voluntates meae, una vetus, alia nova, illa carnalis, illa spiritalis confligebant inter se, atque discordando dissipabant animam meam. Sic intelligebam meo ipso experimento id quod legeram, quomod caro concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisceret adversus spiritum &amp; spiritus adversus carnem; Ego quidem in utro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, sed magis ego in eo quod in me approbabam quam in eo quod in me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabam. Ibi enim magis jam non ego, quia ex magna parte id patiebar invitus, quod faciebam volens. The New Will which began to be in me, whereby I would love thee, O my God the only certain sweetness, was not yet able to overcome my former Will, confirmed by long continuance. So my two Wills, the one Old, the other New, the one Carnal, the other Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, conflicted between themselves, and rent my Soul by their disagreement. Then did I understand by experience in my self what I hard read, how the Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit lusteth against the Flesh. I was my self on both sides, but more in that which I approved in my self than in what I condemned in my self. I was not more in that which I condemned, because for the most part I suffered unwillingly what I did willingly.</hi> This <hi>Conflict</hi> between <hi>Grace and Sin</hi> in the Will he most excellently expresseth, <hi>Cap.</hi> 9, 10, 11. delivering those things which more or less are evident in the Experience of those who have passed through this Work. His Fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his Promises, his Hopes and Fears, the Ground he got and lost, the pangs of Conscience and travel of Soul which he underwent in the new Birth, are all of them <hi>graphically</hi> represented by him.</p>

In the midst of this storm and disorder he comes and sayes, <hi>Peace be still.</hi> For together with his Word, he communicates some influence of his <hi>Grace,</hi> that shall break the rebellious strength, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the Power of Sin, and give the Mind satisfaction in a full Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for its everlasting Relinquishment. So was it with him mentioned, when in the condition described he was hurried up and down almost like a distracted Person, whilst he suffered the Terrors of the Lord, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Praying, sometimes Weeping, sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of his Friends, sometimes walking, and sometimes lying on the Ground, he was by an unusual occurrence warned to take up a Book and read: The Book next him was that of <hi>Paul's Epistle,</hi> which taking up and opening, the place he first fixed his eyes upon, was <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13, 14. <hi>Let us walk honestly as in the day, not in rioting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48389:161"/> not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the Flesh to fulfil the Lusts thereof.</hi> Immediately on the reading of these Words, there was an end put unto his perplexing <hi>Conflict.</hi> He found his whole Soul by the Power of Almighty Grace subdued wholly to the Will of God, and fixed unto a prevalent Resolution of adhering to him with a relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishment of Sin, with an assured composure upon the account of the success he should have therein through Jesus Christ. Immediately he declared what he had done, what had befallen him, first to his <hi>Friend,</hi> then to his <hi>Mother,</hi> which proved the occasion of <hi>Conversion</hi> to the one, and <hi>inexpressible joy</hi> to the other. The end of the Story deserves to be reported in his own words; <hi>Arripui librum, aperui, legi,—nec ultra vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lui legere nec opus erat. Statim quippe cum fine hujusce sententiae quasi lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce securitatis infusa cordi meo, omnes dubitationis tenebrae defugerunt.

Inde ad matrem ingredimur, indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, gaudet; Narramus quemadmodum gestum sit, exultat &amp; triumphat, &amp; benedicit tibi, qui potens es ultra quam petimus aut intelligimus facere, Lib. 8. Cap.</hi> 12. Having read these Verses I would read no more, nor was there any need that so I should do. For upon the end of that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as if a Light of Peace or Security had been infused into my Heart, all darkness of doubts fled away; marking the Book with my Finger put into it, or by some other sign, I shut it, and with a quiet countenance declared what was done to <hi>Alipius.</hi> And hereupon he also declared what was at Work in himself, whereof I was ignorant. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to see what I had read, which when I had shewed him, he looked further than I had read, nor did I know what followed. But it was this, he that is weak in the Faith receive, which he applyed unto himself and declared it unto me; confirmed by this Admonition, with a firm purpose and suitable to his manners, wherein he formerly much excelled me, he was joyned to me without any turbulent delay. We go in hereon unto my Mother, and declare what was done; She rejoyceth; We make known the manner of it how it was done; she exulteth and triumpheth, and blesseth thee, O God, who art able to do for us more than we know how to ask or understand. And these things doth the Holy Man express to bear witness, as he sayes, <hi>Adversus typhum humani generis,</hi> to repress the swelling pride of Mankind. And in the Example of <hi>Alipius</hi> we have an Instance, how variously God is pleased to effect this Work in Men, carrying some through strong Convictions, deep Humiliations, great Distresses, and perplexing Terrors of Mind, before they come to Peace and Rest; leading others gently and quietly without any visible disturbances, unto the saving Knowledge of himself by Jesus Christ.</p>

For the Law comes with its whole Power upon the Mind and Conscience. Men may be partial in the Law the Law will not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.

                  </gap>, but also at the same time
<hi>condemns</hi> by its Authority. For what the <hi>Law speaks, it speaks unto them that are under the Law.</hi> It takes Men <hi>under its Power,</hi> and then
<hi>shutting</hi> them under Sin, it speaks unto them in great severity. This is called the <hi>coming of the Commandment,</hi> and slaying of a Sinner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
               <p>(2.) This Apprehension will ordinarily ingenerate <hi>disquieting and perplexing Affections</hi> in the Minds of Men; nor can it be otherwise where it is fixed and prevalent. As, (1.) <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> for and of what they have done. Shame was the first thing wherein Conviction of Sin discovered it self, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 7. And Sorrow alwayes accompanieth it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36. Hearing these things <gap reason="foreign">

(2.) <hi>Fear of Eternal Wrath;</hi> This keeps the Soul in <hi>bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> Heb. 2. 14. and is accompanied with torment. The Person so convinced, believes the threatning of the Law to be true and trembles at it. An eminent Instance whereof we have in our first Parents also,

And yet they may not be in the least affected with them as we see by experience. Wherefore we say moreover that the <hi>Law</hi> or the Doctrine of it, when the Consciences of Men are effectually brought under its Power, is accompanied with a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Vertue</hi> from God called a <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> which causeth a sense of the Curse of it to take a deep impression on the Soul, to fill it with
<hi>fear</hi> and <hi>dread,</hi> yea sometimes with horror and despair. This the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calls the <hi>Spirit of Bondage unto Fear,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. and declares at large how all that are under the Law, that is, the convincing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Power of it are in <hi>bondage,</hi> nor doth the Law in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of it, lead or gender unto any thing else but <hi>Bondage,</hi> Gal. 4. 22, 23, 24.</p>

The <hi>substance</hi> of these things is ordinarily found in those who are converted unto God, when grown up unto the use of Reason and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Impressions from external Administrations. Especially are they evident in the Minds and Consciences of such as have been engaged in any open sinful couse or practice. But yet no <hi>certain Rule or Measure</hi> of them can be prescribed as necessary in or unto any antecedaneously unto Conversion. To evince the Truth hereof two things may be observed; (1.) That Perturbations, Sorrows, Dejections, Dread, Fears, are <hi>no Duty</hi> unto any; only they are such things as sometimes ensue or are immitted into the Mind upon that which is a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible, namely <hi>conviction</hi> of Sin. They belong not to the Precept of the Law, but to its Curse. They are no part of what is required of us, but of what is inflicted on us. There is a Gospel-Sorrow and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation after believing that is a Duty, that is both commanded and hath Promises annexed unto it. But this Legal Sorrow is an Effect of the Curse of the Law and not of its Command. (2.) God is pleased to exercise a <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Sovereignty</hi> in this whole Matter, and deals with the Souls of Men in unspeakable variety. Some he leads by the Gates of Death and Hell unto Rest in his Love, like the People of old through the waste and howling Wilderness into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Paths of others he makes plain and easie unto them. Some walk or wander long in Darkness, in the Souls of others Christ is formed in the first gracious Visitation.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>34</label>(6.) There is as was said, no certain <hi>Measure or Degree</hi> of these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents or Consequents of Conviction to be prescribed unto any as <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneously necessary</hi> to sincere Conversion and sound Believing: but these two things in general are so; (1.) Such a Conviction of Sin, that is of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48389:162"/> a <hi>state of Sin,</hi> of a <hi>course of Sin,</hi> of <hi>actual Sins,</hi> against the Light of Natural Conscience, as that the Soul is satisfied that it is thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto the Curse of the Law and the Wrath of God. Thus at least doth God <hi>conclude and shut up every one under Sin</hi> on whom he will have Mercy; <hi>for every Mouth must be stopped, and all become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3. 19. Gal. 3. 22. without this no Man ever did nor will ever sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely believe in Jesus Christ. For he calleth none unto him, but those who in some measure are <hi>weary</hi> or <hi>thirsty,</hi> or one way or other seek after Deliverance. The <hi>whole</hi> he tells us, that is, those who so conceit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, have no need of a <hi>Physician,</hi> they will neither enquire after him nor care to go unto him when they are invited so to do; see <hi>Isa.</hi> 32. 2. (2.) A due apprehension and resolved Judgment that there is no way within the compass of a Man's own <hi>contrivance</hi> to find out, or his <hi>ability</hi> to make use of and to walk in, nor any <hi>other way</hi> of God's appointment or approbation, which will deliver the Soul in and from the State and Condition wherein it is, and that which it fears, but only that which is proposed in the Gospel by Jesus Christ.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>35</label>(7.) Where these things are, the Duty of a Person so convinced, is to enquire after and to receive the <hi>Revelation of Jesus Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God</hi> in him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 13. And in order hereunto he ought; (1.) <hi>To own the Sentence of the Law</hi> under which he suffereth, justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in his Righteousness, and the Law in its Holiness, what-ever be the issue of this Dispensation towards himself, <hi>Rom. 3. 19, 20. Chap.</hi> 7. 12, 13. For God in this Work intends to break the stubbornness of Men's Hearts, and to hide Pride from them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4. (2.) Not <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily</hi> to believe every thing that will propose it self unto him as a Remedy or Means of Relief, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 6, 7. The things which will present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in such a Case as means of Relief are of two sort. (1.) Such as the Fears and Superstitions of Men have suggested or will suggest. That which hath raised all the false Religion which is in the World, is nothing but a contrivance for the satisfaction of Men's Consciences un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Convictions. To pass by Gentilism, This is the very Life and Soul of <hi>Popery.</hi> What is the meaning of the Sacrifice of the Mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, of
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> of Pardons, Penances, Indulgences, Abstinences, and the like things innumerable, but only to satisfie Conscience by them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with a sense of Sin? Hence many among them after great and outragious wickednesses, do betake themselves to their highest <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastical</hi> Severity. The Life and Soul of Superstition consists in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to quiet and charm the Consciences of Men convinced of Sin. (2.) That which is pressed with most vehemency and plausibility, being suggested by the <hi>Law</hi> it self in a way of escape from the danger of its Sentence, as the sense of what it speaks represented in a natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, is <hi>legal Righteousness</hi> to be sought after in amendment of Life. This proposeth it self unto the Soul, as with great importunity, so with great Advantages to further its Acceptance. For (1.) the <hi>matter</hi> of it is <hi>unquestionably necessary,</hi> and without it in its proper place and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto its proper End, there is not sincere Conversion unto God. (1.) It is looked on as the <hi>sense of the Law,</hi> or as that which will give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction thereunto. But there is a deceit in all these things, as to the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48389:163"/> end proposed; and if any <hi>amendment of Life</hi> be leaned on to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it will prove a <hi>broken Reed</hi> and pierce the Hand of him that rests upon it. For although the Law require at all times an abstinence from sin, and so for the future, which in a Sinner is <hi>amendment of Life;</hi> yet it proposeth it not as that which will deliver any Soul from the <hi>guilt of Sin already contracted,</hi> which is the State under Consideration. And if it win upon the Mind to accept of its Terms unto that end or purpose, it can do no more, nor will do less than shut up the Person under its
<hi>Curse.</hi>

And I shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize what I have to offer on this Head in the ensuing Observations.</p>
               <p>(1.) This is the <hi>proper and peculiar Work of the Gospel,</hi> and ever was so form the first giving of the Promise. <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moses,
<hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ,</hi> John 1. 18. Rom. 1. 16. 1 Pet. 1. 23. Jam. 1. 18. Ephes. 3. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>(2.) To this purpose it is necessary that the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that is, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of it concerning Redemption, Righteousness and Salvation by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, be <hi>declared</hi> and made known to Convinced Sinners. And this also is an effect of Sovereign Wisdom and Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>(3.) The Declaration of the Gospel is accompanied with a <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Will of God, with respect unto the Faith and Obedience of them unto whom it is declared. This is <hi>the Work of God,</hi> the Work which he requires at our hands, <hi>that we believe in him whom he hath sent,</hi> Joh. 6. And this Command of God unto Sinners to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ for Life and Salvation, the Gospel teacheth us to press from the manifold <hi>Aggravations</hi> which attend the Sin of not complying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. For it is, as therein declared; (1.) <hi>A Rejection of the Testimony of God,</hi> which he gives unto his Wisdom, Love, and Grace, with the excellency and certainty of the way of Salvation of Sinners by Jesus
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48389:163"/> Christ, which is to make <hi>God a Layar,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 10. Joh. 3. 32, 33. (2.) A
<hi>Contempt of Love and Grace,</hi> with the way and means of their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to lost Sinners by the Blood of the Son of God, which is the highest provocation that can be offered unto the Divine Majesty.</p>
               <p>(4.) In the Declaration of the Gospel the Lord Christ is in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner proposed, as <hi>crucified and lifted up</hi> for the especial Object of our Faith, <hi>John 3. 14, 15. Gal.</hi> 3. 1. And this Proposition of Christ hath included in it an <hi>Invitation</hi> unto all Convinced Sinners to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for Life and Salvation, <hi>Isa. 45. 2. Chap.</hi> 65. 1.</p>
               <p>(5.) The Lord Christ being proposed unto Sinners in the Gospel, and their acceptance or receiving of him being urged on them, it is withal declared for <hi>what end</hi> he is so proposed. And this is in general <hi>to save them from their Sins,</hi> Mat. 1. 21. or <hi>the Wrath to come</hi> whereof they are afraid, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 10. For in the Evangelical Proposition of him there is included; (1.) That there is a <hi>Way yet remaining for Sinners,</hi> whereby they may escape the Curse of the Law, and the Wrath of God which they have deserved, <hi>Psal. 130. 4. Job 33. 24. Acts</hi> 4. 12. (2.) That the Foundation of these Wayes lies in an <hi>Atonement</hi> made by Jesus Christ unto the Justice of God, and Satisfaction to his Law for Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21. Gal.</hi> 3. 13. (3.) That God is <hi>well-pleased with this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,</hi> and his Will is that we should accept of it, and acquiesce in it, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 18, 19. Isa. 53. 11, 12. Rom.</hi> 5. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>(6.) It is proposed and promised, that through and upon their believing, that is, on Christ as proposed in the Gospel for the only way of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation, <hi>Convinced Sinners shall be pardoned,</hi> justified, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted before God, discharged of the Law against them, through the
<hi>imputation</hi> unto them of what the Lord Christ hath done for them and suffered in their stead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. &amp; 10. 3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30, 31. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>(7.) To prevail with and win over the Souls of Men unto a <hi>consent</hi> to receive Christ on the Terms wherein he is proposed; that is, to believe in him, and trust unto him, to what he is, hath done and suffered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth to do for pardon of Sin, Life and Salvation, the Gospel is filled with <hi>Arguments, Invitation, Incouragements, Exhortations, Promises,</hi> all of them designed to explain and declare the Love, Grace, Faithfulness, and good-Will of God herein. In the due management and improvement of these parts of the Gospel, consists the principal Wisdom and Skill of the Ministers of the New Testament.</p>
               <p>(8.) Among these various Ways or Means of the Declaration of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his Will, God frequently causeth some <hi>especial Word,</hi> Promise or Passage to fix it self on the <hi>Mind of a Sinner,</hi> as we saw it in the Instance before insisted on. Hereby the Soul is first excited to exert and act the Faith wherewith it is endued, by the effectual working of the Spirit of God before described. And by this means are Men directed unto Rest Peace and Consolation, in that variety of Degrees wherein God is pleased to communicate them.</p>
               <p>(9.) <hi>This Acting of Faith on Christ</hi> through the Promise of the Gospel, for Pardon, Righteousness and Salvation, is inseparably accompanied with, and that Faith is the Root and infallible cause of an <hi>universal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of Heart unto all Holy Obedience to God in Christ,</hi> with a Relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishment of all known Sin, necessarily producing a through-Change
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48389:164"/> and Reformation of Life, and Fruitfulness in Obedience. For as upon a discovery of the <hi>Love of God</hi> in Christ, the Promises whereby it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited unto us being mixed with Faith, the Soul of a poor Sinner will be filled with <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> and Shame for its former Sins, and will be deeply humbled for them; so all the Faculties of it being now renewed and inwardly changed, it can no more refrain from the <hi>Love of Holiness,</hi> and from an Ingagement into a watchful course of Universal Obedience unto God, by such free Actings as are proper unto it, than one that is
<hi>new born</hi> can refrain from all Acts of <hi>Life Natural,</hi> In Motion desire of Food and the like. Vain and foolish therefore are the <hi>Reproaches of some,</hi> who in an high course of a Worldly Life and Profane, do charge others with Preaching a <hi>Justification by Faith</hi> alone in Christ Jesus unto a neglect of Holiness, Righteousness and Obedience of God, which such Scoffers and fierce Despisers of all that are good do so earnestly plead for. Those whom they openly reflect upon, do unanimously teach, That the Faith which doth not <hi>purifie the Heart</hi> and <hi>reform the Life,</hi> which is not fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in good Works, which is not an <hi>effectual Cause and Means</hi> of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and newness of Life, is not genuine nor pleadable unto Justification, but empty, dead, and that which if trusted unto, will eternally deceive the Souls of Men. They do all of them press the indispensible necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Universal Holiness,</hi> Godliness, Righteousness or Obedience to all the Commands of God on surer Principles, with more <hi>cogent</hi> Arguments, in a more clear compliance with the Will, Grace, and Love of God in Christ, than any they pretend unto, who ignorantly and falsly traduce them, as those who regard them not. And as they urge an <hi>Obediential Holiness,</hi> which is not defective in any Duty either towards God or Man, which they either plead for or pretend unto; so it contains that in it which is more <hi>Sublime, Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Heavenly,</hi> than what they are either acquainted with or do regard; which in its proper place shall be made more fully to appear.</p>

Were it unto our present purpose to discourse concerning the general nature of <hi>Peace,</hi> I might shew how it is comprehensive of all Order, Rest and Blessedness, and all that is in them. On this account the enclosure of it in this Title unto God as its only Possessour and Author, belongs to the Glory of his Soveraign Diadem. Every thing that is contrary unto it, is <hi>evil,</hi> and of the <hi>evil One;</hi> yea, all that is evil is so, because of its contrariety unto <hi>peace.</hi> Well therefore may God be styled the <hi>God of Peace.</hi> But these things I may not here stay to explain; although the words are so comprehensive and expressive of the whole work of Sanctification, and that Holiness which is the effect thereof, as that I shall choose to found my whole Discourse concerning this subject upon them. That which offers it self unto our present design from this expression, is the peculiar respect unto the
<hi>Work of our Sanctification</hi> which lies in this especial Property of God. Wherefore he is said to sanctifie us as the <hi>God of peace.</hi> (1) Because it is a <hi>fruit and effect</hi> of that peace with himself which he hath made and prepared for us by Jesus Christ. For he <hi>was in Christ reconciling the World unto himself, destroying the Enmity</hi> which entred by sin, and laying the Foundation of Eternal Peace. From hence it is, that he will <hi>sanctifie</hi> us or make us Holy, without a respect whereunto he would no more do so, than he will sanctifie again the <hi>Angels</hi> that have sinned, for whom there is <hi>no peace</hi> made, nor Attonement. (2) God, by the Sanctification of our Natures and Persons <hi>preserves that peace</hi> with himself in its Exercise, which he made and procured by the Mediation of Christ; without which it could not be kept, nor continued. For in the Duties and Fruits thereof, consist all those Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings towards God which a <hi>State of Reconciliation, Peace,</hi> and Friendship do require. It is Holiness that keeps up a sense of Peace with God, and prevents those spiritual breaches which the remainders of our Enmity would occasion. Hence God as the Author of our Peace is the Author of our Holiness. God even God himself, the God of Peace doth sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us: How this is done <hi>immediately by the Holy Ghost,</hi> the Spirit of Love and Peace, and wherein the nature of this work doth consist, are the things which must afterwards be more fully declared. And he is here said to sanctifie us <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>universally</hi> and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; carrying on the work untill it comes to perfection. For two things are intended in that Expression. 1. That our <hi>whole Nature</hi> is the subject of this work, and not any one Faculty or Part of it. 2. That as the work it self is sincere and universal, communicating all parts of real Holiness unto our whole Natures, so it is carryed on to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatness</hi> and Perfection. Both these in the ensuing words the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle expresseth as the end and design of his Prayer for them, and the Effect of the work of Grace which he prayed for. For (1) the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of this Sanctification he makes to be our whole Natures, which he distributes unto our <hi>entire spirits, Souls and Bodies;</hi> and (2.) The End of the whole is, the preservation of of us <hi>blameless</hi> in the peace of God unto the coming of Christ, which will both of them be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately more fully spoken unto.

This both the Importance of the Truth it self, and the Opposition thatis made unto it, render necessary. Besides, whereas we are in the Declaration of the espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<hi>Operations</hi> of the Holy Ghost, although he be not so denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted originally from this peculiar Work, as though he should be called
<hi>Holy</hi> meerly because he is the Author of Holiness in all that are made partakers of it, which we have before disproved; yet there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral consent, in words at least, among all who are called <hi>Christians,</hi> that this is his immediate and proper Work, or that he is the <hi>only sanctifier</hi> of all them that do believe: And this I shall take as yet for granted, although some among us, who not only pretend high to the
<hi>preaching</hi> of Holiness (whatever be their practice) but reproach others as weakning the <hi>necessity</hi> of it, do talk at such a rate as if in the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which they pleaded for, he had nothing to do in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For it is no news to meet with queint and guilded Discourses about Holiness, intermixed with <hi>scoffing reflections</hi> on the work of the Holy Ghost therein. This Work therefore of his we are in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner to attend unto; unless we would be found among the number of such as those who own themselves and teach their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, That the <hi>Holy Ghost sanctifies all the Elect of God,</hi> and yet not only despise the work of Holiness in themselves, but deride those who plead an interest therein as an effect of the sanctification of the Spirit. For, such fruits of secret <hi>Atheism</hi> doth the world abound withall. But our principal Duty in this world, is to know aright what it is to be Holy, and so to be indeed.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> One thing we must premise to clear our ensuing Discourse from Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity. And this is, that there is mention in the Scripture of a <hi>Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold sanctification,</hi> and consequently of a two-fold Holiness. The first is common unto Persons and Things, consisting in the peculiar <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> Consecration or Separation of them unto the Service of God by his own Appointment, whereby they become Holy. Thus the
<hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> of Old, the <hi>Arke,</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and the
<hi>Temple,</hi> were sanctified and made <hi>Holy.</hi> And indeed in all Holiness whatever there is a peculiar <hi>Dedication</hi> and Separation unto God. But in the sense mentioned, this was solitary and alone; no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto it but this <hi>sacred separation,</hi> nor was there any other effect of this Sanctification. But (secondly) There is another kind of Sanctification and Holiness, wherein this Separation to God is not the first thing done or intended, but a Consequent and Effect thereof. This is <hi>real</hi> and <hi>internal,</hi> by the Communicating of a principle of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness unto our Natures, attended with its Exercise in Acts and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Holy Obedience unto God. This is that which in the first
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48389:167"/> place we enquire after, and how far Believers are therein and thereby peculiarly <hi>separated</hi> and <hi>dedicated</hi> unto God, shall be afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. And unto what we have to deliver concerning it we shall make way by the ensuing observations.</p>

It belongs neither to nature nor the Law, so as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from them, or to be effected by them. Nature is wholly corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contrary unto it. The Law indeed for certain Ends was <hi>given by Moses,</hi> but all <hi>Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ.</hi> There neither is, nor ever was in the world, nor ever shall be, the least dram of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, but what flowing from Jesus Christ, is communicated by the Spirit, according to the <hi>Truth</hi> and promise of the Gospel. There may be something <hi>like</hi> it as to its outward Acts and effects, (at least some of them) something that may wear its Livery in the world, that is but the fruit of mens own Endeavours in Compliance with their convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but Holiness it is not, nor of the same kind or nature with it. And this men are very apt to deceive themselves withal. It is the design of corrupted Reason to debase all the glorious mysteries of the Gospel, and all the concernments of them. There is nothing in the whole
<hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> from the Highest crown of it, which is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, <hi>God manifested in the flesh,</hi> unto the lowest and nearest effect of his Grace, but it labours to deprave, dishonour, and debase. The Lord Christ, it would have in his whole person to be but a <hi>meer man,</hi> in his Obedience and suffering to be but an <hi>Example,</hi> in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be confin'd unto the Capacity and Comprehension of <hi>Carnal Reason,</hi> and the Holiness which he communicates by the Sanctification of his Spirit, to be but that <hi>Moral vertue</hi> which is common among men as the fruit of their own Endeavours. Herein some will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that men are guided and directed to a great Advantage by the
<hi>Doctrine of the Gospel,</hi> and thereunto excited by motions of the Holy Ghost himself put forth in the Dispensation of that Truth; but any thing else in it, more excellent, more mysterious, they will not allow. But these low and carnal imaginations are exceedingly unworthy of the Grace of Christ, the Glory of the Gospel, the mystery of the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of our Nature, and healing of the wound it received by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of sin, with the whole design of God in our Restauration into a state of Communion with himself <hi>Moral vertue</hi> is indeed the best thing amongst men that is of them. It far exceeds in worth, use, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48389:168"/> all that the Honours, Powers, Profits, and Pleasures of the World can extend unto. And it is admirable to consider, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions are given concerning it, what expressions are made of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, what <hi>Encomiums</hi> of its use and beauty by Learned contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative men among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> the wisest of whom did acknowledge, that there was yet something in it which they could onely admire, and not comprehend. And very eminent instances of the practice of it were given in the lives and conversations of some of them. And as the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Righteousness, Moderation, Temperance, Equanimity in all Conditions, rise up at present unto the shame and reproach of many that are called <hi>Christians,</hi> so they will be called over at the last day, as an Aggravation of their Condemnation. But to suppose that this
<hi>Moral vertue,</hi> whatever it be really in its own nature, or however ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the imaginations of men, is that <hi>Holiness of Truth</hi> which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers receive by the Spirit of Christ, is to debase it, to overthrow it, and to drive the souls of men from seeking an interest in it. And hence it is that some pretending highly a friendship and respect unto it, doe yet hate, despise, and reproach what is really so, pleasing themselves with the empty name, or withered Carcase of <hi>vertue,</hi> every way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour as interpreted in their practice to the Righteousness of Heathens. And this in the first place should stir up our diligence in our enquiries after its true and real nature, that we decive not our selves with a false appearance of it, and that unto our ruine.</p>

It may seem strange indeed, that whereas all Believers are <hi>sanctified</hi> and made <hi>Holy,</hi> that they should not understand nor apprehend what is <hi>wrought in them</hi> and for them, and what abideth with them: But alas, how little do we know of our selves, of what we are, and whence are our Powers and Faculties even in things natural? Do we know how the members of the Body are fashioned in the womb? We are apt to be seeking after and giving Reasons for all things, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the progress of the production of our Natures from first to last, so as if not to satisfie our selves, yet to please and amuze others; for vain man would be wise, although he be like the wilde Asses Colt. The best issues of our Consideration hereof is that of the <hi>Psalmist: Thou, O God, hast possessed my reins, thou hast covered me in my Mothers wombe; I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.

By diligent consideration of these things we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a firm foundation to stand on, in an <hi>Holy Admiration</hi> of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wisdom and Goodness of that Soveraign <hi>Architect,</hi> who hath raised this Fabrick unto his own Glory; and what we further attempt is Vanity and Curiosity. How little do we know of these Souls of ours, and all that we do so, is by their Powers and Operations, which are Consequential unto their Beings. Now these things are our own naturally, they dwell and abide with us; they are we, and we are they, and nothing else; yet is it no easie thing for us to have a reflex and intimate acquaintance with them. And is it strange if we should be much in the dark unto this <hi>new Nature,</hi> this new Creature, which comes from above, from God in Heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our natural Reason hath no Acquaintance?

               <p>Besides there are other things which pretend to be this Gospel Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and are not, whereby unspeakable Multitudes are deluded and deceived.

They who dye in the Lord rest from their Labours <hi>and their works follow them, Rev. 14. 13. God is not unrighteous to forget their labour of love,</hi> Heb. 6. 10. There is not any Effect or Fruit of Holiness, not the least, not the giving of a <hi>cup of cold water</hi> to a Disciple of Christ in the name of a Disciple, but it shall be had in everlasting remembrance, and abide for ever in its Eternal Reward. Nothing shall be lost, but all the fragments of it shall be gathered up and kept safe for ever.

Let no soul fear the <hi>Loss</hi> of any Labour in any of the Dutyes of Holiness, in the most secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against sin, for inward Purity, for outward Fruitfulness, in the Mortification of sin, Resistance of Temptations, Improvement of Grace, in Patience, Moderation, Self-denyal, Contentment, all that you do know, and what you do not know, shall all be <hi>revived,</hi> called over, and abide Eternally in your Reward. Our Father who now <hi>seeth in secret</hi> will one day reward openly. And the more we abound in these things the more will God be glorified in the Recompence of Reward. But this is not all, nor that which I intend. It abides (2) for ever, and passeth over into Glory in its <hi>Principle</hi> or Nature. The Love wherewith we now <hi>adhere to God,</hi> and by which we act the Obedience of Faith towards the Saints faileth not, it ends not when Glory comes on, but is a part of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. It is true some Gifts shall be <hi>done away</hi> as useless in a state of Perfection and Glory, as the Apostle there discourseth; and some Graces shall cease as to some <hi>especial Acts</hi> and peculiar Exercise, as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> so far as they respect things unseen and future. But all those Graces whereby Holiness is <hi>constituted</hi> and wherein it doth consist, for the substance of them as they contain the
<hi>Image of God,</hi> as by them we are united and do adhere unto God in Christ, shall in their present nature improved into perfection, abide for ever. In our knowledge of them therefore have we our principal insight into our Eternal Condition in Glory: And this is as a firm foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Consolation, so a part of our chiefest Joy in this World. Is it not a matter of unspeakable Joy and Refreshment that these <hi>poor Bodyes</hi> we carry about us, after they have been made a prey unto death, dust, worms, and corruption, shall be raised and restored to Life and Immortality, freed from pains, sickness, weakness, weariness, and vested with those Qualities in conformity to <hi>Christs glorious Body,</hi> which yet
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48389:169"/> we understand not? It is so also that these <hi>Souls</hi> which now animate and rule in us, shall be delivered from all their Darkness, Ignorance, Vanity, Instability, and Alienation from things Spiritual and Heavenly. But this is not all. These poor low <hi>Graces</hi> which no live and are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us shall be continued, preserved, purified and perfected, but in their nature be the <hi>same</hi> as now they are, as our Souls and Bodies shall be.

The full prosecution of this Consideration we must put off unto our Arguments for the <hi>Necessity</hi> of it, which will ensue in their proper place. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I shall shew, that not only God requireth Holiness indispensibly in all Believers, but also that this is <hi>All</hi> which he requireth of them or expecteth from them: For it comprizeth the whole Duty of man. And this surely rendreth it needfull for us both to <hi>know</hi> what it is, and diligently to apply our selves unto the obtaining an assured par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of it. For what Servant who hath any sense of his Relation and Duty, if he be satisfied that his Master requireth but <hi>one thing</hi> of him, will not endeavour an Acquaintance with it, and the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it. Some indeed say that their Holiness (such as it is) is the
<hi>Chief</hi> or <hi>only</hi> Design of the Gospel. If they intend that it is the first principal <hi>Design of God</hi> in and by the Gospel, and that not only as to the <hi>Preceptive</hi> part of it, but also as unto its <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>Promissory</hi> parts, whence it is principally and <hi>emphatically</hi> denominated, it is a fond Imagination. Gods great and first design in and by the Gospel is eternally to <hi>Glorifie</hi> himself, his Wisdom, Goodness, Love, Grace, Righteousness and Holiness by Jesus Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5, 6. And in order to this his great and supreme end, he hath designed the Gospel, and designs by the Gospel, which gives the Gospel its Design; (1) To
<hi>reveal</hi> that Love and Grace of his unto lost sinners, with the <hi>way of its</hi> Communication through the Mediation of his Son Incarnate, as the only means whereby he will be glorified, and whereby they may be saved, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. (2) To prevail with men in and by the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of its Truth, and Encouragement of its Promises, to renounce their sins and all other Expectations of Relief or Satisfaction, and to
<hi>betake</hi> themselves by Faith unto that way of Life and Salvation which is therein declared unto them, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 18, 19, 20, 21. Col.</hi> 1. 25, 26, 27, 28. (3) To be the means and <hi>Instrument</hi> of conveying over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and giving them a Title unto, and a Right in that Grace and Mercy, that Life and Righteousness which is revealed and tendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them thereby, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. (4) To be the way and means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the <hi>Spirit of Christ</hi> with Grace and Strength unto the Elect, enabling of them to believe and receive the Attonement, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. (5) Hereby to give them <hi>Vnion with Christ</hi> as their Spiritual and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Head, us also to fix their Hearts and Souls in their choycest Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in their Faith, Trust, Confidence and Love immediately on the Son of God as Incarnate and their Mediator, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 1. Wherefore the first and principal End of the Gospel <hi>towards</hi> us, is to invite and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage lost sinners unto the Faith and Approbation of the Way of Grace Life and Salvation by Jesus Christ, without a Complyance wherewith in the <hi>first place,</hi> the Gospel hath no more to do with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but leaves them to Justice the Law and themselves. But now upon a supposition of these things, and of our giving Glory to God by Faith in them, the <hi>whole that God requireth of us in the Gospel in a way of Duty is, that we should be Holy,</hi> and abide in the use of those means whereby Holiness may be attained and improved in us. For if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires any other thing of us it must be on one of these four Accounts: 1. To make Attonement for our sins; or 2. To be our Righteousness
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48389:170"/> before him; or 3. To <hi>merit</hi> Life and Salvation by; or 4. To <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogate</hi> in the behalf of others. No other end can be thought of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what are the true ends of Holiness whereon God should require any thing of us. And all the false Religion that is in the world leans on a supposition that God doth require somewhat of us with respect unto these ends.</p>
               <p>But (1) He requires nothing of us (which we had all the Reason in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the world to expect that he would) to make <hi>Attonement</hi> or satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our sins, that might compensate the injuries we had done him by our Apostasie and Rebellion. For whereas we had multiplyed sins against him, lived in an Enmity and Opposition to him, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted insupportable and immeasurable Debts upon our own Souls,
<hi>Terms of peace</hi> being now proposed, who could think but that the first thing required of us would be, that we should make <hi>some kind of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> to Divine Justice for all our enormous and heynous provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Yea who is there that indeed doth naturally think otherwise? so he apprehended who was contriving a way in his own mind how he might come to an Agreement with God. <hi>Micah 6. 6, 7. Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow my self before the High God? shall I come before him with Burnt-Offerings, with Calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with Thousands of Rams, or with ten Thousands of Rivers of Oyl? Shall I give my first-born for my Transgression, the fruit of my Body for the sin of my Soul.</hi> This or something of this nature seems to be but a very reasonable Enquiry for a Guilty self-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sinner, when first he entertains thoughts of an Agreement with the Holy sin-avenging God? And this was the foundation of all that cruel and expensive Superstition that the World was in bondage unto for so many Ages. Mankind generally thought that the principal thing which was required of them in Religion, was to attone and pacifie the wrath of the Divine Power, and to make a Compensation for what had been done against him. Hence were their Sacrifices of <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of Beasts, of Mankind, of their Children, and of themselves, as I have elsewhere declared. And the same principle is still deep rooted in the minds of convinced sinners; and many an Abby, Monastery, Colledge and Almes-house hath it founded. For in the fruits of this Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Priests which set it on work, alwayes shared deeply. But quite otherwise in the Gospel there is declared and tendred unto sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<hi>an absolute free pardon</hi> of all their sins, without any satisfaction or Compensation made or to be made on their part, that is by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, namely on the Account of the <hi>Attonement</hi> made for them by Jesus Christ. And all Attempts or Endeavours after Works or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Obedience in any respect <hi>satisfactory to God for sin,</hi> or merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of pardon, do subvert and overthrow the whole Gospel. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 20, 21. Wherefore in Answer to the Enquiry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned the Reply in the Prophet is, that God looks for none of these things, and that all such Contrivances were wholly vain; <hi>He hath shewed thee O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> v. 8. which last Expression comprizeth the whole of our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Obedience,

Who can merit by doing his duty? our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth so plainly prove the contrary as none can further doubt of it than of his Truth and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10. Nor can we do any thing that is acceptable to him, but what is wrought in us by his Grace. And this overthrowes the whole <hi>Nature of merit</hi> which requires, that that be every way <hi>our own</hi> whereby we would deserve somewhat else at the hands of another, and not his more than ours. Neither is there any <hi>proportion</hi> between our Duties and the Reward of the eternal Enjoyment of God. For besides that they are all weak, imperfect, and tainted with sin, so that no one of them is able to make good its own station for any End or Purpose in the strictness of Divine Justice, they altogether come infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely short of the desert of an Eternal Reward by any Rule of Divine Justice. And if any say that this merit of our works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not on, nor is measured by <hi>strict Justice,</hi> but wholly by the Gracious Condescension of God who hath appointed and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so to reward them; I answer in the <hi>first</hi> place, that this perfectly overthrowes the whole Nature of <hi>Merit:</hi> For the Nature of Merit
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48389:171"/> consists entirely and absolutely in this, that to him that worketh the <hi>Reward is reckoned of Debt, and not of Grace,</hi> Rom. 4. 4. And these two are contrary and inconsistent; <hi>for what is by Grace is no more of Works, otherwise Grace is no more Grace; and what is of Works is no more of Grace, otherwise Work is no more Work.</hi> Rom. 11. 6. And those who go about to found a Merit of ours in the Grace of God, do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to unite and reconcile those things which God hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly separated and opposed. And I say (<hi>secondly</hi>) that although God doth freely, graciously and bountifully <hi>reward our Dutyes</hi> of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and upon the Account of his Covenant and Promise he is said to be, and he is <hi>Righteous</hi> in his so doing, yet he every where declares that what he so doth, is an Act of <hi>meer Grace</hi> in himself, that hath not respect unto any thing but only the <hi>Interposition</hi> and Mediation of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. In this sense God in the Gospel requireth of us nothing at all.</p>
               <p>(4.) Much less doth he require of any, that they should do such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> things as being no way necessary unto that Obedience which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves personally owe unto him, may yet by their <hi>supererogation</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, redound to the Advantage and benefit of others. This monstrous fiction which hath out-done all the <hi>Pharisaisme</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a pretence given to the piety, or rather covering of the impiety of their Votaries. But seeing on the one hand that they are themselves who pretend to these Works but
<hi>flesh,</hi> and so cannot on their own Account be <hi>Justified in the sight of God,</hi> so it is extreme pride and cursed self-confidence for them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to help others by the merit of those works whose worth they stand not in need of; concerning which it will be one day said unto them, <hi>Who hath required these things at your hands?</hi> But now whereas God requireth none of these things of us, nothing with respect unto any of these Ends, such is the perversness of our Minds by Nature, that many think that God requireth nothing else of us, or nothing of us but with respect unto one or other of these Ends; nor can they in their Hearts conceive why they should perform any one Duty towards God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be with some kind of regard unto these things. If they may do any thing whereby they may make some <hi>Recompense</hi> for their sins that are past, at least in their own Minds and Consciences, if any thing whereby they may procure an <hi>Acceptance</hi> with God, and the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of their state and Condition, they have something which as they suppose may quicken and animate their Endeavours. Without these Considerations, <hi>Holy Obedience</hi> is unto them a thing <hi>Lifeless and useless.</hi> Others will labour and take pains both in wayes of outward
<hi>Mortification</hi> and profuse <hi>Munificence</hi> in any way of Superstitious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whilest they are perswaded or can perswade themselves that they shall <hi>merit</hi> Eternal Life and Salvation thereby, without much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beholding to the Grace of God in Christ Jesus. Yea all that hath the Face or pretence of Religion in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> consists in a suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all which God requireth of us, he doth it with respect unto these ends, of <hi>Attonement, Justification, Merit</hi> and <hi>Supererrogation.</hi> Hereunto do they apply all that remains of the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God amongst them, and all their own <hi>Inventions</hi> are managed with the same Design. But by these things is the Gospel and the Faith of our
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48389:172"/> Lord Jesus Christ made of none effect. Herein then I say lies the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Opposition that is between the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God in the mystery of the Gospel, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Wisdom of the Flesh,</hi> or our Carnal Reason. God in his dealing with us by the Gospel, takes upon his own Grace and Wisdom the providing of an <hi>Attonement</hi> for our sins, a <hi>Righteousness</hi> whereby we may be Justified before him, and the <hi>Collation</hi> of Eternal Life upon us, all in and by him who of God is made <hi>unto us Wisdom and Righteousness and Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi> But withall he indispensibly requires of us <hi>Holiness</hi> and
<hi>universal Obedience</hi> for the ends that shall be declared afterwards. This way, thinks the <hi>Wisdom of the Flesh</hi> or Carnal Reason is meer <hi>foolishness</hi> as our Apostle testifies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18, 23. But such a foolishness it is, that is wiser than men, <hi>v.</hi> 25. that is a way so excellent and full of Divine Wisdom, that men are not able to comprehend it. Wherefore in Opposition hereunto <hi>Carnal Reason</hi> concludes, that either what God requires of us is to be done with respect unto the ends mentioned, some or other, or all of them, or that it is no great matter whether it be done or no. Neither can it discern of what use our <hi>Holiness or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> unto God should be if it serve not unto some of these purposes. For the necessity of Conformity to God, of the Renovation of his Image in us before we are brought unto the enjoyment of him in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Authority of his Commands, the Reverence of his Wisdom, appointing the way of Holiness and Obedience as the means of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing our Thankfulness, glorifying him in the World, and of coming to Eternal Life, it hath no regard unto. But the first true saving Light that shines by the Gospel from Jesus Christ into our Souls begins to
<hi>undeceive</hi> us in this matter. And there is no greater Evidence of our receiving an <hi>Evangelical Baptisme,</hi> or of being baptized into the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Gospel, than the clear Compliance of our minds with the Wisdom of God herein. When we find such constraining motives unto Holiness upon us, as will not allow the least subducting of our Souls from an universal attendance unto it, purely on the Ends of the Gospel without respect unto those now discarded, it is an Evidence that the <hi>Wisdom of God</hi> hath prevailed against that of the flesh in our minds.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Holiness with the fruits of it, with respect unto their proper Ends, which shall afterwards be declared, is all that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us. And this he declares in the tenor of the Covenant with
<hi>Abraham, Gen. 17. 1. I am God Almighty, walk before me and be thou perfect.</hi> This is that, and this is all that I require of thee, namely thy
<hi>Holy Obedience;</hi> for all other things wherein thou art concerned I take them all upon my own <hi>Almighty Power</hi> or All-sufficiency; as he sayes elsewhere, that the <hi>whole of Man is to fear God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> And the consideration hereof taken singly and by its self, is sufficient with all that have any regard unto God, or their own Eternal welfare, to convince them of what importance these things are unto them.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label>(6) But neither yet are we left in this matter merely under the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Gods <hi>Command</hi> with an Expectation of our complyance with it from our own Ability and Power; God moreover hath <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:48389:172"/> to sanctifie us, or to work this Holiness <hi>in us,</hi> the Consideration whereof will give us yet a nearer Prospect into its nature. He that requires it of us, knows that we have it not of our selves. When we were in our best condition by nature in the state of <hi>Original Holiness,</hi> vested with the Image of God, we preserved it not. And is it likely that now in the state of <hi>lapsed and depraved nature</hi> it is in our own power to restore our selves, to re-introduce the Image of God into our Souls and that in a far more eminent manner than it was at first created by God? What needed all that Contrivance of Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grace for the <hi>Reparation of our nature</hi> by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> if Holiness wherein it doth consist be in our own Power, and educed out of the natural faculties of our Souls? There can be no more fond Imagination befall the minds of men, than that <hi>defiled</hi> Nature is able to cleanse it self, or <hi>depraved</hi> Nature to <hi>rectifie</hi> it self, or we who have lost that Image of God which he created in us, and with us, should create it again in our selves by our own endeavours. Wherefore when God commandeth and requireth us to <hi>be Holy,</hi> he commands us to be that which by nature and of our selves we are not; and not only so, but that which we have not of our selves a <hi>Power</hi> to attain unto. Whatever therefore is <hi>absolutely</hi> in our own Power, is not <hi>of that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which God requireth of us. For what we can do our selves, there is neither Necessity nor Reason why God should <hi>promise</hi> to work in us by his Grace. And to say, that what God so promiseth to <hi>work</hi> he will not <hi>work</hi> or effect indeed, but only <hi>perswade</hi> and prevail with us to do it, is through the pride of Unbelief to defie the Truth and Grace of God, and with the Spoyls of them to adorn our own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Power. Now God hath multiplyed his Promises to this purpose, so that we shall need to call over only some of them in way of Instance. <hi>Jerem. 31. 33. I will put my Law in your inward parts, and write it in your hearts, and will be your God and ye shall be my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Chap. 32. 39, 40. <hi>I will give them one Heart and one Way, that they may fear me for ever, and I will put my fear in their Hearts that they shall not depart from me.</hi> Ezek. 36. 26, 27. <hi>A new Heart will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony Heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh, and I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes, and ye shall keep my Judgments and do them.</hi> V. 25. <hi>I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your filthiness:</hi> V. 29. <hi>I will also save you from all your uncleanness.</hi> The whole of our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Holiness is comprized in these Promises. To be cleansed from the Defilements of sin whatever they be, to have an Heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, disposed, enabled, to fear the Lord alwayes, and to walk in all his Wayes and Statutes accordingly, with an internal habitual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the whole Soul unto the Law of God, is to be sanctified or to be Holy. And all this God promiseth directly to work in us and to accomplish himself. In the Faith of these Promises and for the fulfilling of them, the Apostle prayeth for the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served at our Entrance, <hi>That the God of Peace himself would sanctifie them throughout, whereby their whole Spirits Souls and Bodies might be preserved blameless to the coming of Jesus Christ.</hi> And hence is evident what we before observed, that what is absolutely in our own power
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48389:173"/> is not of the nature of, nor doth necessarily belong unto Holiness whatever it be. The best of the Intellectual or Moral Habits of our minds which are but the natural Improvement and Exercise of our facultyes, neither are nor can be our Holiness; nor do the best of our
<hi>Moral Duties</hi> as meerly and only so, belong thereunto. By these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Habits and Duties we understand the Powers Faculties or Abilities of our Souls exercised with respect and in Obedience unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, as excited, perswaded, and guided by outward Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Rules, Arguments and Considerations. Plainly, all the Power we have of our selves to obey the Law of God, and all that we do in the pursuit and exercise of that Power, upon any Reasons, Motives or Considerations whatever, which may all be resolved into fear of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and hope of Reward, with some present satisfactions of mind, on the Account of Ease in Conscience within, or outward Reputation, whether in Abstinence from sin or the Performance of Duties, are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended hereby,</hi> and are not that Holiness which we enquire after. And the Reason is plain, even because those things are not wrought in us by the <hi>power of the especial Grace of God</hi> in the pursuit of the especial Promise of the Covenant as all true Holiness is. If any shall say, that they are <hi>so wrought in us</hi> they do expresly change the nature of them. For thereby those Powers would be no more natural but supernatural; and those Dutyes would be no more meerly <hi>Moral</hi> but <hi>Evangelical</hi> and spiritual, which is to grant all we contend for: Wherefore that which men call <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> is so far from being the whole of <hi>internal Grace or Holiness,</hi> that if it be no more than so, it belongs not at all unto it, as not being effected in us by the <hi>especial Grace of God</hi> according to the Tenor and Promise of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And we may here divert a little to consider what ought to be the frame of our minds in the pursuit of Holiness with respect unto these things;<note place="margin">

Some would separate these things as inconsistent. A <hi>Command</hi> they suppose leaves no room for a <hi>Promise,</hi> at least not such a Promise as wherein God should take on himself to work in us what the Command requires of us. And a <hi>Promise</hi> they think takes off all the influencing Authority of the <hi>Command.</hi> If Holiness be our <hi>Duty</hi> there is no room for <hi>Grace</hi> in this matter; and if it be an effect of <hi>Grace</hi> there is no place for <hi>Duty.</hi> But all these arguings are a fruit of the
<hi>Wisdom of the Flesh,</hi> before-mentioned, and we have before disproved them. The <hi>Wisdom that is from above</hi> teacheth us other things. It is true our <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> are opposed in the matter of <hi>Justification</hi> as utterly inconsistent; <hi>If it be of Works it is not of Grace, and if it be of Grace it is not of Works,</hi> as our Apostle argues, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. Our <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Gods Grace</hi> are no where opposed in the matter of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> yea the one doth absolutely suppose the other. Neither can we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our <hi>Duty</hi> herein without the <hi>Grace</hi> of God; nor doth God give us this <hi>Grace</hi> unto any other End but that we may rightly perform our Duty. He that shall deny either that God <hi>Commands</hi> us to be Holy in a way of <hi>Duty,</hi> or promiseth to work Holiness in us in a way of <hi>Grace,</hi> may with as much modesty reject the whole Bible. Both these
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48389:173"/> therefore we are to have a due regard unto, if we intend to be Holy. And (1) our regard unto the <hi>Command</hi> consisteth in three things. 1. That we get our Consciences alwayes affected with the <hi>Authority</hi> of it, as it is the Command of God. This must afterwards be enlarged on. Where this is not there is no Holiness. Our Holiness is our <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> and the formal nature of Obedience ariseth from its respect unto the Authority of the Command. 2. That we see and understand the
<hi>Reasonableness,</hi> the Equity, the Advantage of the Command. Our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is <hi>reasonable</hi> Service; the wayes of God are <hi>Equal;</hi> and in the keeping of his Commands there is <hi>great Reward:</hi> If we judge not thus, if we rest not herein, and are thence filled with <hi>Indignation</hi> against every thing within us or without us that opposeth it, or riseth up against it, whatever we do in compliance with it in a way of Duty, we are not Holy. 3. That hereon we love and delight in it because it is <hi>Holy, J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                  </hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> because the things it requires are Upright, Equal, Easie and Pleasant to the new Nature, without any regard to the false Ends before discovered. And (2) We have a due regard unto the <hi>Promise</hi> to the same End, when 1. We walk in a constant sense of our own <hi>inability</hi> to comply with the Command in any one instance from any power in our selves. For we have no Sufficiency of our selves our Sufficiency is of God. For him who is otherwise-minded his <hi>Heart is lifted</hi> up. 2. When we <hi>adore that Grace</hi> which hath provided Help and Relief for us. Seeing without the Grace promised we could never have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto the least part or Degree of Holiness, and seeing we could never deserve the least Dram of that Grace, how ought we to <hi>adore</hi> and continually praise that infinite Bounty which hath freely provided us of this supply. 3. When we <hi>Act Faith</hi> in Prayer and Expectation on the Promise for Supplies of Grace enabling us unto Holy Obedience. And 4. When we have <hi>especial Regard</hi> thereunto with respect unto especial Temptations and particular Duties. When on all such Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions we satisfie not our selves with a respect unto the <hi>Promise</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but exercise Faith in particular on it for Aid and Assistance, then doe we regard it in a due manner.</p>

                  <hi>Sanctification is an immediate Work of the Spirit of God on the Souls of Believers, purifying and cleansing of their Natures from the pollution and uncleanness of sin, renewing in them the Image of God, and thereby enabling them from a spiritual and habitual Principle of Grace to yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto God according unto the Tenor and Terms of the New Covenant, by vertue of the Life and Death of Jesus Christ.</hi> Or more briefly; <hi>It is the Vniversal Renovation of our Natures by the Holy Spirit into the Image of God, through Jesus Christ.</hi> Hence it followes, that our <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which is the Fruit and Effect of this Work, the Work as termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us, as it comprizeth the renewed Principle or Image of God wrought in us, so it consists in <hi>an Holy Obedience unto God by Jesus Christ according to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, from the Principle of a Renewed Nature.</hi> Our Apostle expresseth the whole more briefly yet, namely, <hi>He that is in Christ Jesus is a New Creature, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 17.

<hi>Degrees</hi> in their state on other Reasons. But this work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> is <hi>progressive</hi> and admits of Degrees. One may be <hi>more sanctified</hi> and
<hi>more holy</hi> than another, who is yet truely sanctified and truely holy. It is begun at once, and carryed on gradually. But this Observation being of great importance, and such as if rightly weighed will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much Light unto the Nature of the whole work of <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and Holiness, I shall divert in this Chapter unto such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation and Confirmation of it as may give an understanding and furtherance herein.</p>
               <p>1. An <hi>Encrease</hi> and <hi>Growth</hi> in Sanctification or Holiness is frequently in the Scripture enjoyed us, and frequently promised unto us. So speaks the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> in a way of Command: 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 18. Fall not,</hi> be not cast down, <hi>from your own steadfastness; but grow, or encrease, in Grace.</hi> It is not enough that we decay not in our Spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that we be not diverted and carryed off from a steady Course in Obedience by the Power of Temptations, but an endeavour after an <hi>Improvement,</hi> an <hi>Encrease,</hi> a thriving in <hi>Grace</hi> that is in Holiness, is required of us. And a Complyance with this Command is that which our Apostle so commendeth in the <hi>Thessalonians; 2 Epist. Chap. 1. v.</hi> 3. namely, the <hi>exceeding growth of their Faith, and abounding of their Love;</hi> that is, the thriving and encrease of those Graces in them; that which is called <hi>increasing with the increase of God,</hi> Col. 2. 19. or the Encrease in Holiness which God requires, accepts, approves, by supplyes of

                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:48389:176"/> spiritual strength from Jesus Christ our Head, as it is there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
               <p>The Work of Holiness in its beginning is but like seed cast into the Earth; namely the <hi>seed of God</hi> whereby we are born again. And it is known how seed that is cast into the Earth doth grow and encrease. Being variously cherished and nourished it is in its nature to <hi>take root</hi> and to spring up, bringing forth fruit. So is it with the Principle of Grace and Holiness. It is <hi>small</hi> at first, but being received in good and honest Hearts, made so by the Spirit of God, and there nourished and cherished, it takes root and brings forth fruit. And both these, even the first <hi>planting</hi> and the <hi>encrease</hi> of it are both equally from God by his Spirit. He that <hi>begins this good</hi> Work doth also <hi>perform it to the Day of Jesus Christ,</hi> Phil. 1. 6. And this he doth two wayes.</p>
               <p>(1) By <hi>Encreasing</hi> and Strengthning those Graces of Holiness which we have received and been engaged in the exercise of. There are some Graces whose Exercise doth not depend on any outward Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, but they are and that in their actual Exercise absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto the <hi>least Degree</hi> of the Life of God; such are Faith and Love. No man doth, no man can <hi>live to God</hi> but in the Exercise of these Graces. Whatever Dutyes towards God men may perform, if they are not enlivened by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> they belong not unto that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life whereby we live to God. And these Graces are capable of <hi>Degrees,</hi> and so of <hi>Increase.</hi> For so we read expresly of <hi>little</hi> Faith, and <hi>great</hi> Faith, <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>strong</hi> Faith, both true and the same in the substance, but differing in Degrees. So also is there <hi>fervent Love,</hi> and that which comparatively is but <hi>cold.</hi> These Graces therefore in carrying on the work of Sanctification are <hi>gradually</hi> encreased. So the Disciples prayed our Saviour that he would <hi>encrease their Faith, Luke</hi> 17. 5. That is, adde unto its <hi>Light,</hi> confirm it in its <hi>Assent,</hi> multiply its
<hi>Acts,</hi> and make it strong against its Assaults, that it might work more effectually in difficult Duties of Obedience which they had an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regard unto, as is evident from the Context. For they <hi>pray</hi> for this <hi>Encrease of Faith</hi> upon the Occasion of our Saviours enjoyning
<hi>frequent forgiveness</hi> of offending Brethren, a Duty not at all easie nor pleasing to Flesh and Blood. And the Apostle prayes for the <hi>Ephesians, that they may be rooted and grounded in Love,</hi> chap. 3. 17. that is, that by the encrease and strengthening of their <hi>Love,</hi> they may be more esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in all the Duties of it. See 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 12, 13.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> These Graces being the Springs and Spirits of our <hi>Holiness,</hi> in the encrease of them in us the work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> is carryed on and universal Holiness encreased. And this is done by the Holy Spirit <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> By <hi>exciting</hi> them unto frequent Actings. Frequency of <hi>Acts</hi> doth <hi>naturally</hi> encrease and strengthen the Habits whence they proceed. And in these spiritual <hi>Habits</hi> of Faith and Love it is so moreover by Gods Appointment. They <hi>grow</hi> and <hi>thrive</hi> in and by their exercise,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 3. The want thereof is the principal means of their decay. And there are two wayes whereby the Holy Spirit, <hi>excites the Graces of Faith and Love</hi> unto frequent Acts.</p>
               <p>(1) He doth it <hi>Morally,</hi> by proposing their Objects suitably and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48389:176"/> seasonably unto them. This he doth by his <hi>Ordinances of Worship</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the preaching of the Word. God in Christ, the Promises of the Covenant and other proper Objects of our Faith and Love, being proposed unto us, these Graces are <hi>drawn out</hi> unto their Exercise. And this is one principal <hi>Advantage</hi> which we have by attendance on the Dispensation of the Word in a due Manner; namely, that by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting those <hi>Spiritual Truths</hi> which are the Object of our Faith unto our Minds, and those <hi>Spiritual Good Things</hi> which are the Object of our Love unto our Affections, both these Graces are <hi>drawn forth</hi> into frequent actual Exercise. And we are greatly mistaken if we suppose we have no Benefit by the Word beyond what we retain in our <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,</hi> though we should labour for that also. Our chief Advantage lyes in the <hi>Excitation</hi> which is thereby given unto our Faith and Love to their proper Exercise. And hereby are these Graces kept alive which without this would <hi>decay</hi> and wither. Herein doth the Holy Spirit <hi>take the things of Christ and shew them unto us,</hi> Joh. 16. 14, 15. He represents them unto us in the Preaching of the Word as the proper Objects of our Faith and Love. And so brings to remembrance the things spoken by Christ, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 26. that is, in the Dispensation of the Word he minds us of the gracious Words and Truths of Christ, proposing them to our Faith and Love. And herein lies the <hi>secret pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting and thriving</hi> of Believers under the preaching of the Gospel, which it may be they are not sensible of themselves. By this means are many Thousands of <hi>Acts of Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> drawn forth, whereby those Graces are <hi>exercised</hi> and strengthened, and consequently Holiness is encreased. And the Word by the Actings of Faith being <hi>mixed</hi> with
<hi>it,</hi> as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 2. increaseth it by its incorporation.</p>
               <p>(2) The Spirit doth it <hi>really</hi> and internally. He dwelleth in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, preserving in them the Root and Principle of all their Grace by his own immediate Power. Hence all Graces in their Exercise are called the <hi>fruits of the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5. 22, 23. He brings them forth from the <hi>Stock</hi> that he hath planted in the Heart. And we cannot Act any one Grace without his Effectual Operation therein. <hi>God worketh in us both to will and to doe of his good pleasure, Phil.</hi> 1. 13. That is, there is no part of our Wills singly and separately from him in Obedience, but it is the <hi>Operation</hi> of the Spirit of God in us so far as it is Spiritual and <hi>Holy:</hi> He is the immediate Author of every good or gracious Acting in us. For <hi>in us,</hi> that is <hi>in our Flesh</hi> (and of our selves we are but Flesh) <hi>there dwelleth no Good.</hi> Wherefore the Spirit of God <hi>dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Believers,</hi> doth effectually excite and stir up their Graces unto frequent Exercise and Actings whereby they are increased and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened. And there is nothing in the whole Course of our Walking before God that we ought to be more carefull about, than that we
<hi>grieve not,</hi> that we <hi>provoke not</hi> this good and Holy Spirit whereon he should with-hold his gracious Aids and Assistances from us. This therefore is the <hi>first</hi> way whereby the work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> is <hi>gradually</hi> carryed on by the Holy Ghost exciting our Graces unto <hi>frequent</hi> Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; whereby they are encreased and strengthened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He doth it by supplying Believers with <hi>Experiences</hi> of the Truth and <hi>Reality</hi> and Excellency of the things that are believed. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> is the Food of all Grace which it growes and thrives upon.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48389:177"/> Every <hi>Taste</hi> that Faith obtains of Divine Love and Grace, or <hi>how Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious the Lord is,</hi> addes to its measure and stature. Two things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must briefly be declared: (1) That the <hi>Experience</hi> of the Reality, Excellency, Power and Efficacy of the things that are believed, is an effectual means of encreasing Faith and Love: (2) That <hi>it is the Holy Ghost</hi> which gives us this Experience. For the <hi>First,</hi> God himself expostulates with the Church how its Faith came to be so weak when it had so great Experience of Him, or of his Power and Faithfulness,
<hi>Isa. 40. 27, 28. Hast thou not heard, hast thou not known? How then sayest thou that God hath forsaken thee?</hi> And our Apostle affirms that the Consolations which he had experimentally received from God, enabled him unto the discharge of his Duty towards others in trouble, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 4. For herein we prove, or do really approve of, as being satisfied in, <hi>the good and acceptable and perfect will of God, Rom.</hi> 12. 2. And this is that which the Apostle prayeth for in the behalf of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians, chap. 2. v.</hi> 2. I may say, that he who knoweth not how Faith is encouraged and strengthened by <hi>especial Experiences</hi> of the Reality, Power, and spiritual Efficacy on the Soul of the things believed, never was made partaker of any of them. How often doth <hi>David</hi> encourage his own Faith and others from his former Experiences which were pleaded also by our Lord Jesus Christ to the same purpose, in his great Distress, <hi>Psal. 22. 9, 10. Secondly,</hi> That it is the Holy Ghost who giveth us all our Spiritual Experiences needs no other Consideration to evince but only this, that in them <hi>consists</hi> all our Consolation. His Work and Office it is to administer Consolation unto Believers, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only <hi>Comforter</hi> of the Church. Now he administreth Comfort no other way but by giving unto the Minds and Souls of Believers, a <hi>Spiritual sensible Experience</hi> of the Reality and Power of the things we do believe. He doth not comfort us by <hi>Words,</hi> but by <hi>Things.</hi> Other means of <hi>Spiritual Consolation</hi> I know none, and I am sure this never fails. Give unto a Soul an Experience, a <hi>Taste</hi> of the Love and Grace of God in Christ Jesus, and be its Condition what it will, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuse to be comforted. And hereby doth he <hi>shed abroad the Love of God in our Hearts, Rom.</hi> 5. 5. whereby all Graces are cherished and encreased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He doth it by working <hi>immediately</hi> an Actual <hi>Encrease</hi> of these graces in us. I have shewed that these are capable of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of an Addition of Degrees unto them. Now they are Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally the <hi>immediate Work</hi> and product of the Spirit of God in us, as hath been abundantly evinced. And as he first works and creates them, so he <hi>encreaseth</hi> them. Hereby they that are <hi>feeble become as David, Zech.</hi> 12. 8. That is, those whose Graces were weak, whose Faith was infirm, and whose Love was languid, shall by the <hi>supplyes of the Spirit</hi> and the encrease given by him unto them, become strong and vigorous. To this purpose are Promises multiplyed in the Scripture, which in our constant Supplications we principally respect. This is that which the
<hi>School-men</hi> after <hi>Austin</hi> call <hi>Gratiam corroborantem,</hi> that is the working of the Holy Spirit in the encreasing and strengthening of Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. See <hi>Ephes. 3. 16, 17. Col. 1, 10, 11. Isa.</hi> 40. 29. And this is the principal Cause and Means of the <hi>gradual Encrease of Holiness</hi> in us, or the carrying of the Work of Sanctification, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:48389:177"/> (2) There are Graces whose Exercise is more <hi>Occasional</hi> and not alwayes actually necessary as unto the Life of God: That is, it is not necessary that they be alwayes in actual Exercise, as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are to be. With respect unto these Holiness is encreased by the <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of one to another, untill we are brought on several <hi>Occasions</hi> to the Practice and Exercise of them all. For the <hi>Addition</hi> of the new Exercise of any Grace belongs unto the <hi>gradual carrying</hi> on of the Work of Sanctification. And hereunto all things that befall us in this World, all our Circumstances are laid in a subserviency by the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. All our Relations, all our Afflictions, all our Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all our Mercies, all our Enjoyments, all Occurrences are suited to a continual <hi>adding</hi> of the Exercise of one Grace to another where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Holiness is encreased. And if we make not use of them to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, we miss of all the Benefit and Advantage we might have of them, and disappoint what lyes in us the Design of Divine Love and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in them. This is given us in Charge, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7. Besides all this, giving all diligence adde to your Faith Vertue, and to Vertue Knowledge, and to Knowledge Temperance, and to Temperance Patience, and to Patience Godliness, and to Godliness Brotherly-kindness, and to Brotherly-kindness Charity.</hi> The end why this Injunction is given us, is that we may <hi>escape the Corruption that is in the World through Lust,</hi> v. 3. that is have all our Corruptions throughly subdued and our Souls throughly sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. To this end are the Promises given us, and a <hi>Divine</hi> spiritual <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is bestowed upon us. But will that suffice, or is there no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us unto that End? Yes saith the Apostle, this great Work will not be effected, unless you use your <hi>utmost Diligence</hi> and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>adde</hi> the Exercise of all the Graces of the Spirit One to Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Occasion shall require. There is a <hi>Method</hi> in this <hi>Concatenation of Graces</hi> from first to last, and an especial Reason for each particular, or why the Apostle requires that such a Grace should be <hi>added</hi> unto such a one in the Order laid down, which at present I shall not enquire into. But in general he intends that <hi>every Grace</hi> is to be exercised ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its proper season, and especial Occasion. Hereby also is the Work of Sanctification <hi>gradually</hi> carryed on and Holiness encreased. And this <hi>Addition</hi> of one Grace unto another, with the Progress of Holiness thereby, is also from the Holy Ghost. And <hi>three wayes</hi> there are whereby he accomplisheth his Work herein. (1) By Ordering things so towards us, and bringing of us into such <hi>Conditions,</hi> as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Exercise of these Graces shall be required and necessary. All the Afflictions of Tryals which he bringeth the Church into have no other End or Design. So the Apostle <hi>James</hi> expresseth it: <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4. <hi>My Brethren, count it all Joy when ye fall into divers Temptations; knowing this, that the triall of your Faith worketh Patience. But let Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience have its perfect Work, that you may be perfect and entire wanting Nothing.</hi> These Temptations are Trials upon Afflictions, Troubles, Persecutions and the like. But take them in any other sense, it is the same unto our purpose. These are all guided unto us by <hi>Christ</hi> and his
<hi>Spirit;</hi> for it is he who rebukes and chastens us. But what is his End therein? It is that <hi>Faith</hi> may be exercised, and Patience employed, and one Grace <hi>added</hi> unto another that they may carry us on towards Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48389:178"/> So he bringeth us into that Condition as wherein we shall assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly miscarry, if we <hi>adde</hi> not the <hi>Exercise</hi> of one Grace unto another. (2) In this state of things he effectually <hi>minds us of our Duty</hi> and what Graces ought to be put upon their Exercise. We may dispute whether it be better to <hi>Act Faith</hi> or to Despond; to <hi>adde Patience</hi> under the Continuance of our Tryals, or to trust unto our selves and irregularly to seek after Deliverance, or divert unto other satisfactions. Then doth he cause us <hi>to hear a Word behind us saying, this is the way walk in it, when we turn to the right hand, and when we turn to the left,</hi> Isa. 30. 21. When we are at a loss and know not what to doe, and are ready it may be to <hi>consult with flesh and blood</hi> and to divert to irregular courses, he speaks effectually to us, saying, No, that is not your way; but this is it, namely to <hi>Act Faith,</hi> Patience, Submission to God, adding one Grace to another, binding our Hearts thereby to our Duty. (3) He actually excites and sets all needfull Graces at work in the Way and Manner before spoken unto. This then is to be fixed, that all this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Holiness is immediately the Work of the Holy Ghost who therein <hi>gradually</hi> carryes on his Design of sanctifying us throughout in our whole Spirit Souls and Bodies. There is in our Regeneration and Habitual Grace received, a Nature bestowed on us capable of <hi>Growth</hi> and Encrease, and that is all; if it be left unto its self it will not thrive, it will decay and dye. The actual <hi>supplyes</hi> of the Spirit are the <hi>waterings</hi> that are the immediate Cause of its encrease. It wholly depends on continual Influences from God. He cherisheth and improves the work he hath begun with new and fresh supplyes of Grace every moment. <hi>Isa. 27. 3. I the Lord water it every moment.</hi> And it is the Spirit which is this <hi>Water</hi> as the Scripture every where declares. God the Father takes on him the Care in this matter; <hi>he watcheth over his Vineyard to keep it.</hi> The Lord Christ is the Head Fountain and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all actual supplyes: And the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Efficient Cause</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating them unto us from him. From hence it is that any Grace in us is kept alive one Moment, that it is ever acted in one single Duty, that ever it receives the least measure of Encrease or strengthening. With respect unto all these it is that our Apostle saith, <hi>Nevertheless I live, yet not I but Christ liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Spiritual Life and living by it in all the Acts of it are immediately from Christ.</p>
               <p>I concern not my self much how <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> that is no more is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and sustained in the Minds and Lives of men, though I am not ignorant of the Precepts Directions and Instructions which are given unto that End by some of old, and some of late. But for <hi>Grace</hi> and
<hi>Holiness</hi> we have infallible Assurance, that the <hi>Being, Life,</hi> Continuance, and all the Actings of it in any of the Sons of men, depend meerly and only upon their Relation unto that <hi>Spring</hi> and Fountain of all Grace which is in Christ, and the continual Supplyes of it by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit whose Work it is to communicate them, <hi>Col. 3. 3. John 15. 5. Col,</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>There is no man who hath any Grace that is true and saving, that hath any seed, any beginning of Sanctification or Holiness, but that the Holy Spirit by his watchful Care over it, and Supplyes of it, is able to <hi>preserve</hi> it, to <hi>extricate</hi> it from Difficulties, to free it from Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to <hi>encrease</hi> it unto its full measure and perfection. Wherefore
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48389:178"/>
                  <hi>let the hands that hang down be lifted up and the feeble knees be streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened;</hi> we have to do with him who will not <hi>quench the smoking flax not break the bruised reed.</hi> And on the other side, there is none who hath received Grace in such a Measure, nor hath so confirmed it by constant uninterrupted Exercise, as that he can preserve it one Moment, or Act it in any one <hi>Instance</hi> or Duty without the continual Supplyes of new Actual Grace and Help from him, <hi>who worketh in us to will and to doe.</hi> For saith our Lord Christ unto his Apostles and in them to all Believes, the best and strongest of them, <hi>without me ye can do nothing, Joh.</hi> 15. 5. And they who of themselves <hi>can do nothing</hi> that is in a way of living unto God, cannot of themselves preserve Grace, act it, and encrease it, which are the greatest things we doe, or are wrought in us in this World. Wherefore God hath in infinite Wisdom so ordered the Dispensation of his Love and Grace unto Believers, that all of them living upon the <hi>continual supplyes of his Spirit</hi> none may have cause on the one hand to faint or despond, nor Occasion on the other unto self-confidence, or Elation of mind, that so <hi>no flesh may glory in its self, but he that gloryeth may glory in the Lord.</hi> And therefore as he greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth the weak, the fearful, the faint, the disconsolate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and that by the Engagement of all the holy Properties of his Nature in and unto their Assistance, <hi>Isa. 35. 3, 4, 5, 6. Chap.</hi> 40. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. So he warns them who suppose themselves <hi>strong,</hi> steadfast and immovable, <hi>not to be high-minded but fear,</hi> Rom. 11. 20. because the whole issue of things depends on his <hi>Soveraign Supplyes</hi> of Grace. And seeing he hath promised in the Covenant to continue faithfully these Supplyes unto us, there is ground of Faith given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, and Occasion of Presumption administred unto none.</p>

His Divine Power hath given unto us all things that pertain to Life and to Godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to Glory and Vertue; whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the Divine Nature, having escaped the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in the World through lust.</hi> If all things that pertain unto Life and Godliness, among which doubtless is the <hi>Preservation and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease</hi> of Grace, be given unto us by the <hi>power of God;</hi> if from him we
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48389:179"/> receive that <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> by vertue whereof our Corruptions are subdued, then I pray what need is there of any Endeavours of our own? The whole work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> is wrought in us, it seems, and that by the Power of God: We therefore may let it alone, and leave it unto him whose it is, whilest we are negligent, secure and at ease. Nay, saith the Apostle, this is not the use which the Grace of God is to be put unto. The Consideration of it is or ought to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Motive and Encouragement unto <hi>all Diligence</hi> for the Encrease of Holiness in us. For so he addes immediately, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>but also for this cause,</hi> or because of the gracious Operations of the Divine Power in us; <hi>giving all Diligence, adde to your Faith Vertue as before.</hi> These Objectors and this Apostle were very diversly minded in these matters; what they make an insuperable discouragement unto Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in Obedience, that he makes the greatest Motive and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement thereunto. 3. I say from this Consideration, it will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably follow, that we ought continually to <hi>wait and depend on God</hi> for supplyes of his Spirit and Grace, without which we can do nothing: That God is <hi>more the Author</hi> by his Grace of the good we do than we are our selves (<hi>not I, but the Grace of God that was with me</hi>) that we ought to be carefull that by our Negligences and sins we provoke not the Holy Spirit to <hi>with-hold his Aids and Assistances,</hi> and so to leave us to our selves, in which condition we can do nothing that is spiritually Good; These things I say will unavoidably follow on the Doctrine before declared; and if any one be <hi>offended</hi> at them, it is not in our power to tender them Relief.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> I shall close the Discourse on this Subject with some Considerations of that <hi>Similitude</hi> by which the Scripture so frequently represents the
<hi>gradual</hi> Improvement of Grace and Holiness. And this is the <hi>growth of Trees and Plants. Hos. 14. 5, 6. I will be as the dew unto Israel, he shall grow as the Lilly and cast forth his Roots as Lebanon, his branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the Olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.</hi> Isa. 44. 3, 4. <hi>I will pour water on him that is thirsty and stoods upon the dry ground, I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine Off-spring, and they shall spring up as among the grass, as the Willowes by the Water-courses.</hi> And so in other places very many. And we may know that this <hi>Similitude</hi> is singularly instructive, or it would not have been so frequently made use of to this purpose. Some few Instances tending to Administer <hi>Light</hi> in this matter, I shall briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon.</p>
               <p>(1) These <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Plants</hi> have the Principle of their growth in themselves. They do not grow immediately from external adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Aid and Furtherance; they grow from their own <hi>seminal vertue</hi> and radical Moysture. It is no otherwise in the Progress of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Holiness. It hath a <hi>Root,</hi> a <hi>Seed,</hi> a <hi>Principle</hi> of Growth and Encrease in the Soul of him that is sanctified. All Grace is <hi>immortal</hi> Seed, and contains in it a living growing Principle. That which hath not in its self a Life and power of Growth is not Grace. And therefore what Dutyes soever any men do perform, whereunto they are either guided by Natural Light, or which they are urged unto by <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> from the Word, if they proceed not from a Principle of Spiritual
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48389:179"/> Life in the Heart, they are no <hi>fruits</hi> of Holiness nor do belong there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. The Water of Grace which is from Christ, is a <hi>Well of Water springing up unto Everlasting Life</hi> in them on whom it is bestowed.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14. It is therefore of the Nature of Holiness to thrive and grow, as it is of a <hi>Tree</hi> or Plant that have their <hi>seminal Vertue</hi> in themselves after their kind.</p>
               <p>(2) A Tree or Plant must be <hi>watered</hi> from above or it will not thrive and grow by vertue of its own <hi>seminal</hi> power. If a Drowth cometh it will wither or decay. Wherefore, where God mentioneth this growth he ascribes it unto his <hi>watering.</hi> I will be <hi>as the Dew,</hi> and I will <hi>pour water,</hi> is the especial Cause of it. It is so in this carrying on of Holiness. There is a Nature received capable of <hi>Increase</hi> and growth; but if it be left unto its self it will not <hi>thrive,</hi> it will decay and dye. Wherefore God is unto it as the <hi>Dew,</hi> and <hi>pours water</hi> on it by the actual supplyes of the Spirit, as we have shewed before.</p>
               <p>(3) The <hi>growth of Trees and Plants</hi> is secret and <hi>imperceptible;</hi> nor is discerned but in the Effects and Consequences of it. The most watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Eye can discern little of its motion. <hi>Crescit Occulto velut arbor avo:</hi> It is no otherwise in the <hi>progress</hi> of Holiness. It is not immediately discernible either by themselves in whom it is, or by others that make Observation of it. It lyes only under the Eye of him by whom it is wrought: Only by the <hi>Fruits and Effects</hi> of it is made manifest. And some indeed, especially in some seasons, do plainly and evidently
<hi>thrive and grow,</hi> springing up like the <hi>Willowes by the Water-courses.</hi> Though their growth in its self is indiscernible, yet it is plain they have grown. Such we ought all to be. The growth of some I say is manifest on every Triall, on every occasion; their profiting is visible to all. And as some say that the growth of <hi>Plants</hi> is not by a constant insensible progress, but they encrease by suddain <hi>Gusts and Motions,</hi> which may sometimes be discerned in the <hi>Openings of Budds and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> so the growth of Believers consists principally in some intense
<hi>vigorous actings of Grace</hi> on great Occasions; as of Faith, Love, <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> Self-denial, Bounty. And he who hath not some <hi>Experience</hi> of such actings of Grace in especial Instances, can have little Evidence of his Growth. Again there are <hi>Trees and Plants</hi> that have the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Life and Growth in them, but yet are so withering and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifty that you can only discern them to be alive. And so it is with too many Believers: They are all <hi>Trees planted in the Garden of God,</hi> some thrive, some decay for a season, but the <hi>growth of the best is secret.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> From what hath been proved it is evident that the work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is a <hi>progressive</hi> Work, that Holiness is gradually carryed on in us by it towards Perfection. It is neither wrought nor compleated at <hi>once</hi> in us as is Regeneration; nor doth it cease under any Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or in any Condition of Life, but is thriving and carryed on. A River continually fed by a Living Fountain may as soon end its streams before it come to the Ocean, as a stop be put to the Course and Progress of Grace before it issues in Glory. <hi>For the path of the Just is as the shining Light, that shineth more and more to the perfect day, Prov.</hi> 4. 18. So is their <hi>Path</hi> wherein they are led and conducted
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48389:180"/> by the Holy Spirit, even as the <hi>Morning Light</hi> which after it once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, thought it may be sometimes clouded, yet faileth not untill it arrive unto its Perfection. And as the Wisdom, Patience, Faithfulness and Power which the Holy Spirit of God exerciseth herein are <hi>unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable,</hi> so are they constantly <hi>admired</hi> by all that are interested in them: So are they by the <hi>Psalmist, Psal. 66. 8, 9. Psal.</hi> 31. 17. Who is there who hath made any diligent Observation of his own Heart and Wayes, and what have been the workings of the Grace of God in him and towards him to bring him unto the Stature and Measure whereunto he is arrived, that doth not admire the watchful Care and powerfull workings of the Spirit of God therein? The Principle of our Holiness as in us is weak and infirm, because it is in us; in some to so low a Degree as is oft-times unto themselves imperceptible. This he <hi>preserves</hi> and Cherisheth that it shall not be overpowered by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and Temptations. Among all the glorious works of God, next unto that of Redemption by Jesus Christ, my Soul doth most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire this of the Spirit in preserving the Seed and Principle of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in us, as a spark of living Fire in the midst of the Ocean, against all Corruptions and Temptations wherewith it is impugned. Many
<hi>Breaches</hi> are made in and upon our Course of Obedience by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions of Actual sins, these he cures and makes up, healing our back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings and repairing our Decayes. And he <hi>acts the Grace</hi> we have received by constant fresh Supplyes. He wants much of the Comfort and Joy of a <hi>Spiritual Life,</hi> who doth not diligently observe the Wayes and Means whereby it is preserved and promoted. And it is no small part of our sin and folly when we are negligent herein.</p>
               <p>All Believers are no doubt in some measure convinced hereof, not only from the Testimonies given unto it in the Scripture, but also from their own Experience. And there is nothing in themselves which they may more distinctly learn it from, than the Nature and Course of their Prayers, with the workings of their Hearts, Minds and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in them. Let profane Persons deride it whilest they please, it is the Spirit of God as a Spirit of Grace that enables Believers to <hi>pray</hi> and make Intercession according to the mind of God. And herein as he is the <hi>Spirit of Supplications,</hi> he copyeth out and expresseth what he worketh in them as the Spirit of <hi>Sanctification.</hi> In teaching us to
<hi>pray,</hi> he teacheth us what and how he worketh in us. And if we wisely consider his working <hi>in</hi> our Hearts by <hi>Prayer,</hi> we may understand much of his working <hi>upon</hi> our Hearts by <hi>Grace.</hi> It is said, that he who
<hi>searcheth the Hearts,</hi> that is God himself, <hi>knoweth the mind of the Spirit in the Intercessions he worketh in us, Rom.</hi> 8. 27. There are secret pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Operations of the Spirit in Prayer, that are discernible only to the great searcher of Hearts. But we also ought to enquire and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve so far as we may, what he leads us unto and guides us about, which is plainly his work in us. I do not think that the Spirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Supplications in us by an immediate, supernatural, Divine <hi>Afflatus</hi> so as he inspired the <hi>Prophets</hi> of old, who oft-times understood not the things uttered by themselves, but enquired afterwards diligently into them. But I do say, (let the proud carnal World despise it whilest they please, and at their peril) that the Spirit of God doth graciously in the Prayers of Believers carry out and act their Souls and Minds in
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48389:180"/> Desires and Requests which for the matter of them are far above their natural Contrivances and Invention. And he who hath not Experience hereof is a greater stranger unto these things than will at length be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Advantage. By a diligent Observance hereof we may know of what kind and nature the work of the Holy Ghost in us is, and how it is carryed on. For how in general doth the Holy Spirit teach us and enable us to pray? It is by these three things. (1) By giving us a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Insight</hi> into the Promises of God and the Grace of the Covenant, whereby we know what to ask upon a spiritual view of the Mercy and Grace that God hath prepared for us. (2) By acquainting us with and giving us an <hi>Experience</hi> of our wants with a deep sense of them, such as we cannot bear without Relief. (3) By <hi>Creating</hi> and stirring up desires in the <hi>new Creature</hi> for its own Preservation Encrease and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. And in Answer unto these things consisteth his whole work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> in us. For it is his effectual Communication unto us of the Grace and Mercy prepared in the Promises of the Covenant through Jesus Christ; hereby doth he supply our spiritual wants, and sets the new Creature in Life and Vigour. So are our Prayers an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and Copy of the Work of the Holy Spirit in us given us by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And therefore by whomsoever he is despised as a Spirit of <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> he is so as a Spirit of Sanctification also. Now consider what it is that in your Prayers you most labour about? Is it not that the Body, the Power, the whole Interest of Sin in you may be weakened, subdued, and at length destroyed? Is it not that all the Graces of the Spirit may be renewed daily, encreased and strengthened, so as that you may be more ready and prepared for all Dutyes of Obedience? And what is all this but that Holiness may be gradually Progressive in your Souls, that it may be carryed on by new Supplyes and Additions of Grace, untill it come to Perfection?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> It will be said perhaps by some that they find neither in themselves nor others, by the best of their Observation, that the Work of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is constantly <hi>Progressive,</hi> or that Holiness doth so grow and thrive wherever it is in sincerity. For as for themselves they have found Grace more <hi>vigorous</hi> active and flourishing in former dayes than of late; the streams of it were fresher and stronger at the <hi>Spring of Conversion</hi> than since they find them to be in their Course. Hence are those complaints among many of their <hi>Leanness,</hi> their <hi>Weakness,</hi> their
<hi>Deadness,</hi> their <hi>Barrenness.</hi> Nor were many of the Saints in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without such Complaints. And many may cry, <hi>Oh that it were with us as in our former Dayes, in the dayes of our youth!</hi> Complaints of this nature do every where abound, and some are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude upon this Consideration, that either sincere Holiness is not so growing and <hi>progressive</hi> as is pretended, or that indeed they have no interest therein. Yea the like may be said upon a diligent Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, Churches and single Professors; what Evidence do they give, that the work of Holiness is thriving in them? doth it not appear rather to be <hi>Retrograde</hi> and under a constant Decay?</p>
               <p>I shall so far consider and remove this <hi>Objection,</hi> as that the Truth which we have asserted suffer not from it, and so be left as an empty Notion; nor yet those altogether discouraged who come not up unto a
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48389:181"/> full compliance with it. And this I shall doe in the ensuing Rules and Observations.</p>
               <p>(1) <hi>It is one thing what Grace or Holiness is suited unto in its own nature, and what is the Ordinary or Regular way of the procedure of the Spirit in the work of Sanctification according to the tenour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; Another what may occasionally fall out by Indisposition and Irregularity or any other obstructing Interposition in them in whom the work is wrought.</hi> Under the first Consideration the Work is
<hi>thriving</hi> and <hi>progressive,</hi> in the latter the Rule is liable to sundry Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. A Child that hath a Principle of Life, a good natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and suitable food, will <hi>grow</hi> and thrive. But that which hath Obstructions from within, or Distempers and Diseases, or Falls and Bruises, may be weak and thriftless. When we are Regenerate we are as <hi>New-born Babes,</hi> and ordinarily if we have the <hi>sincere milk of the Word</hi> we shall <hi>grow thereby.</hi> But if we our selves give way to Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Corruptions, Negligences, Conformity to the World, is it any wonder if we are lifeless and thriftless? It suffices to confirm the Truth of what we have asserted, that every one in whom is a Principle of spiritual Life, who is <hi>born of God,</hi> in whom the work of Sanctification is begun, if it be not gradually carryed on in him, if he thrive not in Grace and Holiness, if he go not from <hi>strength to strength,</hi> it is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily from his own sinfull Negligence and Indulgence unto carnal Lusts, or Love of this present World. Considering the time we have had and the Means we have enjoyed, what grown, what flourishing Plants in Faith, Love, Purity, Self-denial, and universal Conformity to Christ might many of us have been, who now are weak, withering, fruitless and sapless, scarce to be distinguished from the <hi>thorns and bryars</hi> of the world? It is time for us rather to be <hi>casting off every weight</hi> and the sin that doth so easily beset us, to be by all means stirring up our selves unto a vigorous Recovery of our first Faith and Love with an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant growth in them, than to be <hi>complaining</hi> that the work of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness doth not go on, and that before our wounds become incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>(2) <hi>It is one thing to have Holiness really thriving in any Soul, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that Soul to know it and to be satisfied in it; and these things may be separated;</hi> whereof there are many Reasons. But before I name them I must premise one necessary Observation; and that is, Whereas this <hi>Rule</hi> is proposed for the Relief of such as are at a loss about their Condition, and know not whether Holiness be thriving in them or no, that these have no concernment herein, who may at any time if they please give themselves an Account how matters goe with them and on what grounds. For if men do indulge unto any <hi>predominant Lust,</hi> if they live in the neglect of any <hi>known Duty,</hi> or the practice of any <hi>way of Deceit,</hi> if they suffer the World to devour the choycest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of their Souls, and <hi>Formality</hi> to eat out the Spirit Vigour and Life of Holy Dutyes, or any of these in a <hi>remarkable manner,</hi> I have nothing to offer unto them to manifest that Holiness <hi>may thrive</hi> in them although they discern it not. For undoubtedly it doth not do so, nor are they to entertain any hopes but that whilest they abide in such a Condition, it will decay more and more. Such are to be awaked with <hi>violence</hi> like men falling into a deadly <hi>Lethargy,</hi> to be snatched
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:48389:181"/> as brands out of the Fire, to be warned to recover their first Faith and Love, to repent and doe their first works, lest their End should be darkness and sorrow for evermore. But as unto those who walk with God humbly and in sincerity, there may be sundry Reasons given whence it is that Holiness may be <hi>thriving in them,</hi> and yet not be
<hi>discerned by them</hi> so to be. And therefore though Holiness be wrought within our selves and only there, yet there may be seasons wherein sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere humble Believers may be obliged to <hi>believe</hi> the encrease and growth of it in them when they perceive it not, so as to be sensible of it. For (1) It being the Subject of so may Gospel-Promises it is a proper Object of Faith, or a thing that is to be believed. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are God's Explanations of the Grace of the Covenant, both as to its nature and the manner of its Operation. And they do not abound in any concernment of it more than this, that those who are partakers of it <hi>shall thrive and grow</hi> thereby. With what Limitations they are bounded, and what is required on our part that we may have them fulfilled towards us, shall be afterwards declared. But their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment depends on God's Faithfulness and not on our sence of it. Where therefore we do not openly lay an Obstruction against it, as in the case now mentioned, we may, we ought to believe that they are fulfilled towards us, although we are not continually <hi>sensible</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And (2) It is our Duty to grow and thrive in Holiness. And what God requires of us, we are to believe that he will help us in, and doth so, whatever be our own present sence and Apprehension. And he who on these grounds can believe the growth of Holiness in himself, though he have no sensible Experience thereof, is in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in as <hi>Good,</hi> and perhaps a more <hi>safe</hi> Condition than he who through the vigorous working of Spiritual Affections is most <hi>sensible</hi> thereof. For it is certain, that such a one doth not by any wilfull Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or Indulgence unto any sin, obstruct the growth of Holiness; for he that doth so cannot believe that it doth thrive in him, or is carried on, whatever his Presumptions may be. And the Life of Faith whereof this is a part is every way a <hi>safe</hi> Life. Besides, such a Person is not in that Danger of a vain Elation of mind, and Carelesness thereon, as others may be. For wherein we live by Faith and not at all by Sense we will be humble and fear alwayes: Such a one not finding in himself the Evidence of what he most desires, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually carefull that he drive it not further from him. But the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of this Difficulty are:</p>
               <p>1. The Work it self, as hath been before declared at large, is <hi>secret and mysterious;</hi> And therefore as in some, I hope in many, there is the <hi>Reality</hi> and Essence of Holiness who yet can find nothing of it in themselves, nor perhaps any one else, but only Jesus Christ who is of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord; so it may in the same <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret manner thrive</hi> as to its degrees in them who yet perceive it not. There is not any thing in our whole Course that we ought to be more awake unto, than a diligent Observation of the <hi>Progress</hi> and <hi>Decayes</hi> of Grace; for as the knowledge of them is of the same importance unto us with that of our Dutyes, and Comforts, so they are very hardly and difficultly to be discerned; nor will be so truely for our Good and Advantage, without our utmost Diligence and Spiritual
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48389:182"/> Wisdom in their Observation. Hence, as we before observed, it is compared in the Scripture frequently unto the growth of <hi>Plants and Trees; Hos. 14. 5, 6. Isa.</hi> 44. 3, 4. Now we know that in those of them which are the most thrifty and flourishing, though we may perceive they are grown, yet we cannot discern their growing. And the Apostle tells us, that as the <hi>outward man perisheth</hi> so the <hi>inward man is renewed day by day, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 16. The perishing of the Outward man is by those natural Decayes whereby it continually tends unto Death and Dissolution. And we know many of us how hardly these insensible Decayes are discerned: Unless some great and violent disease befall us, we rather know that we are enfeebled and weakened by Age and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, than perceive when or how. So is the Inward man renewed in Grace. It is by such secret Wayes and Means as that its Growth and Decayes are hardly to be apprehended. And yet he who is negligent in this Enquiry walks at <hi>all peradventures with God,</hi> knowes not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about he is in his way, whether he be nearer or further off from his Journeys End, than he was before. Write that man a <hi>fruitless</hi> and a <hi>thriftless</hi> Christian, who calls not himself to an Account about his Encreases and Decayes in Grace. <hi>David</hi> knew this work to be of so great Importance as that he would not trust to himself and ordinary Assistances for the discharge of it, but earnestly calls in God to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it for him, and to acquaint him with it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>2. There may be some <hi>perplexing Temptations</hi> befall the Mind of a Believer, or some Corruption take advantage to break loose for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it may be for a long season, which may much gall the Soul with its suggestions, and so trouble disturb and unquiet it, as that it shall not be able to make a right Judgment of its Grace and Progress in Holiness. A Ship may be so <hi>tossed</hi> in a storm at Sea as that the most skilfull Mariners may not be able to discern whether they make any way in their intended Course and Voyage, whilest they are carryed on with Success and speed. In such cases Grace in its Exercise is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally engaged in an Opposition unto its <hi>Enemy</hi> which it hath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict withall; and so its thriving other wayes is not discernible. If it should be enquired, how we may discern when Grace is exercised and thrives in <hi>Opposition</hi> unto Corruptions and Temptations; I say, that as great Winds and Storms do sometimes contribute to the <hi>Fruit-bearing</hi> of Trees and Plants, so do Corruptions and Temptations unto the Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Grace and Holiness. The wind comes with violence on the Tree, ruffles its boughs, it may be breaks some of them, beats off its Budds, looseneth and shaketh its Roots, and threatens to cast the whole to the ground: But by this means the Earth is opened and loosed about it, and the Tree gets its Roots deeper into the Earth, whereby it receives more and fresh nourishment, which renders it fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, though it bring not forth Fruit visibly it may be not till a good while after. In the Assaults of Temptations and Corruptions, the Soul is wofully <hi>ruffled</hi> and disordered, its <hi>Leaves</hi> of Profession are much blasted, and its beginnings of Fruit-bearing much broken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded; but in the mean-time it secretly and invisibly casts out its roots of <hi>Humility,</hi> Self-abasement, Mourning, in hidden and continual labouring of Faith and Love after that Grace whereby Holiness doth really increase, and way is made for future visible Fruitfulness. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:48389:182"/> 3. God who in Infinite Wisdom manageth the New Creature or whole Life of Grace by his Spirit, doth so turn the <hi>streams</hi> of it, and so renew and change the especial kinds of its Operations, as that we cannot easily trace his paths therein, and may therefore be often at a loss about it, as not knowing well what He is doing with us. For Instance, it may be the Work of Grace and Holiness hath greatly put forth and evidenced it self in the <hi>Affections</hi> which are renewed by it. Hence Persons have great Experience of Readiness unto, Delight and Chearfulness in Holy Duties, especially those of Immediate Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with God. For Affections are quick and vigorous for the most part in the Youth of Profession: And the Operations of them being sensible unto them in whom they are, and their Fruits visible, they make Persons seem alwayes <hi>fresh and green</hi> in the wayes of Holiness. But it may be after a while it seems good to the Soveraign Disposer of this Affair to turn as it were the streams of Grace and Holiness into another Channel. He sees that the Exercise of <hi>Humility, Godly Sorrow, Fear, diligent Conflicting</hi> with Temptations, that it may be strike at the very root of Faith and Love, are more needfull for them. He will therefore so order his Dispensations towards them, by <hi>Afflictions, Temptations,</hi> Occasions of Life in the world, as that they shall have new work to doe, and all the Grace they have be turned into a new Exercise. Hereon it may be they find not that sensible vigour in their Spiritual <hi>Affections,</hi> nor that Delight in Spiritual Duties, which they have done formerly. This makes them sometimes ready to conclude that Grace is <hi>decayed</hi> in them, that the Springs of Holiness are drying up, and they know neither where nor what they are. But yet it may be the real Work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> is still thriving and effectually car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on in them.</p>
               <p>(3<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi>) It is acknowledged that there may be, that there are in many great <hi>Decayes</hi> in Grace and Holiness; that the work of Sanctification goeth back in them, and that, it may be, universally and for a long season. Many Actings of Grace are lost in such Persons, and the things that remain are ready to dye. This the Scripture abundantly testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth unto, and giveth us instances of. How often doth God charge his People with <hi>Back-sliding, Barrenness, Decayes</hi> in Faith and Love? And the Experience of the Dayes wherein we live sufficiently confirm the Truth of it. Are there not open and visible Decayes in many, as to the whole Spirit, all the Dutyes and Fruits of Holiness? Cannot the best among us contribute somewhat to the Evidence hereof from our own Experience? What shall we say then, is there no sincere Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness where such Decayes are found? God forbid; But we must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Reasons whence this comes to pass, seeing this is contrary to the gradual Progress of Holiness in them that are sanctified, which we have Asserted. And I answer two things unto it:</p>
               <p>1. That these Decayes are <hi>Occasional and Preternatural,</hi> as to the true Nature and Constitution of the New Creature, and a disturbance of the Ordinary Work of Grace. They are <hi>Diseases</hi> in our spiritual State, which it is not to be measured by. Are you dead and cold in Duties, backward in Good Works, careless of your Hearts and Thoughts, addicted to the World? These things belong not to the
<hi>State of Sanctification</hi> but are Enemies unto it, Sicknesses and Diseases
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48389:183"/> in the Spiritual Constitution of the Persons in whom they are.</p>
               <p>2. Although our Sanctification and Growth in Holiness be a Work of the Holy Spirit, as the Efficient Cause thereof, yet is it our own Work also in a way of <hi>Duty.</hi> He hath prescribed unto us what shall be our part, what he expects from us, and requireth of us that the Work may be regularly carryed on unto Perfection, as was before declared. And there are two sorts of things which if we attend not unto in a due Manner, the orderly progress of it will be obstructed and retarded. For</p>
               <p>(1) The Power and Growth of any Lust or Corruption and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance from them with Temptations which is inseparable from the prevalency of any sin in us, lyes directly against this Progress. If we allow or approve of any such thing in us, if we indulge unto any actings of sin, especially when known and grown frequent, in any one kind, when we neglect the use of the best Means for the constant
<hi>Mortification of sin,</hi> which every enlightened Soul understands to be necessary thereunto, there is and will be encreased an universal <hi>decay</hi> in Holiness, and not only in that particular Corruption which is so spared and indulged. A <hi>Disease</hi> in any one of the <hi>Vitals</hi> or principal parts of the Body weakens not only the part wherein it is, but the whole Body it self and vitiates the whole Constitution by a <hi>sympathy</hi> of parts. And any particular Lust indulged unto, vitiates the whole Spiritual Health, and weakens the Soul in all Duties of Obedience.</p>
               <p>(2) There are some things required of us to this End, that Holiness may thrive and be carryed on in us. Such are the constant use of all Ordinances and Means appointed unto that End, a due Observance of Commanded Duties in their Season, with a Readiness for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of every especial Grace in its proper circumstances. Now if we neglect these things, if we walk at all <hi>peradventures</hi> with God, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither to Means nor Dutyes, nor the Exercise of Grace as we should, we are not to wonder if we find our selves Decaying, yea ready to dye. Doth any man wonder to see a person formerly of a sound Constitution grown weak and sickly, if he <hi>openly</hi> neglect all Means of health, and contract all sorts of Diseases by his Intemperance? Is it strange that a Nation should be sick and faint at heart, that <hi>Grey-hairs</hi> should be sprinkled upon it, that it should be poor and decaying, whilest Consuming Lusts with a strange Neglect of all envigorating Means do prevail in it? No more is it that a Professing people should decay in Holy Obedience whilest they abide in the Neglects expressed.</p>
               <p>Having vindicated this Assertion, I shall yet adde a little further Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it. And</p>
               <p>1. If the Work of Holiness be such a Progressive thriving Work in its own nature, if the Design of the Holy Ghost in the use of Means be to carry it on in us and encrease it more and more unto a perfect Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, then is our Diligence still to be continued to the same End and Purpose. For hereon depends our growth and thriving. It is required of us that we give <hi>all Diligence</hi> unto the Encrease of Grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. and that we abound therein, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 7. abounding in all Diligence;</hi> and not only so, but that we shew the <hi>same Diligence unto the End, Heb.</hi> 6. 11. Whetever Diligence you have used in the attaining or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of Holiness, abide in it unto the End, or we cast our selves
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:48389:183"/> under Decayes, and endanger our Souls. If we slack or give over as to our <hi>Duty,</hi> the Work of Sanctification will not be carryed on in a way of <hi>Grace.</hi> And this is required of us, this is expected from us, that our whole Lives be spent in a Course of <hi>diligent Complyance</hi> with the Progressive Work of Grace in us. There are three Grounds on which men doe or may neglect this Duty whereon the Life of their Obedience and all their Comforts do depend.</p>
               <p>(1) A Presumption or Groundless Perswasion that they are <hi>already perfect.</hi> This some pretend unto in a proud and foolish Conceit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of the whole Nature and Duty of Evangelical Holiness or Obedience. For this on our parts consists in our <hi>willing Complyance</hi> with the Work of Grace <hi>gradually</hi> carryed on unto the measure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto us. If this be already attained, there is an End of <hi>all Evangelical Obedience,</hi> and men return again to the Law unto their Ruine. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14. It is an excellent Description of the Nature of our Obedience which the Apostle gives us in that place. All Absolute Perfection in this Life is rejected as unattainable. The End proposed is Blessedness and Glory with the Eternal Enjoyment of God, and the Way whereby we press towards it which comprizeth the whole of our Obedience, is by continual uninterrupted <hi>following after, pressing, reaching</hi> out, a constant Progress, in and by our utmost Diligence.</p>
               <p>(2) A foolish Supposition that being interested in a state of Grace, we need not now be so solicitous about exact Holiness and Obedience in all things as we were formerly whilest our minds hung in suspense about our Condition. But so much as any one hath this Apprehension or Perswasion prevailing in him, or influencing of him, so much hath he cause deeply to question whether he have yet any thing of Grace or Holiness or no. For this <hi>Perswasion is not of him who hath called us.</hi> There is not a more effectual Engine in the hand of Sathan either to keep us off from Holiness, or to stifle it when it is attained, nor can any thoughts arise in the Hearts of men more opposite to the nature of Grace; For which cause the Apostle rejects it with Detestation:
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>(3) Weariness and Despondencies arising from Oppositions. Some find so much <hi>difficulty</hi> in, and <hi>Opposition</hi> to the Work of Holiness and its Progress, from the Power of Corruptions, Temptations, and the Occasions of Life in this World, that they are ready to faint and give over this Diligence in Dutyes and Contending against Sin. But the Scripture doth so abound with Encouragements unto this sort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as we need not to insist thereon.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> THat which we are next to enquire into is the <hi>personal Subject</hi> of this Work of Sanctification; or who and of what sort those Persons are that are made <hi>Holy.</hi> Now these are <hi>All and Only Believers.</hi> All who unseignedly believe in God through Jesus Christ are sanctified, and no other. Unto them is <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> confined. It is for them and them only that our Saviour prayes for this Mercy Grace or Priviledge; <hi>Joh. 17. 17. Sanctifie them by thy Truth;</hi> And concerning them he affirms, <hi>for their sakes I sanctifie my self, that they also may be sanctified through the Truth;</hi> v. 19. And whereas in the Verses foregoing he had immediate Respect unto his Apostles and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Disciples, that we may know that neither his Prayer nor this Grace are confined or limited unto them, he addes, <hi>Neither pray I for these alone,</hi> that is in this Manner, and for these Ends, <hi>but for them also which shall believe on me through their World,</hi> v. 20. It was therefore the Prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ that all Believers should be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and so also was it his Promise; <hi>John 7. 38, 39. He that believeth on me as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall slow rivers of living water; But this he spake of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive.</hi> And it is with respect principally unto this Work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication that he is compared unto flowing and living Water as hath been declared before: It is for <hi>Believers,</hi> the <hi>Church that was in God the Father and in Jesus Christ,</hi> that is by Faith, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 1. that our Apostle prayes, that <hi>the God of Peace would sanctifie them throughout,</hi> chap. 5. 23.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> But before we proced to a further Confirmation of this Assertion, an <hi>Objection</hi> of some importance is to be removed out of our way. For on this Supposition that the Spirit of Sanctification is given only unto <hi>Believers,</hi> it may be enquired, How men come so to be. For if we have not the <hi>Spirit</hi> untill after we do Believe, then is Faith it self
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48389:184"/> of our selves. And this is that which some plead for; namely, that the Gift of the Holy Ghost unto all Ends and Purposes for which he is promised, is <hi>consequential</hi> unto Faith with the Profession and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereof, being as it were its Reward. See <hi>Crell. de Sp. S. cap.</hi> 5. To this purpose it is pleaded, that the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> encourageth men unto Faith and Repentance with the Promise that thereon they should
<hi>receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 2. 38. And so is that also of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 14. 17. that the <hi>World,</hi> that is Unbelievers <hi>cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit of Truth;</hi> so that our Faith and Obedience is required as a necessary Qualification unto the receiving of the Holy Ghost; and if they are so absolutely, then are they of <hi>our selves</hi> and not wrought in us by the Grace of God, which is express <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I could dwell long on this Enquiry concerning the especial Subject of the Holy Spirit, seeing the right understanding of many places of Scripture doth depend thereon. But because I have much work yet before me, I will reduce what I have to offer on this Head into as narrow a Compass as possibly I may. In Answer therefore to this Objection I say:</p>
               <p>1. That the Holy Spirit is said to be promised and received with respect unto the Ends which he is promised for, and the Effects which he worketh when he is received. For although he be himself but one,
<hi>the one and self-same Spirit,</hi> and he <hi>Himself</hi> is promised, given forth and received as we have declared, yet he hath many and <hi>divers Operations.</hi> And as his Operations are <hi>divers,</hi> or several sorts and kinds, so our receiving of him as to the Manner of it is <hi>divers</hi> also, and suited unto the Ends of his Communications unto us. Thus in some sence he is promised unto and received by <hi>Believers,</hi> in another he is promised and received to make men so, or to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. In the first way there may be some Activity of Faith in a way of <hi>Duty,</hi> whereas in the latter, we are <hi>passive,</hi> and receive him only in a way of <hi>Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> 2. The chief and principal Ends for which the Holy Spirit is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and received may be reduced to these <hi>Four</hi> Heads. (1) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> (2) <hi>Sanctification,</hi> (3) <hi>Consolation,</hi> (4) <hi>Edification.</hi> There are indeed very many distinct Operations and Distributions of the Spirit, as I have in part already discovered, and shall yet further go over them in particular Instances. But they may be reduced unto these general Heads, or at least they will suffice to exemplifie the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Manner and Ends of the receiving of the Spirit. And this is the plain Order and Method of these things, as the Scripture both plainly and plentifully testifies. (1) He is promised and received as to the Work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> unto the <hi>Elect;</hi> (2) as to the Work of <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> unto the <hi>Regenerate;</hi> (3) as to the Work of <hi>Consolation</hi> unto the
<hi>Sanctified;</hi> and (4) as unto Gifts for <hi>Edification</hi> unto <hi>Professors,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Soveraign Will and Pleasure.</p>
               <p>(1) He is promised unto the <hi>Elect</hi> and received by them as to his Work of <hi>Regeneration.</hi> That this is his Work in us wholly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, I have proved before at large. Hereunto the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of Faith and Obedience are no way required as previously necessary
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48389:185"/> in us. In order of Nature our receiving of the Spirit is antecedent to the very <hi>Seed</hi> and Principle of Faith in us, as the Cause is to the Effect, seeing it is wrought in us by him alone; and the Promises con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Communications of the Spirit unto this End have been before explained and vindicated. Hereby doth Holy Ghost pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare an <hi>Habitation</hi> for himself, and make way for all the following Work which he hath to do in us and towards us unto the Glory of God, and the perfecting of our Salvation, or the making of us <hi>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</hi> Col. 1. 12.</p>
               <p>(2) He is promised and received as a Spirit of <hi>Sanctification</hi> unto and by them that are <hi>Regenerate;</hi> That is unto Believers and onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. This will be fully confirmed immediately. And this puts an Issue to the principall difficulty of the foregoing objection. It is no way inconsistent that Faith should be required previously unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Spirit as a Spirit of <hi>Sanctification;</hi> though it be not so as he is the Author of <hi>Regeneration.</hi> The same Spirit first worketh Faith in us, and then preserveth it when it is wrought. Only to clear the Manner of it we may observe. 1. That Sanctification may be considered two wayes. (1) As to the Original and essential Work of it, which consists in the preservation of the Principle of <hi>spiritual Life</hi> and Holiness communicated unto us in our Regeneration. (2) As to those renewed Actual Operations whereby it is carried on, and is gradually progressive as hath been declared. 2. Faith also or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving may be considered in this matter two wayes. (1) As to its Original Communication Infusion or Creation in the Soul, for it is the <hi>gift or work of God.</hi> In this respect, that is, as to the <hi>Seed, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and <hi>Habit</hi> of it, it is wrought in us, as all other Grace is, in Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. (2) As to its actings in us, or as unto <hi>Actual Believing</hi> or the Exercise of Faith and the Fruits of it, in a constant Profession and Holy Obedience. Sanctification in the first sence respects Faith also in the first. That is, the Preservation of the Seed, Principle, Grace, Habit of Faith in us, belongs unto the Sanctifying Work of the Holy Spirit. And so Believers only are sanctified. And in the latter sence it respects Faith in the latter also; That is, the progress of the Work of Sanctification in us is accompanyed with the Actings and Exercise of Faith. But both wayes Faith is a <hi>necessary Qualification</hi> in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that are sanctified. Believers therefore are the Adequate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Work of Sanctification, which is all that at present is under our Consideration.</p>
               <p>(3) The Spirit is also promised as a <hi>Comforter,</hi> or as a Spirit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation. In this sence or for this End and Work, he is not promised unto them that are <hi>Regenerate</hi> meerly as such. For many may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate who are not capable of Consolation, nor do need it; as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants who may be and are many of them sanctified from the Womb. Nor is he so promised unto them that are <hi>Believers absolutely,</hi> who have the Grace or Habit of Faith wrought in them; for so many have who are not yet exercised, nor brought into that Condition wherein Spiritual Consolations are either proper or needfull unto them. The Spirit is promised as a Comforter unto Believers, as engaged in the Profession of the Gospel, and meeting with Conflicts inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on the Account thereof. The first Promise of the Holy Ghost
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48389:185"/> as a <hi>Comforter</hi> was made to the Disciples when their <hi>Hearts were filled with sorrow</hi> on the departure of Christ; and this is the Measure of all others, <hi>John</hi> 16. 7. And this is evident both from the Nature of the thing it self, and from all the Promises which are given concerning him to this End and Purpose. And it will be wholly in vain at any time to apply spiritual Consolations unto any other sort of Persons. All men who have any interest in Christian Religion, when they fall into Troubles and Distresses be they of what sort they will, are ready to enquire after the things that may relieve and refresh them. And whereas there are many things in the Word suited unto the Relief and Consolation of the distressed, they are apt to apply them unto themselves, and others also are ready to comply with them in the same Charitable Office as they suppose. But no true Spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation was ever administred by the Word unto any but <hi>Exercised Believers,</hi> however the Minds of men may be for the present a little relieved, and their Affections refreshed by the things that are spoken unto them out of the Word. For the Word is the Instrument of the Holy Ghost; nor hath it any Efficacy but as he is pleased to use it and apply it. And he useth it unto this End and unto no other, as being promised as a Spirit of Consolation only to sanctified Believers. And therefore when Persons fall under spiritual Convictions and Trouble of Mind or Conscience upon the Account of Sin and Guilt, it is not our first work to tender Consolation unto them, whereby many in that Condition are deluded, but to lead them on to Believing, that being justified by Faith they may have peace with God, which is their proper Relief. And in that state God is abundantly willing that they should receive strong Consolation, even as many as fly for Refuge to <hi>the Hope that is set before them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(4) The Spirit of God is promised and received as to <hi>Gifts</hi> for the
<hi>Edification</hi> of the Church. This is that which is intended, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. And his whole Work herein we shall consider in its proper place. The Rule and Measure of the Communication of the Spirit for <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> is Election. The Rule and Measure of the Communication of the Spirit for <hi>Sanctification</hi> is Regeneration. And the Rule and Measure of his Communication as a Spirit of <hi>Consolation,</hi> is Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, with the Afflictions, Temptations and Troubles of them that are sanctified; What then is the Rule and Measure of his Communication as a Spirit of <hi>Edification?</hi> I answer; <hi>Profession</hi> of the Truth of the Gospel and its Worship, with a Call unto the <hi>benefiting</hi> of others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. And here two Rules must be observed. (1) That he carryes not his Gifts for Edification out of the <hi>Pale of the Church,</hi> or Profession of the Truth and Worship of the Gospel. (2) That he useth a Soveraign and not a Certain Rule in this Communication, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11, 13. so as that he is not wanting unto any true Professors in proportion to their Calls and Opportunities.</p>

                  <hi>2<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi>
                  </hi> Whereas the Spirit of <hi>Sanctification</hi> is promised only unto them that are Regenerate and do believe, May we in our Prayers and Supplications for him plead those <hi>Qualifications</hi> as Arguments and Motives for the further Communications of him unto us. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We cannot properly plead any <hi>Qualification</hi> in our selves, as though God
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48389:186"/> were Obliged with respect unto them, to give a man encrease of Grace
<hi>ex congruo</hi> much less <hi>ex condigno.</hi> When we have done all, we are unprofitable Servants. As we begin so we must proceed with God meerly on the Account of Soveraign Grace. 2. We may plead the Faithfulness and Righteousness of God as engaged in his Promises. We ought to pray that he would <hi>not forsake the Work of his own hands,</hi> that he who hath begun the good work in us, would perfect it unto the day of Jesus Christ; that with respect unto his Covenant and Promises he would preserve that <hi>New Creature,</hi> that Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which he hath formed and implanted in us. 3. Upon a sense of the Weakness of any Grace we may humbly profess our sincerity therein, and pray for its encrease. So cryed the poor man with tears,
<hi>Lord I believe, help thou mine unbelief, Matth.</hi> 9. 24. And the Apostles in their Prayer, <hi>Lord increase our Faith, Luke</hi> 17. 5. owned the Faith they had, and prayed for its encrease by fresh supplyes of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>Again 3<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> May Believers in Trouble pray for the <hi>Spirit of Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with respect unto their Troubles, it being unto such that he is promised? <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) They may do so directly, and ought so to doe; yea when they do it not it is a sign they turn aside unto <hi>broken Cisterns</hi> that will yield them no Relief. (2) Troubles are of two sorts, <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> and <hi>Temporal.</hi> Spiritual Troubles are so either <hi>Subjectively,</hi> such as are all inward Darknesses, and Distresses on the Account of sin; or 2<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> 
                  <hi>Objectively,</hi> such are all <hi>Persecutions</hi> for the Name of Christ and the Gospel: It is principally with respect unto these that the Spirit is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised as a <hi>Comforter,</hi> and with regard unto them are we principally to pray for him as so promised. (3) In those outward Troubles which are Common unto Believers with other men, as the death of Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Losses of Estate or Liberty, they may and ought to pray for the Spirit as a <hi>Comforter,</hi> that the Consolations of God administred by him, may out-ballance their outward Troubles, and keep up their hearts unto other Dutyes.</p>
               <p>4<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> May all Sincere Professors of the Gospel pray for the Spirit with respect unto his <hi>Gifts,</hi> for the Edification of others, seeing unto such he is promised for that End? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. They may do so but with the ensuing Limitations. (1) They must do it with express Submission to the Sovereignty of the <hi>Spirit</hi> himself, who <hi>divideth to every one as he will.</hi> (2) With respect unto that Station and Condition wherein they are placed in the Church by the Providence and call of God. Private persons have no warrant to pray for <hi>Ministerial Gifts,</hi> such as should carry them out of their Stations without a Divine Direction going before them. (3) That their <hi>End</hi> be good and right to use them in their respective places unto <hi>Edification.</hi> So ought Parents and Masters of Families, and all Members of Churches, to pray for those <hi>Gifts</hi> of the Spirit whereby they may fill up the Dutyes of their Places and Relations.</p>
               <p>From the Consideration of this <hi>Order</hi> of the Dispensation of the Spirit, we may be directed how to <hi>pray</hi> for him, which we are both commanded and encouraged to doe, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. For we are to <hi>pray for him</hi> with respect unto those Ends and Effects for which he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised: And these are those which are before expressed, with all those
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48389:186"/> particular Instances which may be reduced unto them. We might therefore hence give Direction in some Enquiries, which indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a larger <hi>Discussion</hi> if our present Design would admit of it; one only I shall instance in.</p>
               <p>May a Person who is yet <hi>Vnregenerate</hi> pray for the Spirit of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi> to effect that Work in him? For whereas as such he is promised onely unto the <hi>Elect,</hi> such a Person not knowing his
<hi>Election,</hi> seems to have no foundation to make such a Request upon.
<hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) Election is no <hi>Qualification</hi> on <hi>our part</hi> which we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider or plead in our Supplications, but only the secret Purpose on the part of God of what himself will doe, and is known unto us only by its Effects. (2) Persons convinced of sin, and a state of sin, may and ought to pray, that God by the Effectual Communications of his Spirit unto them would deliver them from that Condition. This is one way whereby we <hi>flee from the wrath to come.</hi> (3) The especial Object of their Supplications herein is Sovereign Grace, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mercy, as declared in and by Jesus Christ. Such Persons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indeed plead any <hi>especial Promise</hi> as made unto them. But they may plead for the Grace and Mercy declared in the Promises, as inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely proposed unto sinners. It may be they can proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Expectations but unto that of the Prophet; <hi>who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth if God will come and give a Blessing; Joel</hi> 2. 14. yet is this a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground and encouragement to keep them waiting at the <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> after he had received his <hi>Vision</hi> from Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in great distress of mind <hi>praying</hi> until he received the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11, 17. (4) Persons under such Convictions have really sometimes the <hi>seeds</hi> of Regeneration communicated unto them, and then as they ought, so they will continue in their Supplications for the Encrease and Manifestation of it.</p>
               <p>It is evident that by these Observations the foregoing Objection is utterly removed out of the way; and there is no disadvantage ariseth unto the Doctrine of the Free and Effectual Grace of God, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining this Work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> and Holiness unto <hi>Believers</hi> only. None are sanctified, none are made Holy but those who truely and savingly Believe in God through Jesus Christ; which I shall now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label>(1) <hi>Without Faith it is impossible to please God, Heb.</hi> 11. 6. The Faith discoursed of by the Apostle is that whereby the Fathers <hi>received the Promises, walked with God and obtained the Inheritance,</hi> the Faith of
<hi>Abraham;</hi> that is true saying justifying Faith. This Faith constitutes all them in whom it is <hi>true Believers,</hi> and without it it is impossible to please God. Now <hi>Holiness</hi> wherever it is <hi>pleaseth God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without Faith it is impossible we should have any interest in it.
<hi>This is the Will of God even our Sanctification, 1 Thess. 4. 3. and walking therein we please God,</hi> v. 7. All that pleaseth God in us, is our Holiness, or some part of it, and it principally consists in an Opposition unto all that displeaseth him. That which he <hi>commands</hi> pleaseth him, and that which he <hi>forbids</hi> displeaseth him; and our Holiness consists in a Complyance with the one, and an Opposition unto the other. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that any others but Believers should have any thing which really
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48389:187"/> belongs unto this <hi>Holiness,</hi> the Apostle declares it to be impossible. Some would except against this sense of the words from the ensuing Reason which the Apostle gives of his Assertion which contains the
<hi>nature of the Faith</hi> intended. <hi>For he that cometh unto God must believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</hi> For this is that, they say, which the Light of Nature directs unto, and therefore there is <hi>no other Faith</hi> necessarily required that a man may please God but only that which is included in the right use and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Natural Reason. But this Exception will no way evade the Force of this Testimony. For the Apostle discourseth concerning such a Coming unto God, and such a Belief in him, as is guided, directed and ingenerated in us, by the <hi>Promises</hi> which it rests upon and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into. Now these Promises all and every one of them, include Jesus Christ with a respect unto him and his Grace. And therefore the Faith intended is that which is <hi>in God through Christ</hi> as revealed and exhibited in the Promises, and this <hi>Coming unto God</hi> is a Fruit and Effect thereof.</p>
               <p>(2) Our Lord Jesus Christ affirms that men are sanctified by the Faith that is in him, <hi>Acts 26. 18. That they may receive Forgiveness of sins and an Inheritance among them that are sanctified by the Faith that is in me.</hi> If there were any other way or means whereby men might be sanctified or <hi>made Holy,</hi> he would not have confined it unto the
<hi>Faith that is in him.</hi> At least there is no other way to attain that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness which may bring them unto the <hi>Heavenly Inheritance,</hi> or make them meet for it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 11. which alone we enquire after. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there can be no greater Contempt cast on the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> and on the Duty of Believing in him, whereunto he makes this one of his principal Motives, than to Imagine that <hi>without Faith in him</hi> any one can be made Holy.</p>
               <p>(3.) Faith is the <hi>Instrumental Cause</hi> of our Sanctification, so that where it is not, no Holiness can be wrought in us. <hi>God purifyeth our hearts by Faith, Acts</hi> 15. 9. and not otherwise. And where the Heart is not <hi>purifyed</hi> there is no Holiness. All the Dutyes in the world will not denominate him Holy whose Heart is not purified; nor will any such Dutyes be holy themselves seeing unto the <hi>unclean all things are unclean.</hi> All the <hi>Obedience</hi> that is accepted with God is the <hi>Obedience of Faith, Rom.</hi> 1. 7. thence it springs and therewith is it animated. So is it expressed, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 21, 22. You who by Christ do believe in God, and have purifyed your Souls in obeying the Truth through the Spirit.</hi> It is from Faith in God through Jesus Christ, acting it self in Obedience unto the Gospel, that we <hi>purifie or cleanse our Souls</hi> which is our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. See <hi>Col. 2. 12, 13, 14. Chap.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>(4) All Grace is Originally entrusted in and with Jesus Christ. The Image of God being lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> whatever was prepared or is used for the Renovation of it in our Natures and Persons, wherein Gospel Holiness doth consist, was to be treasured up in him as the <hi>second Adam,</hi> by whom many are to be made <hi>alive,</hi> who <hi>dyed</hi> in the first. It pleased the Father that in him all Fulness should dwell, as the <hi>Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Godhead</hi> in and for his own Divine Personal Subsistence, so the Fulness of <hi>all Grace</hi> for Supplyes unto us; that of <hi>his Fulness we might receive Grace for Grace.</hi> He is made the Head unto the whole
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48389:187"/> New Creation, not only of Power and Rule but of Life and Influence. God hath given him for a <hi>Covenant to the People,</hi> and communicates nothing that belongs properly to the Covenant of Grace, as our Sanctification and Holiness doe, unto any but in and through him. And we receive nothing by him but by vertue of <hi>Relation</hi> unto him, or especial Interest in him, or union with him. Where there is an especial Communication, there must be an especial Relation whereon it doth depend, and whence it doth proceed. As the Relation of the Members unto the Head is the Cause and Means why <hi>Vital spirits</hi> are thence derived unto them. We must be in Christ as the <hi>Branch is in the Vine</hi> or we can derive nothing from him. <hi>Joh. 15. 4. As the branch cannot bear fruit of it self except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me.</hi> Whatever any way belongeth unto Holiness is
<hi>our Fruit,</hi> and nothing else is Fruit but what belongeth thereunto. Now this our Saviour affirms that we can bring forth <hi>nothing</hi> of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we are in him, and do abide in him. Now our being in Christ and abiding in him is by Faith; without which we can <hi>derive</hi> nothing from him, and consequently never be partakers of Holiness in the least Degree. But these things must be afterwards spoken unto more at large. It is therefore undenyably evident that <hi>Believers only</hi> are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and Holy, all others are unclean, nor is any thing they doe <hi>Holy,</hi> or so esteemed of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> And the due Consideration hereof discovers many pernitious mistakes that are about this matter, both <hi>Notional</hi> and <hi>Practical.</hi> For (1) There are some who would carry Holiness beyond the <hi>Bounds</hi> of an <hi>especial Relation</hi> unto Christ; or would carry that Relation beyond the only
<hi>Bond</hi> of it, which is <hi>Faith.</hi> For they would have it to be no more than <hi>Moral Honesty</hi> or <hi>Vertue,</hi> and so cannot with any Modesty deny it unto <hi>those Heathens</hi> who endeavoured after them according to the Light of Nature. And what need then is there of Jesus Christ? I can and doe commend Morall Vertues and Honesty as much as any man ought to doe, and am sure enough there is no Grace where they are not; yet to make any thing to be our <hi>Holiness</hi> that is not derived from Jesus Christ, I know not what I do more abhorre. An Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hereof dethrones Christ from his Glory, and overthrowes the whole Gospel. But we have a sort of men who plead that <hi>Heathens</hi> may be <hi>eternally</hi> saved, so large and indulgent is their Charity, and in the mean time endeavour by all means possible to destroy <hi>temporally</hi> at least all those Christians who stoop not to a complyance with all their Imaginations. (2) Others there are who proceed much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and yet do but deceive themselves in the Issue. Notions they have of <hi>good and evil</hi> by the Light of Nature. As they come with men into the world, and grow up with them as they come to the Exercise of their Reason, so they are not stifled without offering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Principles of Nature by the power of sin; as it comes to pass in many, <hi>Ephes. 4. 19. 1 Tim. 4. 2. Rom. 1. 31. Chap.</hi> 2. 14, 15. These Notions therefore are in many improved in Process of time by
<hi>Convictions</hi> from the Law; and great Effects are produced hereby. For where the Soul is once effectually convinced of Sin Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Judgement, it cannot but endeavour after a Deliverance
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48389:188"/> from the one, and an Attainment of the other; that so it may be well with it at the Last Day. And here lye the Springs or Foundations of all the Morall Differences that we see amongst Mankind. Some give themselves up unto all Abominations, Lasciviousness, Uncleanness, Drunkenness, Frauds, Oppressions, Blasphemies, Persecutions, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no bounds fixed unto their Lusts, but what are given them by their own Impotency, or dread of Humane Laws. Others endeavour to be Sober, Temperate, Just, Honest, and Upright in their dealings, with a sedulous performance of Religious Dutyes. This difference ariseth from the different Power and Efficacy of Legal Convictions upon the Minds of men. And these Convictions are in many variously improved according to the Light they receive in the Means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which they do enjoy, or the Errors and <hi>Superstitions</hi> which they are misguided unto. For on this latter account do they grow up in some, into <hi>Penances, Vowes,</hi> uncommanded <hi>Abstinencyes,</hi> and various Self-macerations; with other painfull and costly Dutyes. Where the Light they receive is in the generall according unto Truth, there it will engage men into Reformation of Life, a Multiplication of Dutyes, Abstinence from sin, Profession, Zeal, and a Cordial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement into one way or other in Religion. Such Persons may have
<hi>good Hopes</hi> themselves that they are Holy, they may appear to the World so to be, and be accepted in the Church of God as such, and yet really be utter strangers from true <hi>Gospel Holiness.</hi> And the Reason is, because they have missed it in the Foundation; and not having in the first place obtained an Interest in Christ, have built their house on the sand, whence it will fall in the time of trouble. If it be said, that all those who come up unto the Dutyes mentioned are to be
<hi>esteemed</hi> Believers, if therewith they make Profession of the true Faith of the Gospel, I willingly grant it. But if it be said, that <hi>necessarily they are so</hi> indeed, and in the sight of God, and therefore are also sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and Holy, I must say the contrary is expresly denyed in the Gospel, and especial Instances given thereof.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let them wisely consider these things who have any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the Necessity of Holiness. It may be they have done much in the pursuit of it, and have laboured in the Dutyes that <hi>materially</hi> belong unto it. Many things they have <hi>done,</hi> and many things <hi>forborn,</hi> upon the Account of it; and still continue so to doe. It may be they think that for all the World they would not be found among the number of <hi>unholy persons</hi> at the Last Day. This may be the Condition of some, perhaps of many, who are but yet young, and but newly engaged into these wayes upon their Convictions. It may be so with them who for many dayes and years have been so following after a Righteousness in a way of Duty. But yet they meet with these two evils in their wayes. (1) That Dutyes of Obedience seldom or never prove more <hi>easie, familiar</hi> or pleasant unto them, than they did at first, but rather are more <hi>grievous</hi> and burdensome every day. (2) That they never come up unto a <hi>satisfaction</hi> in what they doe, but still find that there is somewhat wanting. These make all they do burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and unpleasant unto them, which at length will betray them into Backsliding and Apostasie. But yet there is somewhat worse behind; All they have done, or are ever able to doe on the bottom upon
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48389:188"/> which they stand, will come to no Account, but perish with them at the great Day. Would we prevent all these fatal evils, would we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a reall, thriving, everlasting Holiness, let our first business be to secure a Relation unto Jesus Christ, without which nothing of it will ever be attained.</p>
               <p>To close this discourse, I shall only from it obviate a <hi>putid Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> cast by the <hi>Papists, Quakers</hi> and others of the same Confederacy against the Grace of God, upon the Doctrine of the <hi>free Justification</hi> of a sinner, through the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ. For with a <hi>shameless Impudence</hi> they clamour on all by whom it is asserted, as those who maintain Salvation to be attained through a meer <hi>External Imputation</hi> of Righteousness, whilest those so saved are
<hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>unholy,</hi> as the <hi>Quaker,</hi> or negligent of the Dutyes of Righteousness and Obedience, as the <hi>Papists</hi> and others slanderously report. For the <hi>frontless impudence</hi> of this Calumny is sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence, that as we assert <hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> to be peculiar only unto Believing justified Persons, that is that Faith and Holiness are inseparable habitually or actually or in both regards; so in like manner that all such Persons are <hi>infallibly sanctified</hi> and made Holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> All Believers and only Believers being sanctified and made Holy,
<hi>What it is</hi> that is sanctified in them, or what is the <hi>proper Seat and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of this Work, is in the next place to be declared. For it is not a meer <hi>External Denomination</hi> as things were called Holy under the Old Testament, nor any <hi>transient Act,</hi> nor any <hi>series</hi> or Course of Actions that we plead about; but that which hath, as a <hi>reall Being</hi> and <hi>Existence,</hi> so a <hi>constant abiding</hi> or Residence in us. Hence he that is Holy is alwayes so, whether he be in the <hi>Actual</hi> Exercise of the Dutyes of Holiness or no; though an Omission of any of them in their proper season is contrary unto and an impeachment of Holiness, as to its Degrees. Now this <hi>subject</hi> of Sanctification is the <hi>Entire Nature</hi> or
<hi>whole Person</hi> of a Believer. It is not any one Faculty of the Soul or Affection of the Mind, or Part of the Body that is sanctified, but the
<hi>whole Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> or the entire Nature of every Believing Person. And hereby is the Work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> really distinguished from any other <hi>meer common Work</hi> which may represent it, or pretend unto it. For all such Works are <hi>partiall;</hi> either they are in the Mind only by Light and Notions of Truth, or on the Affections only in Zeal and Devotion, or on the Mind and Conscience in the Convictions of Sin and Duty, but further they proceed not. But true Holiness consists in the Renovation of our whole Persons, which must be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
               <p>(1) That our entire Nature was Originally created in the <hi>Image</hi> of God I have proved before, and it is by all acknowledged. Our
<hi>whole Souls,</hi> in the Rectitude of all their <hi>Faculties</hi> and Powers in order unto the Life of God and his Enjoyment, did bear this Image. Nor was it confined unto the Soul only. The <hi>Body</hi> also, not as to its shape figure or natural use, but as an <hi>Essential part</hi> of our Natures, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in the Image of God by a Participation of Original Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. Hence the whole Person was a meet Principle for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48389:189"/> of this Image of God unto others, by the means of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Propagation,</hi> which is an act of the entire Person. For a Person created and abiding in the Image of God, begetting another in his own Image and Likeness, had by vertue of the Covenant of Creation begotten him in the Image of God also; that is, had communicated unto him a <hi>Nature upright and pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) By the Entrance of sin this Image of God, so far as it was our Righteousness and Holiness before him, was utterly defaced and Lost. This also I have sufficiently evidenced before. It did not depart from any one Power, Part, or Faculty of our Souls, but from our whole Nature. Accordingly the Scripture describes (1) the Depravation of our Natures distinctly in all the <hi>Powers</hi> of it. In particular the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that ensued on our Minds, Wills and Affections upon the loss of the Image of God, I have before declared and vindicated. And (2) in reference unto the first <hi>Actings</hi> of all these Faculties in things Moral and Spiritual, the Scripture addes that all the <hi>Thoughts and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of our Hearts are evil and that continually, Gen.</hi> 6. 5. All the Original first Actings of the <hi>Powers</hi> of our Souls in or about things Rational and Morall are alwayes evil. <hi>For an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit.</hi> That which is lame and distorted, can act nothing that is straight and regular. Hence (3) All the <hi>Outward Actions</hi> of Persons in this State and Condition are evil, unfruitfull works of Darkness. And not only so but the Scripture (4) in the Description of the Effects of this Depravation of our Nature, calls in the <hi>Body</hi> and the members of it unto a <hi>partnership</hi> in all this Obliquity and Sin. <hi>The members of the Body are Servants unto Vncleanness and Iniquity, Rom.</hi> 6. 19. And the engagement of them in all the Course and Actings of Depraved Nature is particularly declared by our Apostle out of the
<hi>Psalmist, Rom. 3. 12, 13, 14, 15. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable, there is none that doth good no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues they have used deceit, the poyson of Asps is under their lips, whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness, their feet are swift to shed blood,</hi> in all wayes of evil.</p>
               <p>This being the State of our whole Nature in its Depravation, our Sanctification, wherein alone its <hi>Reparation</hi> in this Life doth consist, must equally respect the whole. Some suppose that it is our <hi>Affections</hi> only in their Deliverance from corrupt Lusts and Prejudices, with their direction unto Heavenly Objects, that are the <hi>Subject</hi> of this Work. For the <hi>Mind</hi> or rational Intellectual Power of the Soul, is in its self they say pure, noble, untainted, and needs no other Ayd but to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the <hi>Prejudices</hi> and Obstructions of its Operations, which are cast upon it by the Engagements and Inclinations of corrupt Affections, and a vitious course of Conversation in the World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by <hi>uninterrupted Traditions from our Fathers;</hi> from whence it is not able to extricate or deliver it self, without the Aid of Grace. But they have placed their Instance very unhappily. For among all things that belong unto our Nature, there is not any one which the Scripture so chargeth this <hi>Depravation</hi> of it upon, as the <hi>Mind.</hi> This in particular is said to be <hi>fleshly,</hi> to be <hi>Enmity</hi> against God, to be <hi>filled</hi> with <hi>Vanity,</hi> Folly and Blindness, as we have at large before evinced. Nor is there any thing concerning which the <hi>Work of Sanctification
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48389:189"/> and Renovation</hi> is so expressly affirmed as it is concerning the Mind. It is declared by the <hi>Renovation of our Minds, Rom.</hi> 12. 2. or <hi>being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the spirit of our Minds, Ephes.</hi> 4. 23. that we <hi>put on the New man that is renewed in knowledge, Col.</hi> 3. 10. with other Expressions of the like nature. It is therefore our <hi>Entire Nature</hi> that is the Subject of Evangelical Holiness; For to manifest in particulars.</p>
               <p>(1) Hence it is called the <hi>New Man, Ephes. 4. 24. Put on the New Man, which after God is created in Righteousness and Holiness.</hi> As the Principle of Sin and corrupted Nature in us is called the <hi>Old Man</hi> for no other Reason but that it possesseth all the Active Powers of the whole Man, so that he neither doth nor can do any thing but what is influenced thereby; so this Principle of Holiness in us, the Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Natures is called the <hi>New Man,</hi> because it possesseth the whole Person with respect unto its proper Operations and Ends. And it extends it self as large as the <hi>Old Man</hi> or the Depravation of our Natures, which takes in the whole Person Soul and Body with all their Faculties and Powers.</p>
               <p>(2) The <hi>Heart</hi> in the Scripture is taken for the <hi>whole</hi> Soul and all the Faculties of it, as they are one Common Principle of all Morall Operations; as I have proved before: Whatever therefore is wrought in and upon the <hi>Heart</hi> under this Consideration, is wrought upon the whole Soul. Now this is not only said to be affected with this Work of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or to have Holiness wrought in it, but the principal Description that is given us of this Work, consists in this, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and thereby a <hi>New Heart</hi> is given unto us or created in us, as it is expressed in the Promise of the Covenant. This therefore can be nothing but the possessing of all the Powers and <hi>Faculties</hi> of our Souls with a New Principle of Holiness and Obedience unto God.</p>
               <p>(3) There is especial mention made of the effecting of this Work on our <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> with their <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> distinctly. This I have already proved in the Declaration of the Work of our
<hi>Regeneration</hi> or Conversion to God, which is only preserved, cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, improved, and carryed on to its proper End in our <hi>Sanctification.</hi> The Nature also of that spiritual <hi>Light</hi> which is communicated unto our Minds, of <hi>Life</hi> unto our Wills, of <hi>Love</hi> unto our Affections, hath been declared. Therefore doth it follow thence unavoidably that the whole Person is the Subject of this Work, and that <hi>Holiness</hi> hath its residence in the whole Soul entirely.</p>
               <p>(4) We need goe no further for the proof hereof than unto that Prayer of the Apostle for the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> which we insisted on at the beginning of this Discourse, 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 23. The God of Peace himself sanctifie you</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>throughout;</hi> that is, in your whole Natures or Persons, in all that you are and doe, that you may not in this or that part but be every <hi>whit clean</hi> and Holy <hi>throughout.</hi> And to make this the more evident that we may know <hi>what it is</hi> which he prayes may be sanctified, and thereby <hi>preserved blameless to the coming of Christ,</hi> he distributes our whole Natures into the two Essential parts of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi> And in the former he considereth two things, (1) the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> (2) the <hi>Soul</hi> peculiarly so called. And this distinction frequently occurrs in the Scripture, wherein that by the <hi>Spirit</hi> the <hi>Mind</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Faculty is understood, and by the <hi>Soul</hi> the Affections, is
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48389:190"/> generally acknowledged, and may evidently be proved. These there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle prayes may be <hi>sanctified</hi> and <hi>preserved</hi> Holy <hi>throughout</hi> and entirely,<note place="margin">Fieri non potest ut sanctificato Spiritu non sit sanctum etiam Corpus, quo san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificatus uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Spiritus. <hi>August. lib. de Bono Viduitat.</hi>
                  </note> and that by the Infusion of an Habit of Holiness into them, with its Preservation and Improvement, whereof more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But this is not all. Our <hi>Bodyes</hi> are an <hi>Essential part</hi> of our Natures, and by their union with our Souls are we constituted <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Persons.</hi> Now we are the Principles of all our Operations, as we are <hi>Persons;</hi> Every Moral Act we do, is the Act of the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The <hi>Body</hi> therefore is concerned in the Good and Evil of it. It became a subject of the Depravation of our Nature by Concomitancy and Participation; and is considered as one entire Principle with the Soul of communicating Original Defilement from Parents unto Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Besides it is now subject in that Corruption of its Constitution which it is fallen under as a punishment of sin, unto many disorderly Motions that are Incentives and Provocations unto sin. Hence sin is said to <hi>reign in our mortal Bodyes,</hi> and our <hi>Members to be servants unto unrighteousness, Rom.</hi> 6. 12. 19. Moreover by its Participation in the Defilement and Punishment of sin, the <hi>Body</hi> is disposed and made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto <hi>Corruption</hi> and Destruction. For Death entred by Sin and no otherwise. On all these Accounts therefore it is necessary on the other hand, that the <hi>Body</hi> should be interested in this Work and Priviledge of Sanctification and Holiness. And so it is (1) By <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation.</hi> For it is our Persons that are sanctified and made Holy, (<hi>sanctifie them throughout);</hi> and although our Souls are the <hi>first proper Subject</hi> of the infused Habit or Principle of Holiness, yet our <hi>Bodyes</hi> as essential parts of our Natures are <hi>Partakers</hi> thereof. (2) By <hi>a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Influence</hi> of the Grace of God upon them also, as far as they have any influence into Moral Operations. For the Apostle tells us, that our <hi>Bodyes</hi> are <hi>Members</hi> of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15. and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have influences of Grace from him as our Head. (3) In the Work of Sanctification the Holy Ghost comes and <hi>dwells in us.</hi> And hereon <hi>our Bodyes are the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in us,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 19. And the Temple of God is Holy; although I confess this rather belongs unto the <hi>Holiness</hi> of <hi>peculiar Dedication unto</hi> God, whereof we shall treat afterwards. And hereby (1) are the <hi>Parts and Members of the Body</hi> made Instruments and <hi>Servants of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto Holiness, Rom.</hi> 6. 19. do become meet and fit for to be used in the Acts and Dutyes of Holiness, as being made <hi>clean</hi> and sanctified unto God. (2) Hereby are they disposed and prepared unto a <hi>blessed Resurrection</hi> at the Last Day, which shall be wrought by the Spirit of Christ which dwelt in them and sanctified them in this Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10, 11. <hi>Phil. 3. 20, 21. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 14, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Our whole <hi>Persons</hi> therefore and in them our whole Natures are the Subject of this Work, and true Holiness invests the whole of it. Now whether this universal Investiture of our Nature in all the Faculties and Powers of it, by a new Principle of Holiness and Obedience unto God, whereby it is renewed unto his Image, do belong unto that <hi>Morall Vertue</hi> which some so plead for as to substitute it in the Room of <hi>Gospel-Holiness,</hi> they may do well to consider who are the Patrons of that Cause. For if it doth not, then doth not it self belong unto that <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which the Gospel teacheth, requireth, promiseth and communicates,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48389:190"/> whatever else it be. And moreover, it is practically worthy considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that men deceive not themselves with a <hi>partial</hi> work in Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only, or Change of the Affections also, in stead of this Evangelical Sanctification. It is often and truely spoken unto, how men may have their Minds enlightened, their Affections wrought upon, and their Lives much changed, and yet come short of reall Holiness. The best tryal of this Work is by its <hi>Vniversality</hi> with respect unto its Subject. If any thing remain unsanctified in us sin may there set up its Throne and maintain its Sovereignty. But where this Work is true and reall how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever weak and imperfect it may be as unto its Degrees, yet it possesseth the whole Person, and leaveth not the least hold unto sin, wherein it doth not continually combat and conflict with it. There is saving Light in the Mind, and Life in the Will, and Love in the Affections, and Grace in the Conscience suited to its Nature; there is nothing in us whereunto the Power of Holiness doth not reach according to its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Men may therefore if they please deceive themselves by taking up with some <hi>Notions</hi> in their Minds, some <hi>Devotions</hi> in their Affections, or some good and vertuous Deeds in their Conversations, but Holiness doth not consist therein.</p>
               <p>And Lastly, men may hence see how vainly they excuse themselves in their Sins, their Passions, <hi>Intemperances</hi> and the like disorders of Mind, from their Constitutions and Inclinations; for true <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> reacheth unto the Body also. It is true, Grace doth not so change the natural Constitution as to make him that was <hi>sickly, healthy</hi> and strong; nor so as to make him who was <hi>Melancholy,</hi> to be <hi>Sanguine</hi> or the like; it altereth not the course of the Blood, the animal spirits, with the Impressions they make on our Minds. But consider these things <hi>Morally,</hi> and as the whole Person is a Principle of Spiritual and Moral Operations, and so it doth work that Change and Alteration on the whole Person, as to cure <hi>Morally sinfull distempers,</hi> as of Passion, Elation of Mind, and Intemperancies, which men were before more than ordinarily inclined unto by their Tempers and Constitutions. Yea from the Efficacy of it upon our whole Persons, in the curing of such habitual inordinate and sinfull distempers, lyes the principal discovery of its Truth and Reality. Let no men therefore pretend that Grace and Holiness do not change mens <hi>Constitutions,</hi> thereby to excuse and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate their disorderly Passions before men, and to keep themselves from being humbled for them before God. For although it do not so <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> and <hi>physically,</hi> yet it doth so <hi>Morally,</hi> so that the Constitution it self shall be no more such a <hi>fomes</hi> and Incentive unto disorderly Passions, as it hath been. If Grace hath not cured that Passion, Pride, Causeless Anger, Inveterate Wrath, Intemperance, which mens Constitutions pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly incline unto, I know not for my part what it hath done, nor what a number of outward Dutyes do signifie. The Spirit and Grace of Christ causeth <hi>the Wolf to dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard to lye down with the Kid, Isa.</hi> 11. 6. It will change the most wild and savage Natures into Meekness, Gentleness and Kindness; Examples where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of have been multiplyed in the World.</p>

                  <p>(1) Purification the first proper Notion of Sanctification. (2) Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptisme confirming the same Apprehension. (3) A Spiritual Defilement and Pollution in Sin. (4) The Nature of that Defilement, or wherein it doth consist.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> THese things being premised, we proceed to the Consideration of <hi>Sanctification</hi> it self, in a further Explication of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> before given. And the first thing we ascribe unto the Spirit of God herein, which constitutes the first part of it, is the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and cleansing of our Natures from the Pollution of Sin.</hi> Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the first proper Notion of <hi>internal</hi> real Sanctification. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in <hi>order of Time</hi> it do not precede the other Acts and parts of this Work, yet in <hi>order of Nature</hi> it is first proposed and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. To be <hi>unclean</hi> absolutely, and to be <hi>Holy,</hi> are universally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. Not to be purged from sin, is an Expression of an <hi>unholy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> as to be cleansed is of him that is <hi>holy.</hi> And this Purification or the effecting of this Work of Cleansing is ascribed unto all the Causes and Means of Sanctification. As (1) unto the <hi>Spirit</hi> who is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Efficient of the whole. Not that Sanctification consists wholly herein, but firstly and necessarily it is required thereunto; <hi>Prov. 30. 12. Ezek. 36. 25. I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean, from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you.</hi> That
<hi>this sprinkling of clean Water upon us,</hi> is the Communication of the Spirit unto us for the End designed, I have before evinced. It hath also been declared wherefore he is called <hi>Water</hi> or compared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And the next Verse shews expressly that it is the Spirit of God which is intended. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in my Statutes.</hi> And that which he is thus in the first place promised for, is the <hi>Cleansing of us</hi> from the Pollution of sin, which in order of Nature is preposed unto his enabling us to <hi>walk in Gods Statutes,</hi> or to yield holy Obedience unto him.</p>
               <p>To the same purpose among many others is that Promise, <hi>Isa. 4. 4. When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the Daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Hierusalem, by the Spirit of Judgment and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48389:191"/> the Spirit of Burning.</hi> Upon what ground the Spirit is compared to
<hi>Fire</hi> and thence here called <hi>a Spirit of Burning</hi> hath been also declared. In brief, Fire and Water were the Means whereby all things were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and cleansed <hi>Typically</hi> in the Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 23. And the Holy Spirit being the principal Efficient Cause of all <hi>spiritual cleansing</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to them both, by which his Work was signified, and called by their names. See <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2, 3. And <hi>Judgment</hi> is frequently taken for Holiness. The Spirit of Judgment therefore and the <hi>Spirit of Burning</hi> is the Spirit of Sanctification and Purification. And he is here promised for the Sanctification of the Elect of God. And how shall he effect this Work? He shall do it in the first place by <hi>washing away their filth and purging away their blood;</hi> that is, all their spiritual sinfull Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>(2) The Application of the <hi>Death and Blood of Christ</hi> unto our Souls for our Sanctification by the Holy Ghost, is said to be for our
<hi>cleansing and purging, Ephes. 5. 26, 27. Christ loved the Church and gave himself for it, that he might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the Word;</hi> He gave himself that he might redeem us from all Iniquity <hi>and purifie unto himself a peculiar people zealous of Good Works, Tit. 2. 14. For the Blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all our sins, 1 Joh.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>For he loved us and washed us from our sins in his own Blood, Rev.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>The Blood of Jesus Christ purgeth our Consciences from dead works to serve the living God, Heb.</hi> 9. 14. Respect I acknowledge in some of these places may be had unto the Expiation of the Guilt of sin by the Blood of Christ as offered in Sacrifice, for so <hi>in himself he purged our sins, Heb.</hi> 1. 3. But as they all suppose a Defilement in sin, so the most of them respect its <hi>cleansing</hi> by the Application of the Vertue of the Blood of Christ unto our Souls and Consciences in our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> (3) <hi>moreover where Sanctification is enjoyned us as our Duty it is prescribed under this Notion of</hi> cleansing our selves <hi>from sin.</hi> Wash you, make you clean, Isa. 1. 16. O Jerusalem wash thine Heart from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness that thou mayest be saved, Jer. 4. 14. Having therefore these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh and the spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God, 2 Cor. 7. 1. Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself; 1 Joh. 3. 3. Psal. 119. 9. 2 Tim. 2. 20.
<hi>and the like Expressions of this Duty occur in other places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label>(4) Answerable unto these <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of them we have the Institution of the Ordinance of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> the Outward way and Means of our Initiation into the Lord Christ and the Profession of the Gospel, the great Representation of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward washing of Regeneration, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Now this Baptisme in the First place expresseth the outward putting away <hi>the filth of the flesh,</hi> by
<hi>external washing</hi> with material water, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. And that which answers hereunto can be in nothing but the <hi>inward purifying</hi> of our Souls and Consciences by the Grace of the Spirit of God; that is, saith our Apostle, the <hi>putting off the Body of the sins of the flesh, Col.</hi> 2. 11. which contains the whole Defilement and Corruption of sin. And this also was typed out unto us by all the <hi>Legal Purifications</hi> of Old. Wherefore we shall do three things in the Explication of this
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48389:192"/> first Branch of our Sanctification. (1) Shew, <hi>That there is a spiritual Pollution and Defilement in Sin.</hi> (2) Declare <hi>What it is, or wherein it doth consist:</hi> And (3) <hi>Manifest how it is removed or washed away,</hi> and Believers made <hi>Holy</hi> thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> For the First, it needs not much to be insisted on. Our Minds and their Conceptions are in these things to be regulated by <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> and Expressions. And in the whole Representation made unto us in the Scripture, of the Nature of Sin, of our Concernment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, of the Respect of God towards us on the Account thereof; of the Way and Means whereby we may be delivered from it; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much inculcated, as its being <hi>filthy, abominable,</hi> full of <hi>defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>pollution,</hi> which is set forth both in the plain Expressions and various Similitudes. On the Account hereof is it said to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of God, <hi>the abominable thing which his Soul hateth,</hi> which he cannot behold, which he cannot but hate and detest, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Blood, Wounds, Sores, Leprosie, Scum, loathsome Diseases. With respect hereunto is it so frequently declared that we must be washed, purged, purified, cleansed, as in the Testimonyes before cited; before we can be accepted with him, or be brought to the Enjoyment of him. And the work of the Spirit of Christ in the Application of his Blood unto us for the taking away of sin, is compared to the Effects of <hi>Fire, Water, Sope, Nitre,</hi> every thing that hath a purifying cleansing Faculty in it. These things so frequently occurr in the Scripture and Testimonies concerning them are so multiplyed that it is altogether needless to produce particular Instances. This is evident and undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the Scripture which regulates our Conceptions about Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, expressly declares all sin to be <hi>uncleanness,</hi> and every sinner to be defiled thereby, and all unsanctified persons to be wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; and how far these Expressions are <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> or wherein the
<hi>Metaphor</hi> doth consist, must be afterwards declared.</p>
               <p>Besides, there is no Notion of Sin and Holiness whereof Believers have a more sensible spiritual <hi>Experience.</hi> For although they may not, or do not comprehend the <hi>Metaphysical Notion</hi> or Nature of this Pollution and Defilement of Sin, yet they are sensible of the <hi>Effects</hi> it produceth in their Minds and Consciences. They find <hi>That</hi> in sin which is attended with <hi>shame</hi> and self-Abhorrency and requires deep Abasement of Soul. They discern in it or in themselves on the Account of it, an unsuitableness unto the Holiness of God, and an unfitness thereon for Communion with him. Nothing do they more earnestly labour after in their Prayers and Supplications than a cleansing from it by the Blood of Christ; nor are any Promises more precious unto them, than those which express their <hi>Purification</hi> and <hi>purging</hi> from it. For these are they which next unto their Interest in the Attonement made by the Sacrifice of Christ, give them boldness in their approaches unto God. So our Apostle fully expresseth it, <hi>Heb. 10. 19, 20, 21, 22. Having therefore boldness to enter into the Holiest by the Blood of Jesus, by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the Veyl that is to say his flesh, and having an High Priest over the House of God, let us draw near with a true Heart in full Assurance of Faith, having our Hearts sprinkled from an evil Conscience and our Bodies washed with
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48389:192"/> pure Water.</hi> The Foundation of all our Confidence in our Access unto God, the Right and Title we have to approach unto him is laid in the
<hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> the Sacrifice he offered, the Attonement he made, and the Remission of sins which he obtained thereby, which Effect of it he declares, <hi>v. 19. Having boldness by the Blood of Jesus.</hi> The way of our Access is by pleading an Interest in his Death and Suffering, whereby an Admission and Acceptance is consecrated for us, <hi>v. 20. by a new and living way which he hath consecrated.</hi> And our encouragement to make use of this Foundation, and to engage in this Way, is taken from his discharge of the Office of an High-Priest in our behalf. And
<hi>having an High Priest over the House of God let us draw near.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But besides all this, when we come to an Actual Address unto God, that we may make use of the <hi>Boldness</hi> given us in the full Assurance of Faith, it is moreover required that our <hi>hearts be sprinkled and our bodyes washed;</hi> that is that our whole Persons be <hi>purifyed</hi> from the Defilement of sin by the Sanctification of the Spirit. And this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Believers, we cannot only oppose unto, and plead against the stupidity of such Persons by whom these things are derided, but conclude from it, that those who are unacquainted with it in some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of sincerity, are wholly uninterested in that <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> which we enquire after. We need not therefore further labour in the Confirmation of that concerning which the <hi>Testimonyes</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are so multiplyed, and whereof we have such undoubted <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> Secondly; <hi>The Nature of this Defilement of Sin</hi> must be enquired into.
<hi>Ans.</hi> (1) By some it is reckoned unto <hi>Guilt.</hi> For whereas the insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Effects of Guilt, are <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> whereby it immediately evidenced it self in our first Parents, and shame in particular is from this <hi>filth of sin,</hi> it may be esteemed an <hi>Adjunct</hi> thereof. Hence sin was said to be <hi>purged by Sacrifices</hi> when its Guilt was expiated: And Christ is said to <hi>purge our sins by himself,</hi> that is when he offered himself a Sacrifice for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. And therefore it is granted that so far as the Filth of sin was taken away, not by <hi>Actual Purification</hi> but by <hi>Legal Expiation,</hi> it is sin with its Guilt that was intended. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as we have shewed intendeth more hereby, even such an <hi>internal inherent Defilement</hi> as is taken away by <hi>real actual Sanctification</hi> and no otherwise. (2) There are some especial sins which have <hi>a peculiar Pollution</hi> and Defilement attending them, and which thereon are usually called <hi>uncleanness</hi> in a peculiar manner. The ground hereof is in that of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 18. Flee Fornication. Every sin that a man doth is without the Body: but he that committeth Fornication sinneth against his own Body;</hi> All sins of that Nature have a peculiar <hi>Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and filth accompanying them. And Holiness is sometimes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in an Opposition unto this especial Pollution, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 3. But yet this is not that which we enquire after, although it be included in it, as one especial kind of it. That we now consider alwayes insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably attends <hi>every sin</hi> as sin, as an <hi>Adjunct or Effect</hi> of it. It is the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness of all sin</hi> and not the <hi>sin of uncleanness</hi> which we intend. And for the discovery of its proper Nature we may observe:</p>
               <p>(1) That the Pollution of Sin is that Property of it whereby it is
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48389:193"/> directly opposed unto the <hi>Holiness of God,</hi> and which God expresseth his Holiness to be contrary unto. Hence he is said to be <hi>of purer eyes than to behold iniquity or to look on evil, Hab.</hi> 1. 13. It is a thing vile and loathsome under the Eyes of his Holiness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 6. So speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning it he useth that <hi>pathetical</hi> Dehortation, <hi>O do not that abominable thing which my soul hateth; Jerem.</hi> 44. 4. and with respect unto his own Holiness it is, that he sets it forth by the names of all things which are vile, filthy, loathsome, offensive, every thing that is Abominable. It is so to him as he is infinitely Pure and Holy in his own Nature. And that Consideration which ingenerates <hi>shame</hi> and self-Abhorrency on the Account of the Defilement of sin, is taken pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly from the <hi>Holiness</hi> of God. Hence it is that Persons are so often said to <hi>blush,</hi> to be <hi>ashamed,</hi> to be filled with <hi>Confusion</hi> of Face, to be
<hi>vile,</hi> to be <hi>Abased</hi> in their own sight, under a Sense and Apprehension of this filth of sin.</p>
               <p>(2) The Holiness of God is the Infinite Absolute Perfection and Rectitude of his Nature, as the Eternal Original Cause and Pattern of Truth, Uprightness and Rectitude in all. And this Holiness doth God exert as in all he doth naturally and necessarily, so particularly in his <hi>Law,</hi> which is therefore Good, Holy and Perfect, because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the Holiness of God which is impressed on it. God might not have made any Creature nor given a Law, which are free Acts of his Will. But on supposition he would do so, it was absolutely necessary from his own Nature that this <hi>Law of his should be Holy.</hi> And therefore whatever is contrary unto or different from the Law of God, is so unto and from the Holiness of God himself. Hence it followes,</p>
               <p>(3) That this Defilement and Pollution of Sin is that <hi>Pravity, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and shamefull Crookedness that is in it, with respect unto the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God as expressed in the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sin is either Original or Actual. Original Sin is the Habitual Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of our Natures unto the <hi>Holiness of God</hi> expressed in the Law of Creation. Actual Sin is our Inconformity to God and his Holiness expressed in the <hi>particular Commands of the Law:</hi> The Nature of all sin therefore consists in its <hi>Enmity,</hi> its <hi>Inconformity</hi> to the Rule. Now this Rule, which is the Law, may be considered two wayes, which give a Two-sold respect or inseparable Consequent or Adjunct unto every sin.</p>
               <p>(1) As it expresseth the <hi>Authority of God</hi> in its Precepts and and Sanction. Hence <hi>Guilt</hi> inseparably follows every sin, which is the Respect it induceth on the sinner unto the <hi>Law,</hi> upon the Account of the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Law-giver. The Act of sin passeth away, but this Guilt abideth on the Person and must do so, untill the Law be satisfied and the sinner thereon absolved. This naturally produceth
<hi>Fear</hi> which is the first Expression of a sence of Guilt. So <hi>Adam</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed it upon his sin: <hi>I heard thy Voyce and was afraid, Gen.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>(2) The Law may be considered as it expresseth the <hi>Holiness of God</hi> and his Truth which it was necessary from the Nature of God that it should doe. Hence there is in sin a peculiar <hi>Inconformity to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of God,</hi> which is the <hi>Macula,</hi> the <hi>spot, stain</hi> and <hi>filth</hi> of it, which are inseparable from it, whilest God is Holy, unless it be purged and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48389:193"/> done away as we shall shew. And this is inseparably attended with
<hi>shame</hi> which is the Expression of a sence of this <hi>filth of sin.</hi> So <hi>Adam</hi> upon his sin had his Eyes open to see his <hi>Nakedness,</hi> and was filled with
<hi>shame.</hi> This is the Order of these things. God who is the Object of our Obedience and Sin, is considered as the Supreme Law-giver. On his Law he hath impressed his Authority and his Holiness. Sin with respect unto his Authority is attended with <hi>Guilt;</hi> and this in the Conscience of the sinner produceth <hi>Fear.</hi> As it respects the Holiness of God it is attended with <hi>Filth</hi> or uncleanness, and this produceth
<hi>shame.</hi> And the Ultimate Effects of it, are on the first Account <hi>Poena Sensus,</hi> on the other <hi>Poena Damni:</hi> This therefore is the spot, the stain, the Pollution of sin, which is purged in our Sanctification. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Disorder, and shamefull Crookedness that is in sin with respect unto the Holiness of God.</p>
               <p>And herein there is a <hi>real filthiness, but spiritual;</hi> which is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with and opposed unto things materially and carnally so. <hi>Not that which goeth into a man,</hi> Meats of any sort, <hi>defile him,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>but that which cometh out of the Heart,</hi> that is <hi>spiritually</hi> with respect unto God, his Law and Holiness. And as men are taught the Guilt of sin by their own <hi>Fear</hi> which is the inseparable Adjunct of it, so are they taught the Filth of sin by their own <hi>Shame</hi> which unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably attends it. To instruct us herein is one End of the Law and the Gospel. For in the Renovation of the <hi>Law</hi> which was added to the Promise <hi>because of Transgressions, Gal.</hi> 3. 19. and in the Institutions annexed unto it, God designed to instruct us further in them both, with the Wayes whereby we may be freed from them. In the Doctrine of the Law with the Sanction and Curse of it, and the Institution of Sacrifices to make Attonement for sin, God declared the Nature of
<hi>Guilt</hi> and its Remedy. By the same Law, and by the Institution of sundry Ordinances for <hi>Purification</hi> and cleansing, as also by determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sundry <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Defilements, he makes known the Nature of this <hi>Filth</hi> and its Remedy. To what End were so many Meats and Drinks, so many Diseases and Natural Distempers, so many external
<hi>fortuitous</hi> Accidents as <hi>touching the Dead</hi> and the like, made Religiously
<hi>unclean</hi> by the Law? It was to no other but to teach us the Nature of the spiritual Defilement of sin. And to the same End together with a Demonstration of the Relief and Remedy thereof were the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of <hi>Purification</hi> instituted, which as they were Outward and Carnal purged those Uncleannesses as they also were Outward and Carnal made so by the Law. But Internal and Spiritual things were taught and presigured hereby, yea wrought and effected by vertue of their <hi>Typical</hi> Relation to Christ as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. <hi>For it the blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the Ashes of an Heyfer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifyeth to the purifying of the Flesh, how much more shall the Blood of Christ purge our Consciences from dead Works to serve the Living God.</hi> And hence the whole Work of Sanctification is expressed by opening <hi>a Fountain for sin and for uncleanness;</hi> that is, the purging of them away, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. So is it in the Gospel, where the Blood of Christ is said to <hi>purge our sins</hi> with respect to Guilt, and to wash our Souls with respect to Filth. Yea so inseparable is this
<hi>Filth</hi> from sin, and <hi>Shame</hi> from Filth, that wherever abides a sence of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48389:194"/> sin, there is a sence of this Filth with Shame. The very Heathen who had only the workings of their own Minds and Consciences for their Guide, were never able to quit themselves from a sence of this <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> of sin. And thence proceeded all those wayes of <hi>Lustration, Purgation</hi> and Cleansing, by Washings, Sacrifices and Mysterious <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious</hi> Observances which they had invented. It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only that we enquire a little into the Reasons and Causes why this <hi>pravity of sin,</hi> and <hi>discrepancy from the Holiness of God,</hi> is such a Defilement of our Natures, and so inseparably attended with <hi>shame.</hi> For without the Consideration hereof, we can never understand the true Nature of <hi>Sanctification</hi> and Holiness. And it will also then yet further appear how openly they betray their prodigious Ignorance of these things, who contend that all Grace consists in the Practice of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vertues. And we may to this Purpose observe,</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label>(1) <hi>That the Spiritual Beauty and Comeliness of the Soul consists in its Conformity unto God.</hi> Grace gives Beauty. Hence it is said of the Lord Christ, That he is <hi>fairer</hi> or more <hi>beautifull than the Children of Men,</hi> and that because <hi>Grace was poured into his lips, Psal.</hi> 45. 2. And when the Church is furnished or adorned with his Graces, he affirms her to be <hi>Fair and Comely, Cant. 1. 5. chap. 6. 4. chap.</hi> 7. 6. Christ by washing of it takes away its <hi>spots and wrinkles,</hi> rendring it <hi>beautifull,</hi> that is Holy, and without blemish, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 27. And this Beauty Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally consisted in the Image of God in us, which contained the whole Order, Harmony, and Symmetry of our Natures in all their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Actions with respect unto God, and our utmost End. That therefore which is contrary hereunto, as is all and every sin, hath a Deformity in it, or brings <hi>Spots, Stains</hi> and <hi>Wrinkles</hi> on the Soul. There is in sin all that is contrary to spiritual Beauty and Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to inward Order and Glory, and this is the <hi>Filth</hi> and Pollution of it.</p>
               <p>(2) <hi>Holiness and Conformity to God is the Honour of our Souls.</hi> It is that alone which makes them truely <hi>Noble.</hi> For all Honour consists in an Accession unto Him who is the only Spring and absolute Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessour of all that is so, in whom alone is Originally and Perfectly all Being and Substance. Now this we have alone by Holiness, or that Image of God wherein we were created. Whatever is contrary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is base, vile and unworthy. This is sin, which is therefore the only <hi>base thing</hi> in Nature. Hence it is said of some great Sinners that they had <hi>debased themselves to Hell, Isa.</hi> 57. 9. This belongs to the Pollution of Sin; that it is base, vile, unworthy, dishonouring the Soul, filling it with <hi>shame</hi> in its self and contempt from God. And there are no Persons who are not absolutely hardened, but are in their own Minds and Consciences sensible of this <hi>Baseness</hi> of sin, as they are also of the Deformity that is in it. When mens Eyes are opened to see their <hi>Nakedness,</hi> how vile and <hi>base</hi> they have made themselves by sin, they will have a sence of this Pollution not easily to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. And from hence it is, that sin hath the Propertyes and Effects of <hi>Vncleanness</hi> in the sight of God and in the Conscience of the sinner. God abhorrs, loaths it, accounts it an abominable thing, as that which is directly contrary to his Holiness, which as impressed on the Law
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48389:194"/> is the Rule of Purity, Integrity, spiritual Beauty and Honour. And in the Conscience of the sinner it is attended with <hi>Shame,</hi> as a thing deformed, loathsome, vile, base and dishonourable. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
               <p>In all in whom it is, I say unless they are blind and obdurate it fills them with shame. I speak not of such as are little or not at all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually sensible of sin or any of its propertyes, who <hi>fear</hi> not because of its Guilt, nor are <hi>disquieted</hi> by its Power, not acquainted with its <hi>Fomes</hi> or Disposition to evil, and so not <hi>ashamed</hi> of its filth; much less of such as are given over to all uncleanness with Delight and Greediness, wallowing in the pollution of it <hi>like the Sow in the Mire,</hi> who not only do the things which god abhorreth, but also have pleasure in them that do them. But those I intend who have the least real Conviction of the nature and tendency of sin, who are all in one Degree or other ashamed of it as a filthy thing. And a Casting off of <hi>outward</hi> shame, that is so from its Object, or Shame with respect unto the Conscience and Judgement of Humane Kind, as those doe who proclaim their sins as <hi>Sodom</hi> and hide them not, is the highest Aggravation of sinning and Contempt of God; and the casting out of
<hi>inward</hi> shame, with respect unto the Divine Omniscience, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Evidence of a Reprobate Mind. But in all others who have more Light and spiritual Sense it produceth <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>self-abhorrency,</hi> which hath alwayes a respect unto the Holiness of God, as <hi>Job</hi> 42. 5, 6. They see that in sin which is so <hi>vile, base</hi> and <hi>filthy,</hi> and which renders them so, that like unto men under a loathsome Disease they are not able to bear the sight of their own sores, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. 5. God detesteth, abhorreth and turneth from sin as a loathsome thing, and Man is filled with shame for it, it is therefore <hi>filthy.</hi> Yea no tongue can express the Sence which a Believing Soul hath of the <hi>uncleanness</hi> of sin with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holiness of God. And this may suffice to give a little Prospect into the Nature of this <hi>Defilement of sin,</hi> which the Scripture so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly insisteth on, and which all Believers are so sensible of.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> This Pravity or spiritual Disorder with respect unto the Holiness of God which is the shamefull Defilement of sin, is two-fold. (1) That which is <hi>Habitual</hi> in all the Faculties of our Souls by Nature, as they are the Principle of our Spiritual and Moral Operations. They are all <hi>shamefully</hi> and loathsomely depraved, out of Order, and no way correspondent unto the Holiness of God. Hence by Nature we are
<hi>wholly unclean;</hi> who can bring a clean thing out of that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean? And this uncleanness is <hi>graphically</hi> expressed under the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a wretched polluted Infant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 3, 4, 5. (2) That which is <hi>Actual</hi> in all the Actings of our Faculties as so defiled, and as far as they are so defiled. For 1. Be any sin of what Nature it will, there is a Pollution attending of it. Hence the Apostle adviseth to cleanse our selves from all <hi>Pollutions of Flesh and Spirit, 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 1. The sins that are internal and <hi>spiritual,</hi> as Pride, self-Love, Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Unbelief, have a pollution attending them as well as those which are fleshly and sensual. 2. So far as any thing of this Pravity or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order mixeth it self with the best of our Dutyes, it renders both us and them unclean. <hi>Isa. 64. 6. We are all as an unclean thing, and all our Righteousnesses are as filthy Raggs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:48389:195"/> (2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>,) This Uncleanness as it is <hi>Habitual,</hi> respecting our Natural Defilement, is <hi>equal</hi> in and unto every one that is born into the World. We are by Nature all alike polluted and that to the utmost of what our Nature is capable. But with respect unto Actual sins it is not so. For in them it hath various Degrees and Aggravations even as many as sin it self hath. (1) The <hi>Greater</hi> the sin is from its Nature or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, the greater is the Defilement wherewith it is attended. Hence there is no sin expressed under such Terms of <hi>filthiness and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrences</hi> as <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which is the greatest of sins. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 36, 37. Or, (2) There is an Aggravation of it when the <hi>whole Person</hi> is defiled, as it is in the Case of <hi>Fornication</hi> before instanced in. (3) It is heightned by a <hi>Continuance</hi> in sin, whereby an Addition is made to its Pollution every Day, and which is called <hi>Wallowing in the Mire,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
               <p>I have in this whole Discourse but touched upon this Consideration of sin which the Scripture so frequently mentions and inculcates. For as all the <hi>first Institutions of Divine Worship</hi> recorded therein had some respect hereunto, so the <hi>last Rejection</hi> of obstinate sinners mentioned in it is, <hi>Let him that is filthy</hi> or unclean <hi>be filthy still, Revel.</hi> 22. 11. Neither is there any Notion of sin whereby God would convey an Apprehension of its Nature and an Abhorrency thereof unto our Minds and Consciences, so frequently insisted on as is this of its <hi>Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And in order to our use of it unto the Discovery of the Nature of Holiness we may yet observe these three things. (1) Where this <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness</hi> abideth <hi>unpurged</hi> there neither is nor can be any <hi>true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> at all, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24. For it is universally opposed unto it, it is our unholiness. Where therefore it is absolute and purified in no Measure or Degree, there is no Work of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> no Holiness so much as begun. For in the <hi>purging</hi> hereof, it makes its entrance upon the Soul, and its Effects therein is the first Beginning of Holiness in us. I acknowledge that it is not in any at once absolutely and perfectly taken away in this World. For the Work of <hi>purging it</hi> is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Act commensurate unto the whole Work of our Sanctification. And therefore they who are truely sanctified and Holy, are yet deeply sensible of the Remainder of it in themselves, do greatly bewayl it, and earnestly endeavour after the removal of it. But there is an initial, real, sincere, and (as to all the Faculties of the Soul) <hi>universal</hi> purging of it which belongs to the Nature and Essence of Holiness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and carryed on though not absolutely perfected in this Life. And men who pretend unto a Grace and Holiness that should consist in
<hi>Moral Vertue</hi> only, without a supposition of and respect unto the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of this Pollution of sin, do but deceive their own Souls and others, so far as any are forsaken of God to give credit unto them. The Vertues of men not <hi>purged from the Vncleanness</hi> of their Natures, are an Abomination to the Lord, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. (2) Unless this <hi>unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of sin be purged and washed away, we can never come unto the Enjoyment of God. Nothing <hi>that defileth shall in any wise enter into the New Jerusalem, Revel.</hi> 21. 27. To suppose that an Unpurified Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can be brought unto the blessed Enjoyment of God, is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw both the Law and the Gospel, and to say that Christ dyed in vain. It is therefore of the same importance with the Everlasting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48389:195"/> of our Souls, to have them purged from sin. (3) We are not able of our selves without the especial Aid Assistance and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of God, in any Measure or Degree to free our selves from this <hi>Pollution</hi> neither that which is <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Habitual,</hi> nor that which is <hi>Actual.</hi> It is true, it is frequently prescribed unto us as our <hi>Duty.</hi> We are commanded to <hi>Wash our selves,</hi> to <hi>Cleanse our selves from sin,</hi> to <hi>Purge our selves</hi> from all our Iniquities and the like, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. But to suppose that whatever God requireth of us, that we have Power of our selves to do, is to make the <hi>Cross and Grace of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ of none Effect.</hi> Our Duty is our Duty constituted unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably by the Law of God, whether we have power to perform it or no, seeing we had so at our first Obligation by and unto the Law, which God is not obliged to bend unto a conformity to our Warp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor to suit unto our sinfull Weaknesses. Whatever therefore God worketh in us in a <hi>Way of Grace</hi> he prescribeth unto us in a <hi>Way of Duty,</hi> and that because although he do it in us, yet he also doth it by us, so as that the same Work is an Act of <hi>his</hi> Spirit and of <hi>our</hi> Wills as acted thereby. Of our selves therefore we are not able by any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of our own, nor wayes of our own finding out, to cleanse our selves from the Defilement of sin. <hi>If I be wicked,</hi> saith <hi>Job, why then labour I in vain? if I wash my self with Snow-water, and make my hand never so clean, yet shalt thou plunge me in the Ditch, and mine own Cloathes shall make me to be abhorred, Chap.</hi> 9. 29, 30, 31. There may be Wayes and Means used whereby an Appearance of Washing and Cleansing may be made. But when things come to be tryed in the sight of God, all will be found filthy and unclean. <hi>In vain</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>shalt thou take to thy self Sope and much Nitre, thou shalt not be purged, Jer.</hi> 2. 22. The most probable means of Cleansing, and the most effectual in our Judgement however multiplyed shall fail in this Case. Some speak much of <hi>washing away their sins by the Tears of Repentance.</hi> But Repentance as prescribed in the Scripture is of another Nature and Assigned unto another End. And for mens
<hi>Tears</hi> in this matter they are but <hi>Sope</hi> and <hi>Nitre</hi> which howsoever mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed will not produce the Effect intended. And therefore doth God in places of Scripture innumerable take this to himself as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Effect of his Spirit and Grace, namely to <hi>cleanse us from our Sins and our Iniquities.</hi> (4) The <hi>Institutions</hi> of the Law for this End to purge Uncleanness could not of themselves reach thereunto. They did indeed purifie the unclean Legally, and sanctified persons as to the purifying of the flesh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13. so that they should not on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be separated from their Priviledges in the Congregation and the Worship of God. But of themselves they could goe no further,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 2. only they did Typifie and signifie that whereby sin was really cleansed. But the <hi>real stain</hi> is too deep to be taken away by any outward Ordinances or Institutions. And therefore God as it were rejecting them all, promiseth to open another Fountain to that purpose, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. Wherefore,</p>
               <p>(5) There is a great Emptiness and Vanity in all those Aids and Reliefs which the <hi>Papal Church</hi> hath invented in this Case. Sensible they are of the <hi>spot</hi> and <hi>stain</hi> that accompanyes sin, of its Pollution and Defilement, which none can avoyd the Conscience of who are
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48389:196"/> not utterly hardned and blinded. But they are ignorant of the true and only Means and Remedy thereof. And therefore as in the Work of <hi>Justification</hi> being ignorant of the Righteousness of God, and going about to establish their own Righteousness, they submit not themselves to the Righteousness of God, as the Apostle spake of their predecessors; so in the Work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> being ignorant of the Wayes of the working of the Spirit of Grace and Efficacy of the Blood of Christ, they go about to set up their own <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and submit not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto a Complyance with the Grace of God. Thus in the first place they would, at least the most of them would, have the whole <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness</hi> of our Natures to be washed away by <hi>Baptisme, Virtute Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris operati.</hi> The Ordinance being administred without any more to doe; or any previous Qualifications of the Person internal or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal the filth of Original Sin is washed away; though it fell not out so with <hi>Simon Magus</hi> who notwithstanding he were baptized by <hi>Philip the Evangelist,</hi> and that upon his visible Profession and Confession, <hi>yet continued in the Call of Bitterness and Bond of Iniquity,</hi> and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly not cleansed from his sins. But there is a <hi>cleansing in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and Signification, and there is a Cleansing in the <hi>Reality of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> The former doth accompany <hi>Baptisme</hi> when it is rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred. With respect hereunto are men said to be <hi>purged from their old sins,</hi> that is to have made a Profession and have had a fair <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation</hi> thereof in being made partakers of the outward sign of it; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. as also to escape the Pollutions of the World, and the Lusts of the <hi>flesh; Chap.</hi> 2. 18, 20. But all this may be, and yet sin not be really purged: For not only the Outward Washing of Regeneration in the Pledge of it, but the Internal Renovation of the Holy Ghost is required thereunto. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. But having thus shifted themselves of the Filth of Original sin as easily as a man may put off his Cloathes when they are foul, they have found out <hi>many</hi> wayes whereby the ensuing Defilements that attend Actual sins may be purged or done away. There is the <hi>sprinkling of Holy Water, Confession to a Priest, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> in Fasting and some other Abstinences that are supposed to be of wonderfull vertue to this End and Purpose. And I do acknowledge that the one <hi>Art of Confession</hi> is really the greatest Invention to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the Inclinations of all Flesh, that ever this World was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withall. For as nothing is so suited unto all the Carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of the <hi>Priests</hi> be they what they will, nor so secures them a Veneration in the midst of their Looseness and worthless Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so for the People, who for the most part have other Business to doe than long to trouble themselves about their sins, or find it uneasie to be conversant about their Guilt and the Consequences of it in their Minds, it is such an expedite Course of absolute Exoneration that they may be free for other sins or Businesses, to deposite them wholly and safely with a Priest, that nothing equal unto it could ever have been invented. For the Real Way of dealing with God by Jesus Christ in these things, with Endeavours of a Participation in the Sanctifying Cleansing Work of the Holy Ghost is long, and very irksome to Flesh and Blood, besides that it is intricate and <hi>foolish</hi> unto Natural Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Unbelief. But yet so falls out, that after all these Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they can come to no perfect Rest or Satisfaction in their own
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48389:196"/> Minds. They cannot but find by Experience that their Sores some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times break forth through all these sorry Coverings unto their <hi>Annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> and their Defilements yet fill them with Shame as well as the Guilt of sin doth with Fear. Wherefore they betake themselves to their <hi>Sheat-Anchor</hi> in this storm, in the Relief which they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in another World; when, let men find themselves never so much mistaken they cannot complain of their disappointments. This is in their <hi>Purgatory,</hi> whereunto they must trust at last for the cancelling of all their <hi>odd scores,</hi> and Purging away that <hi>filth of sin</hi> which they have been unwilling to part withall in this World. But as this whole Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of <hi>Purgatory</hi> is a groundless Fable, an Invention set up in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with, and opposition unto the Sanctification of the Spirit and Cleansing Vertue of the Blood of Christ, as a matter of unspeakable more Profit and Secular Advantage unto those who have its mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment committed unto them; so it is as great an Encouragement unto Unholiness and a continuance in Sin, for those who believe it, and at the same time love the Pleasures of sin, which are the Generality of their Church, as ever was or can be found out or made use of. For, to come with a plain down-right Disswasure from Holiness and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement unto Sin, is a Design that would absolutely defeat it self, nor is capable of making Impressions on them who retain the Notion of a Difference between Good and Evil. But this <hi>Side-wind,</hi> that at once pretends to relieve men from the <hi>Filth</hi> of sin, and keeps them from the only Wayes and Means whereby it may be cleansed, insensibly leads them into a quiet pursuit of their Lusts under an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Relief when all is past and done. Wherefore setting aside such vain Imaginations, we may enquire into the true Causes and Wayes of our <hi>Purification</hi> from the Uncleanness of sin described, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the First part of our Sanctification and the Foundation of our Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness doth consist.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label>(1) That we are purged and purified from sin by the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> communicated unto us, hath been before in General confirmed by many Testimonies of the Holy Scriptures. And we may gather also from what hath been spoken wherein this Work of his doth consist. For whereas the Spring and Fountain of all the <hi>Pollution of Sin</hi> lyes in the Depravation of the Faculties of our Natures which ensued on the Loss of the Image of God, he <hi>renews</hi> them again by his Grace.
<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Our want of due answering unto the Holiness of God as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in the Law, and exemplified in our Hearts Originally, is a principal Part and <hi>universal Cause</hi> of our whole Pollution and Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by sin. For when our Eyes are opened to discern it, this is that which in the first place filleth us with shame and self-Abhorrency,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48389:197"/> and that which makes us so unacceptable yea so loathsome to God. Who is there who considereth aright the <hi>Vanity, Darkness</hi> and <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> of his Mind, the <hi>Perversness</hi> and <hi>Stubbornness</hi> of his Will, with the <hi>Disorder Irregularity</hi> and Distemper of his Affections with respect unto things Spiritual and Heavenly, who is not <hi>ashamed</hi> of, who doth not <hi>abhorr</hi> himself? This is that which hath given our Nature its Leprosie and defiled it throughout. And I shall crave leave to say, that he who hath <hi>no Experience</hi> of Spiritual shame and self-Abhorrency upon the Account of this Inconformity of his Nature and the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Soul unto the Holiness of God, is a great stranger unto this whole Work of Sanctification. Who is there that can recount the Unsteadiness of his Mind in Holy Meditation, his Low and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conceptions of Gods Excellencies, his Proneness to foolish Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and Vanities that Profit not, his Aversation to Spirituality in Duty and fixedness in Communion with God, his Proneness to things Sensual and Evil, all arising from the spiritual Irregularity of of our Natural Facultyes, but if ever he had any due Apprehensions of Divine Purity and Holiness, that is not sensible of his own Vileness and Baseness, and is not oft-times deeply affected with shame thereon? Now this whole Evil Frame is cured by the effectual working of the Holy Ghost in the rectfying and Renovation of our Natures. He giveth a New Understanding, a New Heart, New Affections, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Soul into the Image of God, <hi>Ephes. 4. 23, 24. Col.</hi> 3. 10. The way whereby he doth this hath been before so fully declared in our opening of the Doctrine of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> that it need not be here repeated. Indeed our Original Cleansing is therein, where mention is made of the <hi>Washing of Regeneration, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Therein is the Image of God restored unto our Souls. But we consider the same Work now as it is the Cause of our Holyness. Look then how far our Minds, our Hearts, our Affections are <hi>renewed by the Holy Ghost,</hi> so far are we cleansed from our spiritual habitual Pollution. Would we be cleansed from our Sins, that which is so frequently promised that we shall be, and so frequently prescribed as our Duty to be, and without which we neither have nor can have any thing of true Holiness in us, we must labour after and endeavour to grow in this <hi>Renovation of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> by the Holy Ghost. The more we have of saving Light in our Minds, of Heavenly Love in our Wills and Affections, of a constant Readiness unto Obedience in our Hearts; the more Pure are we, the more cleansed from the Pollution of sin. The Old Principle of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Nature is unclean and defiling, shamefull and loathsome. The
<hi>New Creature,</hi> the Principle of Grace implanted in the whole Soul by the Holy Ghost is <hi>Pure</hi> and purifying, Clean and Holy.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, The Holy Ghost doth Purifie and Cleanse us by <hi>strengthening</hi> our Souls by his Grace unto all Holy Duties, and against all <hi>Actual</hi> sins. It is by Actual Sins that our Natural and Habitual Pollution is encreased. Hereby some make themselves base and vile as Hell. But this also is prevented by the Gracious Actings of the Spirit. Having given us a Principle of Purity and Holyness, he so acts it in Dutyes of Obedience and in Opposition unto Sin, as that he preserves the Soul free from Defilements, or Pure and Holy according to the Tenor of the New Covenant, that is in such Measure and to such a Degree
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48389:198"/> as Universal Sincerity doth require. But it may be yet said, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hereby he makes us Pure, and prevents many future Defilements, yet how is Soul freed from those it had contracted before this work upon it, or those which it may and doth unavoidably afterwards fall into; for as there is no man doth good and sinneth not, so there is none who is not more or less defiled with Sin, whilest they are in the Body here in this World. The Apostle answereth this Objection or Enquiry, 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 7, 8, 9. If we say we have no sin we deceive our selves and the Truth is not in us.</hi> But if Sin be in us we are defiled, and how shall we be Cleansed? <hi>God is just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</hi> But how may this be done, by what means may it be accomplished? <hi>The Blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label>(2) It is therefore the <hi>Blood of Christ</hi> in the Second place which is the <hi>Meritorious</hi> procuring, and so the Effective Cause that <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purgeth</hi> us from our sins, by an especial Application of it unto our Souls the Holy Ghost. And there is not any Truth belonging unto the Mystery of the Gospel which is more plainly and evidently asserted, as hath in part been made to appear before. <hi>The Blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin, 1 Joh. 1. 7. He hath washed us from our sins in his own Blood, Revel. 1. 5. The Blood of Christ purgeth our Consciences from dead Works that we may serve the Living God, Heb. 9. 14. He gave himself for his Church that he might wash and cleanse it, Ephes. 5. 26. To Purifie to himself a peculiar People, Tit.</hi> 2. 14. Besides, whatever is spoken in the whole Scripture concerning purifying the Unclean, the Leprous, the Defiled, by Sacrifices or other Institutions of the Old Testament, it is all Instructive in and Directive unto the Purifying Nature of the Blood of Christ, from whence alone these Institutions had their Efficacy; and the Vertue of it is promised under that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. And this the Faith and Experience of all Believers doth confirm; for they are no Imaginations of their own, but what being built on the Truth and Promises of God, yield sensible Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Relief and Refreshment unto their Souls. This they believe, this they pray for, and find the Fruits and Effects of it in themselves. It may be some of them do not, it may be few of them do comprehend distinctly the <hi>Way</hi> whereby, and the Manner how the Blood of Christ so long since shed and offered, should cleanse them now from their sins. But the Thing it self they do believe as it is revealed, and find the use of it in all wherein they have to do with God. And I must say, (let Profane and Ignorant Persons, whilest they please, deride what they understand not, nor are able to disprove) that the Holy Spirit of God which leadeth Believers into all Truth and enableth them to pray ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mind and Will of God, doth guide them in and by the working and Experience of Faith to pray for those things the depths of whose Mysteries they cannot comprehend. And he who well study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the things which he is Taught of the Spirit to ask of God, will find a Door opened into much spiritual Wisdom and Knowledge. For (let the World rage on) in those Prayers which Believers are taught, and enabled unto by the Holy Ghost helping of them as a Spirit of Supplications, there are Two things inexpressible. (1) The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48389:198"/> Labouring and <hi>Spiritual Working</hi> of the Sanctified Heart and Affections towards God, wherein consist those <hi>Sighs and Groans that cannot be uttered. Rom.</hi> 8. 26. God alone sees and knowes and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the fervent Workings of the New Creature when acted by the Holy Ghost in Supplications. And so it is added in the next words,
<hi>Vers. 27. An he who searcheth the Hearts knoweth</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>what is the meaning of the Spirit,</hi> what it savours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines unto. It is not any distinct or separate Acting of the <hi>Spirit</hi> by himself that is intended, but what and how he works in the Hearts of Believers as he is a Spirit of Grace and Supplication. And this is known <hi>only unto him</hi> who is the Searcher of Hearts, and as he is so. And he knoweth what is the bent, frame, inclination and acting of the Inward Man in Prayer from the Power of the Spirit, which they themselves in whom they are wrought do not fathom nor reach the Depth of. This he doth in the <hi>Subject of Prayer,</hi> the Hearts and Minds of Believers, the Effects of his Operation in them are <hi>inexpressible.</hi> (2) As to the <hi>Object of Prayer</hi> or things prayed for, he doth in and by the Word so represent and exhibit the Truth, Reality, Subsistence, Power and Efficacy of spiritual Mysterious things unto the Faith and Affections of Believers, that they have a real and Experimental sence of, do mix Faith with, and are affected by those things now made nigh, now realized unto them, which it may be they are not able Doctrinally and distinctly to explain in their proper Notions. And thus do we oft-times see Men low and weak in their Notional Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of things, yet in their Prayers led into Communion with God in the Highest and Holyest Mysteries of his Grace, having an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Life and Power of the Things themselves in their own Hearts and Souls. And hereby do their Faith, Love, Affiance and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence unto God, act and Exercise themselves. So is it with them in this matter of the actual present purifying of the Pollutions of sin by the Blood of Jesus Christ, the Way whereof we shall now briefly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> 1. Therefore by the <hi>Blood of Christ</hi> herein, is intended the Blood of his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> with the Power Vertue and Efficacy thereof. And the Blood of a Sacrifice fell under a double Consideration. (1) As it was
<hi>offered</hi> unto God to make Attonement and Reconciliation: (2) As it was <hi>sprinkled</hi> on other things for their Purging and Sanctification. Part of the Blood in every Propitiatory Sacrifice was still to be <hi>sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> round about the Altar, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 11. And in the Great Sacrifice of Expiation, some of the Blood of the Bullock was to be sprinkled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Mercy-seat seven time; Levit.</hi> 16. 14. This our Apostle fully expresseth in a great and signal Instance, <hi>Heb. 9. 19, 20, 21, 22. For when Moses had spoken every Precept to all the People according to the Law, he took the Blood of Calves and of Goats, with Water and Scarlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wooll and Hyssop, and sprinkled both the Book and all the People, saying This is the Blood of the Testament which he hath enjoyned unto you, and almost all things are by the Law purged with Blood.</hi> Wherefore the Blood of Christ as it was the Blood of his Sacrifice hath these two Effects, and falls under this double Consideration. (1) As he <hi>offered</hi> himself by the Eternal Spirit unto God to make Attonement for Sin,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48389:199"/> and procure Eternal Redemption. (2) As it is <hi>sprinkled</hi> by the same Spirit on the Consciences of Believers to purge them from Dead works, as <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14. And hence it is called with respect unto our Sanctification the <hi>Blood of Sprinkling, Heb.</hi> 12. 24. For we have the Sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience through the sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>2. The Blood of Christ in his Sacrifice is still alwayes and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in the same <hi>Condition,</hi> of the same Force and Efficacy as it was in that hour wherein it was shed. The Blood of other Sacrifices was alwayes to be used <hi>immediately</hi> upon its Effusion; for if it were Cold and congealed, it was of no Use to be offered or to be sprinkled;
<hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 11. Blood was appointed to make Attonement as the Life or Animal Spirits were in it. But the Blood of the Sacrifice of Christ is alwayes hot and warm, having the same <hi>Spirits of Life and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> still moving in it. Hence the Way of approach which we have to God thereby is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 20; alwayes
<hi>Living,</hi> and yet <hi>alwayes as Newly slain.</hi> Every one therefore who at any Time hath an especial actual Interest in the Blood of Christ as Sacrificed, hath as real a Purification from the Defilement of sin as he had <hi>Typically</hi> who stood by the Priest and had Blood or Water sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on him. For the Holy Ghost diligently declares that whatever was done Legally, Carnally or Typically, by any of the Sacrifices of Old at any time as to the Expiation or Purification of sin, that was all done really and Spiritually by that one Sacrifice, that is the Offering and Sprinkling of the Blood of Christ, and abideth to be so done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. To this Purpose is the Substance of our Apostles Discourse in the Ninth and Tenth Chapters of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And they had Various sorts of Sacrifices wherein to this End the Blood of them was sprinkled, they being Propitiatory in their Offering. As (1) There was the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or continual <hi>Burnt-Offering</hi> of a Lamb or Kid for the whole Congregation Morning and Evening, whose Blood was sprinkled as at other Times. And hereby the Habitual Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Congregation, that they might be Holy to the Lord, and their Cleansing from the daily incursions of secret and unknown sins was signified and carryed on. (2) On the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> this <hi>Juge Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium</hi> was doubled Morning and Evening, denoting a Peculiar and abounding Communication of Mercy and purging Grace through the Administration of Instituted Ordinances on that Day. (3) There was the <hi>Great Annual Sacrifice</hi> at the Feast of Expiation, when by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the <hi>Sin-Offering</hi> and the <hi>Scape-Goat</hi> the whole Congregation were purged from all their known and great sins, and recovered into a state of Legal Holiness. And other stated Sacrifices there were. (4) There were <hi>Occasional Sacrifices</hi> for every one according as he found his Condition to require. For those who were Clean one Day, yea one Hour, might by some Miscarriage or surprizal be Unclean the next; but there was a Way continually ready for any Man's Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by his Offering unto that Purpose. Now the Blood of Christ must continually and upon all Occasions answer unto all these, and accomplish Spiritually what they did Legally effect and Typically represent. This our Apostle asserts and proves; <hi>Heb. 1. v.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Thereby is the gradual carrying on of our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48389:199"/> habitually effected, which was signified by the continual Daily Sacrifice. From thence is especial Cleansing Vertue communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto us by the Ordinances of the Gospel, as is expressly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 25, 26. denoted by the doubling of the Daily Sacrifice on the Sabbath. By it are we purged from all our sins whatever, great or small, as was typified in the Great Sacrifice on the Day of Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And unto him have we continual recourse upon all Occassions of our spiritual Defilements whatever. So was his Blood as to its puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Vertue to answer and accomplish all Legal Institutions. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it doth so that of the <hi>Ashes of the red Heyfer, Numb.</hi> 19. which was a standing Ordinance whereby every one who was any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed might immediately be cleansed: And he who would not make Application thereunto was to be cut off from the People, <hi>v.</hi> 20. And it is no otherwise with respect unto the Blood of Christ, in our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Defilements; Thence is it called <hi>a Fountain opened for sin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, Zech.</hi> 13. 1. And he who neglects to make Application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, shall perish in his Uncleanness and that Eternally.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> Father to clear this whole Matter, two things are to be enquired into. (1) How doth the <hi>Blood of Christ</hi> thus <hi>Cleanse</hi> us from our sins, or what it is that is done thereby. (2) How we come to be made
<hi>Partakers</hi> of the Benefit thereof, or come to be interested therein.</p>
               <p>As to the First, it must be observed what hath been declared before, that the <hi>Vncleanness</hi> we Treat of is not Physical or Corporeal, but
<hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> only. It is the Inconformity of Sin unto the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of God as represented in the Law, whence it is Loathsome to God, and attended with Shame in us. Now wherever there is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest obtained in the Purifying Vertue of the Blood of Christ, it doth (by the Will, Law Appointment of God) do these two Things. 1. It takes away all <hi>loathsomeness</hi> in the sight of God, not from sin in the Abstract, but from the Sinner; so that he shall be as one abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely washed and purified before him. See <hi>Isa. 1. 16, 18. Psal. 51. 7. Ephes.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27. 2. It taketh away <hi>shame</hi> out of the Conscience, and gives the Soul Boldness in the presence of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20, 21, 22. When these things are done, then is sin purged and our Souls are cleansed.</p>
               <p>(2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>,) It may be enquired, How we are to <hi>apply</hi> our selves unto the Blood of Christ for our Purification, or how we may come continually to <hi>partake</hi> of the Vertue of it as it is sprinkled unto that Purpose. Now because what we do herein is wrought in us by the Spirit of God, my Principal Design being to declare his Work in our Sanctification, I shall at once declare both his Work and our Duty in the following Instances.</p>
               <p>1. It is he who discovereth unto us and spiritually convinceth us of the <hi>Pollution of Sin,</hi> and of our Defilements thereby. Something indeed of this Kind will be wrought by the Power of <hi>Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> awakened and excited by Ordinary outward Means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. For wherever there is a sence of Guilt there will be in some kind a sence of Filth; as Fear and Shame are inseparable. But this sence alone will never guide us to the Blood of Christ for Cleansing. Such a sight and Conviction of it as fill us with self-Abhorrency
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48389:200"/> and Abasement, as may cause us to loath our selves for the Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in it, is required of us. And this is the Work of the Holy Ghost belonging to that peculiar Conviction of sin which is from him alone. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8. I mean, that self-abhorrency, shame and Confusion of Face with respect unto the Filth of sin, which is so often mentioned in the Scripture as a Gracious Duty, as nothing is an higher Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of sin than for men to carry themselves with a Carnal Boldness with God and in his Worship, whilest they are unpurged from their Defilements. In a sence hereof the <hi>Publican</hi> stood afar off as one asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and destitute any Confidence for a nearer Approach. So the Holy Men of Old professed to God, that they blushed and were <hi>asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> to lift up their <hi>Faces</hi> unto him. Without this Preparation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we come to know the <hi>Plague</hi> of our own Hearts, the Infection of our Leprosie, the Defilement of our Souls, we shall never make Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication unto the Blood of Christ for Cleansing in a due Manner. This therefore in the First place is required of us, as the First Part of our Duty, and First Work of the Holy Ghost herein.</p>
               <p>2. The Holy Ghost proposeth declareth and presents unto us the only <hi>true Remedy,</hi> the only Means of Purification. <hi>When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian and sent to King Jareb, yet would he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound, Hos.</hi> 5. 13. When men begin to discern their Defilements they are apt to think of many Wayes for their purging. What false Wayes have been invented to this Purpose hath been before declared; and every one is ready to find out a Way of his own; every one will apply his own <hi>Sope</hi> and his own <hi>Nitre.</hi> Though the only <hi>Fountain for Cleansing</hi> be nigh unto us, yet we cannot see it untill the Holy Ghost open our Eyes as he did the Eyes of <hi>Hagar;</hi> He it is who shews it unto us, and leads us unto it. This is an Eminent Part of his office and Work. The principal End of his sending and consequently of his whole Work was to Glorifie the Son; as the End and Work of the Son was to Glorifie the Father. And the great Way whereby he Glorifieth Christ is by <hi>shewing such things unto us, Joh.</hi> 16. 14. And without his Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we can know nothing of Christ, nor of the things of Christ; for he is not sent in vain to shew us the things that we can see of our selves. And what is more so of Christ than his Blood and its Efficacy for the purging of our sins? We never therefore discern it spiritually and in a due Manner but by him. To have a true spiritual sence of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement of Sin, and a gracious View of the Cleansing Vertue of the Blood of Christ, is an eminent Effect of the Spirit of Grace. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it there may be in the Workings of an awakened Natural Conscience, with some Beams of outward Gospel-Light falling on it: But there is nothing in it of the Work of the Spirit. This therefore Secondly we must endeavour after if we intend to be cleansed by the Blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>3. It is he who worketh <hi>Faith</hi> in us, whereby we are actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in the purifying Vertue of the Blood of Christ. By Faith we receive Christ himself, and by Faith do we receive all the Benefits of his Mediation, that is, as they are tendred unto us in the Promises of God. He is our Propitiation through Faith in his Blood as <hi>offered;</hi> and he is our Sanctification through Faith in his Blood as <hi>sprinkled.</hi>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:48389:200"/> And particular acting of Faith on the Blood of Christ, for the cleansing of the Soul from sin, is required of us. A renewed Conscience is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of a Pollution in every sin, and is not freed from the shame of it without a particular Application unto the Blood of Christ. It comes by Faith to the Fountain set open for sin and Uncleanness, as the sick man to the Pool of Healing Waters, and waiteth for a season to be cleansed in it. So <hi>David</hi> on the Defilement he had contracted by his great sins, addresseth himself unto God with that Prayer, <hi>Purge me with Hyssop, and I shall be clean, wash me and I shall be whiter than snow; Psal.</hi> 51. 7. He alludeth unto the purging of the <hi>Leprous</hi> person, the Ordinance whereof is Instituted, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. 5, 6, 7; or that more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Institution for the Purification of all Legal Uncleanness, by the
<hi>Water of Separation</hi> made of the <hi>Ashes of red</hi> Heyfer, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 4, 5, 6. which our Apostle hath respect unto, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. For both these Purifications were made by the Sprinkling of Blood or Water with
<hi>Hyssop.</hi> It is plain I say he alludeth unto these Institutions, but it is as plain they are not the things which he intendeth. For there was not in the Law any purging by <hi>Hyssop</hi> for Persons guilty of such sins as he lay under. And therefore he professeth in the close of the Psalm, that <hi>Sacrifice and Burnt-Offering god would not accept,</hi> in his Case, <hi>v.</hi> 16. It was therefore that which was signified by those Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions which he made his Application unto; namely, really to the
<hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> by which he might be Justified from all things, from which he could not <hi>be Justified by the Law of Moses, Acts</hi> 13. 39. and so likewise purifyed. In like manner do all Believers make an <hi>actual Application</hi> unto the Blood of Christ for the purging away of their sins, which untill it is done they have a Conscience of sin, that is condemning them for sin, and filling them with Shame and Fear,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> And this Actual <hi>Application</hi> by Faith unto the Blood of Christ for
<hi>Cleansing,</hi> the Mystery whereof is scorned by many as a thing <hi>Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and unintelligible, consists in these Four things. (1) A <hi>spiritual View</hi> and <hi>Due Consideration</hi> of the Blood of Christ in his Sacrifice, as proposed in the Promises of the Gospel for our Cleansing and Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<hi>Look unto me,</hi> saith he, <hi>and be saved, Isa,</hi> 45. 22. which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the whole Work of our Salvation and all the Means thereof. Our way of coming unto our Interest therein is by <hi>Looking to him,</hi> namely as he is proposed unto us in the Promise of the Gospel. For
<hi>as the Serpent was lifted up by Moses in the Wilderness, so was he in his Sacrifice on the Cross lifted up, Joh.</hi> 3. 14. And so in the Gospel is he represented unto us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. And the Means whereby they were heal'd in the Wilderness, was by <hi>looking</hi> unto the Serpent that was lifted up. Herein then doth Faith first Act it self, by a spiritual View and due Consideration of the Blood of Christ, as proposed unto us in the Gospel for the only Means of our Purification. And the more we abide in this Contemplation, the more Effectual will our success be in our Application thereto. (2) Faith actually <hi>relyeth</hi> on his Blood, for the real effecting of the great Work and End for which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto us. For God sets him forth, as to be a <hi>Propitiation through Faith in his Blood</hi> as offered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. so to be our <hi>Sanctification</hi>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:48389:201"/> through Faith in his Blood as sprinkled. And the Establishing of this especial Faith in our Souls is that which the Apostle aims at in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Reasoning, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. And his Conclusion unto that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is so evident, that he encourageth us thereon to draw nigh in the <hi>full Assurance of Faith, Heb.</hi> 10. 22. (3) Faith worketh herein by <hi>Fervent Prayer,</hi> as it doth in its whole Address unto God, with Respect unto his Promises; because for all these things God will be sought unto by the House of <hi>Israel.</hi> By this Means the Soul brings it self nigh unto its own Mercy. And this we are directed unto <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15, 16. (4) An <hi>Acquiescency</hi> in the Truth and Faithfulness of God, for Cleansing by the Blood of Christ, whence we are freed from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging perplexing shame, and have Boldness in the Presence of God.</p>
               <p>4. The Holy Ghost <hi>actually Communicates</hi> the cleansing Purifying Vertue of the Blood of Christ unto our Souls and Consciences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are freed from <hi>shame</hi> and have Boldness towards God. For the whole work of the Application of the Benefits of the Mediation of Christ unto Believers, is his properly. And these are the things which Believers aim at and intend in all their servent Supplications for the Purifying and Cleansing of their Souls by the <hi>sprinkling and washing of the Blood of Christ;</hi> the Faith and Perswasion whereof give them Peace and Holy Boldness in the presence of God, without which they can have nothing but <hi>shame</hi> and Confusion of Face in a sence of their own Pollutions.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label>(3) <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Instrumental Cause</hi> of our Purification. <hi>Purifying their Hearts by Faith, Acts</hi> 15. 9. The two unfailing Evidences of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Faith are, that <hi>within</hi> it <hi>purifyeth the Heart,</hi> and <hi>without</hi> it <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Love.</hi> These are the Touch-stone whereon Faith may, yea ought to be tryed. We <hi>purifie our Souls in obeying the Truth through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. That is, by <hi>Believing</hi> which is our Original Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the Truth. And hereby are our Souls purified: Unbelievers and Unclean are the same. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. For they have nothing in them whereby they might be Instrumentally cleansed. And we are <hi>Purified by Faith.</hi> Because (1) Faith it self is the <hi>principal</hi> Grace whereby our Nature is restored unto the Image of God, and so freed from our
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48389:201"/> Original Defilement; <hi>Col. 3. 10. Joh.</hi> 17. 3. (2) It is by Faith on our part whereby we receive the Purifying Vertue and Influences of the Blood of Christ whereof we have before Discoursed. Faith is the Grace whereby we constantly adhere and cleave unto Christ. <hi>Deut. 4. 4. Josh. 23. 8. Acts</hi> 11. 10. And if the Woman who touched his Garment in Faith, obtained Vertue from him to heal her <hi>Issue of Blood,</hi> shall not those who cleave unto him continually derive Vertue from him for the healing of their spiritual Defilements. (3) It is by the Working of Faith <hi>principally,</hi> whereby those Lusts and Corruptions which are Defiling, are mortified, subdued, and gradually wrought out of our Minds. All actual Defilements spring from the Remainders of defiling Lusts, and their depraved Workings in us, <hi>Heb. 12. 15. Jam.</hi> 1. 14. How Faith worketh to the correcting and subduing of them, by deriving supplyes of the Spirit and Grace to that End from Jesus Christ, as being the Means of our abiding in him whereon alone those supplyes do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 3, 4, 5. as also by the Acting of all other Graces which are contrary to the Polluting Lusts of the Flesh and destructive of them, is usually declared, and we must not too far enlarge on these things. (4) Faith takes in all the <hi>Motives</hi> which are proposed unto us, to stir us up unto our utmost Endeavours and Diligence in the use of all Means and Wayes for the preventing of the Defilements of sin, and for the Cleansing our Minds and Consciences from the Relicts of Dead Works. And these Motives which are <hi>great</hi> and <hi>many</hi> may be reduced unto Two Heads: (1) <hi>A Participation of the Excellent Promises of God</hi> at the Present; the Consideration hereof brings a singular Enforcement on the Souls of Believers to endeavour after universal Purity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. And (2) the <hi>future Enjoyment</hi> of God in Glory, whereunto we cannot attain without being purifyed from sin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1. Now these Motives which are the Springs of our Duty in this Matter, are received and made Efficacious by Faith only.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label>(4) Purging from sin is likewise in the Scripture ascribed unto <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi> of all sorts. Hence they are called <hi>Gods Furnace,</hi> and his
<hi>Fining-Pot, Isa. 31. 9. Chap.</hi> 48. 10. whereby he taketh away the Dross and Filth of the Vessels of his House. They are called <hi>Fire</hi> that trieth the Wayes and Works of Men, consuming their Hay and Stubble, and purifying their Gold and Silver, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. And this they do through an Efficacy unto the Ends communicated unto them, in the design and by the Spirit of God. For by and in the Cross of Christ, they were cut off from the Curse of the First Covenant, whereunto all Evil and Trouble did belong, and implanted into the Covenant of Grace. The Tree of the Cross being cast into the Waters of Affliction hath rendred them Wholsom and Medicinal. And as the Lord Christ being the Head of the Covenant, all the Afflictions and Persecutions that befall his Members are Originally his, <hi>Isa. 63. 9. Acts 9. 5. Col.</hi> 1. 24. so they all tend to work us unto a Conformity unto him in Purity and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And they work towards this Blessed End of purifying the Soul several wayes. For (1) They have in them some Tokens of Gods Displeasure against sin, which those who are Exercised by them are led by the Consideration of unto a fresh View of the Vileness of it. For although Afflictions are an Effect of Love, yet it is of Love mixed with
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48389:202"/> Care, to obviate and prevent Distempers. Whatever they are else they are alwayes <hi>Chastisements;</hi> and Correction respects Faults. And it is our safest course in every Affliction to lodge the Adequate Cause of it in our own Deserts; as the Woman did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 18. and as God directs, <hi>Psal. 81. 30, 31, 32. Lament.</hi> 3. 33, 34. And this is one Difference between his Chastiments and those of the Fathers of our Flesh; that he doth it <hi>not for his Pleasure, Heb.</hi> 12. 9, 10. Now a View of <hi>sin</hi> under Suffering makes men loath and abhorre themselves for it, and to be ashamed of it. And this is the first step towards our Purifying of our selves by any Wayes appointed for it. Self-pleasing in <hi>Sin</hi> is the highest Degree of our Pollution; and when we loath our selves for it, we are put into the Way at least of seeking after a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. (2) Afflictions take off the Beauty and Allurements of all <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Good Things</hi> and their Comforts, by which the Affections are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to commit Folly and Lewdness with them; that is to embrace and cleave unto them inordinately, whence many Defilements do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensue
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. This God designs them for, even to wither all the Flowrings of this World in the Minds of men, by discovering their Emptiness, Vanity and Insufficiency to give Relief. This intercepts the disorderly entercourse which is apt to be between them and our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections whereby our Minds are polluted. For there is a Pollution attending the least inordinate Actings of our Mind and Affections towards Objects either in their own nature sinfull, or such as may be rendred so by an Excess in us towards them, whilest we are under the Command of Loving the Lord our God with all our Minds, Souls, and strength, and that alwayes: (3) Afflictions take off the <hi>Edge,</hi> and put a Deadness on those Affections whereby the Corrupt Lusts of the Mind and Flesh, which are the Spring and Cause of all our Defilements do act themselves. They curb those Vigorous and Brisk Affections which were alwayes ready press'd for the service of Lust, and which sometimes carry the Soul into the pursuit of sin, like the <hi>Horse into the Battail</hi> with Madness and Fury. They are no more such prepared Channels for the <hi>Fomes</hi> of Concupiscence to empty it self into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, nor such <hi>Vehicles</hi> for the spirits of Corrupted Lusts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. God I say by Afflictions brings a kind of Death unto the World and the Pleasures of it upon the Desires and Affections of the Soul, which render them unserviceable unto the Remainder of Defiling Lusts and Corruptions. This in some indeed endures but for a season, as when in Sickness, Wants, Fears, Distresses, Losses, Sorrowes, there is a great appearance of Mortification, when yet the strength of sin and the Vigour of Carnal Affections do speedily revive upon the least outward Relief. But with Believers it is not so, but by all their Chastisements they are really more and more delivered from the Pollutions of <hi>Sin,</hi> and made Partakers of Gods Holiness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16, 17. (4) God doth by them excite, stir up and draw forth all the Graces of the Spirit into a constant Diligent and Vigorous <hi>Exercise,</hi> and therein the Work of cleansing the Soul from the Pollution of sin is carried on. A time of Affliction is the Especial <hi>season</hi> for the peculiar Exercise of all Grace. For the Soul can then no otherwise support or relieve it self. For it is cut short or taken off from other Comforts and Reliefs, every <hi>sweet</hi> thing being made <hi>bitter</hi> unto it. It must therefore live not only by
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48389:202"/> Faith and Love, and Delight in God, but in some sence upon them. For if in their Exercise, Supportment and Comfort be not obtained we can have none. Therefore doth such a Soul find it necessary to be constantly abounding in the Exercise of Grace, that it may in any measure be able to support it self under its Troubles or Sufferings. Again, there is no other Way whereby a Man may have a sanctified Use of Afflictions, or a good Issue out of them, but by the assiduous Exercise of Grace. This God calls for, this he designs, and without it Afflictions have no other End but to make men Miserable; and they will either have no Deliverance from them, or such a one as shall tend to their farther Misery and Ruine.</p>
               <p>And so have we taken a View of the First Part of our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Holiness, which I have the more largely insisted on, because the Consideration of it is utterly neglected by them who frame us an Holiness to consist only in the Practice of <hi>Moral Vertue.</hi> And I do not know but what hath been delivered may be looked on as <hi>Fanatical</hi> and <hi>Enthusiastical.</hi> Yet is there no other Reason why it should be so, but only because it is taken from the Scripture. Neither doth that so much insist on any Consideration of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> as this of the Pollution of the one, and the Purifying of it by the other. And to whom the Wisdom and Words of the Holy Ghost are displeasing, we cannot in these things give any satisfaction. And yet I could easily demonstrate, that they were well known to the Ancient Writers of the Church, and for the substance of them were discerned and discussed by the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> in their Manner. But where men hate the <hi>Practice</hi> of Holiness, it is to no Purpose to teach them the <hi>Nature</hi> of it.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> But we may not pass over these things without some Reflections upon our selves, and some Consideration of our Concernment in them. And First, Hence we may take a View of our own <hi>State</hi> and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Nature. It is usefull for us all to be looking back into it; and it is necessary for them who are under it to be fully acquainted with it. Therein are we wholly defiled, polluted, and every way unclean. There is a <hi>Spiritual Leprosie</hi> spread all over our Natures, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us loathsom to God, and puts us in a state of <hi>separation</hi> from him. They who were Legally unclean were separated from the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therein all the Pledges of Gods Gracious Presence, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 2. It is so Virtually with all them who are <hi>spiritually</hi> defiled, under that Pollution which is Natural and Universal; they are abhorred of God and separated from him, which was signified thereby. And the Reason why so many Laws with so great severity and exactness were given about the <hi>Cleansing of a Leprous person,</hi> and the Judgement to be made thereon, was only to declare the Certainty of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, <hi>that no unclean person should approach unto him.</hi> Thus is it with all by Nature, and whatever they do of themselves to be quit of it, it doth but hide and not cleanse it. <hi>Adam</hi> cured neither his Nakedness nor the <hi>shame</hi> of it by his <hi>Fig-leaves.</hi> Some have no other Covering of their Natural Filth but outward Ornaments of the Flesh, which encrease it, and indeed rather proclaim it than hide it. The Greatest Filth in the World is covered with the greatest Bravery. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 16. 17. Whatever we do of our selves in answer unto our
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48389:203"/> Convictions, is a <hi>Covering</hi> not a <hi>Cleansing.</hi> And if we dye in this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unwashed, uncleansed, unpurified, it is utterly impossible that ever we should be admitted into the Blessed Presence of the Holy God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. Let no man deceive you then with Vain Words. It is not the doing of a few Good Works, it is not an outward Profession of Religion, that will give you an <hi>Access with Boldness</hi> and Joy unto God. Shame will cover you when it will be too late. Unless you are <hi>washed</hi> by the Spirit of God, and in the Blood of Christ from the Pollutions of your Natures, you shall not inherit the Kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 9, 10, 11. Yea you will be an horrid spectacle unto Saints and Angels, yea to your selves, unto one another, when the shame of your Nakedness shall be made to appear, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 24. If therefore you would not persih and that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if you would not perish as base defiled Creatures, <hi>an abhorring unto all flesh,</hi> Then when your Pride, and your Wealth, and your Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and your Ornaments, and your Dutyes, will stand you in no stead, look out betimes after that only way of <hi>purifying</hi> and cleansing your Souls, which God hath ordained. But if you love your Defilements, if you are proud of your Pollutions, if you satisfie your selves with your outward Ornaments; whether <hi>Moral,</hi> of Gifts, Dutyes, Profession, Conversation; or <hi>Natural,</hi> of Body, Wealth, Apparel, Gold and Silver; there is no Remedy, you must perish for ever, and that under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Basest and Vilest part of the Creation.</p>

               <p>1. Labour after an <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with it, to know it in its Nature and Effects. Although the Scripture so abounds in the Assertion and Declaration of it as we have shewed, and Believers find a sence of it in their Experience, yet men in common take little Notice of it. Somewhat they are affected with the <hi>Guilt</hi> of sin, but little or not at all with its <hi>Filth.</hi> So they can escape the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God which they have provoked, they regard not their unanswerableness unto his
<hi>Holiness</hi> whereby they are Polluted. How few indeed do enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pravity of their Natures, that Vileness which is come upon them by the Loss of the Image of God, or do take themselves to be much concerned therein? How few do consider aright that <hi>Fomes</hi> and filthy Spring which is continually bubling up crooked, perverse, defiled Imaginations in their Hearts, and influencing their Affections unto the Lewdness of depraved Concupiscence? Who meditates upon the <hi>Holiness</hi> of God in a due Manner, so as to ponder what we our selves ought to be, how Holy, how Upright, how Clean, if we intend
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48389:203"/> to please him or enjoy him? With what Appearances, what Out-sides of things are most men satisfied? Yea how do they please themselves in the shades of their own Darkness and Ignorance of these things, when yet an unacquaintedness with this Pollution of sin is unavoidably ruinous unto their Souls? See the Danger of it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18. Those who would be <hi>cleansed</hi> from it must first know it; and although we cannot do so aright without some convincing Light of the Spirit of God, yet are there Duties required of us in Order thereunto. As (1) To <hi>Search the Scripture,</hi> and to consider seriously what it declareth concerning the Condition of our Nature after the Loss of the Image of God. Doth it not declare that it is shamefully naked, destitute of all Beauty and Comeliness, wholly polluted and defiled? And what is said of that nature which is common unto all, is said of every one who is Partaker of it. Every one is <hi>gone aside, every one is become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together filthy,</hi> or stinking, <hi>Psal.</hi> 53. 3. This is the Glass wherein every man ought to Contemplate himself, and not in foolish flattering Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections from his own Proud Imaginations; And he that will not hence learn his Natural Deformity, shall live <hi>Polluted</hi> and dye <hi>Accursed.</hi> (2) He who hath received the Testimony of the Scripture concerning his corrupted and polluted Estate, if he will be at the Pains to trie and Examine himself by the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Causes</hi> that are assigned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will have a farther View of it. When men read, hear, or are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in what the Scripture teacheth concerning the Defilement of
<hi>Sin,</hi> and giving some Assent to what is spoken, without an Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own <hi>state</hi> in particular, or bringing their Souls unto that
<hi>Standard</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> they will have very little advantage thereby; Multitudes learn that they are polluted by Nature which they cannot gainsay, but yet really find no such thing in themselves. But when men will bring their own Souls to the <hi>Glass of the Perfect Law,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how it is with them in respect of that Image of God wherein they were at first created, what manner of Persons they ought to be with respect unto the Holiness of God, and what they are, how Vain are their Imaginations, how Disorderly are their Affections, how Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse all the Actings of their Minds, they will be ready to say with the Leprous Man, <hi>Vnclean, unclean.</hi> But they are but few who will take the pains to search their own Wounds, it being a matter of smart and trouble to corrupt and carnal Affections. Yet (3) <hi>Prayer</hi> for Light and Direction herein is required of all as a Duty. For a Man to know himself, was of Old esteemed the highest Attainment of Humane Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Some men will not so much as enquire into themselves, and some men dare not, and some neglect the doing of it from <hi>spiritual sloth</hi> and other deceitfull Imaginations. But he that would ever be purged from his sins, must thus far make bold with himself, and dare to be thus far Wise. And in the use of the Means before prescribed, considering his own Darkness and the Treacheries of his Heart, he is to <hi>pray</hi> fervently that God by his Spirit would guide and assist him in his <hi>search</hi> after the Pravity and Defilement of his Nature. Without this he will never make any great or usefull Discoveries. And yet the discerning hereof is the first Evidence that a Man hath received the least Ray of Supernatural Light. The Light of a Natural Conscience will convince Men of, and reprove them for <hi>actual</hi> sins as to their <hi>Guilt,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48389:204"/> Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. But the meer Light of Nature is dark and confused about its own Confusion. Some of the Old <hi>Philosophers</hi> discerned in general that our Nature was disordered, and complained thereof: But as the Principal Reason of their Complaints was because it would not throughout serve the Ends of their Ambition, so of the Causes and Nature of it, with respect unto God and our Eternal Condition, they knew nothing of it at all. Nor is it discerned but by a <hi>Supernatural Light</hi> proceeding immediately from the Spirit of God. If any there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have an Heart or Wisdom to know their own Pollution by sin, without which they know nothing of themselves unto any Purpose, let them pray for that Directing Light of the Spirit of God, without which they can never attain to any usefull Knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>2. Those who would indeed be purged from the <hi>Pollution of Sin,</hi> must endeavour to be <hi>affected with it</hi> suitably to the Discovery which they have made of it. And as the proper Effect of the <hi>Guilt</hi> of sin is
<hi>Fear,</hi> so the proper Effect of the <hi>Filth</hi> of sin is <hi>Shame.</hi> No man who hath read the Scriptures, can be ignorant how frequently God calls on men to be ashamed and confounded in themselves for the Pollutions and Uncleannesses of their sin. So is it expressed in Answer unto what he requires. <hi>O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my God, because of our Iniquities, Ezra</hi> 9. 6. And by another Prophet,
<hi>We lye down in our shame, and our Confusion covereth us, for we have sinned against the Lord our God, Jerem.</hi> 3. 25. And many other such Expressions are there of this Affection of the Mind with respect unto the Pollution of sin. But we must observe, that there is a Two-fold
<hi>shame</hi> with respect unto it. (1) That which is <hi>Legal,</hi> or the product of a meer Legal Conviction of <hi>Sin.</hi> Such was that in <hi>Adam</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his Fall. And such is that which God so frequently calls open and profligate sinners unto; A <hi>shame</hi> accompanyed with Dread and Terrour, and from which the sinner hath no Relief, unless in such sorry Evasions as our First Parents made use of. And (2) There is a
<hi>shame</hi> which is <hi>Evangelical,</hi> arising from a mixed Apprehension of the
<hi>Vileness</hi> of sin, and the <hi>Riches</hi> of Gods Grace in the Pardon and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of it. For although this latter gives Relief against all terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying discouraging Effects of <hi>shame,</hi> yet it encreaseth those which tend to genuine self-Abasement and Abhorrency. And this God still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to abide in us, as that which tends to the Advancement of his Grace in our Hearts. This is fully Expressed by the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 60, 61, 62, 63. <hi>I will remember my Covenant with thee in the Dayes of thy Youth, and I will establish unto thee an Everlasting Covenant; then shalt thou remember thy Wayes and be ashamed, and I will establish my Covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, that thou mayest remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.</hi> There is a <hi>shame</hi> and Confusion or face for sin, that is a Consequent yea an Effect of Gods renewing his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and thereby giving in the full Pardon of sin, as being pacified. And the Apostle asks the <hi>Romans</hi> what Fruit they had in those things whereof they were <hi>now ashamed,</hi> Chap. 6. 21. <hi>Now,</hi> after the Pardon of them they were yet <hi>ashamed,</hi> from the Consideration of their Filth and Vileness. But it is <hi>shame</hi> in the First sence that I here intend, as
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:48389:204"/> antecedent unto the <hi>First Purification</hi> of our Natures. This may be thought to be in all men; but it is plainly otherwise, and men are not at all ashamed of their Sins, which they manifest in Various De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label>(1) Many are <hi>senceless and stupid;</hi> no Instruction, nothing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls them will fix any real <hi>shame</hi> upon them. Of some particular Facts they may be <hi>ashamed,</hi> but for any thing in their Natures they slight and despise it. If they can but preserve themselves from the known Guilt of such sins as are punishable amongst Men, as to all other things they are secure. This is the Condition of the Generality of men living in sin in this World. They have no <hi>inward shame</hi> for any thing between God and their Souls, especially not for the Pravity and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement of their Natures, no although they hear the Doctrine of it never so frequently. What may outwardly befall them that is <hi>shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> they are concerned in; but for their Internal Pollutions between God and their Souls they know none.</p>
               <p>(2) Some have a <hi>Boldness and Confidence</hi> in their Condition as that which is well and pure enough. <hi>There is a Generation that is pure in their own Eyes, yet are they not washed from their Filthiness, Prov.</hi> 30. 12. Although they were never sprinkled with the pure Water of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or cleansed by the Holy Spirit; although their Consciences were never purged from dead Works by the Blood of Christ, nor their Hearts purified by Faith, and so are no Way washed from their Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness; yet do they please themselves in their Condition as pure in their own Eyes, and have not the least sence of any Defilement. Such a Generation were the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of Old, who esteemed themselves as clean as their Hands and Cups that they were continually washing, though within they were filled with all manner of Defilements, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 4, 5. And this Generation is such as indeed despise all that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken about the <hi>Pollution of Sin</hi> and its Purification; and deride it as
<hi>Enthusiastical;</hi> or a fulsome <hi>Metaphor</hi> not to be understood.</p>
               <p>(3) Others proceed farther, and are so far from taking <hi>shame</hi> to themselves for what they are, or what they doe, as that they openly
<hi>Boast</hi> of and <hi>Glory</hi> in the most shamefull sins that Humane Nature can contract the Guilt of. <hi>They proclaim their Sins,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>like Sodom,</hi> where all the People consented together in the Perpetration of Unnatural Lusts. They are not at all ashamed but Glory in the things, which because they do not here, will hereafter fill them with Confusion of Face, <hi>Jerem. 6. 15. Chap.</hi> 8. 12. And where once <hi>Sin</hi> gets this Confidence, wherein it compleats a Conquest over the Law, the in-bred Light of Nature, the Convictions of the Spirit, and in a word God himself, then is it ripe for Judgement. And yet is there a higher Degree of <hi>shamelesness</hi> in sin. For,</p>
               <p>(4) Some content not themselves with Boasting in their own Sins, but also they <hi>approve</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in all those who give up themselves unto the like Out-rage in <hi>Sinning</hi> with themselves. This the Apostle expresseth as the highest Degree of <hi>shameless</hi> sinning, <hi>Rom. 1. 32. Who knowing the Judgement of God, that they which Commit such things are worthy of Death, not only do the same, but have Pleasure in them that do them.</hi> When open Profligate Sinners do as it were make themselves
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48389:205"/> up into Societyes, encouraging and approving one another in their Abominable Courses, so that no Company pleaseth them but such as have obtained an Impudence in sinning, then is the greatest Defiance given unto the <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>Now such as these will never seek after Cleansing. For why should they do so who are sensible of no <hi>Spiritual Pollution,</hi> nor have the least touch of <hi>shame</hi> with respect thereunto? It is Necessary therefore unto the Duty of Purifying our Souls, that we be <hi>affected with shame</hi> for the Spiritual Defilements which our Nature under the Loss of the Image of God is even rolled in. And where this is not, it will be but lost Labour that is spent in the Invitation of men to the <hi>Cleansing Fountain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> 3. Let Person so affected be fully satisfied, that they can never
<hi>Cleanse or Purifie</hi> themselves by any Endeavours that are meerly their own, or by any Means of their own finding out. According unto mens Convictions of the Defilements of sin, so have and alwayes will their Endeavours be after <hi>Purification, Hos.</hi> 5. 13. And indeed it is the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Believers to <hi>purifie themselves</hi> more and more in the Exercise of all Purifying Graces, and the use of all Means appointed of God for that Purpose, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. And their neglect thereof is the highest Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 38. 5. But men in the state of Nature, concerning whom we now treat, are no way able to cleanse their Natures, or purge themselves. He only who can restore, repair, and renew their Natures unto the Likeness of God, can cleanse them. But here many fall into Mistakes. For when by Reason of their Convictions they can no longer satisfie and please themselves in the Pollution of sin, they goe about by Vain attempts of their own to <hi>purifie their Souls, Hos. 5. 13. Jerem. 2. 22. Job</hi> 9. 30, 31. their own Sorrow, and Repentance, and Tears of Contrition, and that sorry Amendment of Life they can attain unto, shall do this Work for them. And every especial defiling Act, or every renewed sence of it, shall have an especial Act of Duty for its Cleansing. But though these things are Good in themselves, yet there is required more Wisdom to the right stating of them, as to their Causes, Respects, Ends, and Use, than they are furnisht withall. Hence are they so frequently abused and turned into an effectual Means not only of keeping Men off and at a Distance from Christ, but also from a due and acceptable <hi>Performance</hi> of the very Duties themselves pretended unto. For <hi>Legal</hi> Sorrow or Repentance, or meer Legal Convictions, being trusted unto, will infallibly keep the Soul from coming up unto that <hi>Evangelical</hi> Repentance which alone God accepts. And meer <hi>Reformation of Life</hi> rested in, proves opposite to Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the <hi>Renovation of our Natures.</hi> But let these Duties be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed however in what Manner you please, they are utterly insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of themselves to cleanse our Natural Defilements. Nor will any seek duely for that which alone is effectual unto this Purpose, untill they are fully convinced hereof. Let therefore Sinners hear and know whether they will or will not believe it, that as by Nature they are
<hi>wholly desiled</hi> and polluted with those Abominations of <hi>Sin</hi> which render them Loathsom in the sight of God, so they have no Power by any Endeavours or Duties of their own to Cleanse themselves; but
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48389:205"/> by all they doe to <hi>this End,</hi> they do but farther plunge themselves into the Ditch, and encrease their own Defilements; yet are all those Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties necessary in their proper Place and unto their <hi>proper End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. It is therefore their Duty to <hi>acquaint themselves</hi> with that only
<hi>Remedy</hi> in this Case, that only Means of Cleansing which God hath appointed, and which he makes Effectual. One great End of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Will of God from the Foundation of the World of his Institutions and Ordinances of Worship, was to direct the Souls and Consciences of Men in and unto the Way of their <hi>Cleansing,</hi> which as it argues his Infinite Love and Care, so the great Importance by the Matter it self. And one Principal Means which Satan from the Beginning made use of to keep men in their Apostasie from God, and to encourage them therein, was by supplying them with innumerable Wayes of <hi>Purifications</hi> suited to the Imaginations of their dark unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and superstitious Minds. And in like manner when he design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to draw men off from Christ and the Gospel under the <hi>Papacy,</hi> he did it principally by the suggestion of such present and future <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi> of Sin as might comply with their Lusts and Ignorance; of so great Importance is it therefore to be acquainted with the only true real Way and Means hereof. And there are two Considerations that are suited to excite the Diligence of Sinners in this Enquiry. 1. The
<hi>Weight</hi> that is laid on this Matter by God himself. 2. The <hi>Difficulty</hi> of attaining an Acquaintance with it. And (1) as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, any one by considering the <hi>Legal Institutions</hi> of Old will see what weight God layes hereon. No Sacrifice had any respect unto <hi>sin,</hi> but there was somewhat Peculiar in it that was for its <hi>Cleansing.</hi> And there were sundry <hi>Ceremonious</hi> Ordinances which had no other End but only to purifie from Uncleannesses. (2) Among all the <hi>Promises</hi> of the Old Testament concerning the Establishment of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the Grace thereof, which are Many and Precious, there are none more Eminent than those which concern our Cleansing from sin by the Administration of the Spirit, through the Blood of Christ. Some of them have been mentioned before. Which also farther mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests the Care that God hath taken for our Instruction herein. (3) There is nothing more <hi>pressed</hi> on us, nothing more frequently <hi>proposed</hi> unto us in the Gospel than the <hi>Necessity</hi> of our <hi>Purification</hi> and the only Way of Effecting it. If therefore either Instructions, or Promises, or Precepts, or all concurring, may evidence the Importance of a Duty, then is this manifested to partake therein. And those who will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the Guidance of <hi>Carnal Reason</hi> and vain Traditions before these Heavenly Directions, shall live in their Ignorance and dye in their Sins. 2<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> The <hi>Difficulty</hi> of attaining an Acquaintance with it, is to be duely considered. It is a part of the Mystery of the Gospel, and such a part as is among those which the Wisdom of the World or Carnal Reason esteemeth <hi>Foolishness.</hi> It is not easily admitted nor received, that we can no otherwise be <hi>cleansed from our sins</hi> but by the <hi>sprinkling</hi> of that Blood which was shed so long ago. Yet this and no other way doth the Scripture propose unto us: To fancy that there is any <hi>cleansing</hi> from sin but by the Blood of Christ, is to overthrow the Gospel. The Doctrine hereof are Persons therefore obliged to enquire after and come to the knowledge of, that being satisfied with its Truth and that
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:48389:206"/> this is the only Way of <hi>Cleansing Sin</hi> appointed and blessed by God himself, their Minds may be exercised about it, and so be taken off from resting on those Vain Medicines and Remedies, which (having) nothing else to fix upon) their own Hearts, and others blind Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, would suggest unto them.</p>
               <p>5. But now the great Enquiry is, How a sinfull <hi>Defiled Soul</hi> may come to have an interest in, or be partaker of, the purifying Vertue and Efficacy of the Blood of Christ? <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) The <hi>purifying</hi> Vertue and Force of the Blood of Christ, with the Administration of the Spirit for its Application to make it effectual unto our Souls and Consciences, is proposed and exhibited unto us in the Promises of the Covenant, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. This all the Instances (which need not be recited) before produced do testifie unto; (2) The only Way to be made partaker of the good things presented in the Promises, is by <hi>Faith.</hi> So <hi>Abraham</hi> is said to have <hi>received the Promises, Heb.</hi> 11. 17. and so are we also, and to <hi>receive Christ</hi> himself. Now this is not from <hi>their</hi> being <hi>proposed</hi> unto us, but from <hi>our Believing</hi> of that which is proposed, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed of <hi>Abraham, Rom. 4. 19, 20, 21. Chap.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8, 9. The whole use, benefit and Advantage of the Promises depends absolutely on our
<hi>mixing them with Faith,</hi> as the Apostle declares, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. Where they are mixed with Faith, there they profit us, there we really receive the thing promised. Where they are not so <hi>mixed</hi> they are of no use, but to aggravate our sins and Unbelief. I know that by some men the whole Nature and Work of Faith is derided. They say it is nothing but a <hi>strong fixing of the Imagination</hi> upon what is said. However, we know that if a man promise us any thing seriously and solemnly which is absolutely in his Power, we trust unto his Word or believe him, considering his Wisdom Honesty and Ability. This we know is not a meer <hi>fixing of the Imagination,</hi> but it is a real and usefull Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or Trust. And whereas God hath given unto us <hi>great</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promises,</hi> and that under several Confirmations, especially that of his Oath and Covenant, if we do really believe their Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that it shall be unto us according to his Word upon the Account of his Veracity, Divine Power, Righteousness and Holiness; why shall this be esteemed a <hi>Fanatical fixing of the Imagination?</hi> If it be so, it was so in <hi>Abraham</hi> our Example, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 19, 20, 21. But this Blasphemous Figment designed to the overthrow of the Way of Life and Salvation by Jesus Christ, shall be elsewhere more fully examined. God, as was said, gives unto us great and precious Promises, that by them we might be made partakers of the Divine Nature. These Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises he requireth us to <hi>receive,</hi> and to <hi>mix them with Faith;</hi> that is, trusting to and resting on his Divine Power and Veracity, ascribing unto him thereby the Glory of them, to believe that the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised unto us shall be accomplished, which is the Means by Gods Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment whereby we shall be really made partakers of them. Such was the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> so celebrated by our Apostle; and such was all the true and saving Faith that ever was in the World from the Foundation of it. Wherefore (3) This is the <hi>only Way</hi> and Means to obtain an Interest in the <hi>Cleansing Vertue</hi> of the Blood of Christ. God hath given this Power and Efficacy unto it by the Covenant. In the Promise of the Gospel it is proposed and tendred unto us. Faith in
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48389:206"/> that Promise is that alone which gives us an Interest in it, makes us partakers of it and renders it actually Effectual unto us, whereby we are really <hi>Cleansed</hi> from sin. (4) There are Two things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre unto the <hi>Efficacy of Faith</hi> to this Purpose: 1. The <hi>Excellency of the Grace</hi> or Duty it self. Despise their Ignorance who tell you this is but a deceitfull fixing of the Imagination, for they know not what they say. When men come to the real Practice of this Duty, they will find what it is to discard all other Wayes and pretences of <hi>Cleansing,</hi> what it is sincerely and really to give unto God, against all Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Oppositions, the Glory of his Power, Faithfulness, Goodness and Grace, what it is to approve of the Wisdom and Love of God in finding out this <hi>Way for us,</hi> and the Infiniteness of his Grace in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it when we were lost and under the Curse, and to be filled with an holy Admiration of him on that Account, all which belong unto the Faith mentioned, neither is it nor can it be acted in a due manner without them; and when you understand these things, you will not think it so strange that God should appoint this <hi>Way of Believing</hi> only as the Means to <hi>interest</hi> us in the purifying Vertue of the <hi>Blood of Christ.</hi> 2. Hereby are we as hath been shewn <hi>united</hi> unto Christ, from whom alone is our <hi>Cleansing;</hi> He that declares another Way must make another Gospel.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Faith</hi> in this Case will act it self in and by <hi>fervent Prayer.</hi> When
<hi>David</hi> had by Sin brought himself into that Condition wherein he stood in need of a new universal Purification, how earnest is he in his Supplications that God would again <hi>purge and cleanse him, Psal.</hi> 51. And when any Soul is really coming over to the Way of God for his
<hi>washing</hi> in the Blood of Christ, he will not be more earnest and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in any Supplication than in this; and herein and hereby doth Christ communicate of the <hi>purging Efficacy</hi> of his Blood unto us. And these things may in some measure suffice for the Direction and Guidance of those who are yet wholly under the <hi>Pollution of Corrupted Nature,</hi> how they may proceed to get themselves <hi>cleansed</hi> according to the Mind of God. Not that this Order or Method is prescribed unto any; only these are the Heads of those things which in one Degree or other are wrought in the Souls of them whom Christ will and doth
<hi>Cleanse</hi> from their Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> Secondly, <hi>Instruction</hi> also may be hence taken for them concerning whom our Apostle sayes, <hi>Such were you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9. Such as are freed from the generall Pollution of Nature by the <hi>Washing of Regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Those I mean who have been made partakers of that <hi>cleansing</hi> purifying Work of the Holy Ghost, which we have described; several Duties are incumbent on them with respect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. As,</p>
               <p>(1) Continual <hi>self-abasement</hi> in the Remembrance of that wofull defiled state and Condition from whence they have been delivered. This Consideration is one of them which principally doth influence the Minds of Believers unto <hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>hideth Pride</hi> from them. For what should Creatures of such a base and defiled Extraction have
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48389:207"/> to boast of in themselves? It is usual I confess, for Vile men of the most Contemptible Beginnings, when they are greatly exalted in the World, to out-goe others in Pride and Elation of Mind, as they are behind them in the Advantages of Birth and Education. But this is esteemed a vile thing amongst men; and it is but one <hi>Potsheard of the Earth</hi> boasting it self against another. But when Believers shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what was their vile and polluted Estate with respect unto God when first he had regard unto them, it will cause them to walk <hi>humbly</hi> in a deep sence of it, or I am sure it ought so to doe. God calls his People to <hi>self-Abasement,</hi> not only from what they <hi>are,</hi> but from what they <hi>were,</hi> and whence they came. So he ordained that Confession to be made by him that offered the <hi>First-fruits</hi> of his Fields and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions;
<hi>A Syrian ready to perish was my Father,</hi> or <hi>a Syrian,</hi> that is,
<hi>Laban</hi> was ready to destroy my Father, a poor helpless man that went from one Countrey to another for Bread. How is it of Soveraign Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that I am now in this State and Condition of Plenty and Peace?
<hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4, 5. And in particular, God wonderfully binds upon them the sence of that defiled Natural Extraction whereof we speak, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 3, 4, 5. And when <hi>David</hi> upon his great Sin and his Repentance took in all humbling self-abasing Considerations, here he fixeth the Head of them, <hi>Psal. 51. 5. Behold I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> His Original natural defilement was that which in the First place influenced him into <hi>self-Abasement.</hi> So our Apostle frequently calls the Saints to a Remembrance of their former Condition before they were <hi>purged, Ephes. 2, 11, 12, 13. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 8, 9. and therewith are the Minds of all true Believers greatly affected and greatly humbled. When they consider what was their Natural State and Condition, universally <hi>leprous</hi> and polluted, with what Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it do still abide, it casts them on the Earth, and causeth them to lay their mouths in the Dust. Hence proceed their great and deep Humiliations of themselves, and Confessions of their own Vileness in their Prayers and Supplications. Considering the Holiness of God with whom they have to doe, unto whom they do approach, they are no way able to express what low Thoughts and Apprehensions they have of themselves. Even God himself doth teach them to use
<hi>figurative Expressions</hi> whereby to declare their own Vileness by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which abound in the Scripture. It is true, all Declarations here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in Prayer and Confession of Sin are derided and scorned by some, who seem to understand nothing of these things, yea to Glory that they do not. Whatever is spoken to express as they are able to the deep sence any have of their Natural Defilement with the Remainder of it, their <hi>shame</hi> and self-Abasement with respect unto the Holiness of God, is reputed either as false and <hi>Hypocritical,</hi> or that it containeth such things as for which men ought to be <hi>hanged;</hi> such prodigious Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in proclaiming a sencelesness of the Holiness of God, and of the Vileness of Sin, have we lived to see and hear of. But when we have to deal with God, who puts no trust in his Servants, and chargeth his
<hi>Angels with Folly,</hi> what shall we say? What Lowliness <hi>becomes then who dwell in Houses of Clay, whose Foundation is in the Dust, and who are crushed before the Moth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) That <hi>Initial Deliverance</hi> which Believers have from their <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48389:207"/> Pollution</hi> of Sin, is a Matter and Cause of everlasting Thankfulness. When our Lord Jesus Christ cleansed the <hi>Ten Lepers,</hi> he manifests how much it was their Duty to return unto him with their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Acknowledgement, though <hi>Nine</hi> of them failed therein, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 17. And when of Old any one was cleansed from a carnal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement, there was an Offering enjoyned him to testifie his Gratitude. And indeed, the Consideration hereof is that which in an eminent manner influenceth the Minds of Believers in all their Gratefull Ascrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Glory, Honour, and Praise to Jesus Christ. <hi>To him,</hi> say they,
<hi>who loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own Blood, to him be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever, Revel.</hi> 1. 5, 6. And there are three Things which concurr to this Duty. (1) A due <hi>Valuation</hi> of the Causes and Means of our Purification, namely, the <hi>sprinkling</hi> of the Blood of Christ in the Sanctification of the Spirit. As these alone have effected this great Work, so they alone were able so to doe. Had we not been <hi>washed</hi> in the Blood of Christ, we must have lived and dyed in our Pollutions, and have lain under them to Eternity. For the Fire of Hell will never purge the Defilements of sin, much less will the fictitious Fire of Purgatory <hi>cleanse</hi> any from them. How ought we then to prize, value and admire both the Vertue or Efficacy of the Blood of Christ, and the Love from whence it was given for us, and is applyed unto us. And because this Valuation and Admiration are Acts of Faith, the very Work it self also of <hi>cleansing</hi> our Souls is carryed on by them. For by the Exercise of Faith do we continually derive Vertue from Christ to this purpose, as the Woman did by touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Garment for the stopping of her Issue of Blood. (2) <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Joy</hi> and Satisfaction in our Freedom from that <hi>shame</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived us of all Boldness and Confidence in God. This Internal Joy belongs unto the Duty of Thankfulness. For therein is God glorified when we are graciously sensible of the Effects of his Love and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards us. Every Grace then glorifies God, and expresseth our Thankfulness for his Love, when a Soul finds it self really affected with a sence of its being <hi>washed</hi> from all its loathsome Defilements in the Blood of Christ, and, being thereby freed from discouraging oppressing
<hi>shame,</hi> to have Filial Boldness in the presence of God. (3) <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment</hi> in a way of Actual Prayse.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> Again; We have declared not only that there is in our Natural Frame and Spiritual Constitution a Discrepancy to the Holiness of God, and consequently an universal Defilement, but that there is from its Pravity and Disorder a <hi>Pollution</hi> attending every <hi>actual Sin,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>internal</hi> of the Heart and Mind only, or <hi>external</hi> in Sin perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, averse to Holiness and contrary to the carrying on of the Work of Sanctification in us. And sundry things, Believers whose Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone this is, may learn from hence also. As,</p>
               <p>(1) How they ought to <hi>Watch against Sin</hi> and all the Motions of it, though never so secret. They all of them <hi>defile</hi> the Conscience. And it is an Evidence of a Gracious Soul to be watchfull against sin on this Account. Convictions will make men wary where they are prevalent, by continual Representations of the Danger and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sin: And these are an allowable Motive to Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48389:208"/> to abstain from it in all known Instances. The Consideration of the Terrour of the Lord, the Use of the Threatnings both of the Law and Gospel, declare this to be our Duty. Neither let any say, that this is <hi>servile fear;</hi> that Denomination is taken from the <hi>frame of our Minds,</hi> and not from the <hi>Object feared.</hi> When men so fear as thereon to be discouraged and to encline unto a Relinquishment of God, Duty, and Hope, that Fear is <hi>servile</hi> whatever be the Object of it. And that Fear which keeps from Sin, and excites the Soul to cleave more firmly to God, be the Object of it what it will, is no servile Fear, but an holy Fear of due Reverence unto God and his Word. But this is the most genuinely gracious fear of sin, when we dread the
<hi>defilement</hi> of it, and that Contrariety which is in it to the Holiness of God. This is a Natural Fruit of Faith and Love. And this Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration should alwayes greatly possess our Minds; and the truth is, if it do not so, there is no assured Preservative against sin. For together with an Apprehension of that <hi>spiritual Pollution</hi> wherewith sin is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed, Thoughts of the Holiness of God, of the Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of the sanctifying Spirit, of the Blood of Christ, will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually abide in our Minds, which are all efficaciously preservative against Sin. I think that there is no more forceable Argument unto Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against all sin unto Believers in the whole Book of God, than that which is mannaged by our Apostle, with especial respect unto one kind of sin, but may in Proportion be extended unto all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 15, 19. Moreover, where this is not, where the Soul hath no respect to the <hi>Defilement</hi> of sin, but only considers how it may shift with the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it, innumerable things will interpose, partly arising from the abuse of Grace, partly from Carnal Hopes and foolish Resolutions for after-times, as will set it at Liberty from that watchfull Diligence in universal Obedience which is required of us. The Truth is, I do not believe that any one that is awed only with respect to the
<hi>Guilt</hi> of sin and its Consequents, doth keep up a firm Integrity with regard to inward and outward actings of his Heart and Life in all things. But where the Fear of the Lord and of Sin is influenced by a deep Apprehension of the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the one and the <hi>Pollution</hi> that inseparably attends the other, there is the Soul kept alwayes upon its best Guard and Defence.</p>
               <p>(2) How we ought to <hi>walk humbly</hi> before the Lord all our Dayes. Notwithstanding our utmost Watchfulness and Diligence against sin, there is yet <hi>no man that liveth and sinneth not.</hi> Those who pretend unto a Perfection here, as they manifest themselves to be utterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of God and themselves, and despise the Blood of Christ, so for the most part they are left visibly and in the sight of men to confute their own Pride and Folly. But to what purpose is it to hide our selves from our selves when we have to do with God? God knows and our own Souls know, that more or less we are <hi>defiled</hi> in all that we doe. The best of our Works and Duties brought into the presence of the Holiness of God, are but as <hi>filthy raggs.</hi> And Man even every man of himself <hi>drinketh in Iniquity like water.</hi> Our own Cloaths are ready to defile us every day. Who can express the Motions of Lust that are in the Flesh, the irregular actings of Affections, in their <hi>inordinate</hi> risings up to their Objects, the Folly of the Imaginations of our Hearts and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48389:208"/> Minds, which as far as they are not Principled by Grace are only evil, and that continually; with the vanity of our Words, yea with a mixture of much corrupt Communications, all which are <hi>defiling,</hi> and have Defilements attending of them? I confess I know not that my Heart and Soul abhorrs any Eruption of the Diabolical pride of man, like that whereby they reproach and scoff at the deepest Humiliations and self-Abasements which poor sinners can attain unto in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Confessions and Supplications. Alas! that our Nature should be capable of such a Contempt of the Holiness of God, such an Ignorance of the infinite distance that is between him and us, and be so senceless of our own Vileness, and of the abominable Filth and Pollution that is in every Sin, as not to tremble at the despising of the lowest Abasements of poor sinners before the Holy God. <hi>Behold his Soul which is lifted up is not upright in him, but the Just shall live by his Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(3) How we ought continually to endeavour after the <hi>wasting</hi> of Sin in the <hi>Root</hi> and Principle of it. There is a <hi>Root</hi> of sin in us which springs up and defiles us. Every man is tempted (that is <hi>chiefly</hi> and
<hi>principally</hi>) of his own Lust, and seduced, and then when Lust hath conceived it bringeth forth Sin. It is the Flesh that lusteth against the Spirit, and which bringeth forth corrupted and corrupting, polluted and polluting Fruits. This Principle of Sin, of Aversation from God, of Inclination unto things Sensual and Present, however wounded, weakened, dethroned, impaired, yet still abides in all Believers. And it is the Foundation, the Spring, the Root, the next Cause of all sin in us, which tempts, enticeth, draws aside, conceives and brings forth. And this hath in us all, more or less degrees of Strength, Power and Activity, according as it is more or less mortified by Grace, and the Application of the Vertue of the Death of Christ unto our Souls. And according to its <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> so it abounds in bringing forth the
<hi>defiled Acts</hi> of sin. Whilest this retains any considerable Power in us, it is to no purpose to set our selves meerly to watch against the Erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Actual sins in the Frames of our Hearts, in the Thoughts of our Minds, or outward Actions. If we would preserve our selves from multiplying our Defilements, if we would continually be perfecting the Work of Holiness in the Fear of the Lord, it is this we must set our selves against. The <hi>Tree</hi> must be made <hi>good</hi> if we expect good
<hi>Fruit,</hi> and the evil Root must be digged up, or <hi>evil Fruit</hi> will be brought forth. That is, our main Design should be to crucifie and
<hi>destroy the Body of the sins of the flesh</hi> that is <hi>in us,</hi> the Remainders of the Flesh or In-dwelling sin, by the Wayes and Means which shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be declared.</p>
               <p>(4) Hence also is manifest the Necessity we have of <hi>continual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> to Jesus Christ for <hi>cleansing Vertue</hi> from his Spirit, and the sprinkling of his Blood on our Consciences in the Efficacy of it to purge them from dead works. We <hi>defile</hi> our selves <hi>every day,</hi> and if we go not
<hi>every day</hi> to the Fountain that is <hi>open for sin and for uncleanness,</hi> we shall quickly be all over Leprous. Our Consciences will be filled with <hi>dead Works,</hi> so that we shall no way be able to serve the Living God, unless they are daily purged out. How this is done hath been at large before declared. When a Soul filled with self-Abasement, under a sence of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48389:209"/> its own Defilements, applyes it self unto Christ by Faith for <hi>cleansing,</hi> and that constantly and continually, with a Fervency answering its sense and Convictions, it is in its Way and proper Course. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded no true Believer in the World is a stranger unto this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And the more any one abounds therein, the more genuine is his Faith evidenced to be, and the more Humble is his Walk before the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> But it may justly be enquired, upon all that we have discoursed upon this Subject concerning the <hi>Defilement</hi> of sin, How, if it be so, Believers can be <hi>united unto Jesus Christ,</hi> or be <hi>Members</hi> of that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Body whereof he is the Head, or obtain <hi>Fellowship</hi> with him. For whereas he is absolutely <hi>pure,</hi> holy, and perfect, how can he have
<hi>Vnion</hi> or <hi>Communion</hi> with them who are in any thing <hi>defiled?</hi> There is no Fellowship between Righteousness and Unrighteousness, no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Light and Darkness, and what can there be between Christ and those that are defiled with sin? And because he is <hi>holy, harmless and undefiled,</hi> he is said to be <hi>separate from sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many things must be returned unto this Objection, all concurring to take away the seeming difficulty that is in it. As,</p>
               <p>(1) It must be granted, that where men are <hi>wholly</hi> under the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their Original Defilement, they neither have nor can have either Union or Communion with Christ. With respect unto such Persons, the Rules before mentioned are universally true and certain: There is no more <hi>Communion</hi> between them and Jesus Christ, than is between Light and Darkness, as the Apostle speaks expressly, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 6. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Profession they may make of his Name, whatever Expectations they may unduely raise from him in their own Minds, he will say unto them at the last day, <hi>Depart from me, I never knew you.</hi> No person therefore whatever, who hath not been made Partaker of the washing of Regeneration and the Renovation of the Holy Ghost, can possibly have any Union with Christ. I do not speak this as though our <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> were in order of Time or Nature antecedent unto our Union with Christ, for indeed it is an Effect thereof. But it is such an Effect as immediately and inseparably accompanyeth it; so that where the one is not, there is not the other. The <hi>Act</hi> whereby he unites us unto himself, is the same with that whereby he <hi>cleanseth</hi> our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>(2) Whatever our <hi>Defilements</hi> are or may be, he is not <hi>defiled</hi> by them. They adhere only unto a <hi>capable Subject,</hi> which Christ is not. He was capable to have the <hi>Guilt</hi> of our sins imputed to him, but not the <hi>Filth</hi> of one sin adhering to him. A Member of a Body may have a putrified Sore. The <hi>Head</hi> may be troubled at it, and grieved with it, yet is not defiled by it. Wherefore, where there is a Radical Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Cleansing by the Spirit of Regeneration and Holiness, whereby any one is meet for Union and Communion with Christ, however he may be <hi>affected</hi> with our <hi>partial Pollutions,</hi> he is not <hi>defiled</hi> by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He is able <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>compati, condolere,</hi> he suffers with us in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion; but he is not liable <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be <hi>defiled with us,</hi> or for us. The <hi>Visible</hi> Mystical Body of Christ may be defiled by <hi>corrupt Members, Heb.</hi> 12. 15. but the <hi>Mystical</hi> Body cannot be so, much less the Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:48389:209"/> (3) The Design of Christ when he takes Believers into Union with himself, is to <hi>purge and cleanse</hi> them absolutely and perfectly; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the present remainders of some Defilements are not absolutely inconsistent with that Union. <hi>He gave himself for it, that he might sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the Word, that he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it unto himself a Glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish, Ephes.</hi> 5. 26, 27. This he aims at, and this he will, in his own Way and in his own Time, perfectly accomplish. But it is not done at once, it is a Progressive Work, that hath many degrees. God did never <hi>sanctifie</hi> any Soul at once, unless by Death. The <hi>Body</hi> must dye by reason of Sin. Every Believer is truely and <hi>really</hi> sanctified at once, but none is <hi>perfectly</hi> sanctified at once. It is not therefore necessary unto Union that we should be <hi>compleatly</hi> sanctified, though it is that we should be <hi>truely</hi> sanctified. Compleat Sanctification is a necessary Effect of Union in its proper Time and Season. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>(4) Where the Work of Sanctification and Spiritual Cleansing is
<hi>really begun</hi> in any, there the whole Person is, and is thence denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Holy. As therefore Christ the Head is Holy, so are all the Members Holy according to their Measure. For although there may be Defilements <hi>adhering</hi> unto their Actions, yet their Persons are sanctified. So that no <hi>unholy Person</hi> hath any Communion with Christ, no Member of his Body is unholy, that is, absolutely so, in such a state as thence to be denominated Unholy.</p>
               <p>(5) Our Union with Christ is immediately in and by the <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in us, by the Divine Nature which is from the Spirit of Holiness, and is Pure and Holy. Hereunto and hereby doth the Lord Christ communicate himself unto our Souls and Consciences; and hereby have we all our Entercourse with him. Other Adherences that have any Defilement in them, and consequently are opposite unto this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he daily worketh out by vertue hereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. The whole Body of Christ therefore, and all that belongs unto it is <hi>holy,</hi> though those who are Members of this Body are in themselves oft-times pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, but not in any thing which belongs to their Union. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle describeth the two-fold Nature, or Principle that is in Believers, the New Nature by Grace, and the Old of Sin, as a double Person,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19, 20. And it is the former, the renewed, (and not the latter, which he calls <hi>I</hi> also, but corrects as it were that Expression, calling it
<hi>Sin which dwelleth in him,</hi>) that is the subject of the <hi>Vnion</hi> with Christ, the other being to be destroyed.</p>
               <p>(6) Where the <hi>Means of Purification</hi> are duely used, no Defilement ensues on any sin that Believers fall into, which doth or can totally obstruct Communion with God in Christ according to the Tenor of the Covenant. There were many things under the Old Testament, that did Typically and Legally defile men that were lyable unto them. But for all of them there were provided <hi>Typical</hi> and Legal Purifications, which sanctified them as to the purifying of the Flesh. Now no man was absolutely cut off or separated from the People of God for his being so defiled; but he that being defiled did not take care that he might be Purifyed according to the Law, He was to be cut off from among the People. It is in like manner in things Spiritual
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48389:210"/> and Evangelical. There are many sins whereby Believers are defiled. But there is a <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Cleansing</hi> still open unto them. And it is not meerly the Incidence of a <hi>Defilement,</hi> but the Neglect of <hi>Purification</hi> that is inconsistent with their state and Interest in Christ. The Rule of Communion with God, and consequently of Union with Christ in its Exercise, is expressed by <hi>David, Psal. 19. 12, 13. Who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his Errors, cleanse thou me from secret sins; keep back thy Servant also from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me, then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.</hi> The Design of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> is to be preserved in such a state and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as wherein he may be <hi>upright</hi> before God. To be <hi>upright</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is that which God requireth of us in the Covenant, that we may be accepted with him, and enjoy the Promises thereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. He that is so, will be freed from that great Transgression, or that Abundance of sin which is inconsistent with the Covenant, Love and Favour of God. And hereunto three things are required. 1. A constant humble Acknowledgement of Sin; <hi>Who can understand his Errors?</hi> 2. Daily Cleansing from those Defilements which the least and most secret sins are accompanyed withall. <hi>Cleanse thou me from secret sins;</hi> and 3. A Preservation from Presumptuous sins, or Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sins committed with an high hand. Where these thing are, there a man is <hi>upright,</hi> and hath the Covenant-ground of his Communion with God. And whilest Believers are preserved within these Bounds, though they are defiled by sin, yet is there not any thing therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with their Union with Christ.</p>
               <p>(7) Our Blessed Head is not only <hi>pure</hi> and Holy, but he is also Gracious and Mercifull, and will not presently cut off a Member of his Body, because it is sick or hath a sore upon it. He is himself passed through his Course of Temptations, and is now above the reach of them all. Doth he therefore reject and despise those that are Tempted, that labour and suffer under their Temptations? It is quite otherwise, so that on the Account of his own present <hi>state</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions do exceedingly abound towards all his that are Tempted. It is no otherwise with him as to their Sins and Defilements. These he himself was absolutely freed from in all his Temptations and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but we are not. And he is so far from casting us away on that Account, while we endeavour after Purification, as that it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out his Compassions towards us. In brief, he doth not unite us to himself because we are <hi>perfect,</hi> but that in his own Way and Time he may make us so; not because we are <hi>clean,</hi> but that he may cleanse us, for it is the <hi>Blood of Jesus Christ</hi> with whom we have Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
<hi>that cleanseth us from all our sins.</hi>

                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> to wind up this Discourse, There is hence sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced a Comprehensive Difference between a <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> unto God by <hi>Evangelical Holiness,</hi> and a <hi>Life of Moral Vertue</hi> though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto God also. Unto the first, the Original and continual
<hi>Purification</hi> of our Nature and Persons by the Spirit of God and Blood of Christ is indispensibly required. Where this Work is not, there neither is nor can be any thing of that Holiness which the Gospel prescribes, and which we enquire after. Unless the Purification and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:48389:210"/> Cleansing of sin belongs necessarily unto the Holiness of the New Covenant, all that God hath taught us concerning it in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament and the New, by his Institution of Legal purifying Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by his Promises to wash purifie and cleanse us, by his Precepts to get our selves cleansed by the Means of our Purification, namely, his Spirit and the Blood of Christ, by his <hi>Instructions</hi> and Directions of us to make use of those Means of our Cleansing, by his Declarations that Believers are so washed and cleansed from all their Defilements of their sins, are things <hi>Fanatical, Enthusiastick Notions,</hi> and Unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Dreams. Untill men can rise up to a Confidence enabling them to own such horrible Blasphemies, I desire to know, whether these things are required unto their <hi>Morality?</hi> If they shall say they are so, they give us a new Notion of <hi>Morality</hi> never yet heard of in the World; and we must expect untill they have further cleared it, there being little or no signification in the great swelling words of Vanity which have hitherto been lavished about it: But if they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long thereunto, as it is most certain, the most improved <hi>Moralists,</hi> that are only so, whether in Notion or Practice, have no regard unto them; then is their <hi>Life of Moral Vertues</hi> (were it as real in them as it is with notorious Vanity pretended) cast out from all Consideration in a serious Disquisition after <hi>Evangelical</hi> Holiness. And what hath been spoken may suffice to give us some Light into the Nature of this First Act of our Sanctification by the Spirit, which consists in the
<hi>Cleansing</hi> of our Souls and Consciences from the <hi>Pollutions</hi> of Sin both Original and Actual.</p>

And this part of his Work we shall reduce unto two Heads, which we shall first propose, and afterwards clear and vindicate.</p>
               <p>And our First Assertion is, <hi>That in the Sanctification of Believers, the Holy Ghost doth work in them, in their whole Souls, their Minds, Wills and Affections, a gracious supernatural Habit, Principle, and Disposition of Living unto God, wherein the Substance or Essence, the Life and Being of Holiness doth consist.</hi> This is that <hi>spirit</hi> which is born of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that <hi>new Creature,</hi> that new and Divine Nature which is wrought in them, and whereof they are made partakers.

<hi>Image of God</hi> whereunto our Natures are repaired by the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby we are made conformable unto God, firmly and steadfastly adhering unto him through Faith and Love. That there is such a <hi>Divine Principle,</hi> such a gracious supernatural
<hi>Habit,</hi> wrought in all them that are Born again, hath been fully proved in our Assertion and Description of the Work of <hi>Regeneration.</hi> It is therefore acknowledged, that the first supernatural Infusion or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of this <hi>Principle of spiritual Light and Life,</hi> preparing, sitting and enabling all the Faculties of our Souls unto the Duties of Holiness, according to the Mind of God, doth belong unto the Work of our first Conversion. But the preservation, cherishing and encrease of it belongs unto our Sanctification, both its Infusion and Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being necessarily required unto Holiness. Hereby is the <hi>Tree made good,</hi> that the Fruit of it may be good, and without which it will not so be. This is our new Nature, which ariseth not from <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Actions</hi> of Holiness, but is the Root of them all. <hi>Habits</hi> acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a multitude of Acts, whether in things Morall or Artificial, are not a <hi>new Nature,</hi> nor can be so called, but a readiness for Acting from Use and Custom. But this Nature is from God its Parent, it is that in us which is born of God. And it is Common unto, or the same in all Believers, as to its Kind and Being, though not as to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Exercise. It is that we cannot learn, which cannot be taught us but by God only, as he teaches other Creatures in whom he plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a natural Instinct. The Beauty and Glory hereof as it is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inexpressible, so have we spoken somewhat to it before. Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God, Likeness to Christ, Compliance with the Holy Spirit, Interest in the Family of God, Fellowship with Angels, Separation from Darkness and the World, do all consist herein.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> Secondly, The <hi>Matter</hi> of our Holiness consists in our <hi>Actual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> unto God, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace. For God promiseth to write his Law in our Hearts, that we may fear him and walk in his Statutes. And concerning this in general we may observe two things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That there is a certain fixed Rule and Measure of this Obedience,</hi> in a Conformity and Answerableness whereunto it doth consist. This
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:48389:212"/> is the <hi>Revealed Will</hi> of God in the Scripture, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 8. Gods Will I say as revealed unto us in the Word is the Rule of our Obedience. A Rule it must have, which nothing else can pretend to be. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Will or hidden Purposes of God are not the Rule of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. much less are our own Imaginations, Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Reasons so; neither doth any thing, though never so specious, which we do in Complyance with them or by their Direction, belong thereunto, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19, 20, 21, 22. But the Word of God is the Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Rule of all Holy Obedience. (1) It is so <hi>materially.</hi> All that is commanded in that Word belongs unto our Obedience, and nothing else doth so. Hence are we so strictly required neither to <hi>add unto it</hi> nor to <hi>diminish</hi> or take any thing from it, <hi>Deut. 4. 2. Chap. 12. 32. Josh. 1. 7. Prov. 36. 6. Revel.</hi> 22. 18. (2) It is so <hi>formally;</hi> that is, we are not to do only <hi>what is commanded,</hi> all that is commanded, and nothing else, but whatever we do we are to do it <hi>because it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> or it is no part of our Obedience or Holiness, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 24, 25. <hi>Chap. 29. 19. Psal.</hi> 119. 9. I know there is an in-bred Light of Nature as yet remaining in us, which gives great Direction as to Moral Good and Evil, commanding the one and forbidding the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. But this Light, however it may be made subservient and subordinate thereunto, is not the Rule of Gospel Holiness as such, nor any part of it. The <hi>Law</hi> which God by his Grace writes in our Hearts, answers unto the Law that is written in the Word that is given unto us; and as the first is the only Principle, so the latter is the only Rule of our Evangelical Obedience. For this End hath God promised that his Word and his Spirit shall alwayes accompany one another, the one to quicken our Souls, and the other to guide our <hi>Lives, Isa.</hi> 59. 20. And the Word of God may be considered as our Rule in a threefold Respect. 1. As it requires the <hi>Image of God</hi> in us. The Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Rectitude of our Nature with respect unto God and our Living to him, is Enjoyned us in the Word, yea and wrought in us thereby. The whole Renovation of our Natures, the whole Principle of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before described, is nothing but the Word changed into Grace in our Hearts; for we <hi>are born again by the incorruptible seed of the Word of God.</hi> The Spirit worketh nothing in us, but what the Word first requireth of us. It is therefore the Rule of the inward Principle of spiritual Life, and the growth thereof is nothing but its increase in Conformity to that Word. 2. With respect unto all the <hi>Actual Frames,</hi> Designs and Purposes of the Heart, All the internal Actings of our Minds, All the <hi>Volitions</hi> of the Will, all the <hi>Motions</hi> of our Affections are to be regulated by that Word which requires us to Love the Lord our God with all our Minds, all our Souls, and all our Strength. Hereby is their Regularity or Irregularity to be tried. All that Holiness which is in them consists in their Conformity to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will of God. 3. With respect unto all our <hi>outward Actions</hi> and Duties, private, publick, of Piety, of Righteousness, towards our selves or others, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 12. This is the Rule of our Holiness. So far as what we are and what we doe answers thereunto, so far are we
<hi>holy</hi> and no further. Whatever Acts of <hi>Devotion</hi> or Duties of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> may be performed without respect hereunto, belong not to our Sanctification.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:48389:212"/> 2. As there is a Rule of our <hi>Performance</hi> of this Obedience, so there is a Rule of the <hi>Acceptance</hi> of our Obedience with God. And this is the <hi>Tenor of the New Covenant, Gen.</hi> 17. 1. What answers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is accepted, and what doth not so is rejected, both as to the Universality of the whole, and the Sincerity that accompanyes each particular Duty in it. And these two things, <hi>Vniversality</hi> and <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> answer now as to some certain Ends the Legal Perfection at first required of us. In the Estate of Original Righteousness, the Rule of our Acceptance with God in our Obedience was the Law and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works. And this required that it should be absolute, perfect in <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Degrees,</hi> without the least intermixture of <hi>sin</hi> with our
<hi>good,</hi> or interposition of it in the least Instance, which was inconsistent with that Covenant. But now although we are renewed again by Grace in the Image of God really and truely, yet not absolutely nor perfectly, but only in part. We have yet remaining in us a contrary Principle of Ignorance and Sin, which we must alwayes conflict with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16, 17. Wherefore God in the Covenant of Grace is pleased to accept of that Holy Obedience which is <hi>universal</hi> as to all Parts, in all known Instances of Duty, and <hi>sincere</hi> as to the Manner of their Performance. What in particular is required hereunto, is not our present Work to declare. I only aim to fix in general the Rule of the Acceptance of this Holy Obedience. Now the Reason hereof is not, that a Lower and more imperfect kind of Righteousness, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and Obedience, will answer all the Ends of God and his Glory now under the New Covenant, than would have done so under the Old. Nothing can be imagined more distant from the Truth, or more dishonourable to the Gospel, nor that seems to have a nearer approach unto the making of Christ the <hi>Minister of sin.</hi> For what would he be else, if he had procured that God would accept of a weak imperfect Obedience, accompanyed with many failings infirmities and sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in nothing compleat, in the Room and stead of that which was compleat, perfect and absolutely sinless, which he first required of us? Yea, God having determined to exalt and glorifie the Holy Properties of his Nature in a more eminent and Glorious manner under the New Covenant than the Old, for which Cause and End alone it is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and preferred above it, it was necessary that there should be a
<hi>Righteousness</hi> and Obedience required therein, far more compleat, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and glorious than that required in the other. But the Reason of this Difference lyes solely herein, that our <hi>Evangelical Obedience</hi> which is accepted with God, according to the Tenor of the New Covenant, doth not hold the same place which our Obedience should have had under the Covenant of Works. For therein it should have been our
<hi>Righteousness</hi> absolutely before God, that whereby we should have been Justified in his sight, <hi>even the Works of the Law,</hi> and for which in a due Proportion of Justice we should have been Eternally reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this place is now filled up by the Righteousness and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ our Mediator, which being the Obedience of the Son of God, is far more eminent and glorious, or tends more to the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of the Properties of Gods Nature, and therein the Exaltation of his Glory, than all that we should have done had we abode steadfast
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48389:213"/> in the Covenant of Works. Whereunto then, it may be some will say, serves <hi>our Holiness</hi> and Obedience, and what is the Necessity of it. I must deferre the answering of this Enquiry unto its proper place, where I shall prove at large the <hi>Necessity of this Holiness,</hi> and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it from its proper Principles and Ends. In the mean time, I say only in general, that as God <hi>requireth</hi> it of us, so he hath appointed it as the <hi>only means</hi> whereby we may express our Subjection to him, our Dependance on him, our Fruitfulness and Thankfulness, the only Way of our Communion and Entercourse with him, of using and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Effects of his Love, the Benefits of the Mediation of Christ, whereby we may glorifie him in this World, and the only orderly way whereby we may be made meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, which is sufficient in general to manifest both its Necessity and its use. These things being then in general premised, I shall comprize what I have further to offer in the Declaration and Vindication of Gospel-Sanctification and Holiness, in the two ensuing Assertions.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> 1. There is wrought and preserved in the Minds and Souls of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, by the Spirit of God, a supernatural Principle or Habit of Grace and Holiness, whereby they are made meet and enabled to live unto God, and perform that Obedience which he requireth and accepteth through Christ in the Covenant of Grace, essentially or specifically distinct from all natural Habits intellectual and moral, however or by what Means soever acquired or improved.</p>
               <p>2. There is an immediate Work or effectual Operation of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by his Grace, required unto every Act of holy Obedience, whether inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal only in Faith and Love, or external also; that is, unto all the holy Actings of our Vnderstandings, Wills and Affections, and unto all Duties of Obedience in our Walking before God.</p>
               <p>The First of these Assertions I affirm not only to be <hi>true,</hi> but of so great weight and importance, that our Hope of Life and Salvation depends thereon, and it is the second great Principle constituting our Christian Profession. And there are Four things that are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed concerning it. (1) That there is such an <hi>Habit</hi> or Principle
<hi>supernatural,</hi> Infused or Created in Believers by the Holy Ghost, and alwayes abiding in them. (2) That according to the Nature of all
<hi>Habits</hi> it <hi>inclines</hi> and <hi>disposeth</hi> the Mind, Will and Affections, unto Acts of Holiness suitable unto its own Nature, and with regard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its proper End, and to make us meet to live unto God. (3) It doth not only encline and dispose the Mind, but gives it <hi>Power,</hi> and enables it to live unto God in all Holy Obedience. (4) That it differs
<hi>specifically</hi> from all other Habits <hi>Intellectual</hi> or <hi>Morall,</hi> that by any Means we may acquire or attain; or <hi>spiritual Gifts</hi> that may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on any Persons whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> In the handling of these things, I shall manifest the Difference that is between a <hi>spiritual supernatural Life</hi> of Evangelical Holiness, and a Course of <hi>Moral Vertue,</hi> which some to the rejection of the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, do endeavour to substitute in the Room thereof. Such a Spiritual, Heavenly, Supernatural Life, so denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:48389:213"/> from its Nature, Causes, Acts and Ends, we must be partakers of in this World, if ever we mind to attain Eternal Life in another.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> And herein we shall take what View we are able of the Nature, Glory and Beauty of Holiness, and do confess, it is but little of them which I can comprehend. It is a matter indeed often spoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but the Essence and true Nature of it, are much hidden from the Eyes of all living men. The sence of what the Scripture propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, what I believe, and what I desire an Experience of, that I shall endeavour to declare. But as we are not in this Life perfect in the Duties of Holiness, no more are we in the Knowledge of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>First therefore I say, it is a <hi>gracious supernatural Habit,</hi> or a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of spiritual Life. And with respect hereunto I shall briefly do these three things. 1. Shew what I mean by such an <hi>Habit.</hi> 2. Prove that there is such an <hi>Habit</hi> required unto Holiness, yea that the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of Holiness consists therein. 3. Declare in general the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> 1. Our First Enquiry is after the <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of Holiness, that from which any one is truely and really made and denominated Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or what is the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of that Holiness which our Nature is partaker of in this World. This must be something <hi>peculiar,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>sacred,</hi> as that which constitutes the great and only Difference that is between Mankind, on their own part, in the sight of God, with respect unto Eternity. Every one that hath this Holiness pleaseth God, is accepted with him, and shall come to the Enjoyment of him. And every one that hath it not, is rejected of him here and hereafter.</p>
               <p>And this Holiness in the first place doth not consist in any <hi>single Acts of Obedience</hi> unto God, though good in their own Nature, and acceptable unto him. For such Acts may be performed, yea many of them, by <hi>unholy</hi> persons, with Examples whereof the Scripture aboundeth. <hi>Cain</hi>'s Sacrifice and <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Repentance, were signal single Acts of Obedience <hi>materially;</hi> yet no Acts of <hi>Holiness formally,</hi> nor did either make or denominate them Holy. And our Apostle tells us, that men may give <hi>all their Goods to the Poor, and their Bodies to be burned,</hi> and yet be nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. yet in single Acts who can go further? Such Fruits may spring from Seed that hath no Root. Single Acts may <hi>evidence</hi> Holiness, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Obedience in sacrificing his Son, but they constitute none Holy; nor will a <hi>series,</hi> a Course, a Multiplication of Acts and Duties of Obedience either constitute or denominate any one so, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. All the Duties, a
<hi>series</hi> and <hi>Multiplication</hi> whereof are there rejected for want of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, were good in themselves, and appointed of God. Nor doth it consist in an <hi>Habitual Disposition</hi> of Mind unto any <hi>outward Duties,</hi> of Piety, Devotion or Obedience, however obtained or acquired. Such
<hi>Habits</hi> there are both Intellectual and Morall. <hi>Intellectual Habits</hi> are Arts and Sciences. When men by Custom, Usuage, and frequent Acts in the Exercise of any Science, Art or Mystery, do get a ready Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in and unto all the Parts and Duties of it, they have an <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48389:214"/> Habit</hi> therein. It is so in things Morall, as to Vertues and Vices. There are some seeds and sparks of <hi>Moral Vertues</hi> remaining in the Ruines of depraved Nature, as of Justice, Temperance, Fortitude, and the like. Hence God calls on profligate Sinners to remember and shew themselves Men, or not to act contrary to the Principles and Light of Nature, which are inseparable from us as we are Men, <hi>Isa.</hi> 46. 8. These Principles may be so excited in the Exercise of Natural Light, and improved by Education, Instruction and Example, untill persons by an assiduous diligent performance of the Acts and Duties of them, may attain such a Readiness unto them and Facility in them, as is not by any outward Means easily changed or diverted; and this is a <hi>Moral Habit;</hi> in like manner in the Duties of Piety and Religion, in Acts of outward Obedience unto God, men by the same Means may so accustom themselves unto them, as to have an <hi>habitual Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> unto their Exercise. I doubt not but that it is so unto an high Degree with many superstitious Persons. But in all these things, the
<hi>Acts</hi> do still precede the <hi>Habits</hi> of the same nature and kind, which are produced by them and not otherwise. But this <hi>Holiness</hi> is such an
<hi>Habit</hi> or Principle as is antecedent unto all Acts of the same kind, as we shall prove. There never was by any, nor ever can be, any <hi>Act</hi> or Duty of true <hi>Holiness</hi> performed, where there was not in Order of Nature antecedently an <hi>Habit</hi> of Holiness in the Persons by whom they are performed. Many Acts and Duties for the substance of them good and approveable, may be performed without it, but no one that hath the proper Form and Nature of Holiness can be so. And the Reason is, because every Act of true Holiness must have something
<hi>supernatural</hi> in it from an internal renewed Principle of Grace, and that which hath not so, be it otherwise what it will, is no Act or Duty of true Holiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> And I call this Principle of Holiness an <hi>HABIT;</hi> not as though it were absolutely of the same kind with <hi>acquired Habits,</hi> and would in all things answer to our Conceptions and Descriptions of them: But we only call it so, because in its Effects and Manner of Operation, it agreeth in sundry things with acquired intellectual or moral Habits. But it hath much more Conformity unto a natural unchangeable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stict, than unto any acquired Habit. Wherefore, God chargeth it on men, that in their Obedience unto him they did not answer that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> which is in other Creatures towards their Lords and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 3. and which they cordially observe, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 8. 7. But herein God <hi>teacheth us more than the Beasts of the Earth, and maketh us wiser than the Fowls of Heaven, Job</hi> 35. 11.</p>
               <p>This therefore is that which I intend; A Vertue, a Power, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Spiritual Life and Grace, wrought, created, infused into our Souls, and in-laid in all the Faculties of them, constantly abiding, and unchangeably residing in them, which is antecedent unto, and the next Cause of all Acts of true Holiness whatever. And this is that as was said, wherein the <hi>nature of Holiness</hi> doth consist, and from which in those that are <hi>Adult,</hi> the actual Discharge of all Duties and Works of Holiness is inseparable. This abideth alwayes in and with all that are sanctified, whence they are alwayes Holy, and not only so when
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48389:214"/> they are actually exercised in the Duties of Holiness. Hereby are they prepared disposed and enabled unto all Duties of Obedience, as we shall shew immediately, and by the Influence hereof into their Acts and Duties do they become Holy, and no otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> For the further Explanation of it, I shall only add three things.</p>
               <p>(1) That this <hi>Habit</hi> or Principle thus wrought and abiding in us, doth not, if I may so say, Firm its own Station, or abide and continue in us by its own natural Efficacy, in adhering unto the Faculties of our Souls. <hi>Habits</hi> that are acquired by many Actions, have a natural Efficacy to preserve themselves, untill some Opposition that is too hard for them, prevail against them, which is frequently (though not easily) done. But this is preserved in us, by the constant powerfull Actings and Influence of the Holy Ghost. He which works it in us, doth also <hi>preserve it in us.</hi> And the Reason hereof is because the Spring of it is in our Head Christ Jesus; it being onely an Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vertue and Power from him unto us by the Holy Ghost; if this be not actually and alwayes continued, whatever is in us, would dye and wither of its self. See <hi>Ephes. 4. 16. Col. 3. 3. Joh.</hi> 4. 14. It is in us as the Fructifying Sap is in a Branch of the Vine or Olive. It is there really and formally, and is the next Cause of the Fruit-bearing of the Branch. But it doth not live and abide by its self, but by a continual Emanation and Communication from the Root. Let that be intercepted and it quickly withers. So is it with this Principle in us, with respect unto its Root Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>(2) Though this Principle or <hi>Habit</hi> of Holiness be of the same <hi>kind</hi> or Nature in all Believers, in all that are sanctified, yet there are in them very <hi>distinct Degrees</hi> of it. In some it is more strong, lively, vigorous and flourishing, in others more weak, feeble and unactive, and this in so great variety, and on so many Occasions, as cannot here be spoken unto.</p>
               <p>(3) That although this <hi>Habit</hi> and Principle is not acquired by any or many Acts of Duty or Obedience, yet is it in a way of Duty <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, encreased, strengthened</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> thereby. God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that we should live in the Exercise of it, and in and by the Multiplication of its Acts and Duties, is it kept alive and stirred up, without which it will be weakened and decay.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> This being what I intend as to the Substance of it, we must in the next place shew, That there is such a <hi>spiritual Habit or Principle of spiritual Life</hi> wrought in Believers, wherein their Holiness doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. Some few Testimonies of many shall suffice as to its present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
               <p>The Work of it is expressed, <hi>Deut. 30. 6. The Lord thy God will Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise thy Heart, to love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart and all thy Soul, that thou mayest live.</hi> The End of Holiness is that <hi>we may live,</hi> and the principal Work of Holiness is, to love the Lord our God with all our Hearts and Souls. And this is the Effect of Gods <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising</hi> our Hearts, without which it will not be. Every Act of Love and Fear, and consequently of every Duty of Holiness whatever, is consequential unto Gods <hi>circumcising of our Hearts,</hi> But it should
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:48389:215"/> seem that this Work of God is only a removal of Hinderances, and doth not express the Collation of the Principle which we assert. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that although it were easie to demonstrate, that this Work of
<hi>circumcising our Hearts</hi> cannot be effected without an implantation of the Principle pleaded for in them, yet it shall suffice at present to evince from hence, that this Effectual Work of God upon our Hearts is antecedently necessary unto all Acts of Holiness in us. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall,
<hi>God writes his Law in our Hearts. Jerem. 31. 33. I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts.</hi> The <hi>Habit</hi> or Principle which we have described, is nothing but a Transcript of the Law of God, implanted and abiding on our Hearts, whereby we comply with and answer unto the whole Will of God therein. This is Holiness in the <hi>Habit</hi> and Principle of it. This is more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<hi>Ezek. 36. 26, 27. A new Heart will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes, and ye shall keep my Judgements and do them.</hi> The whole of all that actual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and all those Duties of Holiness which God requireth of us, is contained in these Expressions; <hi>ye shall walk in my Statutes, and keep my Judgements to doe them.</hi> Antecedent hereunto, and as the Principle and Cause thereof, God gives a <hi>new Heart</hi> and a <hi>new Spirit.</hi> This <hi>new Heart</hi> is an Heart with the Law of God written in it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; and this <hi>new spirit</hi> is the habitual Inclination of that heart unto the Life of God, or all Duties of Obedience. And herein the whole of what we have asserted, is confirmed; namely, that ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently unto all Duties and Acts of Holiness whatever, and as the next Cause of them, there is by the Holy Ghost, a new spiritual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or <hi>habit</hi> of Grace, communicated unto us, and abiding in us, from whence we are made and denominated <hi>holy.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> It is yet more Expressly revealed and declared in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Joh. 3. 6. There is</hi> a Work of the Spirit of God upon us in our Regeneration, we are <hi>born again of the Spirit.</hi> And there is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this Work of the Spirit of God in us, <hi>that which is born</hi> in this new Birth, and that is <hi>spirit</hi> also. It is something <hi>existing</hi> in us, that is of a <hi>spiritual</hi> Nature and <hi>spiritual</hi> Efficacy. It is something <hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> in us, acting in a continual Opposition against the Flesh or Sin; as
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. and unto all Duties of Obedience unto God. And untill this <hi>spirit</hi> is formed in us, that is, our whole Souls have a furnishment of spiritual Power and Ability, we cannot perform any one Act that is spiritually good, not any one <hi>Vital Act</hi> of Obedience. This Spirit or spiritual Nature, which is born of the Spirit, by which alone we are enabled to live to God, is that <hi>Habit</hi> of Grace or Principle of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> which we intend. And so also is it called a New Creature. <hi>He that is in Christ is a new Creature, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 17. It is something, that by an almighty creating Act of the Power of God by his Spirit, that hath the Nature of a <hi>living Creature,</hi> is produced in the Souls of all that are in Christ Jesus. And as it is called the <hi>new Creature,</hi> so it is also <hi>a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. and a Nature is the Principle of all Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; And this is what we plead for. <hi>The Spirit of God createth a new Nature in us, which is the Principle and next Cause of all Acts of the Life of God.</hi> Where this is not, whatever else there may be, there is no
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48389:215"/> Evangelical Holiness. This is that whereby we are enabled to live unto God, to fear him, to walk in his Wayes, and to yield Obedience according to his Mind and Will. See <hi>Ephes. 4. 23, 24. Col.</hi> 3. 10, 11. this the Scripture plentifully testifieth unto; but withall I must adde, that as to the proper Nature or Essence of it, no Mind can apprehend it, no Tongue can express it, none can perfectly understand its glory; some few things may be added to illustrate it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label>(1) This is that whereby we have <hi>Vnion with Jesus Christ</hi> the Head of the Church. Originally and <hi>efficiently</hi> the Holy Spirit dwelling in him and us, is the Cause of this Union. But <hi>formally</hi> this new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace is so. It is that whereby we become <hi>members of his bones and of his flesh, Ephes.</hi> 5. 30. As <hi>Eve was of Adam;</hi> she was one with him because she had the same Nature with him, and that deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, which the Apsotle alludeth unto, so are we of him, partakers of the same <hi>Divine Nature</hi> with him. Thus he that is <hi>Joyned unto the Lord is one spirit, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 17. that is, of one and the same
<hi>spiritual Nature</hi> with him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11, 14. How excellent is this Grace which gives us our Interest in, and Continuity unto the Body of Christ, and to his Person as our Head. It is the same Grace in the <hi>kind</hi> thereof which is in the <hi>holy</hi> Nature of Christ, and renders us one with him.</p>
               <p>(2) Our <hi>Likeness</hi> and <hi>Conformity unto God</hi> consists herein. For it is the <hi>Reparation of his Image</hi> in us, <hi>Ephes. 4. 23, 24. Col.</hi> 3. 10. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I hope I apprehend concerning this Image of God in Believers, and of their Likeness unto him, how great a Priviledge it is, what
<hi>honour</hi> safety and security depend thereon, what Duties are required of us on the Account thereof: But perfectly to conceive or express the Nature and Glory of it, we cannot attain unto, but should learn to adore the Grace whence it doth proceed and is bestowed on us, to admire the Love of Christ, and the Efficacy of his Mediation, whereby it is renewed in us; but the thing it self is ineffable.</p>
               <p>(3) It is our <hi>Life,</hi> our <hi>spiritual Life,</hi> whereby we live to God. Life is the Foundation and summe of all Excellencies: Without this we are <hi>dead in Trespasses and sins,</hi> and how we are quickened by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, hath been declared. But this is the <hi>internal Principle of Life,</hi> whence all Vital Acts in the Life of God do proceed. And whereas we know not well what is the true Form and Essence of Life Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, only we find it, discern it, and judge of it by its Effects; much less do we know the Form and Essence of Life Spiritual, which is far more Excellent and Glorious. This is that Life which is <hi>hid with Christ in God, Coloss.</hi> 3. 3. In which words the Apostle draws a Veil over it, as knowing that we are unable steadfastly to beholds its Glory and Beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> But before I proceed unto a further Description of this Principle of Holiness in its Effects, as before laid down, it may not be amiss
<hi>practically</hi> to call over these general Considerations of its Nature; and our own Concernment in this Truth, which is no empty Notion, will be therein declared. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We may learn hence, not to satisfie our selves, or not to rest in any <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>Duties</hi> of Obedience, in any good Works, how good
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:48389:216"/> and usefull soever in themselves, nor howsoever multiplyed by us, unless there be a <hi>Vital Principle of Holiness</hi> in our Hearts. A few honest Actions, a few usefull Dutyes do satisfie some persons that they are as holy as they should be, or as they need to be. And some mens Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath consisted in the multiplying of outward Duties, that they might be meritorious for themselves and others. But God expressely rejecteth not only such Duties, but the greatest <hi>multitude</hi> of them, and their most frequent Reiteration, if the <hi>heart</hi> be not antecedently purified and sanctified, if it be not possessed with the Principle of Grace and Holiness insisted on; <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Such Acts and Duties may be the Effects of other Causes, the Fruits of other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Meer Legal Convictions will produce them, and put men upon a Course of them. Fears, Afflictions, Terrors of Conscience, Dictates of Reason improved by Education and confirmed by Custom, will direct, yea compell men unto their Observance. But all is lost, men do but labour in the Fire about them, if the Soul be not prepared with this spiritual Principle of <hi>habitual Holiness</hi> wrought in it immediately by the Holy Ghost. Yet we must here observe these two things.</p>
               <p>(1) That so far as these Duties, be they of Morality or Religion, of Piety or Divine Worship, are good in themselves, they ought to be approved, and men encouraged in them. There are sundry wayes whereby the best Duties may be abused and misapplyed, as when men rest in them, as if they were <hi>meritorious,</hi> or the matter of their Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God. For this as is known, is an effectual Means to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Souls of sinners from Faith in Christ for Life and Salvation,
<hi>Rom. 9. 31, 32. Chap.</hi> 10. 3, 4. And there are Reasons and Causes that render them unacceptable before God, with respect unto the Persons by whom they are performed; as when they are not done in Faith, for which <hi>Cain's</hi> Sacrifice was rejected; and when the Heart is not previously sanctified and prepared with a spiritual Principle of Obedience. But yet on neither of these grounds or pretences can we, or ought we to condemn or undervalue the Duties themselves, which are good in their own nature, nor take off men from the performance of them, yea it were greatly to be desired that we could see more of the Fruits of <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> and Duties of Religious Piety among un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Persons than we doe. The World is not in a Condition to spare the <hi>good</hi> Acts of <hi>bad</hi> men. But this we may doe, and as we are called we ought to doe: When men are engaged in a course of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and good Works, on Principles that will not abide and endure the triall, or for Ends that will spoyl and corrupt all they doe, we may tell them, (as our Saviour did the Young man, who gave that great Account of his Diligence in all Legal Duties) <hi>one thing is yet wanting unto you;</hi> you want Faith, or you want Christ, or you want a spiritual Principle of Evangelical Holiness, without which all you do will be lost, and come to no account at the last Day. The due Assertion of Grace never was nor never can be an Obstruction unto any Duty of Obedience. Indeed, when any will give up themselves unto such Works or Actings under the Name of Duties and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto God, which although they may make a specious shew and appearance in the World, yet are <hi>evil</hi> in themselves, or such as God requireth not of men, we may speak against them, deny them, and
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:48389:216"/> take men off from them. So <hi>Persecution</hi> hath been looked on as a good Work, men <hi>supposing they did God good service</hi> when they slew the Disciples of Christ, and men giving their <hi>Goods</hi> unto pious Uses, as they were called, (indeed impious Abuses) to have others pray for their Souls, and expiate their sins, when they were gone out of this World. These and the like other innumerable pretended Duties may be judged, condemned, exploded, without the least fear of deterring men from Obedience.</p>
               <p>(2) That wherever there is this Principle of Holiness in the <hi>Heart,</hi> in those that are <hi>Adult,</hi> there will be the Fruits and Effects of it in the
<hi>Life,</hi> in all Duties of Righteousness, Godliness and Holiness. For the main Work and End of this Principle is to enable us to comply with that Grace of God, which teacheth <hi>us to deny all Vngodliness and worldly Lusts, and to live Soberly, and Righteously, and Godly in this present World, Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. That which we press for, is the great Direction of our Saviour, make <hi>the Tree good, and the Fruit will be so</hi> also. And there can be no more vile and sordid Hypocrisie, than for any to pretend unto inward habitual Sanctification, whilest their Lives are <hi>barren</hi> in the Fruits of Righteousness and Duties of Obedience. Wherever this Root is, there it will assuredly bear Fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It will appear from hence, whence it is that men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and steer such various Courses with respect unto <hi>Holiness.</hi> All men who profess themselves to be <hi>Christians,</hi> are agreed, in words at least, that Holiness is absolutely necessary unto them that would be saved by Jesus Christ. To deny it, is all one as openly to renounce the Gospel. But when they should come to the <hi>practice</hi> of it, some take one false Way some another, and some Actually despise and reject it. Now all this ariseth from Ignorance of the true Nature of <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> on the one hand, and Love of Sin on the other. There is nothing wherein we are <hi>spiritually</hi> and <hi>eternally</hi> concerned, that is more frequently insisted on, than is the true Nature of <hi>Sanctification</hi> and Holiness. But the thing it self, as hath been declared, is deep and mysterious, not to be understood without the Aid of spiritual Light in our Minds. Hence some would have <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> to be Holiness, which as they suppose they can understand by their own Reason, and practise in their own Strength, and I heartily wish that we could see more of the Fruits of it from them. But <hi>real Moral Vertue</hi> will hardly be abased into an Opposition unto Grace; the Pretence of it will be so easily, and is so every day. Some on the other hand place all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in <hi>superstitious Devotions,</hi> in the strict Observance of Religious Duties which Men and not God have appointed. And there is no end of their <hi>Multiplication</hi> of them, nor measure of the Strictness of some in them. The Reason why men give up themselves unto such soul-deceiving Imaginations, is their Ignorance and <hi>hatred</hi> of that only true real Principle of Evangelical Holiness which we have discoursed. For, what the World knoweth not in these things, it alwayes hateth. And they cannot discern it clearly, or in its own Light and Evidence; for it must be <hi>spiritually</hi> discerned. This the Natural man cannot doe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. And in that false Light of Corrupted Reason wherein they discern and judge it, they esteem it <hi>foolishness</hi> or Fancy. There
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:48389:217"/> is not a more Foolish and Fanatical thing in the World with many, than that <hi>internal habitual Holiness</hi> which we are in the Consideration of. And hence are they lead to despise and to hate it. But here the Love of Sin secretly take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> place, and influenceth their Minds. This universal Change of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul in all its Principles of Operation into the Image and Likeness of God, tending to the Extirpation of all sins and vitious Habits, is that which men fear and abhorre. This makes them take up with Morality and superstitious Devotion, any thing that will pacifie a Natural Conscience, and please themselves or others with a
<hi>Reputation of Religion.</hi> It is therefore highly incumbent on all that would not wilfully deceive their own Souls unto their Eternal Ruine, to enquire diligently into the true Nature of <hi>Evangelical Holiness,</hi> and above all to take care that they miss it not in the Foundation, in the true Root and Principle of it, wherein a mistake will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is moreover evident from hence, that it is a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be <hi>truely and really holy</hi> than most Persons are aware of. We may learn eminently, how great and Excellent a Work this of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Holiness is, from the Causes of it. How emphatically doth our Apostle ascribe it unto God even the Father, 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 23. Even the God of Peace himself sanctifie you.</hi> It is so great a Work as that it cannot be wrought by any but the <hi>God of Peace</hi> himself. What is the immediate Work of the Spirit therein, what the Influence of the Mediation and Blood of Christ into it, hath been already in part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and we have yet much more to adde in our Account of it. And these things do sufficiently manifest, how Great, how Excellent and Glorious a Work it is. For it doth not become Divine and Infinite Wisdom, to engage the immediate Power and Efficacy of such glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Causes and Means, for the producing of any ordinary or common Effect. It must be somewhat as of great Importance unto the Glory of God, so of an Eminent Nature in it self. And that little Entrance which we have made into an Enquity after its Nature, manifests how Great and Excellent it is. Let us not therefore deceive our selves with the Shadowes and Appearances of things in a few Duties of Piety, or Righteousness, no nor yet with many of them, if we find not this great Work at least begun in us. It is sad to see what <hi>trifling</hi> there is in these things amongst men. None indeed are contented to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Religion, and very few are willing to admit it in its Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Have we <hi>received</hi> this Principle of Holiness and of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life, by the gracious Operation of the Holy Ghost; there are among many others <hi>three Dutyes</hi> incumbent on us, whereof we ought to be as carefull as of our Souls. And the First is, Carefully and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently by all Means to <hi>cherish</hi> and preserve it in our hearts. This Sacred <hi>Depositum</hi> of the New Creature, of the Divine Nature, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with us, to take care of, to cherish and improve. If we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly or through our neglect suffer it to be wounded by Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, weakened by Corruptions, or not exercised in all known Duties of Obedience, our Guilt is great, and our Trouble will not be small. And then Secondly, It is equally incumbent on us, to <hi>evidence</hi> and manifest it by its <hi>Fruits</hi> in the Mortification of corrupt Lusts and Affections, in all Duties of Holiness, Righteousness, Charity and Piety
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48389:217"/> in the World. For that God may be glorified hereby, is one of the Ends why he indues our Natures with it. And without these visible Fruits, we expose our entire Profession of Holiness to reproach. And in like manner is it required, that we be <hi>thankefull</hi> for what we have received.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> Secondly; As This Principle of Inherent Grace or Holiness hath the <hi>Nature</hi> of an <hi>Habit,</hi> so also hath it the <hi>Properties</hi> thereof. And the first Property of an <hi>Habit</hi> is, that it <hi>inclines</hi> and disposeth the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject wherein it is, unto Acts of its own kind, or suitable unto it. It is directed unto a certain End, and enclines unto Acts or Actions which tend thereunto, and that with evenness and Constancy. Yea Moral Habits are nothing but <hi>strong and firm Dispositions and Inclinations</hi> uuto Moral Acts and Duties of their own kind; as Righteousness, or Temperance, or Meekness. Such a Disposition and Inclination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must be in this <hi>new spiritual Nature</hi> or Principle of Holiness which we have described, wherewith the Souls of Believers are in-laid and furnished by the Holy Ghost in their Sanctification. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> 1. It hath a <hi>certain End,</hi> to enable us whereunto, it is bestowed on us. Although it be a great Work in it self, that wherein the <hi>Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Image of God</hi> in us doth consist, yet is it not wrought in any but with respect unto a further End in this World. And this <hi>end</hi> is, that we may Live to God; We are made <hi>like</hi> unto God, that we may <hi>live</hi> unto God. By the Depravation of our Natures we are <hi>aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this Life of God,</hi> this Divine spiritual Life, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 18. we like it not, but have an Aversation unto it. Yea, we are under the Power of a Death that is universally opposed unto that Life; <hi>For, to be carnally minded is death, Rom.</hi> 8. 6. that is, it is so with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Life of God, and all the Acts that belong thereunto. And this Life of God hath two parts. (1) The <hi>outward Duties</hi> of it, (2) The
<hi>inward Frame</hi> and Actings of it. For the First; Persons under the Power of Corrupted Nature may perform them, and doe so, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Delight, Constancy or Permanency. The Language of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple whereby they are Acted is, <hi>Behold what a Wearyness it is, Mal.</hi> 1. 13. and such Hypocrites will not pray alwayes. But as to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, for the <hi>internal actings of Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> whereby all outward Duties should be quickened and animated, they are utter strangers unto them, utterly alienated from them. With respect unto this Life of God, a Life of spiritual Obedience unto God, are our Natures thus spiritually renewed, or furnished with this spiritual Habit and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace. It is wrought in us, that by vertue thereof we may
<hi>live to God,</hi> without which we cannot do so in any one single Act or Duty whatever. For, they that are in the <hi>flesh</hi> cannot please God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8. Wherefore, the first Property and inseparable Adjunct of it is, that it <hi>enclineth</hi> and <hi>disposeth</hi> the Soul wherein it is, unto all Acts and Duties that belong to the Life of God, or unto all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of holy Obedience, so that it shall attend unto them, not from Conviction or external Impression only, but from an internal genuine Principle so inclining and disposing them thereunto. And these things may be illustrated by what is contrary unto them. There is in the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48389:218"/> state of Nature a <hi>Carnal Mind;</hi> which is the Principle of all Morall and Spiritual Operations in them in whom it is; And this <hi>Carnal Mind</hi> hath an <hi>Enmity,</hi> or is Enmity against God; <hi>it is not subject unto the Law of God, neither indeed can be, Rom.</hi> 8. 7. that is, the Bent and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of it lyes directly against <hi>spiritual</hi> things, or the Mind and Will of God, in all things which concern a Life of Obedience unto himself. Now as this Principle of Holiness is that which is introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into our Souls in Opposition unto, and to the Exclusion of the Carnal Mind; so this Disposition and Inclination of it, is opposite and contrary unto the <hi>Enmity</hi> of the Carnal Mind, as tending alwayes unto Actions <hi>spiritually</hi> good, according to the Mind of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> 2. This <hi>Disposition</hi> of Heart and Soul, which I place as the first Property or Effect of the Principle of Holiness before declared and explained, is in the Scripture called, <hi>Fear, Love, Delight,</hi> and by the names of such other Affections as express a constant regard and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto their Objects. For these things do not denote the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Holiness it self, which is seated in the Mind, or Understanding and <hi>Will,</hi> whereas they are the names of Affections only; but they signifie the first Way whereby that Principle doth act it self in an holy Inclination of the Heart unto Spiritual Obedience. So when the People of <hi>Israel</hi> had engaged themselves by solemn Covenant, to hear and do whatsoever God commanded, God addes concerning it,
<hi>Oh that there were such an Heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandements alwayes, Deut.</hi> 5. 29. that is, that the Bent and Inclinations of their Hearts were alwayes unto Obedience. It is that which is intended in the Promise of the Covenant, <hi>Jerem. 32. 39. I will give them one Heart, that they may fear me,</hi> which is the same with the <hi>new Spirit, Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. The <hi>new Heart,</hi> as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, is the <hi>new Nature,</hi> the new Creature, the new spiritual super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Principle of Holiness; The first Effect, the first Fruit hereof is, the <hi>Fear of God alwayes,</hi> or a New spiritual Bent and Inclination of Soul unto all the Will and Commands of God. And this <hi>new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> this Fear of God, is still expressed as the inseparable Consequent of the new Heart, or the writing of the Law of God in our Hearts, which are the same. So it is called, <hi>Fearing the Lord and his goodness, Hos.</hi> 3. 5. In like manner it is expressed by <hi>Love,</hi> which is the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Soul unto all Acts of Obedience unto God and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, with Delight and Complacency. It is a Regard unto God and his Will, with a Reverence due unto his Nature, and a Delight in him suited unto that Covenant-Relation wherein he stands unto us.</p>

It is moreover expressed by being <hi>spiritually minded: To be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded is Life and Peace, Rom.</hi> 8. 6. that is, the <hi>bent</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> of the Mind unto <hi>spiritual</hi> things, is that whereby we Live to God, and enjoy Peace with him, <hi>it is Life and Peace.</hi> By Nature we savour only the things of the <hi>flesh,</hi> and mind Earthly things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. our Minds or Hearts are set upon them, disposed towards them, ready for all things that lead us to the Enjoyment of them, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in them.

By vertue hereof <hi>David</hi> professeth, that his Soul <hi>followed hard</hi> after God; <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 8. or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined earnestly unto all those Wayes whereby he might live unto him, and come unto the Enjoyment of him: Like the Earnestness which is in him who is in the pursuit of something continually in his Eye, as our Apostle expresseth it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13, 14.

               <p>This therefore is that which I intead. Every Nature hath its Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition unto Actings suitable unto it. The Principle of Holiness is such a Nature, a New or Divine Nature; wherever it is, it constantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the Soul unto Duties and Acts of Holiness; it produceth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Disposition unto them. And as by the Principle it self, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Principle of Sin and Flesh is impaired and subdued, so by this
<hi>gracious Disposition,</hi> the Inclination unto sin which is in us, is weakened, impaired, and gradually taken away.</p>

(3) <hi>Permanently,</hi> unto the End. And where these things are not, no Multiplication of Duties will either make or Denominate any Person <hi>Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1) There is <hi>no Duty of Holiness whatever,</hi> but there is a <hi>Disposition</hi> in a sanctified heart unto it. There is a respect unto all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Some of them may be more contrary unto our natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations than others, some more cross unto our present secular Interests, some attended with more Difficulties and disadvantages than others; and some may be rendred very hazardous by the circumstances of Times and Seasons. But however, if there be a gracious Principle in our Hearts, it will <hi>equally encline and dispose us</hi> unto every one of them in its proper place and season. And the Reason hereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it being a <hi>new Nature,</hi> it equally enclines unto all that belongs unto it, as all Acts of Holy Obedience doe. For every Nature hath an equal Propensity unto all its natural Operations, in their Times and Seasons. Hence our Saviour tried the rich Young Man, who gave an Account of his Duties and Righteousness, with one that lay close unto his secular Interests and worldly Satisfactions. This immediately carryed him off, and evidenced that all he had done besides, was not from an <hi>internal</hi> Principle of spiritual Life. Any other Principle or Cause of Duties and Obedience, will upon Sollicitations give way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an habitual Reserve of one thing or other that is contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. It will admit either of the <hi>Omission</hi> of some Duties, or of the
<hi>Commission</hi> of some Sin, or of the retaining of some Lust. So <hi>Naaman,</hi> who vowed Obedience upon his Conviction of the Power of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> would nevertheless upon the sollicitation of his Worldly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> have a Reserve to bow in the house of <hi>Rimmon.</hi> So Omissions of Duties that are dangerous, in a way of Profession, or the Reserve of some corrupt Affections, Love of the World, Pride of Life, will be admitted upon any other Principle of Obedience, and that <hi>habitually.</hi>
                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:48389:219"/> For even those who have this real spiritual Principle of Holiness, may be <hi>surprized</hi> into actual Omission of Duties, Commission of sins, and a temporary indulgence unto Corrupt Affections. But <hi>habitually</hi> they cannot be so. An <hi>habitual Reserve</hi> for any thing that is sinfull or Morally evil, is eternally inconsistent with this Principle of <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Light and Darkness, Fire and Water, may as soon be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in one. And hereby is it distinguished from all other Principles, Reasons or Causes, whereon men may perform any Duties of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards God.</p>

It is true, that the Actings of Grace which proceed from it, are in us sometimes more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense and vigorous than at other times. It is so also, that we are our selves sometimes more watchfull, and diligently intent on all Occasions of acting Grace, whether in Solemn Duties, or in our general Course, or on particular Occasions, than we are at some other times. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there are especial Seasons wherein we meet with greater Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Obstructions from our Lusts and Temptations than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, whereby this <hi>holy Disposition</hi> is intercepted, and impeded. But notwithstanding all these things, which are contrary unto it, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of its Operations, in it self and its own Nature it doth
<hi>constantly and evenly,</hi> encline the Soul at all Times and on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, unto Duties of Holiness. Whatever falls out otherwise, is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental unto it. This Disposition is like a Stream that ariseth equally from a living Fountain, as our Saviour expresseth it; <hi>John 4. 14. A Well of Water springing up into everlasting Life.</hi> As this <hi>stream</hi> passeth in its Course it may meet with Oppositions, that may either stop it or divert it for a season: But its Waters still press forward continually. Hereby doth the Soul <hi>set God alwayes before him,</hi> and walk continually as in his sight. Men may perform Duties of Obedience unto God, yea many of them, yea be engaged into a constant Course of them as to their outward performance, on other Grounds, from other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and by vertue of other Motives. But whatever they are, they are not a new Nature in and unto the Soul, and so do not dispose men <hi>constantly and evenly</hi> unto what they lead unto. Sometimes their Impressions on the Mind are strong and violent, there is no withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them but the Duties they require must instantly be complyed withall. So is it when Convictions are excited by Dangers or Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, strong Desires, or the like. And again, they leave the Soul unto its own Formality and Course, without the least impression from them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any Duties whatever. There is no Cause nor Principle, or Reason of Obedience, besides this one insisted on, that will <hi>evenly and constantly</hi> incline unto the Acts of it. Men proceeding only upon the Power of Convictions, are like those at Sea, who sometimes meet with storms or vehement winds which sit them for their Course, and would seem immediately to drive them as it were with Violence into their Port or Harbour, but quickly after they have an <hi>utter Calme,</hi> no breath of Air stirres to help them forward; and then it may be after a while
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:48389:219"/> another <hi>gust of wind</hi> befalls them, which they again suppose will dispatch their Voyage; but that also quickly fails them. Where this Principle is, Persons have a natural Current which carryes them on quickly, <hi>evenly,</hi> and <hi>constantly;</hi> And although they may sometimes meet with Storms, Tempests, and Cross winds, yet the <hi>Stream,</hi> the Current which is natural, at length worketh its way, and holds on its course through all external occasional <hi>impediments.</hi>

They shall <hi>never doe</hi> so in whom is this <hi>Fear,</hi> which is permanent and Endless. It is true, that it is our Duty, with all Care and Diligence, in the use of all Means, to preserve, cherish and improve both the Principle it self, and its actings in these Holy Dispositions. We are to <hi>shew all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence unto the full Assurance of Hope unto the End; Heb.</hi> 6. 11. And in the use of Means and the Exercise of Grace is it, that it is infallibly kept and preserved, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 31. And it is also true, that sometimes, in some Persons, upon the fierce <hi>interpositions</hi> of Temptations, with the violent and deceitfull working of Lusts, the Principle it self may seem for a Season to be <hi>utterly stifled,</hi> and this Property of it to be destroyed; as it seems to have been with <hi>David</hi> under his sad Fall and decay. Yet such is the Nature of it, that it is <hi>immortal,</hi> ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, and which shall never absolutely dye; such is the Relation of it unto the Covenant-Faithfulness of God, and Mediation of Christ, as that it shall never utterly cease or be extinguished. It abideth
<hi>disposing</hi> and <hi>enclining</hi> the Heart unto all Dutyes of Holy Obedience unto the <hi>grave.</hi> Yea ordinarily, and where its genuine Work and Tendency is not interrupted by cursed Negligence or Love of the World, it thrives and growes continually unto the End. Hence some are not only Fruitfull, but <hi>Fat and flourishing in their Old Age,</hi> and as the <hi>outward</hi> man decayeth, so in them the <hi>inward</hi> man is dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in Strength and Power. But as unto all other Principles of Obedience whatever, as it is in their own nature to decay and wither, all their actings growing insensibly weaker and less efficacious, so for the most part either the <hi>increase of Carnal Wisdom,</hi> or the Love of the World, or some powerfull Temptations at one time or other put an utter end unto them, and they are of no use at all. Hence there is not a more secure Generation of sinners in the World, than those who have been acted by the Power of Conviction unto a course of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the performance of many Duties. And those of them who fall not openly to Profaneness or Lasciviousness, or Neglect of all
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48389:220"/> Duties of Religion, do continue in their Course, from what they have been habituated unto, finding it complyant with their present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and Conditions in the World, as also having been preserved from such Wayes and Practices as are inconsistent with their present course by the power of their former Convictions. But the Power of these Principles, of Conviction, Education, Impressions from Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Dangers, Fears, all in one, dye before men, and if their eyes were open, they might see the End of them.</p>
               <p>In this manner therefore, doth the <hi>New Divine Nature</hi> that is in Believers, <hi>dispose</hi> and <hi>encline</hi> them, <hi>impartially, evenly</hi> and <hi>permanently</hi> unto all Acts and Duties of Holy Obedience.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>24</label> One thing yet remains to be cleared, that there may be no mistake in this matter. And this is, that in those who are thus constantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and disposed unto all the Acts of an Heavenly spiritual Life, there are yet remaining contrary Dispositions and Inclinations also.</p>
               <p>There are yet in them Inclinations and Dispositions to sin, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Remainders</hi> of a contrary habitual Principle. This the Scripture calls the <hi>Flesh, Lust, the sin that dwelleth in us,</hi> the <hi>Body of Death;</hi> being what yet remaineth in Believers of that vitious corrupted Depravation of our Nature, which came upon us by the loss of the Image of God, disposing the whole Soul unto all that is evil. This yet continueth in them, enclining them unto Evil, and all that is so, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Power and Efficacy that is remaining unto it in various Degrees. Sundry things are here observable; as (1) This is that which is <hi>singular</hi> in this Life of God. There are in the same Mind, Will and Affections, namely, of a Person Regenerate, contrary Habits and
<hi>inclinations,</hi> continually opposing one another, and acting adversly about the same Objects and Ends. And this is not from any Jarrings or Disorder between the distinct Faculties of the Soul it self, as in Natural men there are adverse Actings between their Wills and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the one hand bent unto sin, and the Light of their Minds and Consciences on the other, prohibiting the committing of sin, and condemning its Commission, which Disorder is discernible in the Light of Nature, and is sufficiently canvased by the <hi>Old Philosophers.</hi> But these contrary Habits, Inclinations and Actings are in the <hi>same Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> (2) As this cannot be apprehended but by vertue of a <hi>previous Conviction</hi> and acknowledgement, both of the total Corruption of our Nature by the Fall, and the Initial Renovation of it by Jesus Christ, wherein these contrary Habits and Dispositions do consist, so it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed without an open Rejecting of the Gospel, and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Experience of all that do Believe, or know any thing of what it is to live to God. We intend no more but what the Apostle so plainly asserts, <hi>Gal. 5. 17. The Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh;</hi> that is, in the Mind, Will and Affections of Believers, <hi>and these are contrary the one unto the other;</hi> they are contrary Principles attended with contrary Inclinations and Actings,
<hi>so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</hi> (3) There cannot be
<hi>contrary Habits</hi> meerly Natural or Moral in the same Subject, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto the same Object, at the same time; at least they cannot be so in any high Degree, so as to encline and act contrary one to another
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:48389:220"/> with Urgency or Efficacy. For violent Inclinations unto sin, and a Conscience fiercely condemning for sin, whereby sinners are sometimes torn and even distracted, are not <hi>contrary Habits</hi> in the same Subject. Only Conscience brings in from without the Judgment of God, against what the Will and Affections are bent upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>25</label> But it is, as was said, otherwise in the contrary Principles or <hi>Habits</hi> of <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>flesh,</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> with their adverse inclinations and actings. Only they cannot be in the <hi>highest Degree</hi> at the same time, nor be equally prevalent or predominant in the same instances. That is, Sin and Grace cannot <hi>bear rule</hi> in the same Heart at the same time, so as that it should be equally under the conduct of them both. Nor can they have in the same Soul contrary Inclinations <hi>equally</hi> effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious; for then would they absolutely obstruct all sorts of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatever. Nor have they the same <hi>influence</hi> into particular Actions, so as that they should not be justly denominated from one of them either <hi>gracious</hi> or <hi>sinfull.</hi> But by Nature the vitious depraved Habit of sin, or <hi>the flesh,</hi> is wholly predominant and universally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, constantly disposing and enclining the Soul to sin. Hence <hi>all the Imaginations of mens hearts are evil, and that continually:</hi> And,
<hi>they that are in the Flesh cannot please God.</hi> There dwelleth no <hi>good thing</hi> in them, nor can they do any thing that is good; and the Flesh is able generally to subdue the Rebellions of Light, Convictions and Conscience, against it. But, upon the Introduction of the New Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace and Holiness in our Sanctification, this Habit of sin is weakened, impaired, and so disenabled, as that it cannot nor shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline unto sin with that Constancy and Prevalency as formerly, nor press unto it ordinarily with the same Urgency and Violence. Hence in the Scripture it is said to be dethroned by Grace, so as that it shall not <hi>reign or lord it over us,</hi> by hurrying us into the pursuit of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable
<hi>inclinations, Rom.</hi> 6. 12. Concerning these things the
<hi>Reader</hi> may consult my Treatises of the <hi>Remainder of Indwelling sin,</hi> and the <hi>Mortification of it in Believers.</hi>

<hi>dethroned,</hi> corrected, impaired and disabled, yet is it never wholly and absolutely dispossessed and cast out of the Soul in this Life. There it will remain, and there it will work, seduce and tempt, more or less, according as its remaining Strength and Advantages are. By Reason hereof, and the Opposition that hence ariseth against it, the Principle of Grace and Holiness cannot, nor doth perfectly and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
<hi>encline</hi> the Heart and Soul unto the Life of God and the Acts thereof, so as that they in whom it is should be sensible of no Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition made thereunto, or of no contrary motions and inclinations unto sin. For, the <hi>Flesh</hi> will lust against the Spirit, as well as the Spirit against the Flesh, and these are contrary. This is the <hi>Analogie</hi> that is between these two States. In the state of Nature, the Principle of sin or the Flesh is predominant and bears rule in the Soul, but there is a Light remaining in the Mind, and a Judgment in the Conscience, which being heightned with Instructions and Convictions doe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually oppose it, and condemn <hi>Sin</hi> both before and after its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48389:221"/> In them that are Regenerate it is the Principle of Grace and Holiness that is predominant and beareth rule: But there is in them still a Principle of Lust and sin, which rebells against the Rule of Grace, much in the proportion that Light and Convictions rebell against the Rule of sin in the Unregenerate. For as they hinder men from doing many evils, which their ruling Principle of sin strongly inclines them unto, and puts them on many Dutyes that it likes not; so do these on the other side in them that are Regenerate: They hinder them from doing many good things which their ruling Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple inclines unto, and carry them into many Evils which it doth abhorr.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>27</label> But this belongs unto the Principle of Holiness, inseparably and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily; that it inclineth and disposeth the Soul wherein it is, <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally</hi> unto all Acts of Holy Obedience. And these <hi>inclinations</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant unto any other, and keep the Soul pointed to Holiness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.

Our Living unto God, our walking in his Wayes and Statutes, keeping his Judgements, which things express our whole Actual Obedience, are the Effects of the New Heart that is given unto us, whereby we are enabled unto them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27. But this must be somewhat further and distinctly declared.

               <p>That by Nature we have <hi>no Power</hi> unto, or for any thing that is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually good, or to any Acts or Dutyes of Evangelical Holiness, hath been sufficiently proved before. <hi>When we were yet without strength in due time Christ dyed for the Vngodly, Rom.</hi> 5. 6.

<hi>no Power to live to God.</hi> But, as was said, this hath been formerly fully and largely confirmed in our Declaration of the <hi>impotency</hi> of our Nature by Reason of its Death in Sin, and so need not here to be further insisted on.</p>

The Water of the Spirit therein, is not only a <hi>Well of Water</hi> abiding in them, but it <hi>springeth up into everlasting Life, Joh.</hi> 4. 14. or enables us conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to such gracious Actings as have a Tendency thereunto. There is a <hi>sufficiency</hi> in the Grace of God bestowed on them that Believe, to enable them unto the Obedience required of them. So God told our Apostle, when he was ready to faint under his Temptations, that <hi>his Grace was sufficient for him, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 9. or there is a <hi>Power</hi> in all that are sanctified, whereby they are able to yield all holy Obedience unto God. They are <hi>alive</hi> unto God, <hi>alive</hi> to Righteousness and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. They have a Principle of spiritual Life; and where there is
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:48389:222"/> Life, there is <hi>Power</hi> in its Kind and for its End. Whence there is not in our Sanctification only a <hi>Principle</hi> or inherent <hi>Habit of Grace</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on us, whereby we really and habitually as to State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition differ from all unregenerate persons whatever, but there belongs moreover thereunto, an <hi>active Power</hi> or an Ability for and unto spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual holy Obedience, which none are partakers of but those who are so sanctified. And unto this Power there is a respect in all the Commands or Precepts of Obedience, that belong to the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The Commands of each Covenant respect the Power given in and by it. Whatever God required or doth require of any, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Old Covenant or the Precepts thereof, it was on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, and proportionate unto, the <hi>strength</hi> given under and by that Covenant. And that we have lost that strength by the Entrance of sin, exempts us not from the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Command; and thence it is that we are righteously obliged to doe, what we have no Power to perform. So also the Command of God under the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> as to all that Obedience which he requireth of us, respects that <hi>Power</hi> which is given and communicated unto us thereby. And this is that
<hi>Power</hi> which belongs unto the New Creature, the Habit and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace and Holiness, which as we have proved, is wrought by the Holy Ghost in all Believers.</p>

<hi>spiritual</hi> good which is in us by Nature, which it cures and takes away. This we have before at large declared, and thither the <hi>Reader</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. When we know what it is to be <hi>without Power</hi> or Strength in Spiritual things, we may thence learn what it is to have them: To this purpose we may consider, that there are three things or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in our Souls, which are the Subject of all Power or Impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in <hi>spiritual</hi> things; namely, our <hi>Vnderstandings, Wills</hi> and <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> That our spiritual Impotency ariseth from their Depravation hath been proved before; and what Power we have for holy spiritual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it must consist in some especial Ability communicated distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto all these Faculties. And our Enquiry therefore is, What is this <hi>Power</hi> in the Mind, what in the Will, and what in the Affections. And,</p>
               <p>(1) This <hi>power</hi> in the Mind consists in a <hi>spiritual Light</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> to discern <hi>spiritual</hi> Things in a <hi>spiritual</hi> Manner, which Men in the state of Nature are utterly devoyd of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13, 14.

It is true, they have not all of them this Power and Ability in the same Degree; but every one of them hath a sufficiency of it, so as to discern what concerns themselves and their Dutyes necessarily. Some of them seem indeed to be very low in Knowledge, and in comparison of others very Ignorant. For there are different Degrees in these things, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 7. And some of them are kept in that Condition by their own <hi>Negligence</hi> and Sloth. They do not use as they ought, nor improve those Means of Growing in Grace and in the Knowledge of Jesus Christ, which God prescribes unto them; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 16. But every one who is truely sanctified, and who thereby hath received the least Degree of saving Grace, hath Light enough to understand the <hi>spiritual</hi> Things of the Gospel in a <hi>spiritual</hi> Manner. When the Mysteries of the Gospel are Preached unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, some of them may be so declared as that those of meaner Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities and Abilities may not be able to comprehend aright the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of them, which yet is necessary to be so proposed for the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of those who are more grown in Knowledge. Nevertheless, there is not any the meanest of them, but hath a spiritual insight into the things themselves intended, so far as they are necessary unto their Faith and Obedience in the Condition wherein they are. This the Scripture gives such abundant Testimony unto, as to render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable. For we have <hi>received the Spirit of God, that we may know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> By vertue of what we have received, we know or discern Spiritual things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.

Believers have <hi>Free-will</hi> unto that which is spiritually Good. For they are freed from that Bondage and slavery unto sin which they were under in the state of Nature: Whatever some dispute concerning the Nature of
<hi>Free-will,</hi> that it consists in an <hi>Indifferency</hi> unto Good or Evil, one thing or another, with a Power of applying it self unto all its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, whatever their <hi>Objects</hi> be, as the Scripture knoweth nothing of it, so it is that which we <hi>cannot</hi> have, and if we could, it would be no <hi>advantage</hi> at all unto us, yea we had much better be without it. Have it indeed we <hi>cannot,</hi> for a supposition of it includes a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of all our Dependance on God, making all the <hi>springs</hi> of our Actions to be absolutely and <hi>formally</hi> in our selves. Neither, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prejudices, Temptations and Corruptions that we are possessed
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:48389:223"/> and exercised with, would such a <hi>flexibility</hi> of Will be of any Use or Advantage unto us, but would rather certainly give us up to the Power of Sin and Sathan. All that the Scripture knows about <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> is that in the state of Nature antecedent unto the Converting sanctifying Work of the Spirit, all men whatever are in <hi>bondage unto sin,</hi> and that in all the Faculties of their Souls. They are sold under sin, are not <hi>subject unto the Law of God, nor can be;</hi> can neither think, nor will, nor doe, nor desire, nor love any thing that is <hi>spiritually</hi> Good, according to the Mind of God. But as unto what is Evil, perverse, unclean, that they are free and open unto, ready for, prone and inclined, and every way able to doe. On the other side, in those who are renewed by the Holy Ghost and sanctified, it acknowledgeth and teacheth a <hi>freedom</hi> of Will, not in an Indifferency and Flexibility unto Good and Evil, but in a Power and Ability to like, love, choose, and cleave unto God and his Will in all things. The Will is now freed from its Bondage unto sin, and being enlarged by Light and Love, willeth and chooseth freely the things of God, having received spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power and Ability so to doe. It is the Truth, that is, Faith in the Gospel, the Doctrine of the Truth, which is the Means of this Freedom. The <hi>Truth that makes you free, Joh.</hi> 8. 32. And it is the Son of God by his Spirit who is the principal Efficient cause of it. <hi>For if the Son make us free, then are we free indeed, v.</hi> 36. and otherwise we are not, whatever we pretend.

Whether there be a Power in Man, <hi>indifferently</hi> to Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himself, his Choice and all his Actings, to this, or that, Good or Evil, one thing or another, independently on the Will, Power and Providence of God, and his Disposal of all future Events. This indeed we deny, as that which is inconsistent with the Prescience, Authority, Decrees and Dominion of God; and as that which would prove cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ruinous and destructive to our selves. 2. Whether there be in men <hi>unregenerate,</hi> not renewed by the Holy Ghost, a <hi>Freedom, Power</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> unto that which is <hi>spiritually good,</hi> or to Believe and Obey according to the Mind and Will of God. This also we deny, as that which is contrary to innumerable Testimonies of Scripture, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely destructive of the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Freedom</hi> of Will that is in Believers, do consist in an <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> from any Determination only, with a <hi>power</hi> equally ready for Good or Evil, according as the Will shall determine it self; or whether it consist in a Gracious <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> to choose, will and doe that which is <hi>spiritually Good,</hi> in Opposition to the Bondage and slavery unto sin, wherein we were before detained. This last is that Liberty and Power of the Will which we assert with the Scripture in persons that are sanctified. And a <hi>Liberty</hi> this is every way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with all the Operations of God, as the Sovereign first Cause of all things; every way complyant with, and an Effect of the special Grace of God, and the Operations of the Holy Ghost; a Liberty
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:48389:223"/> whereby our Obedience and Salvation are secured, in Answer to the Promises of the Covenant. And who, that understands himself, would change this reall, usefull, gracious <hi>free-will,</hi> given by Jesus Christ the Son of God, when he makes us <hi>free,</hi> and an Effect of Gods writing his Law in our Hearts, to cause us to walk in his Statutes, that Property of the new Heart whereby it is able to consent unto, choose and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace freely the things of God, for that fictitious <hi>imaginary freedom,</hi> yea for it if it were <hi>reall,</hi> of an Indifferency unto all things, and an Equal Power unto every thing, whether it be Good or Evil. I say then, that by the Habit of Grace and Holiness infused into us by the Spirit of Sanctification, the Will is freed, enlarged, and enabled to answer the Commands of God for Obedience, according to the Tenor of the New Covenant. This is that <hi>freedom,</hi> this is that <hi>Power</hi> of the
<hi>Will</hi> which the Scripture reveals and regards, and which by all the Promises and Precepts of it we are obliged to use and exercise, and no other.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> The Properties of this Power are <hi>Readiness</hi> and <hi>Facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Wherever it is, it renders the Soul <hi>ready</hi> unto all Dutyes of Holy Obedience, and renders all Dutyes of holy Obedience <hi>easie</hi> unto the Soul.</p>
               <p>1. It gives <hi>Readiness,</hi> by removing and taking away all those <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances</hi> which the Mind is apt to be clogged with and hindred by, from Sin, the World, spiritual Sloth, and Unbelief. This is that which we are exhorted unto in a way of Duty, <hi>Heb. 12. 1. Luke</hi> 12. 35. 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 13. chap. 4. 1. Ephes.</hi> 6. 14. Herein is the Spirit <hi>ready</hi> though the Flesh be weak, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 35. And those Incumbrances which give an <hi>unreadiness</hi> unto Obedience to God, may be considered two wayes. (1) As they are in their <hi>full power</hi> and <hi>efficacy,</hi> in persons Unregenerate; whence they are unto every <hi>good work reprobate; Tit.</hi> 1. 13. Hence proceed all those prevalent Tergiversations against a Complyance with the Will of God, and their own Convictions, which bear sway in such
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:48389:224"/> persons. <hi>Yet a little slumber, a little sleep, a little folding of the hands to sleep, Prov.</hi> 6. 10. By these do men so often put off the Calls of God, and perniciously procrastinate from time to time a full Complyance with their Convictions. And whatever particular Dutyes such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons do perform, yet are their Hearts and Minds never prepared or
<hi>ready</hi> for them; but the <hi>incumbrances</hi> mentioned, do influence them into spiritual Disorders in all that they doe. (2) These Principles of
<hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Vnreadiness</hi> do oft-times <hi>partially</hi> influence the Minds of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers themselves unto great Indispositions unto <hi>spiritual</hi> Dutyes; So the Spouse states her case, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 5. 2, 3. By reason of her Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in the World, she had an <hi>unreadiness</hi> for that Converse and Communion with Christ, which she was called unto. And it is so not unfrequently with the Best of men in this World. A spiritual <hi>unready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> unto holy Dutyes, arising from the Power of Sloth or the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Life, is no small part of their <hi>sin</hi> and Trouble. Both these are removed by this <hi>spiritual Power</hi> of the Principle of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> in Believers. The total prevailing <hi>Power</hi> of them, such as is in persons <hi>unregenerate,</hi> is broken by the first Infusion of it into the Soul, wherein it gives an <hi>habitual</hi> fitness and Preparation of Heart unto all Dutyes of Obedience unto God. And by various Degrees it freeth Believers from the Remainders of the Incumbrances which they have yet to conflict with; and this it doth three wayes. As (1) it <hi>weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> and taketh off the <hi>bent</hi> of the Soul from Earthly things, so as they shall not possess the Mind as formerly, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 2. How it doth this, was declared before, and when this is done, the Mind is greatly eased of its Burden, and some way <hi>ready</hi> unto its Duty. (2) It gives an <hi>insight</hi> into the Beauty, the Excellency and Glory of <hi>Holiness</hi> and all Dutyes of Obedience. This they see nothing of who being unsanctified, are under the Power of their Natural Darkness. They can see no <hi>Beauty in Holiness,</hi> no form nor Comeliness why it should be desired; and it is no wonder if they are unfree to the Dutyes of it, which they are but as it were compelled unto. But the spiritual <hi>Light</hi> wherewith this Principle of Grace is accompanyed, discovers an Excellency in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and the Dutyes of it, and in the Communion with God which we have thereby, so as greatly to encline the mind unto them, and prepare it for them. (3) It causeth the <hi>Affections</hi> to cleave and adhere unto them with Delight. <hi>How doe I love thy Law,</hi> saith <hi>David, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in thy Statutes, they are sweeter unto me than the Honey-Comb.</hi> Where these three things concurr, that the Mind is freed from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Influences of carnal Lusts and Love of this World, where the Beauty and Excellency of Holiness and the Dutyes of Obedience lye clear in the Eyes of the Soul, and where the Affections cleave unto
<hi>spiritual</hi> things as commanded, then will be that <hi>Readiness</hi> in Obedience which we enquire after.</p>

Whatever men do from an <hi>Habit,</hi> they doe with some kind of <hi>Easiness.</hi> That is easie to them which they are accustomed unto, though hard and difficult in its self. And what is done from
<hi>Nature</hi> is done with Facility. And the Principle of Grace as we have shewed, is a new Nature, an infused <hi>Habit</hi> with respect unto the Life
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:48389:224"/> of God, or all Dutyes of Holy Obedience. I grant, there will be Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position unto them even in the Mind and Heart it self, from sin and Sathan, and Temptations of all sorts, yea and they may sometimes arise so high, as either to <hi>defeat</hi> our purposes and intentions unto Dutyes, or to clogge us in them, to take off our Chariot-wheels, and to make us drive heavily. But still it is in the Nature of the Principle of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness to make the whole Course of Obedience and all the Dutyes of it <hi>easie</hi> unto us, and to give us a <hi>Facility</hi> in their Performance. For (1) it introduceth a <hi>suitableness</hi> between our Minds and the Dutyes we are to perform. By it is the Law written in our Hearts; that is, there is an Answerableness in them unto all that the Law of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. In the state of Nature, the great things of the Law of God are a <hi>strange thing unto us, Hos.</hi> 8. 12. there is an <hi>enmity</hi> in our Minds against them; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. There is no <hi>suitableness</hi> between our Minds and them. But this is taken away by the Principle of <hi>Grace.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by do the Mind and Duty answer one another, as the Eye and a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Body. Hence the Commands of <hi>Christ are not grievous</hi> unto them in whom it is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 3. They do not appear to contain any thing uncouth, unreasonable, burdensome, or any way unsuited to that new Nature whereby the Soul is influenced and acted. Hence all the Wayes of <hi>Wisdom</hi> are unto Believers as they are in themselves, <hi>Pleasantness, and all her paths are peace, Prov.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>The great Notion of some in these dayes is, about the <hi>suitableness</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> unto <hi>Reason.</hi> And to make good their Assertion in the principal Mysteries of it, because Reason will not come to them, they bring them by violence unto their Reason. But it is with respect unto this renewed Principle alone that there is a <hi>suitableness</hi> in any of the things of God unto our Minds and Affections. (2) It keeps up the Heart or whole Person unto a <hi>frequency</hi> of all Holy Acts and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And <hi>frequency</hi> gives <hi>facility</hi> in every kind. It puts the Soul upon reiterated Actings of Faith and Love, or renewed holy Thoughts and Meditations. It is a Spring that is continually bubling up in them, on the frequent Repetition of the daily Dutyes of Prayer, Reading, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Discourse; as on closing with all Opportunities and Occasions of Mercy, Benignity, Charity and Bounty amongst men. Hereby is the Heart so accustomed unto the Yoke of the Lord, and made so conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in his Wayes, that it is <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to it to bear them, and to be engaged in them. And it will be found by Experience, that the more Intermissions of Dutyes of any sort we fall under, the more
<hi>difficulty</hi> we shall find in the performance of them. (3) It engageth the <hi>Assistance</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Spirit.</hi> It is the Divine Nature, the New Creature which the Lord Christ careth for; in and by its Actings in all Duties of Obedience doth its Life consist: Therein also is it streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and improved. For this cause doth the Lord Christ continually come in by the Supplyes of his Spirit unto its Assistance. And when the strength of Christ is engaged, then and there is his Yoke <hi>easie</hi> and his Burden <hi>light.</hi>

And if their Impediments do arise from what they know themselves to be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site unto them, and that Principle whereby they are acted, then not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this Objection it may be in the Nature of the Principle of Holiness to give <hi>Facility</hi> in all the Duties of it.</p>

<hi>assiduous</hi> in the Performance of all those Duties which they now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that they find so much difficulty in. The Principle of Grace and Holiness gives <hi>Facility</hi> in all Dutyes of Obedience, but in the <hi>proper</hi> Way and Order. It first gives <hi>Constancy</hi> and <hi>Assiduity,</hi> and then <hi>Easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> If men comply not with its Guidance and Inclination in the former, it is in vain for them to expect the latter. If we are not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> in all Acts of Obedience, none of them will ever be <hi>easie</hi> unto us. Let not those who can omit <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>due</hi> Seasons of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Prayer, Hearing, Charity, Moderation in all things, Patience, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and the like, at their pleasure, on the least Occasions, Excuses, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions, ever think or hope to have the Wayes of Obedience smooth, its Paths pleasant, or its Duties <hi>easie.</hi> Let him never think to attain any <hi>Readiness, Delight</hi> or <hi>Facility</hi> in any Art or Science, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beginning at it, touching upon it sometimes. As this is the way in all sorts of things Natural and Spiritual, to be alwayes <hi>learning,</hi> and never to come to the Knowledge of the Truth; so in the Practice of Holy Obedience; if men are as it were alwayes <hi>beginning,</hi> one while performing, another intermitting the Duties of it, fearing or being unwilling to engage into a <hi>constant, equal, assiduous</hi> Discharge of them, they will be alwayes <hi>striving,</hi> but never come unto any <hi>Readiness</hi> or
<hi>Facility</hi> in them.</p>
               <p>(3) The Difficulty and Burdensomeness complained of, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Interposition of <hi>perplexing Temptations,</hi> which weary,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:48389:225"/> disquiet and distract the Mind. This may be and frequently is so, and yet our Assertion not impeached.

               <p>(1) Let us take heed, that we <hi>deceive</hi> not our selves, as though it would suffice unto Gospel-Holiness, that we have <hi>occasionally good Purposes</hi> of leaving Sin and living unto God, then when something urgeth upon us more than ordinary, with the Effects which such Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses will produce. Afflictions, Sicknesses, Troubles, sense of great Guilt, fear of Death, and the like, do usually produce this Frame. And although it is most remote from any pretence unto <hi>Evangelical Obedience,</hi> yet I could not but give a Caution against it, because it is that whereby the Generality of men in the World do delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Eternal Ruine. It is rare to find any that are so stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Profligate, but at one time or another, they project and design, yea promise and engage unto a Change of their Course, and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Lives, doing sundry things it may be in the pursuit of those Designs and Purposes. For they will thereon abstain from their old Sins, with whose haunt they are much perplexed, and betake themselves unto the Performance of those Duties from whence they expect most Relief unto their Consciences, and whose Neglect doth most reflect upon them. Especially will they do so when the hand of God is upon them in Afflictions and Dangers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 34, 35, 36, 37. And this produceth in them that kind of Goodness, which God sayes, is <hi>like the Morning Cloud or the Early Dew,</hi> things that make a fair Appearance of something, but immediately vanish away, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 4. Certainly there need not much pains to convince any man, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably this comes short of that <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> which is a Fruit of the Sanctification of the Spirit. It hath neither the Root of it, nor any Fruit that doth so much as resemble it. But it is to be lamented, that such Multitudes of Rational Creatures, living under the Means of Light and Grace, should so vainly and wofully delude their own Souls. That which they aim at and intend, is to have that in them whereby they may be accepted with God. Now not to insist on what will absolutely frustrate all the Designs of such persons, namely, their want of Faith in Christ, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in his Righteousness thereby, which they are regardless of; all that they project and design is as farre beneath that Holiness which God requireth of them, and which they think hereby to obtain, as the Earth is beneath the Heavens. All that they do in this kind is utterly lost, it will never be either a Righteousness <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> them or an Holiness <hi>in</hi> them. But this Deceit is frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked; God only by his Grace can remove and take it away from the Minds of Men.</p>

These things go a great way in the World, and many deceive both themselves and others by them. <hi>Gifts</hi> are from the Holy Ghost in an especial manner; and therefore greatly to be esteemed. They are also frequently use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in and unto the Church; For <hi>the Manifestation of the Spirit is given unto men to profit withall.</hi> And they put men on such Duties as have a great <hi>shew</hi> and Appearance of Holiness. By the help of them alone may men <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>preach,</hi> and maintain spiritual Communication among them with whom they do converse. And as Circumstances may be ordered, they put sundry persons on a frequent performance of these Duties; and so keep them up to an Eminency in Profession. But yet when all is done, they are not <hi>Holiness,</hi> nor are the Duties performed in the strength of them alone, Duties of <hi>Evangelical Obedience</hi> accepted of God in them by whom they are performed; and they may be where there is nothing of Holiness at all. They are not indeed only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Holiness, but subservient unto it, and exceeding promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it in Souls that are really Gracious. But they may be <hi>alone without Grace,</hi> and then are they apt to deceive the Mind with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being and doing what they are not, nor doe. Let them be called to an Account by the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of that Habit and Principle of Grace which is in all true Holiness as before explained, and it will quickly appear how short they come thereof. For, as their Subject where they have their Residence, is the <hi>mind only,</hi> and not the Will or Affections, any further but as they are influenced or restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Light, so they do not <hi>renew</hi> nor <hi>change</hi> the Mind it self, so as to <hi>transform</hi> it into the Image of God. Neither do they give the Soul a general Inclination unto all Acts and Duties of Obedience, but only a Readiness for that Duty which their Exercise doth peculiarly consist in. Wherefore, they answer no one Property of true Holiness, and we have not seldom seen Discoveries made thereof.</p>

To be a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>Holy</hi> man according to the Gospel, and to be a <hi>Moral</hi> man, is all one with them. And as yet it is not declared, whether there be any Difference between <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> and <hi>Philosophical Morality.</hi> Wherefore, I shall proceed to the Second Thing proposed; And this is, further to prove, That this <hi>Habit</hi> or Gracious Principle of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is <hi>specifically distinct</hi> from all other Habits of the Mind whatever, whether Intellectual or Moral, Connate or Acquired, as also from all that Common Grace and the Effects of it, whereof any Persons not really sanctified may be made partakers.</p>

                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:48389:226"/> The Truth of this Assertion is indeed sufficiently evident from the Description we have given of this <hi>spiritual Habit,</hi> its Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. But whereas there are also other Respects giving further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the same Truth, I shall call over the most important of them, after some few things have been premised. As,</p>
               <p>1. An <hi>Habit</hi> of what sort soever it be, qualifies the Subject wherein it is, so that it may be denominated from it, and make the Actions proceeding from it to be suited unto it, or to be of the same Nature with it. As <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayes, <hi>Vertue is an Habit which maketh him that hath it Good or Vertuous, and his Actions good.</hi> Now all <hi>Moral</hi> Habits are seated in the Will. <hi>Intellectual</hi> Habits are not immediately affective of Good or Evil, but as the Will is influenced by them. These <hi>Habits</hi> do encline, dispose and enable the Will to act according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And in all the Acts of our Wills, and so all external Works which proceed from them, two things are considered. First, the <hi>Act</hi> it self, or the Work done; and Secondly, the <hi>End</hi> for which it is done. And both these things are respected by the Habit it self, though not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, yet by vertue of its Acts. It is moreover <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> that every Act of the Will, every Work of a Man be for a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain End.</hi> Two things therefore are to be considered in all our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; (1) The <hi>Duty</hi> it self we doe, and (2) The <hi>End</hi> for which we doe it. If any Habit therefore doth not encline and dispose the Will unto the proper <hi>End</hi> of Duty, as well as unto the Duty it self, it is not of that Kind from whence true Gospel Obedience doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. For the End of every Act of Gospel Obedience, which is the
<hi>Glory of God</hi> in Jesus Christ, is Essential unto it. Let us then take all the Habits of <hi>Moral Vertue,</hi> and we shall find, that however they may incline and dispose the Will unto such Acts of Vertue as <hi>materially</hi> are Duties of Obedience, yet they do it not with respect unto this End. If it be said, that such Moral <hi>Habits</hi> do so incline the Will unto Duties of Obedience with respect unto this <hi>End,</hi> then is there no need of the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> or the Gospel, to enable men to Live unto God, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace, which some seem to aim at.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>44</label> 2. Whereas, it is the <hi>End</hi> that gives all our Duties their special Nature, this is two-fold:</p>
               <p>(1) The <hi>next;</hi> and (2) The <hi>ultimate;</hi> or it is <hi>particular</hi> or <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal.</hi> And these may be different in the same Action. As a man may give Almes to the <hi>poor,</hi> his <hi>next</hi> Particular End may be to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and Cherish them: This End is good, and so far the Work or Duty it self is good also. But the <hi>ultimate</hi> and General End of this Action may be Self, Merit, Reputation, Praise, Compensation for sin committed, and not the Glory of God in Christ; which vitiates the whole. Now <hi>Moral Habits,</hi> acquired by Endeavours answerable unto our Light and Convictions, or the Dictates of Enlightened Reason, with Resolutions and Perseverance, may encline and dispose the Will unto Actions and Works, that for the Substance of them are Duties, and are capable of having <hi>particular Ends</hi> that are good, but a want of Respect unto the General End allows them not to be any part of
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:48389:227"/> Gospel Obedience. And this is applicable unto all <hi>Moral Habits</hi> and Duties whatever. But the difference asserted, is farther manifested,</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>45</label>
                  <hi>First,</hi> From the especial <hi>Fountain</hi> and <hi>Spring</hi> of Holiness, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes its Nature of another Kind than any Common Grace or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality can pretend unto: And this is <hi>Electing Love,</hi> or Gods Purpose of Election. <hi>Ephes. 1. 4. He hath chosen us in Christ before the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, that we should be Holy and unblameable before him in Love.</hi> God chooseth us from Eternity, that we should be Holy; that is, with a Design and Purpose to make us so. He sets some men apart in his Eternal Purpose, as those unto whom he will communicate Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. It is therefore an especial Work of God, in the pursuit of an especial and eternal Purpose. This gives it its especial Nature, and makes it, as was said, of another Kind than any Effect of <hi>Common Grace</hi> whatever. <hi>That</hi> is Holiness, which God works in men by his Spirit, because he hath chosen them, and nothing else is so. For he
<hi>chooseth us unto salvation through the sanctification of the Spirit, 2 Thess.</hi> 2. 13. Salvation is the End that God aimeth at in his choosing of us, in subordination unto his own Glory; which is and must be the <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate End</hi> of all his Purposes and Decrees, or of all the free Acts of his Wisdom and Love. The Means which he hath ordained, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we shall be brought unto this <hi>Salvation</hi> so designed in his Eternal Purpose, is the <hi>sanctification of the Spirit.</hi> Gospel Holiness therefore is the Effect of that Sanctification of the Spirit, which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as the especial Way and Means on their part, of bringing the Elect unto Salvation. And his <hi>choosing</hi> of them is the Cause and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he doth so sanctifie them by his Spirit. And, where our
<hi>Sanctification</hi> is comprized under our <hi>Vocation,</hi> because therein and thereby we are sanctified by the sanctifying Principle of Holiness com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto us, it is not only reckoned as an Effect and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of our <hi>Predestination,</hi> but is so conjoyned thereunto, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that none others are partakers of it, but those that are Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate;
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30.</p>
               <p>And this Consideration is of it self sufficient to Evince, that this <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> whereof we treat, differs essentially from all other Habits of the Mind, and Actions proceeding from them, as having an especial Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its own. Whatever there may be in any men, of <hi>Vertue</hi> and
<hi>Piety,</hi> or whatever their Endeavours may be, in Wayes of Honesty and Duty towards God and Men, if the Power and Principle of it in them be not a <hi>Fruit of Electing Love,</hi> of the Spirit of Sanctification, given of God for this certain End, that we may attain the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereunto we are chosen, it belongeth not unto this <hi>Holiness.</hi> Wherefore, the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> giving us in charge, to use all Diligence whereby we may make our <hi>Calling and Election sure,</hi> that is, unto our Souls, and in our own Minds, prescribes as the Means of it, the Exercise and Encrease of those Graces which are its proper Effects, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7, 10. And the Reason why we see so many glorious Professions of Faith and Obedience utterly to fail as we do, is because the Faith so professed was not <hi>the Faith of the Elect of God, Tit.</hi> 1. 1. And the Obedience of it was not the Fruit of that Spirit of Sanctification which God gives to man, to make his Purpose of Election infallibly Effectual; that so
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:48389:227"/> the <hi>Purpose of God which is according to Election might stand; Rom.</hi> 11. And the <hi>Election,</hi> or those Elected <hi>might obtain</hi> the Grace and Glory designed for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 5. 7. And it is an Evidence of much spiritual Sloth in us, or that which is worse, namely that our Graces and Obedience are not <hi>genuine</hi> and of the true Heavenly Race, if we endeavour not to satisfie our selves, that they are real Effects of
<hi>Electing Love.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>46</label> If any one shall enquire, How we may know whether the Graces of Holiness, which we hope are in us, and the Duties that proceed from them are Fruits and Effects of <hi>Election,</hi> seeing such only are
<hi>genuine</hi> and Durable. I answer, it may be done three wayes.</p>
               <p>(1) By their <hi>Growth</hi> and <hi>Encrease.</hi> This in ordinary Cases, setting aside the Seasons of prevalent Temptations and Desertions, is the best Evidence hereof. Waters that proceed from a <hi>living</hi> Fountain, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in their <hi>progress,</hi> because of the continual Supplyes which they have from their Spring; when those which have only Occasional Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rom showers of Rain or the like, do continually decay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they are dryed up. The Graces that come from this Eternal Spring, have continual supplyes from it, so that if they meet with no violent Obstructions, (as they may do sometimes for a season) they do constantly encrease and thrive. And therefore no man can secure his <hi>spiritual Comforts</hi> one Moment under a sensible decay of Grace. For such a decay is a very sufficient Reason why he should call the Truth of all his Grace into Question. Where the Spirit of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, as given in pursuit of the Purpose of <hi>Election,</hi> it is a <hi>Well of Water springing up into Everlasting Life, Joh.</hi> 4. 14. The <hi>quietness</hi> and
<hi>satisfaction</hi> of Professors under a Decay of Grace, is a Soul-ruining <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,</hi> and hath nothing in it of Spiritual Peace.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>47</label>(2) We may discern it, when we are <hi>much stirred up</hi> unto diligent
<hi>Actings</hi> and <hi>Exercise</hi> of Grace, out of a sence of that <hi>Electing Love</hi> from whence all Grace doth proceed. It is the Nature of Grace that is the Fruit of Election, greatly to affect the Heart and Mind with a sence of the <hi>Love</hi> that is therein: So the Apostle sayes expressely, that one Grace exciteth and stirreth up another, from a sence of the Love of God, which sets them all on work, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4, 5. So God is said to <hi>draw us with Loving-kindness,</hi> because <hi>he hath loved us with everlasting love, Jerem.</hi> 31. 3. That is, he gives us such a sence of his everlasting Love, as thereby to draw us after him in Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Those Principles of Dutyes in us which are excited only by Fear, Awe, Hope, and the jealous Observances of an awakened Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, will scarce at any time evince this heavenly Extract unto a spiritual Understanding. That Grace which proceeds from especial Love, will carry along an holy quickening sence of it, and thereby be excited unto its due Exercise. And we do what we can to famish and starve our Graces, when we do not endeavour their Supplyes by Faith on that Spring of Divine Love from whence they proceed.</p>

From his Prayer for us, is Holiness begun in us; <hi>Sanctifie them,</hi> saith he, <hi>by thy Truth.</hi> Thence is it kept alive and preserved in us: <hi>I have,</hi> saith he to <hi>Peter, prayed for thee, that thy Faith should not fail,</hi> and through his Intercession are we <hi>saved to the uttermost.</hi> Nothing belongs to this Holiness, but what in the Actual Communication of it is a peculiar Fruit of Christs Intercession: What is not so, what men may be made partakers of upon any more general Account, belongs not thereunto. And if we really design Holiness, or intend to be Holy, it is our Duty constantly to improve the <hi>Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Christ for the Encrease of it. And this we may do by especial
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:48389:228"/> Applications to him for that Purpose. So the Apostles prayed him, to <hi>encrease their Faith, Luke</hi> 17. 3. And we may do so, for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of our Holiness. But the <hi>Nature</hi> of this Application unto Christ, for the Encrease of Holiness, by vertue of his Intercession, is duely to be considered. We are not to pray unto him, that he would <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede</hi> for us, that we may be Sanctified. For as he needs not our minding for the Discharge of his Office, so he intercedes not <hi>Orally</hi> in Heaven at all, and alwayes doth so <hi>Vertually</hi> by his Appearance in the Presence of God with the Vertue of his Oblation or Sacrifice. But whereas the Lord Christ gives out no Supplyes of Grace unto us, but what he receiveth from the Father for that End by vertue of his Intercession, we apply our selves unto him under that Consideration; namely, as he who upon his Intercession with God for us, hath all stores of Grace to give us supplyes from.</p>

Nor is the Written Law it self so. It is the Rule of Original Holiness, but not the adequate Rule of that Holiness whereunto we are restored by Christ. Neither are both these in Conjunction, the Dictates of Nature and the Law written, the Instrument of working Holiness in us. But it is the Doctrine of the Gospel which is the Adequate Rule and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Instrument of it. My meaning is, That the Word, the Gospel, the Doctrine of Christ in the <hi>Preceptive part</hi> of it, is so the Rule of all our Obedience and Holiness, as that all which it requireth belongeth thereunto, and nothing else but what it requireth doth so; and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Reason of our Holiness consists in Conformity thereunto, under this Consideration, that it is the Word and Doctrine of Christ. Nothing belongeth unto Holiness <hi>materially,</hi> but what the Gospel requireth; and nothing is so in us <hi>formally,</hi> but what we doe <hi>because the Gospel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it. And it is the <hi>Instrument</hi> of it, because God maketh use of it alone as an external Means for the Communicating of it unto us, or the Ingenerating of it in us. Principles of Natural Light, with the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances of an awakened Conscience, do direct unto, and exact the performance of many material Duties of Obedience. The written Law requireth of us all Duties of Original Obedience, and God doth use these things variously for the preparing of our Souls unto a right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Gospel. But there are some Graces, some Duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto <hi>Evangelical Holiness,</hi> which the Law knows nothing of: Such are the <hi>Mortification of sin, Godly Sorrow, daily Cleansing of our Hearts and Minds;</hi> not to mention the more sublime and <hi>spiritual</hi> Acts of Communion with God by Christ, with all that Faith and Love which is required in us towards him. For although these things may be contained in the Law <hi>radically,</hi> as it requires universal Obedience unto God, yet are they not so <hi>formally.</hi> And it is not used as the Means to beget Faith and Holiness in us: This is the Effect of the <hi>Gospel</hi> only.
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:48389:229"/> Hence it is said to be the <hi>Power of God unto Salvation; Rom.</hi> 1. 16. or that whereby God puts forth <hi>the Greatness of his Power</hi> unto that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; the <hi>Word of his Grace, which is able to build us up, and give us an Inheritance among them that are sanctified, Acts</hi> 20. 30.

<hi>seed of the Gospel</hi> quickened in our Hearts, and bearing Fruit in our Lives. It is the Delivery up of our Souls into the Mould of the Doctrine of it, so as that our Minds and the Word should Answer one another, as Face doth unto Face in Water. And we may know whether it be so with us or no, two wayes. For (1) if it be so, none of the <hi>Commands</hi> of the Gospel will be <hi>grievous</hi> unto us, but easie and pleasant. A Principle suited unto them all, enclining unto them all, connatural unto them, as proceeding from them, being implanted in our Minds and Hearts, it renders the Commands themselves so <hi>suited</hi> unto us, so <hi>usefull,</hi> and the Matter of them so <hi>desireable,</hi> that Obedience is made pleasant thereby. Hence is that <hi>satisfaction of Mind,</hi> with Rest and Joy, which Believers have in Gospel Duties, yea the most Difficult of them; with that Trouble and Sorrow which ensues upon their Neglect, Omission, or their being deprived of Opportunities for them. But in the strictest Course of Duties that proceedeth from any other Principle, the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Gospel,</hi> or at least some of them, on the Account of their Spirituality, or Simplicity, are either esteemed <hi>grievous</hi> or despised. (2) None of the Truths of the Gospel will seem <hi>strange</hi> unto us. This makes up the Evidence of a genuine Principle of Gospel-Holiness, when the Commands of it are not <hi>grievous,</hi> nor the Truths of it <hi>strange</hi> or uncouth. The Mind so prepared receives every Truth, as the Eye doth every Encrease of Light, naturally and pleasantly, untill it come unto its proper measure. There is a Measure of Light which is suited unto our Visive Faculty, what exceeds it, dazles and amazes, rather than enlightens; but every Degree of <hi>Light,</hi> which tends unto it, is connatural and pleasant to the Eye. So is it with the sanctified Mind and spiritual Truth: There is a Measure of Light issuing from spiritual Truths, that our Minds are capable of; what is beyond this Measure, belongs to Glory; and the gazing after it will rather dazle than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten us: And such is the issue of over-strained Speculations, when the Mind endeavours an Excess as to its Measure. But all Light from Truth which tends to the filling up of that Measure, is pleasant, and natural to the sanctified Mind. It sees Wisdom, Glory, Beauty, and Usefulness, in the most spiritual, sublime and mysterious Truths, that are revealed in and by the Word; labouring more and more to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, because of their Excellency. For want hereof, we know how the Truths of the Gospel are by many despised, reproached, scorned, as those which are no less <hi>foolishness</hi> unto them, to be believed, than the Precepts of it are <hi>grievous</hi> to be obeyed.</p>

But when unto this Power which Examples have <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>morally</hi> to instruct and affect our Minds, things are peculiarly designed and instituted of God to be our <hi>Examples,</hi> He requiring of us, that from them we should learn both what to doe, and what to avoid, their Force and Efficacy is encreased. This the Apostle instructs us in at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Now both these concurr in the <hi>Example of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> that is given us in the Person of Christ. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He is not only in himself <hi>morally</hi> considered, the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, absolute, glorious <hi>Pattern</hi> of all Grace, Holiness, Vertue, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to be chosen and preferred above all others, but he is <hi>onely</hi> so; there is no other compleat Example of it. As for those Examples of
<hi>Heroical Vertue,</hi> or <hi>Stoical Apathie</hi> which are boasted of among the Heathens, it were an easie matter to find such Flaws and Tumors in them, as would render them not only <hi>uncomely</hi> but <hi>deformed</hi> and monstrous. And in the Lives of the best of the Saints, there is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what we ought expressly to avoid, as well as what we ought to follow; and in some things we are left at a loss, whether it be safe to conform unto them or no, seeing we are to be followers of none any further than they were so of Jesus Christ, and wherein they were so; neither in what they were or did, absolutely our Rule and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in its self, but only so farr as therein they were conformable unto Christ. And the best of their Graces, the highest of their Attainments, and the most perfect of their Duties, have their Spots and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; so that although they should have exceeded what we can attain unto, and are therefore meet to be proposed unto our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet do they come short of what we aim at, which is to be Holy as God is Holy. But in this our great <hi>Exemplar,</hi> as there was never the least shew of variableness from the Perfection of Holiness, (<hi>for he did no sin, neither was there any guile found in him,</hi> yea in him was
<hi>Light</hi> and no <hi>Darkness at all</hi>) so were all his Graces, all his Actings of them, all his Duties, so absolute and compleat, as that we ought to aim no higher, nor to propose any other <hi>Pattern</hi> unto our selves. And
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:48389:230"/> who is it, that aiming at any Excellency, would not design the most absolute and perfect Example. This therefore is to be found as unto
<hi>Holiness</hi> in Christ, and in him alone.</p>

Such an <hi>Example</hi> was needfull, that we might never be at a loss about the Will of God in his Commands, having a glorious Representation of it before our Eyes; and this could be given us no otherwise but in our own Nature. The <hi>Angelical</hi> Nature was not suited to set us an Example of Holiness and Obedience, especially as to the <hi>Exercise</hi> of such Graces as we principally stand in need of in this World. For what Examples could <hi>Angels</hi> set unto us in themselves, of Patience in Afflictions, of Quietness in Sufferings, seeing their Nature is incapable of such things. Neither could we have had an Example that was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat in our <hi>own Nature,</hi> but only in <hi>One</hi> who was Holy, Harmless, Undefiled and separate from Sinners. To this End therefore among others did God send his <hi>own Son</hi> to take our Nature on him, and therein to represent unto us the perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of that Holiness and Obedience which he requireth of us. It is evident therefore, that these two Considerations of an <hi>Instructive Example,</hi> that is hath a <hi>moral aptitude</hi> to incite the Mind unto Imitation, and that it is <hi>instituted of God</hi> unto that Purpose, are both found Eminently in this of Christ.</p>

For (1) we are often called to <hi>behold Christ,</hi> and to <hi>look upon him;</hi> or it is promised that we shall do so, <hi>Isa. 45. 22. Zech.</hi> 12. 10. Now this <hi>beholding of Christ</hi> or <hi>looking</hi> on him, is the Consideration of him by <hi>Faith</hi> unto the Ends for which he is exhibited, proposed and set forth of God in the Gospel, and Promises thereof. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is an especial Ordinance of God, and is by his Spirit made effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. And these Ends are two: 1. <hi>Justification, 2. Salvation,</hi> or Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from Sin and Punishment. <hi>Look,</hi> saith he, <hi>unto me, and be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> This was he on the Cross, and is still so in the Preaching of the Gospel, wherein he is <hi>evidently crucifyed before our eyes, Gal.</hi> 3. 1. lifted up as <hi>the Brazen Serpent in the Wilderness, Joh.</hi> 3. 14, 15. That we looking on him by Faith, as <hi>bearing our sins in his own Body on the Tree, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 24. and <hi>receiving the Attonement</hi> made thereby, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. may through <hi>Faith in him</hi> be Justified from all our Sins, and
<hi>saved</hi> from the Wrath to come. But this we intend not. For (2) He is of God <hi>proposed</hi> unto us in the Gospel, as the great <hi>Pattern</hi> and Exemplar of Holiness; so as that by Gods Appointment our <hi>beholding and looking</hi> on him in the Way mentioned, is a Means of the Encrease and <hi>growth</hi> of it in us. So our Apostle declares, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. We all
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:48389:230"/> with open face, beholding as in a Glass the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> That which is proposed unto us, is the <hi>Glory of the Lord;</hi> or the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God <hi>in the Face of Jesus Christ, Chap. 4. v.</hi> 6. that is, God glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously manifesting himself in the Person of Christ. This are we said to
<hi>behold with open face;</hi> The Veil of Types and Shadowes being taken off and removed, Faith doth now clearly and distinctly view and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider Jesus Christ as he is represented unto us in the <hi>glass of the Gospel;</hi> that is, the Evidences of the Presence of God in him and with him, in his Work, Purity and Holiness.

Because, (1) Whatever is <hi>proposed</hi> unto us, in what he was, or what he did, as our <hi>Pattern</hi> and <hi>Example,</hi> he was it, and did it, not for his own sake, but out of free and meer <hi>Love</hi> unto us. That pure Nature of his, which we ought to be labouring after a Conformity unto, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. and which he will at length bring us unto, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. he took it upon him by an infinite Condescension, meerly out of <hi>Love</hi> unto us,
<hi>Heb. 2. 14, 15. Phil.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7. And all the Actings of Grace in him, all the Duties of Obedience which he performed, all that glorious Complyance with the Will of God in his Sufferings which he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, proceed all from his Love unto us, <hi>Joh. 17. 19. Gal.</hi> 2. 20. These things being in themselves truely Honourable and Excellent, yea, being only so; the Holiness and Obedience which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of us consisting in them, being by the Appointment of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto our Imitation in the Example of Jesus Christ, how must it needs influence and prevail on gracious Souls to endeavour a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto him therein, to be as he was, to do as he did, seeing he was what he was, and did what he did, meerly out of Love unto us, and for no other End. And (2) Every thing which we are to imitate in Christ, is other wayes also <hi>beneficial</hi> unto us. For we are in its Place and Way even saved thereby. By his <hi>Obedience we are made Righteous, Rom.</hi> 5. 19. There is no Grace nor Duty of Christ, which he did perform, but we have the Advantage and Benefit of it. And this encreaseth the Efficacy of this Example. For who would not strive to obtain these things in himself, of whose being in Christ he hath so great Advantage.</p>

And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we are the most of us much to blame, that we do not more abound in the use of this Means unto the End mentioned. Did we abide more constantly in the <hi>beholding</hi> or <hi>Contemplation</hi> of the Person of Christ, of the Glory and Beauty of his Holiness, as the Pattern and great <hi>Example</hi> proposed unto us, we should be more transformed into his Image and Likeness.

<pb n="450" facs="tcp:48389:231"/> the vertuous Sayings and Actions of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and are ready to make them the Object of their Imitation, whilest they have no thoughts of the Grace that was in our Lord Jesus Christ, nor do endeavour after Conformity thereunto. And the Reason is, because the Vertue which they seek after and desire, is of the same Kind with that which was in the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and not of that Grace and Holiness which was in Christ Jesus. And thence also it is that some, who, not out of Love unto it, but to decry other important Mysteries of the Gospel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, do place all Christianity in the <hi>Imitation of Christ,</hi> do yet indeed in their practice despise those Qualities and Dutyes wherein he princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally manifested the Glory of his Grace. His Meekness, Patience, Self-denyal, Quietness in bearing Reproaches, Contempt of the World, Zeal for the Glory of God, Compassion to the Souls of men, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descentions to the Weaknesses of all, they regard not.

But in particular what there is of this nature in the <hi>Mediation</hi> of Christ, in his being the middle Person between God and us, may be declared in the ensuing Assertions.</p>

That the Holy Spirit is the immediate <hi>efficient Cause</hi> of all Grace and Holiness, I have sufficiently proved already, unto them to whom any thing in this kind will be sufficient. Now the End why the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is sent, and consequently of all that he doth as he is so sent, is to <hi>glorifie</hi> Christ; and this he doth by receiving from Christ, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof unto others, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13, 14, 15. And there are two Works of this kind which he hath to doe, and doth effect. 1. To
<hi>unite us to Christ:</hi> And, 2. To <hi>Communicate all Grace</hi> unto us from Christ, by vertue of that Union.</p>
               <p>(1) By him are we <hi>united</hi> unto Christ, that is his Person, and not a
<hi>Light</hi> within us as some think, nor the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospel</hi> as others with an equal folly seem to imagine. It is by the Doctrine and Grace of the Gospel that we are united, but it is the Person of Christ whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we are united. <hi>For he that is joyned unto the Lord is one Spirit, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 17. because by that one Spirit he is joyned unto him. <hi>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 13. implanted into the Body, and united unto the Head. And therefore, <hi>if we have not the Spirit of Christ, we are none of his, Rom.</hi> 8. 9. We are therefore his, that is, united unto him, by a Participation of his Spirit. And hereby Christ himself is in us, for <hi>Jesus Christ is in us, except we be Reprobates,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. That is, he is in us <hi>by his Spirit that dwelleth in us, Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. It may therefore be enquired, Whether we receive the Spirit of the Gospel from the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> or no. And this is the Enquiry, which nothing but the extreme Ignorance or Impudence of some could render seasonable or tolerable, seeing formerly no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian ever doubted of it, nor is he so now, who doth disbelieve it. It is true, we receive him by the <hi>Preaching of the Gospel, Gal.</hi> 3. 2. But it is no less true, that we receive him immediately from the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ. For no other Reason is he called so frequently the <hi>Spirit of Christ;</hi> that is, the Spirit which he gives, sends, bestowes, or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates. He receives of the <hi>Father</hi> the <hi>Promise of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and sheddeth him forth. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 33.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> But it may be said, That if hereby we are united unto Christ, namely, by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> then we must be <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Obedient</hi> before we so receive him, wherein our <hi>Vnion</hi> doth consist. For certainly, <hi>Christ</hi> doth not unite <hi>ungodly</hi> and impure Sinners unto himself, which would be the greatest dishonour unto him imaginable. We must therefore be <hi>holy,</hi> obedient, and like unto Christ, before we can be united unto him, and so consequently before we receive his <hi>Spirit,</hi> if thereby we are united to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. If this be so, then indeed are we not beholding in the least unto the <hi>Spirit of Christ</hi> that we are Holy and Obedient, and like to Christ. For he that hath the Spirit of Christ, is <hi>united</hi> unto him: And he who is united to him, hath his Spirit, and none else. Whatever therefore is in any man, of Holiness, Righteousness or Obedience, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent unto <hi>Vnion</hi> with Christ, is no especial Effect of his Spirit. Wherefore, in this case we must <hi>purifie</hi> our selves, without any Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Blood of Christ unto our Souls, and we must <hi>sanctifie</hi> our
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:48389:233"/> selves, without any Especial Work of the Spirit of God on our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Let them that can, satisfie themselves with these things, for my part, I have no esteem or valuation of that <hi>Holiness</hi> as <hi>Holiness,</hi> which is not the immediate Effect of the Spirit of <hi>Sanctification</hi> in us.</p>
               <p>2. It is granted, that Ordinarily, the Lord Christ, by the <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> of his <hi>Word,</hi> by <hi>Light</hi> and Convictions thence ensuing, doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Souls of men in some measure for the <hi>Inhabitation</hi> of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The Way and Manner hereof hath been fully before declared.</p>
               <p>3. It is denyed, that on this Supposition, the Lord Christ doth
<hi>unite impure or ungodly Sinners</hi> unto himself, so as that they should be so united, and continue impure and ungodly. For in the <hi>same instant</hi> whereby any one is united unto Christ, and by the <hi>same Act</hi> whereby he is so united, he is <hi>really</hi> and <hi>habitually purified</hi> and <hi>sanctified.</hi> For, where the Spirit of God is, there is <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Holiness.</hi> All Acts and Duties of Holiness, are in order of Nature consequential hereunto; but the Person is quickened, purified, and sanctified in its
<hi>Vnion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas therefore the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ communicated from him, for our <hi>Vnion</hi> with him, is the Cause and Author of all Grace and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Holiness in us, it is evident, that we receive it directly from
<hi>Christ</hi> himself, which gives it the Difference from all other <hi>Habits</hi> and Acts pleaded for.</p>

<hi>head</hi> and <hi>members</hi> of the Body of a Man in things <hi>natural.</hi> And this the Scripture, because of the Weight and Importance of it, with its singular Use unto the Faith of Believers, doth frequently express. God hath <hi>given him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is his Body, the Fulness of him that filleth all in all, Ephes. 1. 22, 23. For as the Body is one and hath many Members, and all the Members of that Body being many are one Body; so also is Christ, 1 Cor. 12. 12. Christ is the Head, from whom the whole Body fitly joyned together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, by that which every Joynt supplyeth, according to the ehe effectual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every part, maketh increase of the Body, unto the edifying of it self
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:48389:233"/> in Love, Ephes.</hi> 4. 15, 16. And the same Apostle speaks again to the same purpose; <hi>Col. 2. 19. Not holding the Head, from which the Body by joynts and bands, having nourishment ministred, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</hi> Now it hath been alwayes granted, by all them who acknowledge the Divine Person of the Son of God, or the Union of the Humane Nature unto the Divine in his Person, that the Lord Jesus is the <hi>Head of his Church,</hi> in the double sence of that word; For he is the <hi>Political Head</hi> of it in a way of Rule and Government; and he is the Really <hi>Spiritual Head</hi> as unto Vital In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Grace unto all his Members. The <hi>Romanists</hi> indeed cast some disturbance on the former, by interposing another immediate Ruling, Governing Head, between him and the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> yet do they not deny, but that the Lord Christ in his own Person, is yet the absolute supream King, <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Ruler</hi> of the Church. And the latter the <hi>Socinians</hi> cannot grant; for denying his Divine Person, it is impossible to conceive, how the Humane Nature subsisting alone by it self, should be such an <hi>immense</hi> Fountain of Grace, as from whence there should be an Emanation of it into all the Members of the <hi>mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body;</hi> But by all other Christians this hath hitherto been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; and therefore there is nothing belongs unto Gospel Grace or Holiness, but what is Originally derived from the Person of Christ, as he is the <hi>Head of the Church.</hi> And this is most evidently expressed in the places before alleadged. For, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. it is plainly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it is between <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> as it is between the <hi>Head</hi> and the <hi>Members</hi> of the same <hi>natural</hi> Body. Now not only the whole Body hath guidance and direction in the disposal of it self from the Head, but every Member in particular hath <hi>influences</hi> of Life actually, and Strength from thence, without which it can neither act nor move, nor discharge its place or Duty in the Body. <hi>So also is Christ,</hi> saith the Apostle; not only hath the whole <hi>mystical Body</hi> of the Church, Guidance and Direction from him, in his Laws, Rules, Doctrine and Precepts, but <hi>spiritual Life</hi> and Motion also: And so hath every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof.

And <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16. the Relation of Believers unto Christ being stated exactly, to answer the Relation and Union of the <hi>Members</hi> of the Body unto the <hi>Head,</hi> it is expressely affirmed, that as in the Natural Body there are Supplyes of Nourishment and natural Spirits communicated from the <hi>Head</hi> unto the Members, by the subserviency of all the parts of the Body, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed unto that purpose, to the Growth and Encrease of the whole in every part; so from <hi>Christ</hi> the Head of the Church, which he is in his Divine Person as God and Man, there is a Supply of <hi>spiritual Life,</hi> Strength and Nourishment, made unto every Member of the Body, unto its Encrease, Growth and Edification; <hi>for we are members of his

And <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. it is expressly affirmed, that from him the Head, there is <hi>Nourishment ministred</hi> unto the Body, unto its Encrease with the Encrease of God.

And if any do deny it, they do what lies in them to destroy the <hi>Life</hi> and overthrow the <hi>Faith</hi> of the whole Church of God. Yea, upon such a blasphemous Imagination, that there could be an <hi>Intercision</hi> for one Moment, of Influences of <hi>spiritual</hi> Life and Grace from the Person of <hi>Christ</hi> unto the <hi>Church;</hi> the whole must be supposed to dye and perish, and that Eternally.</p>

The principal of them is, that both laid down and declared by our Saviour himself, <hi>Joh. 15. 1. 4, 5. I am the true Vine, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Husbandman. Abide in me, and I in you: As the Branch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye abide in me. I am the Vine, and ye are the Branches, he that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit, for without me</hi> (or severed from me, apart from me) <hi>ye can do nothing.</hi> The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in-being of the Vine and Branches in each other, is known unto all, with the Reason of it; and so is the Way whereby the <hi>in-being</hi> of the Branches in the Vine, is the Cause and Means of their Fruit-bearing. It is no otherwise, but by the Communication and Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that <hi>Succus,</hi> i. e. <hi>Juyce</hi> and <hi>Nourishment,</hi> which alone is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative of Vegetative Life, and the next Cause of Fruit-bearing. In this Juyce and Nourishment all Fruit is <hi>Virtually,</hi> yea also as to the first <hi>matter</hi> and substance of it: In and by the <hi>Branch</hi> it is only formed into its proper Kind and Perfection. Let any thing be done to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Communication from the <hi>Vine</hi> unto any <hi>Branch,</hi> and it not only immediately looseth all its Fruit-bearing Power and Vertue, but its self also withereth and dyeth away. And there is a <hi>mutual acting</hi> of the Vine and Branches in this matter. Unto the Vine it self it is Natural from its own Fullness to communicate <hi>Nourishment</hi> unto the Branches; it doth it from the Principle of its Nature. And unto the Branches it is also Natural, to <hi>draw</hi> and derive their <hi>Nourishment</hi> from the Vine. <hi>Thus is it,</hi> saith the Lord Christ unto his Disciples, <hi>between me and you. I am the Vine,</hi> saith he, <hi>and ye are the Branches;</hi> and there is a mutual <hi>in-being</hi> between us, <hi>I am in you, and ye are in me,</hi> by vertue of our Union. That now which is expected from you is, that you bring forth Fruit; that is, that you live in <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> unto the Glory of God: Unless you do so, you are no <hi>true real Branches</hi> in me, whatever outward Profession you may make of your so being. But how shall this be effected? How shall they be able to bring forth Fruit? This can be no otherwise done, but by
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:48389:234"/> their <hi>abiding in Christ;</hi> and thereby continually <hi>deriving spiritual nourishment,</hi> that is, Grace and supplyes of Holiness from him. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>separate,</hi> or <hi>apart from me,</hi> ye can do nothing of this kind. And that is, because nothing becomes <hi>Fruit</hi> in the <hi>Branch</hi> that was not <hi>Nourishment</hi> from the <hi>Vine.</hi> Nothing is Duty, nothing is Obedience in Believers, but what is Grace from Christ communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them. The Preparation of all fructifying Grace is in Christ, as the Fruit of the Branches is naturally in the Vine. And the Lord Christ doth spiritually and voluntarily <hi>communicate</hi> of this Grace unto all Believers, as the Vine communicates its <hi>Juyce</hi> unto the Branches naturally: And it is the <hi>new</hi> Nature of Believers to <hi>derive</hi> it from him by Faith. This being done, it is in them turned into particular Duties of Holiness and Obedience. Therefore it is evident, that there is nothing of <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> in any one Person whatever, but what is in the Vertue Power and Grace of it, derived immediately from Jesus Christ, by vertue of Relation unto him, and Union with him: And it may be enquired, Whether this be so with <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> or no. The same is taught by our Apostle, under the Similitude of an

He was made Flesh, and dwelt among us, full of <hi>Grace and Truth.</hi> It is not the Fulness of the Deity, as it dwelt in him personally, that is here intended, but that which was in him as he <hi>was made flesh,</hi> that is, in his Humane Nature as inseparably united unto the Divine: An <hi>All-fulness</hi> that he received by the good pleasure or voluntary Disposal of the Father; <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore belongeth not unto the Essential Fulness of the Godhead. And as to the Nature of this Fulness, it is said to consist <hi>in Grace and Truth;</hi> that is, the Perfection of Holiness, and Knowledge of the whole Mind, Counsel and Mystery of the Will of God. Of this Fulness do we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Grace for Grace,</hi> all the Grace in every Kind whereof we are made partakers in this World. That this Fulness in Christ, expresseth the unconceivable Fulness of his Humane Nature, by vertue of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissolute Personal Union with all Graces in their perfection, wherein he received not the Spirit by measure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. is as I suppose by all Christians acknowledged, I am sure cannot be denyed without the highest Impiety and Blasphemy. Hence therefore, the Holy Ghost being witness, do we derive and receive all our Grace, every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Measure, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 7. Wherefore, Grace is given unto the Lord Christ in an immeasurable Perfection, by vertue of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
<hi>Vnion; Col.</hi> 2. 9. and from him is it derived unto us, by the gracious <hi>Inhabitation</hi> of his Spirit in us, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 19. Eph.</hi> 4. 30. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the Degree of participation allotted unto us. This in the substance of it is contained in this Testimony. There was and is in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> a Fulness and Perfection of all Grace; in us, of our selves,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:48389:235"/> or by any thing that we have by Nature, or natural Generation, by Blood, or the Flesh, or the Will of Man, (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) there is none at all.

<hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> The Promises of the Covenant unto this purpose, we have before on other Occasions insisted on. In them doth God declare, That he will cleanse and purifie our Natures, that he will write his Law in our Hearts, put his Fear in our inward parts, and cause us to walk in his Statutes, in which things our Holiness doth consist. Whoever therefore hath any thing of it, he doth receive it in the Accomplishment of these Promises of the Covenant. For there are not two wayes whereby men may become Holy, one by the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit according to the Promise of the Covenant, and the other by their own Endeavours without it; though indeed <hi>Cassia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> with some of the <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> dreamed somewhat to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Wherefore, that which is thus a Fruit and Effect of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> of the Covenant, hath an especial Nature of its own, distinct from whatever hath not that Relation unto the same Covenant. No man can ever be made partaker of any the least Degree of that Grace or Holiness which is promised in the Covenant, unless it be by vertue and as a Fruit of that Covenant. For if they might do so, then were the Covenant of God of none Effect; for what it seems to promise in a peculiar Manner, may on this Supposition be attained without it, which renders it an empty Name.</p>

But this Pretence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the swelling words of vanity wherewith it is set off and vended, will easily be discovered to be weak and frivolous. For,</p>

Nor is there any sence of it agreed upon, by them who so magisterially im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it on others. Yea, there are many express Contests about the
<hi>signification</hi> of these words, and what it is that is intended by them;
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:48389:236"/> which those who contend about them are not ignorant of, and yet have they not endeavoured to reduce the sence they intend unto any Expression used concerning the same matter in the Gospel, but all men must needs submit unto it, that at least the main parts, if not the whole of Religion, consists in <hi>Moral Vertue,</hi> though it be altogether uncertain what they intend by the one or the other. These are they who scarce think any thing intelligible, when declared in the words of the Scripture, which one hath openly traduced as a <hi>ridiculous Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</hi> They like not, they seem to abhorre the <hi>speaking of Spiritual Things,</hi> in the Words which the Holy Ghost teacheth, the only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof is, because they understand not the <hi>things</hi> themselves. And whilest they are <hi>foolishness</hi> unto any, it is no wonder, the <hi>terms</hi> whereby they are declared, seem also so to be. But such as have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of Christ,</hi> and do know the Mind of Christ, (which profane Scoffers are sufficiently remote from) do best receive the Truth and apprehend it, when declared, not in <hi>the Words which Mans Wisdom teacheth, but which are taught by the Holy Ghost.</hi> It is granted, to be the Wisdom and Skill of men further to explain and declare the Truths that are taught in the Gospel, by sound and wholsom words of their own, which yet all of them, as to their Propriety and Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy, are to be tryed and measured by the Scripture it self. But we have a <hi>new Way</hi> of teaching <hi>spiritual</hi> Things sprung up among some, who being ignorant of the whole Mystery of the Gospel, and therefore despising it, would debase all the glorious Truths of it, and the Declaration made of them, into dry, barren, sapless, <hi>Philosophical</hi> Notions and Terms, and those the most common, obvious and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, that ever obtained among the <hi>Heathen</hi> of old. <hi>Vertuous Living</hi> they tell us is the Way to Heaven; but what this <hi>Vertue</hi> is, or what is a <hi>Life of Vertue,</hi> they have added as little in the Declaration of, as any Persons that ever made such a Noyse about them.</p>

But because the Duties of Holiness, have the most of them a <hi>Morality</hi> in them, as Morall is opposed to <hi>Instituted,</hi> some would have

Many seem to design no more but that Honesty and Integrity of Life which was found among some of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> in their vertuous Lives and Actions. And indeed, it were heartily to be wished, that we might see more of it amongst some that are called <hi>Christians.</hi> For, many things they did were <hi>Materially</hi> good, and usefull unto Mankind: But let it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be never so exact, and the Course of it most diligently attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto; I defie it, as to its being the <hi>Holiness</hi> required of us in the Gospel, according unto the terms of the Covenant of Grace; and that because it hath none of those Qualifications which we have proved Essentially to belong thereunto. And I defie all the men in the World to prove, that this <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> is the summe of our Obedience to God, whilest the Gospel is owned for a Declaration of his Will and our Duty. It is true, all the Duties of this <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> are required of us, but in the Exercise of every one of them there is more required of us than belongs unto their <hi>Morality,</hi> as namely, that they be done in Faith, and Love to God through Jesus Christ; and many things are required of us as necessary parts of our Obedience, which belong not thereunto at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>81</label>(4) Some give us such a Description of <hi>Morality,</hi> as that it should be of the same extent with the Light and Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> or the Dictates of it, as rectified and declared unto us in the Scripture. And this I confess requires of us the Obedience which is due towards God by the Law of our Creation, and according to the Covenant of Works
<hi>materially</hi> and <hi>formally.</hi> But what is this unto <hi>Evangelical</hi> Holiness and Obedience? Why it is alleadged, that <hi>Religion</hi> before the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Sin and under the Gospel is one and the same, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no difference between the Duties of Obedience required in the one and the other. And it is true, that they are so far the same, as that they have the same <hi>Author,</hi> the same <hi>Object,</hi> the same <hi>End,</hi> and so also had the Religion under the <hi>Law,</hi> which was therefore so far the same with them. But that they are the same as to all the Acts of our Obedience, and the Manner of their Performance, is a vain Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Is there no <hi>Alteration</hi> made in Religion by the <hi>Interposition</hi> of the Person of Christ to be Incarnate, and his Mediation? No Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the Object of Faith? No Change in the Abolishing of the Old Covenant, and the Establishment of the New; the Covenant between God and Man being that which gives the especial <hi>form</hi> and
<hi>kind</hi> unto Religion, the Measure and Denomination of it? No Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Principles, Aids, Assistances, and whole Nature of our Obedience unto God? The whole Mystery of Godliness must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, if we intend to give way unto such Imaginations. Be it so then, that this <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> and the Practice of it, do contain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press all that Obedience <hi>materially</hi> considered, which was required by the Law of Nature in the Covenant of Works, yet, I deny it to be
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:48389:237"/> our Holiness or <hi>Evangelical Obedience;</hi> and that as for many other Reasons, so principally, because it hath not that respect unto Jesus Christ which our Sanctification hath.</p>

Is it that which he worketh in us in the pursuit of <hi>Electing Love?</hi> Is it that which gives us a <hi>new Heart,</hi> with the Law of God written in it? or is it a Principle of <hi>spiritual</hi> Life, disposing, enclining, enabling us to live to God according to the Gospel, produced in us by the effectual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Ghost, not educed out of the natural Powers of our own Souls by the mere Applications of external Means? Is it that which is purchased and procured for us by Jesus Christ, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease whereof in us he continueth to intercede for? Is it the Image of God in us, and doth our Conformity unto the Lord Christ consist therein? If it be so, if <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> answer all these Properties and Adjuncts of <hi>Holiness,</hi> then the whole Contest in this matter is, whether the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> or these men be wisest, and know best how to express the things of God Rationally and Significantly. But if the <hi>Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> they speak of, be inconcerned in these things, if none of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto it, if it may and doth consist without it, it will appear at length to be no more as to our Acceptance before God, than what one of the greatest Morallists in the World complained that he found it when he was dying, a mere <hi>empty Name.</hi> But this fulsome <hi>Pelagian</hi> Figment of an Holiness or Evangelical Righteousness, whose Principle should be Natural Reason, and whose Rule is the Law of Nature as explained in the Scripture, whose Use and End is Acceptation with God, and Justification before him, whereof those who plead for it, the most of them, seem to understand no more but outward Acts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, nor do practise so much, being absoluely opposite unto and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, being the mere Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> by whom it is better and more intelligibly expressed, than by some new Patrons of it amongst us; will not in the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it create any great Trouble, unto such as look upon the Scripture to be a Revelation of the Mind of God in these things.</p>

They are in their own Nature either <hi>Internal only;</hi> Or, 2. <hi>External</hi> also. There may be <hi>internal</hi> Acts of Holiness, that have no <hi>external</hi> Effects. But no <hi>external</hi> Acts or Duties are any part of Holiness, which are <hi>only</hi> so and no more; for it is required thereunto, that they be quickened and sanctified by <hi>internal</hi> Acting of Grace. Two Persons may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the same time perform the same Commanded Duties, and in the same <hi>outward</hi> Manner, yet may it be the Duty of <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> in the one, and not in the other; as it was with <hi>Cain</hi> and
<hi>Abel,</hi> with the other Apostles and <hi>Judas.</hi> For if Faith and Love be

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> Concerning all these Acts and Duties, whether <hi>internal</hi> only, or
<hi>external</hi> also, whether their proper Object be God, or selves, or other Men, so far as they are <hi>Acts of Holiness,</hi> and are accepted with God, they proceed from a <hi>peculiar Operation</hi> of the Holy Spirit in us. And herein to make our Intention the more evident, we may distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observe.</p>
               <p>(1) That there is in the Minds, Wills and Affections of all Believers, a <hi>Meetness, Fitness, Readiness</hi> and habitual Disposition unto the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> of all Acts of Obedience towards God, all Duties of Piety, Charity, and Righteousness, that are required of them, and hereby are they <hi>internally</hi> and <hi>habitually</hi> distinguished from them that are not so. That it is so with them, and whence it comes be so, we have before declared. This Power and Disposition, is wrought and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in them by the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>(2) No Believer can of <hi>himself</hi> act, that is, actually exert or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise this <hi>Principle,</hi> or Power of a <hi>spiritual</hi> Life, in any one Instance of any Duty, <hi>internal</hi> or <hi>external,</hi> towards God or Men, so as that it shall be an Act of Holiness, or a Duty accepted with God. He cannot I say do so <hi>of himself,</hi> by vertue of any <hi>Power habitually inherent</hi> in him. We are not in this World intrusted with any such <hi>spiritual</hi>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:48389:238"/> Ability from God, as without further actual Aid and Assistance, to do any thing that is Good: Therefore,</p>
               <p>(3) That which at present I design to prove is, That the <hi>Actual Aid, Assistance and internal Operation of the Spirit of God, is necessary, required and granted, unto the producing of every holy Act of our Minds, Wills and Affections, in every Duty whatever.</hi> Or, notwithstanding the Power or Ability which Believers have received in, or by <hi>Habitual</hi> Grace, they still stand in need of <hi>Actual</hi> Grace, in, for, and unto every single gracious holy Act or Duty towards God. And this I shall now a little further explain, and then confirm.</p>

By ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue hereof, we are enabled unto all <hi>vital Acts,</hi> whether Natural and Necessary, or Voluntary according to the Constitution of our Beings, which is Intellectual. <hi>God breathed into man the Breath of Life, and he became a living Soul, Gen.</hi> 2. 7. giving him a Principle of Life, he was fitted for, and enabled unto all the proper Acts of that Life. For, a Principle of Life, is an Ability and Disposition unto Acts of Life. But yet whosoever is thus made a <hi>living Soul,</hi> who is indued with this Principle of Life, he is not able <hi>Originally,</hi> without any <hi>motion</hi> or Acting from God as the first Cause, or independently on him, to exert or put forth any vital Act: That which hath not this Principle, as a dead Carkase, hath no <hi>meetness</hi> unto vital Actions, nor is capable either of <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Alteration,</hi> but as it receives Impressions from an
<hi>outward</hi> Principle of Force, or an <hi>inward</hi> Principle of Corruption. But he in whom it is, hath a <hi>Fitness, Readiness</hi> and <hi>habitual Power</hi> for all vital Actions, yet so as without the Concurrence of God in his <hi>Energeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Providence,</hi> moving and Acting of him, he can do nothing. For, in God <hi>we live, and move, and have our being, Acts</hi> 17. 28. And if any one could of <hi>himself</hi> perform an Action without any Concourse of Divine Operation, he must himself be absolutely the first and only Cause of that Action, that is, the <hi>Creatour</hi> of a New Being.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> It is so as unto our <hi>spiritual Life.</hi> We are by the Grace of God through Jesus Christ, furnished with a Principle of it, in the <hi>Way</hi> and for the <hi>Ends</hi> before described. Hereby are we enabled and disposed to Live unto God in the Exercise of <hi>spiritually</hi> vital Acts, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Dutyes of Holiness. And he who hath not this Principle of spiritual Life, is <hi>spiritually</hi> dead, as we have at large before mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, and <hi>can do nothing at all</hi> that is spiritually Good. He may be moved unto, and as it were compelled by the Power of <hi>Convictions,</hi> to do many things that are <hi>materially</hi> so. But that which is on all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
<hi>spiritually good,</hi> and accepted with God, he can do nothing of. The Enquiry is, What Believers themselves, who have received this <hi>Principle of spiritual Life,</hi> and are Habitually sanctified, can do as to Actual Duties, by vertue thereof, without a new immediate Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and working of the Holy Spirit in them. And I say, they can no more do any thing that is <hi>spiritually good,</hi> without the particular
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:48389:239"/> Concurrence and Assistance of the Grace of God unto every Act thereof, than a man can <hi>naturally</hi> act, or move, or doe any thing in an absolute <hi>Independency</hi> on God, his Power and Providence. And this proportion between the Works of Gods <hi>Providence</hi> and of his <hi>Grace,</hi> the Apostle expresseth, <hi>Ephes. 2. 10. For we are his Workmanship, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Christ Jesus unto good Works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</hi> God at the Beginning made all things by a <hi>creating</hi> Power, producing them out of Nothing, and left them not meerly to themselves and their own <hi>Powers</hi> when so created, but he
<hi>upholds,</hi> supports, sustains and preserves them in the Principles of their Beings and Operations, acting powerfully in and by them, after their several Kinds. Without his Supportment of their Beings by an Actual incessant <hi>Emanation of Divine Power,</hi> the whole Fabrick of Nature would dissolve into Confusion and nothing. And without his Influence into, and Concurrence with their <hi>Ability</hi> for Operation by the same Power, all things would be <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>deformed,</hi> and not one Act of Nature be exerted. So also is it in this Work of the <hi>New Creation</hi> of all things by Jesus Christ. <hi>We are the Workmanship of God,</hi> he hath formed and fashioned us for himself by the Renovation of his Image in us. Hereby are we <hi>sitted for good Works,</hi> and the Fruits of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, which he hath appointed as the Way of our Living unto him. This New <hi>Creature,</hi> this Divine Nature in us, he supporteth and preserveth, so as that without his continual <hi>influential Power</hi> it would perish and come to nothing. But this is not all; He doth moreover act it, and effectually concurre to every singular Duty, by <hi>new sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes</hi> of Actual Grace. So then, that which we are to prove, is; That there is an <hi>Actual Operation</hi> of the Holy Ghost in us, <hi>necessary</hi> unto every Act and Duty of Holiness whatever, without which none either will or can be produced or performed by us, which is the Second Part of his Work in our Sanctification: And there are several Wayes whereby this is confirmed unto us.</p>

                  <hi>First;</hi> The Scripture declares, that <hi>we our selves,</hi> cannot in and by our selves, that is, by vertue of <hi>any strength or power</hi> that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<hi>do any thing</hi> that is spiritually Good. So our Saviour tells his Apostles, when they were <hi>sanctified Believers,</hi> and in them all that are so; <hi>without me ye can do nothing, John</hi> 15. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

If a Branch be so separated from the Root and Body of the Vine, as that it receives not continual supplyes of Nourishment from them, if their Influence into it, be by any Means intercepted, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not in its Growth, it brings forth no Fruit, but is immediately under decay: It is so, saith our Saviour, with <hi>Believers</hi> in respect unto him. Unless they have continual <hi>uninterrupted influences</hi> of Grace, and spiritually vital Nourishment from <hi>him, they can do nothing. Without me,</hi> expresseth a Denyal of all the spiritual Aid that we have from Christ. On supposition hereof, <hi>we can do nothing;</hi> that is, <hi>by our own Power,</hi> or by vertue of any Habit or Principle of Grace we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. For when we have received it, what we can do thereby with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further actual Assistance, we can do of our selves. <hi>You can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> that is, which appertains to <hi>Fruit-bearing</hi> unto God. In things
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:48389:239"/> Natural and Civil we can do somewhat, and in things Sinfull too much; we need no Aid or Assistance for any such purpose. But in <hi>Fruit-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> unto God we can do nothing. Now every Act of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> every Motion of our Minds or Affections towards God, is a part of our <hi>Fruit-bearing,</hi> and so unquestionably are all external Works and and Duties of Holiness and Obedience. Wherefore, our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being Judge, <hi>Believers</hi> who are really sanctified, and made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Habitual Grace, yet cannot of themselves, without new <hi>actual Ayd and Assistance</hi> of Grace from him, do any thing that is spiritually Good, or acceptable with God.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> Our Apostle confirmeth the same Truth, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 4, 5. And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward; not that we are sufficient of our selves, to think any thing as of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God.</hi> It is a great and eminent Grace which he declareth that he was acting, namely, <hi>Trust in God</hi> through Christ in the Discharge of his Ministry, and for the blessed Success thereof: But he had no sooner expressed it, than he seems to be jealous lest he should appear to have assumed something to himself, in this Work, or the Trust he had for its Success. This no man was ever more cautious against, and indeed it was incumbent on him so to be, because he was appointed to be the principal Minister and Preacher of the Grace of Jesus Christ. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say, he addes a <hi>Caution</hi> against any such Apprehensions, and openly renounceth any such Power, Ability, or <hi>Sufficiency</hi> in himself, as that by vertue thereof he could act so excellent a Grace, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form so great a Duty. <hi>Not that we are sufficient of our selves;</hi> And in this matter, he hath not only in places innumerable asserted the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and Efficacy of Grace, with our <hi>impotency</hi> without it, but in his own Instance he hath made such a Distinction between what was of <hi>himself,</hi> and what of <hi>Grace,</hi> with such an open Disclaimure of any Interest of his own in what was Spiritually good, distinct from Grace, as should be sufficient with all sober Persons, to determine all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in this Case. See 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 10. Gal.</hi> 2. 21. and this place. I assume no such thing to my self, I ascribe no such thing unto any other, as that <hi>I</hi> or <hi>they</hi> should have in our selves <hi>a sufficiency</hi> unto any such purpose. For our Apostle knew nothing of any <hi>sufficiency</hi> that needed any other thing to make it effectual. And he doth not exclude such a <hi>sufficiency</hi> in our selves with respect unto <hi>eminent Actings</hi> of Grace, and greater Duties, but with respect unto every <hi>good Thought,</hi> or whatever may have a tendency unto any spiritual Duty. We cannot conceive, we cannot engage in the <hi>Beginning</hi> of any Duty by our own <hi>sufficiency.</hi> For it is the <hi>beginning of Dutyes</hi> which the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth by <hi>thinking;</hi> our Thoughts and Projections being Naturally the first thing that belongs unto our Actions. And this he doth as it were on purpose to obviate that <hi>Pelagian</hi> Fiction, that the <hi>Beginning of Good</hi> was from our selves, but we had the help of Grace to <hi>perfect</hi> it. But what then! if we have no such <hi>sufficiency,</hi> to what purpose should we set about the <hi>thinking</hi> or doing of any thing that is good? Who will be so <hi>unwise</hi> as to attempt that which he hath no <hi>strength</hi> to accomplish? And doth not the Apostle hereby deny, that he <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had performed</hi> and Holy Duties, or Acted any Grace, or done any
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:48389:240"/> thing that was good, seeing he <hi>had no sufficiency</hi> of himself so to doe? to obviate this cavil he confines this denyal of a sufficiency <hi>unto our selves,</hi> we have it not of our selves. But, saith he, our <hi>sufficiency</hi> is of God, that is, we have it by Actual supplies of Grace, necessary unto every Duty; and how God Communicates this <hi>sufficiency,</hi> and how we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, he declares, <hi>Chap. 9. v. 8. God is able to make all Grace abound towards you, that ye alwaies having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.</hi> God manifests the <hi>abounding of Grace</hi> towards us, when he works an <hi>effective sufficiency</hi> in us, which he doth so as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to abound in good works, or Duties of Holiness. These are those <hi>supplies of Grace</hi> which God gives us unto all our Duties, as He had promised unto him in his own ease, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 9. And this is the first Demonstration of the Truth proposed unto Consideration, namely the Testimonies given in the Scripture, that Believers themselves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not of <hi>themselves</hi> perform any Acts or Duties of Holiness, any thing that is spiritually good. Therefore these things are Effects of Grace, and and must be wrought in us by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who is the immediate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Divine Operations.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> All <hi>Actings of Grace, all good Duties</hi> are actually ascribed unto the Operation of the Holy Ghost.

For nothing in general can be intended in these expressions, but the <hi>Actings of the Holy Spirit</hi> of God upon our Souls, in a Complyance wherewith, as acting when we are acted by him, our Obedience unto God according to the Gospel doth consist, <hi>Gal. 5. 16.

So are we injoyned, to attend unto particular Duties <hi>through the Holy Ghost that dwelleth in us, 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 14. that is, through his Assistance, without which we can do nothing.</p>

<hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>Faith,</hi> and every <hi>Act</hi> of Love is Love, and consequently no Act of them is of our selves, but every one of them is a <hi>fruit of the Spirit of God.</hi> So in another place he adds an <hi>universal affirmative,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all instances of particular Graces and their Exercise, <hi>Ephes. 5. 9.

                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> There are Testimonies that are express unto the <hi>Position</hi> as before laid down, <hi>Phil. 2. 13. It is God who worketh in you both to will and to doe of his good pleasure.</hi> The things thus wrought, are all things that appertain unto our <hi>Obedience</hi> and Salvation, as is evident from the Connexion of the words with <hi>v. 12. Work out your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling.</hi> Hereunto two things are required: (1) <hi>Power</hi> for such Operations, or for all the Duties of Holiness and Obedience that are required of us. That this we are <hi>indued</hi> withall, that this is wrought in us, bestowed upon us, by the Holy Ghost, hath been before abundantly confirmed. But when this is done for us, is there ought else yet remaining to be done? Yea, (2) There is the
<hi>Actual Exercise</hi> of the Grace we have received. How may this be Exercised? All the whole work of Grace consists in the <hi>internal</hi> Acts of our Wills, and <hi>external</hi> Operations in Duties suitable thereunto. This therefore is incumbent on us, this we are to look unto in our selves; it is our Duty so to do, namely to stir up and exercise the <hi>Grace</hi> we have received in and unto its proper Operations. But it is so our Duty, as that of our selves we cannot perform it. It is God who
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:48389:241"/>
                  <hi>worketh effectually</hi> in us all those gracious Acts of our Wills, and all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Operations in a way of Duty. Every Act of our <hi>Wills,</hi> so far as it is Gracious and Holy, is the Act of the Spirit of God <hi>efficiently,</hi> He
<hi>worketh in us to will,</hi> or the very Act of willing. To say he doth only perswade us, or excite and stirre up our Wills by his Grace to put forth their own Acts, is to say he doth not do what the Apostle affirms him to do. For, if the gracious Actings of our Wills be so our <hi>own</hi> as not to be his, he doth not work in us <hi>to will,</hi> but only perswadeth us so to do. But the same Apostle utterly excludeth this pretense, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>I laboured abundantly, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> He had a Necessity incumbent on him, of declaring the great labour he had undergone, and the pains he had taken in <hi>preaching of the Gospel:</hi> But yet immediately, least any one should apprehend, that he ascribed any thing to himself, any gracious holy Actings in those Labours, he addes his usual <hi>Epanorthosis, Not I;</hi> let me not be mistaken; it was not I, by any power of mine, by any thing in me, but it was all wrought in me by the free Grace of the Spirit of God. <hi>Not I, but Grace,</hi> is the Apostles Assertion. Suppose now, that God by his Grace doth no more but <hi>aid, assist,</hi> and <hi>excite</hi> the Will in its Actings, that he doth not effectually work all the gracious Actings of our Souls in all our Duties; the Proposition would hold on the other hand, <hi>Not Grace, but I,</hi> seeing the principal Relation of the Effect is unto the next and immediate Cause, and thence hath it its Denomination. And as he worketh them, <hi>To Will</hi> in us, so also <hi>To Doe;</hi> that is, Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to perform those Duties whereunto the gracious <hi>actings</hi> of our Wills are required.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">

<hi>Acts</hi> of Faith, Love and Obedience, wherein the first Part of our <hi>Actual Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> doth consist. And the Truth thus confirmed, may be further improved unto our Instruction and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

<hi>Expressions</hi> of the Scripture, and the <hi>Notions</hi> of some Men among us. There is not any thing that is good in us, nothing that is done well by us in the way of Obedience, but the Scripture expressely and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently assigns it unto the immediate Operations of the Holy Spirit in us. It doth so in general as to all gracious <hi>Actings</hi> whatever, and not content therewith, it proposeth every Grace, and every Holy Duty, distinctly affirming the Holy Ghost to be the immediate Author of them. And when it comes to make mention of us, it <hi>positively</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed prescribes <hi>our Duty</hi> to us, but as <hi>plainly</hi> lets us know, that we have no <hi>power</hi> in or from our selves to perform it. But some men <hi>speak,</hi> and <hi>preach,</hi> and <hi>write</hi> utterly to another purpose. The Freedom, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Power and Ability of our own Wills; the Light, Guidance, and Direction of our own Minds Reasons; and from all, our own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all the Duties of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> are the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of their Discourses; and that in Opposition unto what is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>bed in the Scriptures unto the Immediate Operations of the Holy Ghost. They are all for Grace, <hi>Not I, but Grace, not I but Christ, without him we
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:48389:241"/> can do nothing:</hi> These are all for our Wills; not Grace but our Wills doe all. It is not more plainly affirmed in the Scripture, that God created Heaven and Earth, that he sustains and preserves all things by his Power, than that he <hi>creates grace</hi> in the Hearts of Believers; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves it, acts it, and makes it effectual, working all our Works for us, and all our Duties in us. But Evasions must be found out, strange, forced, uncouth sences, be put upon plain, frequently repeated Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, to secure the Honour of our Wills, and to take care, that all the Good we doe, may not be assigned to the Grace of God. To this purpose Distinctions are coyned, Evasions invented, and such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation is given of all Divine Operations, as renders them useless and insignificant. Yea, it is almost grown, if not <hi>Criminal,</hi> yet weak and
<hi>ridiculous</hi> in the Judgement of some, That any should assign those Works and Operations to the Spirit of God, which the Scripture doth, in the very words that the Scripture useth. To lessen the Corruption and Depravation of our Nature by Sin; to extoll the Integrity and Power of our Reasons; to maintain the Freedom and Ability of our Wills in and unto things spiritually Good; to resolve the Conversion of men unto God, into their Natural good Dispositions, Inclinations and the right use of their Reason; to render <hi>Holiness</hi> to be only a Probity of Life, or Honesty of Conversation, upon rational Motives and Considerations; are the things that men are now almost wearied with the Repetition of. Scarce a Person that hath Confidence to commence for Reputation in the World, but immediately he furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself with some new <hi>tinkling Ornaments</hi> for these old <hi>Pelagian</hi> Figments. But whoever shall take an impartial View of the Design and constant Doctrine of the Scripture in this matter, will not be easily carryed away with the plausible Pretences of men exalting their own Wills and Abilities, in Opposition to the Spirit and Grace of God by Jesus Christ.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label>(2) From what hath been discoursed, a further discovery is made of the Nature of <hi>Gospel Obedience,</hi> of all the Acts of our Souls therein, and of the Duties that belong thereunto. It is commonly granted, that there is a great difference between the Acts and Duties that are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gracious, and those which are called by the same name, that are not so, as in any Duties of Faith, of Prayer, of Charity. But this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is supposed generally to be in the Adjuncts of those Duties, in some properties of them, but not in the <hi>kind, nature</hi> or substance of the Acts of our minds in them. Nay it is commonly said, that whereas wicked men are said to <hi>believe,</hi> and doe many <hi>things gladly</hi> in a way of Obedience; what they so doe, is for the <hi>substance of the Acts</hi> they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, the same with those of them who are truely Regenerate and Sanctified. They may differ in their <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>End,</hi> but as to their
<hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> they are the same. But there is no small mistake herein. All gracious Actings of our Minds and Souls, whether internal only, in Faith, Love, or Delight, or whether they go out unto external Duties required in the Gospel, being wrought in us by the immediate Efficacy of the Spirit of Grace, differ in their Kind, in their Essence and substance of the Acts themselves, from whatever is not so wrought or effected in us. For whatever may be done by any one, in any
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:48389:242"/> acting of common Grace, or performance of any Duty of Obedience, being educed out of the power of the Natural Faculties of men, excited by Convictions, as directed and enforced by Reasons and Exhortations, or assisted by common Aids of what nature soever, they are natural as to their kind, and they have no other substance or Being but what is so. But that which is wrought in us by the especial Grace of the Holy Ghost in the way mentioned, is <hi>supernatural,</hi> as being not educed out of the Powers of our natural Faculties, but an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Effect of the Almighty supernatural Efficacy of the Grace of God. And therefore the sole Reason why God accepts and rewards Duties of Obedience in them that are sanctified, and regardeth not those which for the <hi>outward</hi> Matter and Manner of Performance are the same with them, (as unto <hi>Abel</hi> and his Offering he had respect, but he had no respect unto <hi>Cain</hi> and his Offering, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4, 5.) is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the State and Condition of the Persons that perform them only, though that also have an influence thereinto; but from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Acts and Duties themselves also. He never accepts and rejects Duties of the same Kind absolutely with respect unto the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that do perform them. The Duties themselves are of a different Kind. Those which he accepts are <hi>supernatural</hi> Effects of his own Spirit in us, whereon he rewardeth and crowneth the Fruits of his own Grace. And as for what he rejects, whatever Appearance it may have of a Complyance with the <hi>outward</hi> Command, it hath nothing in it that is <hi>supernaturally</hi> Gracious, and so is not of the same Kind with what he doth accept.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly:</hi> Thus is this Duty expressed, whose <hi>Nature</hi> in the next place we shall more particularly enquire into, and declare, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Observations.</p>
               <p>1. Mortification of Sin is a Duty <hi>alwayes</hi> incumbent on us, in the whole Course of our Obedience. This the Command testifieth, which represents it as an <hi>alwayes present</hi> Duty. When it is no longer a <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>grow</hi> in Grace, it is so not to <hi>mortifie</hi> Sin. No man under Heaven can at any Time say, that he is exempted from this Command, nor on any Pretence. And he who ceaseth from this Duty, lets go all Endeavours after Holiness. And as for those who pretend unto an
<hi>absolute Perfection,</hi> they are of all Persons living the most impudent, nor do ever in this Matter open their mouths, but they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Lye. For,</p>
               <p>2. This Duty being <hi>alwayes</hi> incumbent on us, argues undenyably the abiding in us of a <hi>Principle of Sin</hi> whilest we are in the Flesh, which with its Fruits is that which is to be <hi>mortified.</hi> This the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth the <hi>sin that dwelleth in us,</hi> the <hi>evil that is present with us,</hi> the <hi>Law of the Members, evil Concupiscence, Lust,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the like. And thereunto are the Properties and Actings of <hi>folly, deceit,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:48389:244"/> tempting, seducing, rebelling, warring, captivating,</hi> ascribed. This is not a place to dispute the Truth of this Assertion, which cannot with any Reputation of Modesty be denyed by any who own the Scripture, or pretend to an Acquaintance with themselves. But yet through the Craft of Sathan, with the Pride and Darkness of the Minds of men, it is so fallen out, that the want of a true understanding hereof, is the Occasion of most of those pernitious Errors wherewith the Church of God is at present pestered; and which practically keeps men off from being seriously troubled for their sins, or seeking out for Relief by Jesus Christ. Thus one hath not feared of late openly to profess, that he knowes of no <hi>deceit</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> in his own Heart, though a wiser than he, hath informed us, that <hi>he who trusteth his own Heart is a Fool, Proverb.</hi> 28. 26.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> 3. <hi>In-dwelling sin,</hi> which is the Object of this Duty of <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> falls under a three-fold Consideration. 1. Of its <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple:</hi> 2. Of its <hi>Disposition</hi> and <hi>Operations:</hi> 3. Of its <hi>Effects.</hi> These in the Scripture are frequently distinguished, though mostly under
<hi>Metaphorical</hi> Expressions. So are they mentioned together distinctly,
<hi>Rom. 6. 6. Our old Man is crucified with Christ, that the Body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</hi> (1) The <hi>Root</hi> or
<hi>Principle</hi> of sin, which by Nature possesseth all the Faculties of the Soul, and as a depraved Habit enclines unto all that is evil, is the
<hi>Old man,</hi> so called in Opposition unto the <hi>New man</hi> which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness. (2) There is the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,</hi> actual <hi>Disposition</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of this Principle or Habit, which is called the <hi>Body of sin</hi> with the Members of it. For, under those Expressions sin is proposed as <hi>in procinctu,</hi> in a Readiness to Act its self, and enclining unto all that is evil. And this also is expressed by the <hi>Affections and Lusts of the Flesh, Gal. 4. 25. Deceitfull Lusts, Ephes.</hi> 4. 24. The <hi>Old man is Corrupt, according unto the deceitfull Lusts, the Wills of the Flesh, and the Mind.</hi> (3) There are the <hi>Effects,</hi> Fruits and Products of these things, which are Actual sins, whereby as the Apostle speaks, we <hi>serve sin,</hi> as bringing forth the Fruits of it; that we should not henceforth <hi>serve sin.</hi> And these Fruits are of two sorts: 1. <hi>Internal,</hi> in the <hi>Figments</hi> and Imaginations of the Heart, which is the first way whereby the Lusts of the Old man do act themselves. And therefore, of those that are under the Power or Dominion of sin, it is said, that <hi>every Figment or Imagination of their Hearts are evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, Gen.</hi> 6. 5. For they have no other Principle whereby they are acted, but that of Sin, and therefore all the Figments of their Hearts must be necessarily evil. And with respect hereunto, our Saviour affirms, that all Actual sins <hi>proceed out of the Heart, Math.</hi> 15. 19. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is their <hi>Root,</hi> and there are they first formed and framed. 2. <hi>External,</hi> in Actual sins, such as those enumerated by our Apostle;

(1) They are opposed in their <hi>Principle.</hi> For the <hi>Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit lusteth against Flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other, Gal.</hi> 5. 17. These are those two adverse <hi>Principles,</hi> which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such a Conflict in the Souls of <hi>Believers,</hi> whilst they are in this world, and which is so <hi>Graphically</hi> described by our Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. so the Old and New man are opposed and contrary. (2) In their
<hi>Actings;</hi> The <hi>Lusting</hi> of the Flesh, and the <hi>Lusting</hi> or desires of the Spirit,
<hi>Walking</hi> after the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Walking</hi> after the <hi>Spirit, living</hi> after the
<hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>living</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> are opposed also. This is the Opposition that is between the Body of <hi>Sin</hi> with its Members, and the Life of Grace; <hi>Who walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit, Rom. 8. 1, 4, 5. We are Debters not to the flesh, to live after the flesh; for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die; but if ye by the Spirit, doe mortifie the Deeds of the Flesh ye shall live, ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13. By this walking after the Flesh, I understand not, at least not principally, the committing of Actual Sins, but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the Principle or Habit of sin prevailing in Depraved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Nature, allowing it a predominancy in the Hearts and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is when men are <hi>disposed</hi> to <hi>Act</hi> according to the <hi>Inclinations, Lustings, Motions, Wills</hi> and <hi>Desires</hi> of it. Or it is to bend <hi>that way Habitually</hi> in our <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Conversation,</hi> which the Flesh inclines and leads unto. This <hi>Principle</hi> doth not indeed <hi>Equally</hi> bring forth <hi>Actual sins</hi> in all, but hath various Degrees of its Efficacy, as it is <hi>advantaged</hi> by
<hi>Temptations, controlled</hi> by <hi>Light,</hi> or hampered by <hi>Convictions.</hi> Hence all that are under the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> are not all equally vitious and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But <hi>after the flesh</hi> goes the bent of the Soul, and the generality of its Actings. To <hi>walk after the Spirit,</hi> consists in our being given up to Rule and Conduct, or walking according to the Dispositions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the Spirit, that which is born of the Spirit, Namely, a
<hi>Principle</hi> of Grace implanted in us by the Holy Ghost, which hath at large insisted on before. And (3) The External <hi>Fruits and Effects</hi> of these two Principles are contrary also, as our Apostle expressely and at large declares, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. For whereas in the Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Works of the Flesh, he reckons up <hi>Actual sins,</hi> as Adultery, Fornication, and the like, in the Account he gives of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Spirit, he insists on <hi>Habitual Graces,</hi> as Love, Joy, Peace, he expresseth them both <hi>Metaphorically.</hi> In the former he hath repect unto the viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Habits of those <hi>Actual Sins;</hi> and in the latter, unto the <hi>Actual Effects</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> of those Habitual Graces.</p>

There being this universal Contrariety, Opposition, contending and warfare between Grace and Sin, the Spirit and the Flesh, in their inward Principles, Powers, Operations, and outward Effects; the Work and Duty of <hi>Mortification</hi> consists in a constant <hi>taking part</hi> with Grace, in its Principle, Actings and Fruits, against the Principle Acts and Fruits of Sin. For the Residence of these contrary Principles being <hi>in,</hi> and their Actings being <hi>by</hi> the same Faculties of the Soul, as the one is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, strengthened, and improved, the other must of necessity be weakened and decay. Wherefore the <hi>Mortification of Sin</hi> must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in these three things. (1) The <hi>cherishing</hi> and improving of the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:48389:245"/> Principle of Grace and Holiness which is implanted in us by the Holy Ghost, by all the wayes and means which God hath appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which we have spoken unto before. This is that which alone can undermine and ruine the power of Sin, without which all Attempts to weaken it are vain and fruitless. Let men take never so much pains to Mortifie, Crucifie or Subdue their sins, unless they endeavour in the first place to weaken and impair its strength by the increase of Grace, and growing therein, they will labour in the fire, where this work will be consumed. (2) In <hi>frequent actings</hi> of the Principles of Grace in all Duties Internal and External. For where the Inclinations, Motions, and Actings of the Spirit in all Acts, Duties, and Fruits of Holy Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are vigorous and kept in constant Exercise, the contrary Motions and Actings of the Flesh are defeated. (3) In a due <hi>Application</hi> of the Principle, Power, and Actings of Grace, by way of opposition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Principle, Power, and Actings of Sin. As the whole of Grace is opposed unto the whole of Sin; so there is no particular Lust where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Sin can act its power, but there is a particular Grace ready, to make effectual Opposition unto it, whereby it is mortified. And in this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Grace in its Actings in Opposition unto all the Actings of sin, consists the Mystery of this great Duty of <hi>Mortification.</hi> And where men being ignorant hereof, have yet fallen under a Conviction of the Power of Sin, and been perplexed therewith, they have found out
<hi>foolish wayes</hi> innumerable, for its Mortification, wickedly opposing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, Natural, bodily Force and Exercise, unto an Internal, Moral, Depraved Principle which is no way concerned therein. But hereof we must treat more afterwards under the third Head concerning the
<hi>Manner</hi> how this work is to be carried on, or this Duty performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> 6. This Duty of weakening Sin, by the Growth and improvement of Grace, and the Opposition which is made unto sin in all its Actings thereby is called <hi>Mortification, Killing,</hi> or <hi>putting to Death,</hi> on sundry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. First and principally, from that <hi>Life,</hi> which because of its Power, Efficacy and Operation is ascribed unto <hi>Indwelling Sin.</hi> The state of the Soul by reason of it is a state of <hi>Death.</hi> But whereas Power and Operations, are the proper Adjuncts or Effects of Life, for their sakes <hi>life</hi> is ascribed unto sin, on whose account sinners are dead. Wherefore this corrupt Principle of Sin in our depraved Nature, having a constant, powerful inclination, and working Actually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>wards all evil; it is said <hi>Metaphorically</hi> to <hi>Live,</hi> or to have a <hi>Life</hi> of its own. Therefore is the Opposition that is made unto it for its ruine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, called <hi>Mortification,</hi> or <hi>Killing,</hi> being its Deprivation of that strength, and efficacy whereby, and wherein it is said to <hi>live.</hi> Secondly, It may be so called because of the <hi>Violence</hi> of that contest which the Soul is put unto in this Duty. All other Duties that we are called unto in the course of our Obedience, may be performed in a <hi>more easie, gentle,</hi> and plain manner. Though it is our Work and Duty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with all sorts of Temptations, yea to <hi>wrestle</hi> with <hi>Principalities and Powers, and spiritual wickednesses in high places,</hi> yet in this which we have with our selves, which is wholly within us and from us, there is more of <hi>Warring, Fighting, Captivating, Wounding, Crying out</hi> for Help and Assistance, a deep sense of such a violence as is used in taking away
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:48389:245"/> the Life of a mortal Enemy, than in any thing else we are called unto. And Thirdly, the end aymed at in this Duty, is <hi>Destruction,</hi> as it is of all killing. Sin, as was said, hath a Life, and that such a Life, as whereby it not onely Lives, but Rules and Reigns in all that are not born of God. By the entrance of Grace into the Soul it looseth its Dominion, but not its Being; its Rule, but not its Life. The utter Ruine, Destruction and gradual Annihilation of all the Remainders of this cursed Life of Sin, is our Design and Aym in this Work and Duty, which is therefore called <hi>Mortification.</hi> The design of this Duty wherever it is in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is to leave sin neither Being, nor Life, nor Operation.</p>

               <p>And (1) It is evident from what hath been discoursed, that it is a Work which hath a <hi>Gradual Progress,</hi> in the proceed whereof we must continually be Exercised. And this respects in the first place the Principle of sin it self. Every day, and in every Duty an especial eye is to be had unto the Abolition and Destruction of this Principle. It will no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise dye, but by being <hi>Gradually</hi> and constantly weakened, spare it and it heals its wounds and recovers strength. Hence many who have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a great Degree in the <hi>Mortification</hi> of sin, doe by their negligence suffer it in some Instances or other so to take head again, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recover their former state whilst they live.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> And this is the Reason why we have so many <hi>Withering Professors</hi> among us, decayed in their Graces, fruitless in their lives, and every way conformed to the world. There are some indeed who being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of that Blindnesse and Darknesse, which is a Principal part of the Depravation of our Nature, doe neither see nor discern the Inward secret Actings and Motions of sin; its Deceit and Restles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, its mixing its self one way or other in all our Dutyes, with the Defilement and Guilt wherewith these things are accompanied; who judge that God scarce takes notice of any thing but outward Actions, and it may be not much of them neither, so as to be displeased with them, unlesse they are very foul indeed, which yet he is easily intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to passe by and excuse, who judge this Duty superfluous, despising both the Confession and <hi>Mortification</hi> of Sin, in this Root and Principle of it. But those who have received most Grace and Power from above against it, are of all others the most <hi>sensible</hi> of its Power and Guilt, and of the Necessity of Applying themselves continually unto its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>(2) With respect unto its <hi>Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Operations,</hi> wherein it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously exerts its Power, in all particular instances we are continually to watch against it, and to subdue it. And this concerns us in all that we are and doe; in our Duties, in our Calling, in our Conversation with others, in our Retirements, in the frames of our Spirits, in our Streights, in our Mercies, in the use of our Enjoyments, in our Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If we are negligent unto any Occasion we shall suffer by it. This is our Enemy, and this is the Warre we are ingaged in. Every mistake, every neglect is perillous.</p>

                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:48389:246"/> And, (3) The <hi>End</hi> of this Duty with respect unto us, expressed by the Apostle is, <hi>that henceforth we should not serve sin;</hi> which referres unto the Perpetration of Actual Sins, the bringing forth of the Actual Fruits of the Flesh internal or external also. In whosoever the <hi>Old man</hi> is not crucisied with Christ, let him think what he will of himself, he is a <hi>servant</hi> of Sin. If he have not received Vertue from the Death of Christ, if he be not wrought unto a <hi>Conformity</hi> to him therein, whatever else he may do or attain, however he may in any thing, in many things, change his Course, and reform his Life, he <hi>serves sin</hi> and not God. Our great Design ought to be, that we should no <hi>longer serve sin,</hi> which the Apostle in the ensuing Verses gives us many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for. It is indeed the <hi>worst service</hi> that a Rational Creature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and will have the most dolefull End. What therefore is the only <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> whereby we may attain this End; namely, that although Sin will <hi>abide</hi> in us, yet that we may not <hi>serve</hi> it, which will secure us from its Danger? This is that <hi>Mortification</hi> of it which we insist upon, and no other. If we expect to be freed from the <hi>service</hi> of Sin, by its own giving over to press its Dominions upon us, or by any Composition with it, or any other way but by being alwayes <hi>killing</hi> or <hi>destroying</hi> of it, we do but deceive our own Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> And indeed, it is to be feared, that the <hi>Nature</hi> of this Duty is not sufficiently understood, or not sufficiently considered. Men look upon it as an easie Task, and that which will be carried on with a little Diligence, and ordinary Attendance. But do we think it is for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that the Holy Ghost expresseth the Duty of opposing Sin, and weakening its Power by <hi>Mortification,</hi> killing or putting to death? Is there not somewhat <hi>peculiar</hi> herein, beyond any other Act or Duty of our Lives? Certainly there is intimated a great Contest of Sin, for the preservation of its Life. Every thing will do its utmost to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve its Life and Being. So will Sin do also; and if it be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly pursued with Diligence and Holy Violence, it will escape our Assaults. Let no man think to <hi>kill sin</hi> with few, easie or gentle strokes. He who hath once smitten a Serpent, if he follow not on his blow untill it be slain, may repent that ever he begun the quarrel. And so will he who undertakes to deal with Sin, and pursues it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to death; Sin will after a while revive, and the Man must dye. It is a great and <hi>fatal</hi> Mistake, if we suppose this Work will admit of any <hi>remisseness</hi> or intermission. Again, the Principle to be slain is <hi>in our selves,</hi> and so possessed of our Faculties, as that it is called <hi>our selves.</hi> It cannot be killed without a sense of
<hi>pain</hi> and <hi>trouble.</hi> Hence it is compared to the cutting off of <hi>Right Hands,</hi> and the plucking out of <hi>Right Eyes.</hi> Lusts that pretend to be usefull to the State and Condition of men, that are pleasant and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to the Flesh, will not be mortified without such a Violence as the whole Soul shall be deeply sensible of. And sundry other things might be insisted on, to manifest how men deceive themselves, if they suppose this Duty of Mortification is that which they may carry on in a negligent careless Course and Manner. Is there no Danger in this <hi>Warfare?</hi> no Watchfulness, no Diligence required of us? Is it so easie a thing <hi>to kill an Enemy</hi> who hath so many Advantages of <hi>force</hi>
                  <pb n="481" facs="tcp:48389:246"/> and <hi>fraud?</hi> Wherefore, if we take care of our Souls, we are to attend unto this Duty, with that Care, Diligence, Watchfulness, and earnest Contention of spirit, which the Nature of it doth require.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> And moreover, there is no less <hi>fatal</hi> Mistake where we make the Object of this Duty to be only some <hi>particular Lusts,</hi> or the Fruits of them in Actual sins, as was before observed. This is the way with many. They will make Head against some Sins, which on one Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or other they find themselves most concerned in; but if they will observe their Course, they shall find with how little success they do it. For the most part Sin gets ground upon them, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually groan under the Power of its Victories. And the Reason is, because they mistake their <hi>Business.</hi> Contests against particular sins, are only to comply with Light and Convictions. Mortification with a Design for Holiness, respects the <hi>Body of Sin,</hi> the Root and all its Branches: The first will miscarry, and the latter will be successefull. And herein consists the Difference between that <hi>Mortification</hi> which men are put upon by Convictions from the Law, which alwayes proves fruitless, and that wherein we are acted by the Spirit of the Gospel: The first respects only <hi>particular</hi> sins, as the Guilt of them reflects upon Conscience; the latter, the <hi>whole Interest</hi> of Sin as opposed to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of the Image of God in us.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly:</hi> That which remains further to be demonstrated is, That the Holy Spirit is the <hi>Author</hi> of this Work in us, so that although it is <hi>our Duty,</hi> it is <hi>his Grace</hi> and Strength whereby it is performed; as also the <hi>Manner</hi> how it is wrought by him, which is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>For the first, we have the truth of it asserted, <hi>Rom. 8. 13. If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the Deeds of the Flesh.</hi> It is <hi>we</hi> that are to mortifie the Deeds of the Flesh; it is our Duty, but of our selves we cannot do it, it must be done in or by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Whether we take the Spirit here for the Person of the Holy Ghost, as the Context seems to require, or take it for the gracious Principle of spiritual Life in the Renovation of our Nature, not the Spirit himself, but that <hi>which is born of the Spirit,</hi> it is all one as to our purpose; the Work is taken from our own Natural Power or Ability, and resolved into the Grace of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> And that we go no further for the proof of our Assertion, it may suffice to observe, That the Confirmation of it is the principal Design of the Apostle, from the second Verse of that Chapter unto the end of the 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> That the Power and Reign of Sin, its Interest and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency in the Minds of Believers, are weakened, impaired, and finally destroyed (so as that all the pernicious Consequences of it shall be avoyded,) by the Holy Ghost, and that these things could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be effected, he both affirms and proves at large. In the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<hi>Chapter,</hi> from the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verse unto the end, he declares the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Properties,</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of <hi>In-dwelling sin,</hi> as the Remainders of it do still abide in Believers. And whereas a two-fold Conclusion might be made from the Description he gives of the Power and Actings
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:48389:247"/> of this sin, or a double Question arise, unto the great Disconsolation of Believers, he doth in this Chapter remove them both, manifesting that there was no cause for such Conclusions or Exceptions, from any thing by him delivered. The first of these is, that if such, if this be the Power and Prevalency of <hi>In-dwelling sin,</hi> if it so obstruct us in our doing that which is good, and impetuously incline unto evil; what will become of us in the End, how shall we answer for all the Sin and Guilt which we have contracted thereby? We must, we shall therefore perish under the Guilt of it. And the second Conclusion which is apt to arise from the same Consideration is, that seeing the Power and Prevalency of Sin is so great, and that we in our selves are no way able to make Resistance unto it, much less to overcome it, it cannot be, but that at length it will absolutely prevail against us, and bring us under its Dominion, unto our everlasting Ruine. Both these
<hi>Conclusions</hi> the Apostle obviates in this Chapter, or removes them if laid as <hi>Objections</hi> against what he had delivered. And this he doth,</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label>(1) By a Tacit <hi>Concession,</hi> that they will both of them be found true towards all who live and dye <hi>under the Law,</hi> without an Interest in Jesus Christ. For, affirming that <hi>there is no condemnation unto them that are in Christ Jesus,</hi> he grants, that those who are not so cannot avoyd it. Such is the Guilt of this sin, and such are the Fruits of it in all in whomsoever it abides, that it makes them obnoxious unto Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. But,</p>
               <p>(2) There is a <hi>Deliverance</hi> from this Condemnation, and from all
<hi>liableness</hi> thereunto, by <hi>free Justification in the Blood of Christ, v.</hi> 1. For those who have an Interest in him, and are made partakers thereof, although sin may grieve them, trouble and perplex them, and by its Deceit and Violence cause them to contract much Guilt in their sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizals, yet they need not despond, or be utterly cast down; there is a stable ground of Consolation provided for them, in that <hi>there is no Condemnation unto them that are in Christ Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(3) That none may <hi>abuse</hi> this Consolation of the Gospel, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance themselves unto a Continuance in the <hi>service of sin,</hi> he gives a Limitation of the Subjects unto whom it doth belong, namely, all them and only them <hi>who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit, v.</hi> 1. As for those who give up themselves unto the Conduct of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of In-dwelling sin, who comply with its Motions and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being acted wholly by its Power, let them neither flatter nor deceive themselves, there is nothing in Christ nor the Gospel to free them from Condemnation. It is they only who give up themselves to the <hi>Conduct of the Spirit of Sanctification and Holiness,</hi> that have an interest in this Priviledge.</p>
               <p>(4) As to the other Conclusion, taken from the Consideration of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Prevalency</hi> of this Principle of sin, he prevents or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves it, by a full Discovery <hi>how</hi> and by <hi>what means</hi> that Power of it shall be so broken, its strength abated, its prevalency disappointed, and its self destroyed, as that we need not fear the Consequents of it before mentioned; but rather may secure our selves, that we shall be the <hi>death thereof,</hi> and not <hi>that</hi> the death of our Souls. Now this is, saith he, by the <hi>Law or Power</hi> of the Spirit of Life, which is in Christ
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:48389:247"/> Jesus, <hi>v.</hi> 2. And thereon he proceeds to declare, that it is by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual working of this Spirit in us alone, that we are enabled to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this spiritual Adversary. This being sufficiently evident, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth only that we declare, the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> how he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth this Effect of his Grace.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label>(1) The Foundation of all Mortification of Sin, is from the <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Spirit in us.</hi> He dwells in the Persons of Believers as in his <hi>Temple,</hi> and so he prepares it for himself. Those Defilements or Pollutions which render the Souls of men unmeet <hi>Habitations</hi> for the Spirit of God, do all of them consist in <hi>sin inherent</hi> and its Effects. These therefore he will remove and subdue, that he may dwell in us suitably unto his <hi>Holiness. Rom. 8. 11. If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the Dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the Dead shall also quicken your mortal Bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> Our <hi>mortal Bodyes,</hi> are our Bodies as obnoxious unto Death by reason of sin; as <hi>v.</hi> 10. And the <hi>Quickening of these mortal Bodyes,</hi> is their being freed from the Principle of Sin, or Death and its Power, by a contrary Principle of Life and Righteousness. It is the freeing of us from <hi>being in the Flesh, that we may be in the Spirit, v.</hi> 9. And by what <hi>Means</hi> is this effected? It is by the <hi>Spirit of him that raised Jesus from the Dead;</hi> that is, of the Father, which also is called the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, <hi>v.</hi> 9. For he is equally the Spirit of the Father and the Son. And he is described by this <hi>Periphrasis,</hi> both because there is a similitude between that Work as to its Greatness and Power which God wrought in Christ when he raised him from the Dead, and what he worketh in Believers in their Sanctification, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 19, 20. and because this Work is wrought in us by vertue of the Resurrection of Christ. But under what especial Consideration doth he effect this Work of mortifying sin in us? It is as he <hi>dwelleth in us.</hi> God doth it by his Spirit as he dwelleth in us. As it is a <hi>work of Grace,</hi> it is said to be <hi>wrought by the Spirit;</hi> and as it is <hi>our Duty,</hi> we are said to work it <hi>through the Spirit, v.</hi> 13. And let men pretend what they please, if they have not the Spirit of Christ <hi>dwelling in them,</hi> they have not mortified any sin, but do yet walk after the flesh, and, continuing so to doe, shall dye.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> Moreover, as this is the only <hi>Spring</hi> of Mortification in us as it is a
<hi>Grace,</hi> so the Consideration of it is the principal Motive unto it as it is a <hi>Duty.</hi> So our Apostle pressing unto it, doth it by this Argument;
<hi>Know ye not that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which you have of God? 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 19. To which we may adde that weighty Caution which he gives us to the same purpose; 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 16.

               </p>
               <p>Whereas therefore in every Duty two things are principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. First, The <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spring</hi> of it, as it is wrought in us by
<hi>Grace:</hi> Secondly, The <hi>principal Reason</hi> for it and Motive unto it, as it is to be performed in our selves by the way of <hi>Duty:</hi> Both these as to this matter of <hi>Mortification,</hi> do center in this <hi>Inhabitation</hi> of the Spirit.
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:48389:248"/> For, (1) It is he who <hi>mortifies</hi> and <hi>subdues</hi> our Corruptions, who quickens us unto Life, Holiness and Obedience, as <hi>he dwelleth in us,</hi> that he may make and prepare an <hi>Habitation</hi> meet for himself. And, (2) The principal Reason and Motive which we have to attend unto it, with all Care and Diligence as a <hi>Duty,</hi> is that we may thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his <hi>Dwelling-place</hi> so as becometh his Grace and Holiness. And indeed, whereas (as our Saviour tells us) they are things which arise from and come <hi>out of the Heart,</hi> that defile us, there is no greater nor more forcible Motive to contend against all the defiling Actings of sin, which is our Mortification, than this, that by the Neglect hereof the <hi>Temple</hi> of the Spirit will be defiled, which we are commanded to watch against under the severe Commination of being destroyed for our Neglect therein.</p>

And an Acquaintance herewith dependeth on the Knowledge of the sin that is to be mortified, which we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore described. It is the <hi>vitious corrupt Habit,</hi> and Inclination unto sin, which is in us by Nature, that is the principal Object of this Duty; or, <hi>the Old man which is corrupt according unto deceitfull Lusts.</hi> When this is weakened in us as to its Power and Efficacy, when its <hi>strength</hi> is abated, and its Prevalency destroyed, then is this Duty in its proper Discharge, and <hi>Mortification</hi> carryed on in the <hi>soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this the Holy Ghost doth, <hi>First,</hi> By <hi>implanting</hi> in our Minds and all their Faculties, <hi>A contrary Habit and Principle,</hi> with contrary Inclinations, Dispositions and Actings, namely, a Principle of <hi>spiritual</hi> Life and Holiness, bringing forth the Fruits thereof. By means hereof is this work effected. For sin will no otherwise dye, but by being
<hi>killed</hi> and <hi>slain:</hi> And whereas this is <hi>gradually</hi> to be done, it must be by Warring and Conflict. There must be something in us that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto it, which opposing of it, conflicting with it, doth insensibly
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:48389:248"/> and by Degrees, (for it dyes not at once) work out its Ruine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. As in a <hi>Chronical</hi> Distemper, the Disease continually Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and Conflicts with the Powers of Nature, untill having insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly improved them, it prevails unto its Dissolution. So is it in this matter. These adverse Principles with their Contrariety, Opposition, and Conflict, the Apostle expressely asserts and describes, as also their contrary Fruits and Actings, with the Issue of the whole, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16, 17. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. The contrary Principles are the <hi>Flesh</hi> and
<hi>Spirit,</hi> and their contrary Actings are in <hi>Lusting</hi> and <hi>Warring</hi> one against the other, <hi>ver. 16. Walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulfill the Lusts of the Flesh:</hi> Not to fulfill the lusts of the flesh is to Mortifie it; for it neither will nor can be kept alive if its Lusts be not fulfilled. And he gives a fuller Account hereof <hi>ver. 17. For the Flesh Lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit Lusteth against the Flesh, and these are contrary one to the other.</hi> If by the Spirit, the Spirit of God himself be intended, yet he <hi>Lusteth not in us,</hi> but by vertue of that spirit which is born of him, that is, the New Nature or Holy Principle of Obedience which he worketh in us. And the <hi>way</hi> of their <hi>mutual Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> unto one another, the Apostle describes at large in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verses, by instancing in the contrary Effects of the one and the other. But the Issue of the whole is, <hi>v. 24. They that are Christs have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Flesh with its Affections and Lusts.</hi> They have crucified it, that is, fastned it unto that Cross, where at length it may expire. And this is the way of it, namely, the Actings of the Spirit against it, and the Fruits produced thereby. Hence he shuts up his discourse with that Exhortation, <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us walk in the Spirit.</hi> That is, if we are endowed with this Spiritual Principle of Life, which is to live in the Spirit, then let us Act, Work and Improve that spiritual Principle unto the Ruine and Mortification of sin.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>22</label> This therefore is the <hi>first way</hi> whereby the Spirit of God Mortifieth sin in us, and in a compliance with it under his conduct do we regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry on this work and Duty: That is, <hi>we Mortifie sin,</hi> by cherishing the Principle of Holiness and Sanctification in our Souls, labouring to encrease and strengthen it by growing in Grace, and by a constancy and frequency in acting of it in all Duties, on all Occasions, abounding in the Fruits of it. Growing, Thriving, and Improving in universal Holinesse, is the great way of the <hi>Mortification</hi> of sin. The more <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous</hi> the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Holinesse</hi> is in us, the more <hi>weak, infirm,</hi> and <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> will be that of sin. The more <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> are the <hi>Actings</hi> of Grace, the <hi>feebler</hi> and seldomer will be the <hi>Actings</hi> of <hi>Sin.</hi> The more we abound in the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the less shall we be concerned in the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Flesh.</hi> And we doe but deceive our selves if we think sin will be mortified on any other terms. Men when they are galled in their Consciences, and disquieted in their Mindes with any
<hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Temptation</hi> thereunto, wherein their <hi>Lusts</hi> or <hi>Corruptions,</hi> are either influenced by <hi>Satan,</hi> or entangled by <hi>Objects, Occasions,</hi> and
<hi>Opportunities,</hi> doe set themselves oft-times in good earnest to oppose and subdue it, by all the <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>means</hi> they can think upon. But all they doe is in vain, and so they find it at last unto their cost and sorrow. The reason is, because they neglect this course, without which never
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:48389:249"/> any one sin was <hi>truly Mortified</hi> in the world, nor ever will so be. The course I intend is, that of labouring universally to improve a <hi>Principle of Holiness,</hi> not in this or that way, but in all Instances of <hi>Holy Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> This is that which will ruine sin, and without it nothing else will contribute any thing thereunto. Bring a man unto the <hi>Law,</hi> urge him with the <hi>Purity</hi> of its <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of its <hi>Commands,</hi> the
<hi>Severity</hi> of its <hi>Threatnings,</hi> the dreadfull <hi>Consequences</hi> of its transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Suppose him convinced hereby of the evil and danger of sin, of the necessity of its <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Destruction.</hi> Will he be able here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to discharge this Duty, so as that sin may dye, and his soul may live? The Apostle assures us of the contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7, 8, 9. The whole <hi>Effect</hi> of the <hi>Application</hi> of the Law in its power <hi>unto indwelling sin,</hi> is but to <hi>irritate, provoke,</hi> and <hi>increase</hi> its guilt.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Holy Ghost carryeth on this work in us as a <hi>Grace,</hi> and enableth us unto it as our <hi>Duty,</hi> by those <hi>actual Supplies</hi> and <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> which he continually communicates unto us.

                  </gap>, <hi>Phil. 1. ver.</hi> 19. An <hi>Additional supply</hi> as occasion requireth beyond our constant daily provision; or <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Heb. 4. ver.</hi> 16. Grace given in to help seasonably upon our cry made for it. Of the Nature of these Supplies, we have discoursed before. I shall now onely observe, that in the Life of Faith and Dependance on Christ, the Expectation and Derivation of these supplies of Grace and spiritual strength, is one principal part of our Duty. These things are not <hi>empty Notions</hi> as some Imagine. If Christ be an Head of <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> unto us, as well as of Rule, as the Head natural is to the Body; If he be <hi>our Life,</hi> if our Life be in him, and we have nothing but what we doe receive from him, if he gives unto us supplies of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and increases of <hi>Grace,</hi> and if it be our Duty by Faith to look for all these things from him, and that be the means of receiving them, which things are all <hi>expressely</hi> and <hi>frequently</hi> affirmed in the Sripture; then is this Expectation and Derivation of spiritual strength continually from him, the way we are to take for the Actual <hi>Mortification</hi> of sin. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we would be found in a successeful discharge of this Duty, it is required of us; (1) That we endeavour diligently in the whole Course of our lives after these continual supplies of <hi>Grace,</hi> that is, that we wait for them in all those ways and means whereby they are communicated. For although the Lord Christ giveth them out freely and bountifully,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:48389:249"/> yet our <hi>Diligence in Duty,</hi> will give the measure of receiving them. If we are negligent in Prayer, Meditation, Reading, Hearing of the Word, and other Ordinances of Divine Worship, we have no ground to expect any great <hi>supplyes</hi> to this End. And, (2) That we live and abound in the <hi>Actual Exercise</hi> of all those Craces, which are most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposite unto those peculiar Lusts or Corruptions that we are most exercised withall, or obnoxious unto. For <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> do trie their Interest and Prevalency in <hi>particular</hi> Instances. If therefore any are more than ordinarily subject unto the Power of any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as Passion, inordinate Affections, Love of the World, Distrust of God; unless he be constant in the Exercise of those Graces which are <hi>Diametrically</hi> opposed unto them, they will continually suffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is the Holy Spirit which <hi>directs</hi> us unto and <hi>helps</hi> us in the Performance of <hi>those Duties</hi> which are appointed of God unto this <hi>End,</hi> that they may be <hi>Means</hi> of the Mortification of sin. Unto the right use of those Duties (for such there are) two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: 1. That we <hi>know</hi> them aright, in their <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Vse,</hi> as also that they are appointed of God unto this <hi>End:</hi> And then, 2. That we <hi>perform</hi> them in a due <hi>manner.</hi> And both these we must have from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God: He is given to Believers, <hi>to lead them into all Truth;</hi> he teacheth and instructs them by the Word, not only what Duties are <hi>incumbent</hi> on them, but also how to <hi>perform</hi> them, and with respect unto what Ends.</p>
               <p>(First,) It is required, that we <hi>know</hi> them aright, in their <hi>Nature, Vse</hi> and <hi>Ends.</hi> For want hereof, or through the Neglect of looking after it, all sorts of men have wandred after <hi>foolish Imaginations</hi> about this Work, either as to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Work it self, or as to the
<hi>Means</hi> whereby it may be effected. For it being a Grace and Duty of the Gospel, thence only is it truely to be learned, and that by the
<hi>Teachings</hi> of the Spirit of God. And it may not be amiss to give some Instances of the Darkness of mens Minds and their Mistakes herein.</p>

<pb n="488" facs="tcp:48389:250"/> it may be brought about by the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> They have by the Light of the <hi>Scripture</hi> a far clearer Discovery of the Nature and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of sin, than had the <hi>Philosophers</hi> of Old. The <hi>Commandment</hi> also being variously brought and applyed unto their Consciences, they may be, and doubtless are and have been, many of them, made deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sensible of the Actings and Tendency of <hi>In-dwelling sin.</hi> Hereon ensues a Terror of Death and Eternal Judgement. Things being so stated, Persons who were not profligate, nor had their Consciences seared, could not refrain from contriving <hi>wayes</hi> and <hi>means</hi> how Sin might be mortified and destroyed. But whereas they had lost a true Apprehension of the only Way whereby this might be effected, they betook themselves unto innumerable <hi>false ones</hi> of their own. This was the <hi>Spring</hi> of all the Austerities, Disciplines, Fastings, self-Macerations, and the like, which are exercised or in use among them. For although they are now in Practice turned mostly to the Benefit of the <hi>Priests,</hi> and an Indulgence unto Sin in the <hi>Penitents,</hi> yet they were invented and set on foot at first, with a Design to use them as Engines for the
<hi>Mortification</hi> of sin; and they have a great Appearance in the Flesh unto that End and Purpose. But yet when all was done, they found by Experience that they were insufficient hereunto; Sin was not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,</hi> nor Conscience <hi>pacified</hi> by them. This made them betake themselves to <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Here they have Hopes all will be set right, when they are gone out of this World, from whence none could come back to complain of their Disappointments. These things are not spoken to condemn even <hi>External Severities</hi> and Austerities, in Fastings, Watchings and Abstinencies in their proper place. Our Nature is apt to run into extremes; Because we see the vanity of the <hi>Papists</hi> in placing Mortification of Sin, in an outward Shadow and Appearance of it, in that <hi>Bodily Exercise</hi> which profiteth not; we are apt to think that all things of that Nature are utterly needless, and cannot be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate unto spiritual Ends. But the truth is, I shall much suspect their <hi>internal</hi> Mortification, (pretend what they will) who alwayes
<hi>pamper</hi> the Flesh, indulge to their sensual Appetite, conform to the World, and lead their Lives in Idleness and Pleasures. Yea it is high time, that Professors by joynt-consent should retrench that <hi>Course of Life,</hi> in Fulness of Diet, Bravery of Apparel, Expence of Time, in vain Conversation, which many are fallen into. But these outward
<hi>Austerities</hi> of themselves, I say, will never effect the End aimed at: For as to the most of them, they being such as God never appointed unto any such End or Purpose, but being the Fruit of mens own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances</hi> and <hi>Inventions;</hi> let them be insisted on and pursued unto the most imaginable Extremities, being not blessed of God thereunto, they will not contribute the least towards the <hi>Mortification</hi> of Sin. Neither is there either Vertue or Efficacy in the residue of them, but as they are subordinated unto other <hi>spiritual Duties.</hi> So <hi>Hierome</hi> gives us an honest <hi>Instance</hi> in himself, telling us, that whilest he lived in his horrid Wilderness in <hi>Judea,</hi> and lodged in his Cave, his Mind would be in the Sports and Revels at <hi>Rome.</hi>

<pb n="489" facs="tcp:48389:250"/> which it may be also some of them really intended, though it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they never understood the <hi>Nature</hi> of it. For in the height of their outward Appearances, as they came short of the sorry Weeds, begging Habits, macerated Countenances, and severe Looks of many <hi>Monks</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and <hi>Devices</hi> among the <hi>Mahumetans;</hi> so they were so far from restraining or mortifying their real Inclinations, as that they seemed to excite and provoke themselves to exceed all others in Clamours, Railings, evil Speakings, Reproaches, Calumnies, and malicious Treating of those who dissented from them, without the least Discovery of an Heart filled with Kindness and Benignity unto Mankind, or love unto any but themselves; in which Frame and state of things, Sin is as secure from <hi>Mortification</hi> as in the Practice of open Lusts and Debaucheries. But supposing that they made a real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious Attempt for the <hi>Mortification</hi> of sin, what <hi>success</hi> have they had, what have they attained unto? Some of them have very wisely slipt over the whole Work and Duty of it, into a <hi>pleasing Dream of Perfection.</hi> And generally finding the <hi>fruitlesness</hi> of their Attempt, and that indeed Sin will not be mortified by the Power of their <hi>Light within,</hi> nor by their Resolutions, nor by any of their austere outward Appearances, nor peculiar Habits or Looks, which in this matter are openly <hi>Pharisaical,</hi> they begin to give over their Design. For who among all that pretend to any Reverence of God, do more openly indulge themselves unto Covetousness, Love of the World, Aemula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Strife, Contentions among themselves, severe Revenges against others, than they doe; not to mention the Filth and Uncleanness they begin mutually to charge one another withall. And so will all <hi>self-devised</hi> wayes of Mortification end. It is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God alone who leads us into the Exercise of those Duties whereby it may be carryed on.</p>

Not to go over these Duties in particular, nor to shew wherein their especial Efficacy unto this End and Purpose doth consist, I shall only give some general <hi>Rules</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Exercising of our Souls in them, and some Directions for their right performance.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>28</label>(1) All these Dutyes are to be designed and mannaged with an especial <hi>Respect unto this End.</hi> It will not suffice that we are Exercised in them in general, and with regard only unto this general End. We are to apply them unto this particular Case, designing in and by them the Mortification and Ruine of sin. Especially, when by its especial Actings in us, it discovers it self in a <hi>peculiar Manner</hi> unto us. No man who wisely considereth himself, his State and Condition, his
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:48389:251"/> Occasions and Temptations, can be wholly ignorant of his especial Corruptions and Inclinations, whereby he is ready for <hi>halting,</hi> as the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks. He that is so, lives in the dark to himself, and walks at <hi>peradventures</hi> with God, not knowing how he walketh, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goeth. <hi>David</hi> probably had respect hereunto, when he said,
<hi>I have kept the Wayes of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God; for all his Judgments were before me, and I did not put away his Statutes from me. I was also upright before him, and I kept my self from mine Iniquity, Psal.</hi> 18. 21, 22, 23. He could have done nothing of all this, nor have preserved his Integrity in walking with God, had he not known, and kept a continual Watch upon his <hi>own Iniquity,</hi> or that working of Sin in him which most peculiarly inclined and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him unto Evil. Upon this Discovery are we to apply these <hi>Dutyes</hi> in a particular Manner to the weakening and Ruine of the Power of Sin. And as they are all usefull and Necessary, so the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of our Condition will direct us, which of them in particular we ought to be most conversant in. Sometimes <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Meditation</hi> claim this place, as when our Danger ariseth solely from our <hi>selves,</hi> and our own perverse Inclinations, disorderly Affections, or unruly Passions; sometimes
<hi>Watchfulness</hi> and <hi>Abstinence,</hi> when Sin takes Occasion from Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Concerns and Businesses in the World; sometimes <hi>Wisdom</hi> and
<hi>Circumspection,</hi> when the Avoydance of Temptations and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for sin, is in an especial manner required of us. These Dutyes I say, are to be managed with a peculiar design to oppose, defeat and destroy the Power of sin, into which they have a powerfull Influence as designed of God unto that End. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>29</label>(2) All these Duties <hi>rightly improved,</hi> work two wayes towards the End designed. 1. <hi>Morally,</hi> and by way of <hi>Impetration,</hi> namely, of Help and Assistance: 2. <hi>Really,</hi> by an immediate Opposition unto Sin and its Power, whence Assimulation unto Holiness doth arise.</p>
               <p>(First,) These Duties work <hi>Morally,</hi> and by way of <hi>Impetration.</hi> I shall instance only in one of them, and that is <hi>Prayer.</hi> There are two parts of <hi>Prayer</hi> with respect unto Sin and its Power. (1) <hi>Complaints:</hi> (2) <hi>Petitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Complaint.</hi> So is the Title of <hi>Psal. 102. The Prayer of the Afflicted when he is overwhelmed, and powreth out his Complaint before the Lord.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> expresseth himself, <hi>Psal. 55. 2. Attend unto me, and hear me, I mourn in my Complaint, and make a Noyse.</hi> His Prayer was a Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lamentation. And <hi>Psal. 142. 2. I powred out my Complaint before him, I shewed before him my trouble.</hi> This is the first Work of Prayer, with respect unto Sin, its Power and Prevalency. The Soul therein pours out its <hi>Complaints</hi> unto God, and sheweth before him the trouble it undergoes on the Account thereof. And this it doth in an humble Acknowledgement of its Guilt, crying out of its Deceit and Violence. For all just and due <hi>Complaint</hi> respecteth that which is <hi>grievous,</hi> and which is beyond the Power of the Complainer to relieve himself against. Of this sort there is nothing to be compared with the <hi>Power</hi> of Sin, as to Believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>30</label> This therefore is and ought to be the <hi>principal</hi> Matter and Subject
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:48389:251"/> of their <hi>Complaints</hi> in Prayer. Yea, the very <hi>Nature</hi> of the whole Case is such, as that the Apostle could not give an Account of it without great <hi>Complaints, Rom.</hi> 7. 24. This part of Prayer indeed is with profligate Persons derided and scorned, but it is acceptable with God, and that wherein Believers find Ease and Rest unto their Souls. For, let the World scoffe while it pleaseth, what is more acceptable unto God, than for his Children, out of pure Love unto him and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, out of fervent Desires to comply with his Mind and Will, and thereby to attain Conformity unto Jesus Christ, to come with their
<hi>Complaints</hi> unto him, of the <hi>Distance</hi> they are kept from these things by the captivating Power of sins, bewailing their frail Condition, and humbly acknowledging all the Evils that they are liable unto upon the Account thereof? Would any man have thought it possible, had not Experience convinced him, that so much <hi>Luciferian Pride</hi> and
<hi>Atheisme</hi> should possess the Minds o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thy who would be esteemed Christians, as to <hi>scoffe</hi> at and <hi>deride</hi> these things? that any one should ever read the Bible, or once consider what he is, and with whom he hath to doe, and to be ignorant of this Duty? But we have nothing to do with such Persons, but to leave them to please themselves whilest they may, with these fond and impious Imaginations. They will come either in this World, (which we hope and pray for) in their <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> to know their Folly, or in another. I say, these <hi>Complaints</hi> of sin, powred out before the Lord, these Cryings out of Deceit and Violence, are acceptable to God, and prevalent with him to give out
<hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Assistance.</hi> He owns Believers as his Children, and hath the Bowels and Compassion of a Father towards them; Sin he knowes to be their greatest Enemy, and which fights directly against their Souls. Will he then despise their Complaints, and their bemoaning of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before him? will he not <hi>avenge</hi> them of that Enemy, and that speedily? See <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 18, 19, 20. Men who think they have no other Enemies, none to complain of, but such as oppose them, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them, or oppress them in their Secular Interests, Advantages and Concerns, are <hi>strangers</hi> unto these things. <hi>Believers</hi> look on <hi>sin</hi> as their greatest Adversary, and know that they suffer more from it than from all the World: Suffer them therefore to make their Complaints of it unto him who pities them, who will <hi>relieve</hi> them and <hi>avenge</hi> them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>31</label> 2. Prayer is directly <hi>Petitions</hi> to this purpose; it consists of Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto God, for supplyes of Grace to conflict and conquer Sin withall. I need not prove this; No man Prayes as he ought, no man joyns in Prayer with another who prayes as he ought, but these <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions</hi> are a part of his Prayer. Especially will they be so, and ought they so to be, when the Mind is peculiarly engaged in the Design of
<hi>destroying sin.</hi> And these <hi>Petitions</hi> or Requests are, as far as they are
<hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>effectual,</hi> wrought in us by the Holy Ghost, who therein maketh <hi>intercession for us</hi> according <hi>to the Will of God.</hi> And hereby doth he carry on this work of the <hi>Mortification of sin,</hi> for his Work it is. He makes us to put up prevalent Requests unto God, for such continual supplyes of Grace, whereby it may be constantly kept under, and at length <hi>destroyed.</hi> And this is the <hi>first way</hi> whereby this Duty hath an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into <hi>Mortification,</hi> namely, <hi>Morally</hi> and by way of <hi>Impetration.</hi>

                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:48389:252"/> (Secondly,) This Duty hath <hi>a real Efficiency</hi> unto the same End. It doth its self (when rightly performed, and duly attended unto) mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail unto the weakning and Destruction of sin. For in and by
<hi>fervent Prayer,</hi> especially when it is designed unto this End, the Habit, Frame, and Inclinations of the Soul unto universal Holiness, with a Detestation of all sin, are increased, cherished, and strengthened. The soul of a Believer is never raised unto a higher Intension of spirit in the pursuit of, love unto, and delight in Holiness, nor is more conformed unto it, or cast into the mould of it, than it is in Prayer. And frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in this Duty, is a principal means to fix and consolidate the mind in the form and likeness of it; And hence doe Believers oft-times conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in, and come off from Prayer above all <hi>Impressions</hi> from sin, as to
<hi>Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Complyances.</hi> Would such a frame alwayes continue, how happy were we. But abiding in the Duty is the best way of reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out after it. I say therefore that this Duty is really <hi>Efficient</hi> of the
<hi>Mortification</hi> of sin, because therein all the Graces whereby it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and weakened, are excited, exercised, and improved unto that End; as also the Detestation and Abhorency of sin is increased in us. And where this is not so, there are some secret flaws in the Prayers of men, which it will be their wisdom to find out and heal.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Holy Spirit carrieth on this work by applying in an especial manner the <hi>death of Christ</hi> unto us for that end. And this is another, thing which, because the World understandeth not, it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise. But yet in whomsoever the Death of Christ is not the death of sin, he shall dye in his sins. To evidence this Truth, we may observe (1) in general, That the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> hath an especial <hi>influence</hi> into the <hi>Mortification</hi> of sin, without which it will not be <hi>Mortified.</hi> This is plainly enough testified unto in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> By his <hi>Cross,</hi> that is, his <hi>Death</hi> on the <hi>Cross, We are crucified unto the world, Gal. 6. 14. Our old man is crucified with him, that the Body of sin might be destroyed, Rom.</hi> 6. 6. That is, sin is <hi>Mortified</hi> in us by vertue of the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ, (2) In the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> with respect unto sin there may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, 1. His <hi>Oblation</hi> of himself, and 2. The <hi>Application</hi> thereof unto us. By the <hi>first</hi> it is, that our sins are expiated as unto their Guilt; but from the <hi>latter</hi> it is, that they are actually subdued as to their Power. For it is by an Interest in, and a participation of the Benefits of his Death, which we call the Application of it unto us. Hereon are we said to <hi>be buried</hi> with him, and <hi>to rise with him,</hi> whereof our Baptism is a pledge; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. not in an outward Representation, as some imagine of being <hi>dipped under the water,</hi> and taken up again (which were to make one <hi>sign</hi> the <hi>sign</hi> of another,) but in a powerful Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the vertue of the Death and Life of Christ, in a death unto sin, and newness of life in Holy Obedience, which Baptisme is a pledge of, as it is a token of our initiation and implanting into him. So are we said to be <hi>baptized into his death;</hi> or into the likeness of it, that is, into its power, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. (3) The <hi>old man</hi> is said to <hi>be crucified with Christ,</hi> or sin to be Mortified by the Death of Christ, as was in part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore observed on two Accounts.</p>
               <p>(1) Of <hi>Conformity.</hi> Christ is the Head, the Beginning or <hi>Idea,</hi> of
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:48389:252"/> the New Creation; The first born of every Creature. Whatever God designeth unto us therein, he first exemplified in Jesus Christ; And we are predestinated to be conformed to the Image of his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. Hereof the Apostle gives us an express instance in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Christ the first Fruits, afterwards they that are Christs at his coming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 23. It is so in all things; all that is wrought in us, it is in resemblance and conformity unto Christ. Particularly, we are by Grace <hi>planted into the likeness of his Death, Rom.</hi> 6. 5. being <hi>made conformable unto his Death, Phil.</hi> 3. 10. and so to be <hi>dead with Christ, Col.</hi> 2. 20. Now this conformity is not in our <hi>Natural</hi> Death, nor in our being <hi>put to death</hi> as he was; for it is that which we are made partakers of in this Life, and that in a way of Grace and Mercy. But Christ died for sin, for our sin, which was the meritorious procuring cause thereof. And he lived again by the Power of God. A likeness and conformity hereunto God will work in all Believers. There is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Life of sin in them, as hath been declared. This Life must be destroyed, sin must dye in us, and we thereby become dead unto sin. And as he <hi>rose again;</hi> So are we to be <hi>quickened</hi> in and unto newness of life. In this death of sin consists that <hi>Mortification</hi> which we treat about; and without which we cannot be <hi>conformed unto Christ in his Death,</hi> which we are designed unto. And the same Spirit which wrought these things in Christ, will in the pursuit of his Design, work that which answers unto them in all his Members.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>34</label>(2) In respect of <hi>Efficacy;</hi> vertue goeth forth from the Death of
<hi>Christ,</hi> for the subduing and Destruction of sin. It was not designed to be a dead, unactive, <hi>passive Example,</hi> but it is accompanied with a Power conforming and changing us into its own likeness. It is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God unto that End, which he therefore gives efficacy unto. It is by a fellowship or participation in his sufferings, that we are made
<hi>conformable to his Death, Phil.</hi> 3. 10. this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in the Benefit of his suffering; we also are made partakers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This makes us conformable to his Death, in the Death of sin in us. The Death of Christ is designed to be the Death of sin; let them who are dead in sin deride it whilest they please. If <hi>Christ</hi> had not dyed, sin had never dyed in any sinner unto Eternity. Wherefore that there is a vertue and Efficacy in the Death of <hi>Christ</hi> unto this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, cannot be denyed without a Renuntiation of all the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits thereof. On the one hand the Scripture tells us, that he is <hi>our Life,</hi> our <hi>Spiritual Life,</hi> the Spring, Fountain, and Cause of it; we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therefore that belongs thereunto but what is derived from him. They cast themselves out of the verge of Christianity, who suppose that the Lord Christ is no otherwise our Life, or the Authour of Life unto us, but as he hath revealed and taught the way of Life unto us; He is our Life as he is our Head. And it would be a sorry Head that should onely <hi>teach the feet to go,</hi> and not communicate strength to the whole Body so to doe. And that we have real influences of Life from Christ, I have sufficiently proved before. Unto our spiritual Life doth ensue the Death of sin; for this on the other hand is peculiarly assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto his Death in the Testimonies before produced. This therefore is by vertue derived from <hi>Christ,</hi> That is, in an especial manner from his Death, as the Scripture testifies.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>35</label>
                  <hi>All the Enquiry is,</hi> How the Death of Christ is applyed unto us, <hi>or which is the same,</hi> How we apply our selves to the Death of Christ for this purpose. <hi>And I answer, We do it two wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1) By <hi>Faith.</hi> The way to derive Vertue from Christ, is by <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him.</hi> So the <hi>diseased Woman</hi> in the Gospel touched but the Hemme of his Garment, and Vertue <hi>went forth from him to stay her Bloody Issue, Math.</hi> 9. 22. It was not her Touching him <hi>outwardly,</hi> but her <hi>Faith</hi> which she acted then and thereby, that derived Vertue from him. For so our Saviour tells her in his Answer, <hi>Daughter be of good Comfort, thy Faith hath made thee whole.</hi> But unto what End was this <hi>touching of his Garment?</hi> It was only a Pledge and Token of the particular Application of the <hi>healing</hi> Power of Christ unto her Soul, or her Faith in him in particular for that End. For at the same time many thronged upon him in a presse, so as his Disciples marvelled he should ask <hi>who touched his Cloaths; Mark</hi> 5. 30, 31. yet was not any of them advantaged but the poor sick Woman. A great <hi>Emblem</hi> it is of <hi>common Profession</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>especial Faith</hi> on the other. Multitudes presse and throng about Christ in a Profession of Faith and Obedience, and in the real performance of many Duties; but no Vertue goeth forth from Christ to <hi>heal</hi> them. But when any one, though poor, though seemingly at a distance, gets but the least touch of him by <hi>especial Faith,</hi> this Soul is healed. This is our Way with respect unto the Mortification of Sin. The <hi>Scripture</hi> assures us, that there is Vertue and Efficacy in the Death of Christ unto that End. The Means whereby we derive this Vertue from him, is by
<hi>Touching of him,</hi> that is, by Acting <hi>Faith</hi> on him in his Death, for the Death of Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>36</label> But how will this effect it, how will <hi>sin</hi> be mortified hereby? I say,
<hi>how,</hi> by what Power and Vertue were they healed in the Wilderness, who looked unto the <hi>Brazen Serpent?</hi> was it not because that was an Ordinance of God, which by his Almighty Power he made effectual unto that purpose? The <hi>Death</hi> of Christ being so as to the Crucifying of sin, when it is looked on, or applyed unto by <hi>Faith,</hi> shall not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vertue and Power go forth unto that End? The <hi>Scripture,</hi> and Experience of all Believers, give Testimony unto the Truth and Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof. Besides, <hi>Faith</hi> it self as acted on the Death of Christ, hath a <hi>peculiar</hi> Efficacy unto the subduing of sin; for, beholding him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as in <hi>a Glass, we are changed into the same Image; 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 18. And that which we peculiarly behold, we are peculiarly transformed into the Likeness of. And moreover, it is the only Means whereby we Actually derive from Christ the Benefits of <hi>our Vnion</hi> with him; from thence we have all Grace, or, there is no such thing in the World. And the Communication of it unto us, is in and by the Actual Exercise of <hi>Faith</hi> principally. So it being acted with respect unto his Death, we have Grace for the Killing of sin, and thereby become dead with him, Crucified with him, Buryed with him, as in the Testimonies before produced. This is that which we call, the
<hi>Application of the Death of Christ unto us,</hi> or our Application of our selves to the Death of Christ for the Mortification of sin. And they
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:48389:253"/> by whom this Means thereof is despised or neglected, who are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it, or do Blaspheme it, must live under the Power of sin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what Inventions soever they turn themselves for Deliverance. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we abide and abound herein, will be our success. Those who are careless and remiss, in the Exercise of Faith, by <hi>Prayer</hi> and
<hi>Meditation,</hi> in the Way described, will find that <hi>Sin</hi> will keep its ground, and maintain so much Power in them as shall issue in their perpetual Trouble. And men who are much conversant with the Death of Christ, not in Notions and Lifeless Speculations, not in Natural or Carnal Affections, like those which are raised in weak Persons by <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Crucifixes,</hi> but by holy Actings of <hi>Faith,</hi> with respect unto what is declared in the Scripture as to its Power and Efficacy, will be implanted into the Likeness of it, and experience the Death of sin in them continually.</p>

And this is doth by proposing unto our Faith, the Grace, the Love, the Patience, the Condescension, the Obedience, the End and Design of Christ therein. So is Christ eyed by
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:48389:254"/> Faith as the proper Object of sincere Love. And being so stated, the Effects of it, as of all true Love, are, 1. <hi>Adherence; 2. Assimulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1) <hi>Adherence;</hi> Love in the Scripture is frequently expressed by this Effect; The Soul of one did <hi>cleave</hi> or was <hi>knit</hi> unto another; as that of <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David, 1 Sam.</hi> 18. 1. So it produceth a firm Adherence unto Christ crucified, that makes a Soul to be in some sence alwayes present with Christ on the Cross. And hence (2) ensues <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation</hi> or Conformity. None treat of the Nature or Effects of Love, but they assign this as one of them, that it begets a Likeness between the <hi>Mind</hi> loving, and the <hi>Object</hi> beloved. And so I am sure it is in this matter. A Mind filled with the Love of Christ as <hi>crucified,</hi> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the Manner and Way before described, will be changed into its <hi>Image</hi> and Likeness, by the effectual Mortification of sin, through a Derivation of Power and Grace from thence for that purpose.</p>

                  <hi>Fifthly;</hi> The Holy Ghost carryeth on this Work by constant Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries unto, and pressing on Believers, on the one hand, the <hi>true Nature</hi> and <hi>certain End</hi> of Sin; and on the other, the <hi>Beauty, Excellency, Vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> of Holiness, with the Concerns of God, Christ, the Gospel, and their own Souls therein. A Rational Consideration of these things, is all the Ground and Reason of <hi>Mortification</hi> in the Judgements of some men. But we have proved, that there are other Causes of it also. And now I adde, that if we have no Consideration of these things, but what our own Reason is of it self able to suggest unto us, it will never be prevalent unto any <hi>sincere</hi> or <hi>permanent</hi> Attempt in the <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of any <hi>sin</hi> whatever. Let men make the best of their Reason they can, in the <hi>searching</hi> and Consideration of the perverse Nature and dreadfull Consequents of <hi>Sin,</hi> of the perfect Peace and future Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which attendeth the Practice of <hi>Holiness,</hi> they will find an Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and Stubbornness in their Hearts, not conquerable by any such Reasonings or Considerations: That <hi>Conviction</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> which is usefull and prevalent unto that End and Purpose, is wrought in us by the Holy Ghost, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 18. Although he makes use of our Minds, Understandings, Reasons, Consciences, and the best of our Consideration in this matter, yet if he give not a <hi>peculiar Efficacy</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> unto all, the Work will not be <hi>effectual.</hi> When he is pleased to make use of Reasons and Motives taken from the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of Sin and Holiness, unto the <hi>Mortification of sin,</hi> they shall hold good, and bind the Soul unto this Duty, against all Objections and Temptations that would divert it whatever.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Necessity of Holiness from the Consideration of the Nature of God.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>(1) The Necessity of Evangelical Holiness owned by all Christians: Doctrines falsely charged with an Inconsistency with it. (2) Though owned by all, yet practised by few, and disadvantageously pleaded for by many; the true Nature of it briefly expressed. (3) First Argument for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Holiness from the Nature of God; frequently proposed unto our Consideration for that End. (4) This Argument Cogent and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; pressed with its Limitation. (5) Not the Nature of God absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but as he is in Christ, the Foundation of this Necessity, and a most Effectual Motive unto the same End; the Nature and Efficacy of that Motive declared. (10) The Argument enforced, from the Consideration of our Conformity unto God by Holiness; with that Communion and Likeness with him which depend thereon; (13) With our future everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enjoyment of him. (14) True force of that Consideration vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Merit rejected, (15) And the Substitution of Morality in the Room of Gospel Holiness. (16) False Accusations of the Doctrine of Grace, discarded; and (17) The Neglect of the true Means of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gospel Obedience, charged. (18, 19.) The principal Argument far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enforced, from the Preeminence of our Natures and Persons by this Conformity to God; (21) And our Accesses unto God thereby, in order unto our eternal Enjoyment of him: (22) As it also alone renders us usefull in this World unto others. (23) Two sorts of Graces, by whose Exercise we grow into Conformity with God; (24) Those that are Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating, as Faith, and (26) Love; And (28) those which are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative of that Assimulation; as Goodness or Benignity, and (31) Truth. (32) An Objection against the Necessity of Holiness from the Freedom and Efficacy of Grace, answered.</p>

And for our Encouragement in this part of our Work, this <hi>Necessity</hi> is such,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:48389:255"/> as that it is by all sorts of Christians allowed, pleaded for, and the thing it self pretended unto. For, whereas the Gospel is <hi>eminently,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 3. Tit. 1. 1. The Truth or Doctrine which is according unto Godliness,</hi> or that which is designed and every way suited unto the <hi>attaining, furtherance</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of it, no men can with Modesty refuse the Tryal of their Doctrines by their Tendency thereunto. But what is of that <hi>Nature,</hi> or what is an
<hi>Hinderance</hi> thereunto, that many are not yet agreed about. The <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> contend, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Satisfaction of Christ</hi> doth overthrow the <hi>Necessity</hi> of an Holy Life. The <hi>Papists</hi> say the same, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Imputation of the <hi>Righteousness of Christ</hi> unto our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The same Charge is laid by others against the Doctrine of the
<hi>gratuitous Election of God,</hi> the almighty <hi>Efficacy</hi> of his <hi>Grace</hi> in the Conversion of <hi>Sinners,</hi> and of his <hi>Faithfulness</hi> in the Preservation of true <hi>Believers</hi> in their state of Grace unto the End: On the other hand, the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth so place the Foundations of all <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real Holiness</hi> in these things, that without the Faith of them, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on our Minds from them, it will not allow of any thing to be so called.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> To examine the <hi>pretences</hi> of others concerning the <hi>suitableness</hi> of their Doctrines unto the Promotion of Holiness, is not my present Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. It is well that it hath alwayes maintained a Conviction of its
<hi>Necessity,</hi> and carryed it through all different Perswasions in Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In this one thing alone almost, do all Christian agree; and yet notwithstanding, the <hi>want</hi> of it, is, if not the <hi>onely</hi> yet the <hi>principal</hi> thing, whereby the most who are so called, are ruined. So ordinary a thing is it, for men to agree for the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness,</hi> and live in the <hi>Neglect</hi> of it, when they have so done. <hi>Conviction</hi> comes in at an easie rate, as it were whether men will or no, but <hi>Practice</hi> will stand them in pains, cost and trouble. Wherefore, unto the due handling of this matter, some few things must be premised. As,</p>
               <p>(First,) It is <hi>disadvantageous</hi> unto the Interest of the Gospel, to have men plead for <hi>Holiness</hi> with weak incogent Arguments, and such as are not taken out of the Stores of its <hi>Truth,</hi> and so really affect not the Consciences of men. And it is <hi>pernicious</hi> to all the Concerns of Holiness it self, to have that defended and pleaded for, under its Name and Title, which indeed is not so, but an <hi>Vsurper</hi> of its Crown and Dignity; which we shall afterwards enquire into.</p>
               <p>(Secondly,) It is <hi>uncomely</hi> and unworthy, to hear men <hi>contending for Holiness,</hi> as the <hi>whole</hi> of our Religion, and in the mean time on all Occasions, express in themselves an <hi>Habit</hi> and Frame of Mind utterly inconsistent with what the <hi>Scripture</hi> so calls, and so esteems. There is certainly no readier way on sundry Accounts to unteach men all the Principles of Religion, all Respect unto God and common Honesty. And if some men did this only, as being at variance with themselves, without Reflections on others, it might the more easily be borne. But to see or hear men proclaiming themselves in their whole Course, to be Proud, Revengefull, Worldly, Sensual, Neglecters of Holy Dutyes, Scoffers at Religion, and the Power of it, pleading for an <hi>Holy Life,</hi> against the Doctrine and Practice of those who walked unblameably
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:48389:255"/> before the Lord in all his Wayes, yea upon whose <hi>Breasts and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads</hi> was written <hi>Holiness unto the Lord,</hi> such as were most of the
<hi>first Reformed Divines,</hi> whom they reflect upon, is a thing which all sober men do justly <hi>nauseate,</hi> and which God <hi>abhorres.</hi> But the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Consideration here of I shal at present omit, and pursue what I have proposed.</p>
               <p>(Thirdly,) In my Discourse concerning the <hi>Necessity</hi> of Holiness, with the Grounds and Reasons of it, and Arguments for it, I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my self unto these two Things.</p>
               <p>(1) That the Reasons, Arguments and Motives which I shall insist on, being such as are taken out of the Gospel, or the Scripture, are not only consistent and compliant with the great Doctrines of the <hi>Grace of God</hi> in our free Election, Conversion, Justification, and Salvation by Jesus Christ, but such as <hi>naturally flow</hi> from them, discover what is their true Nature and Tendency in this matter.</p>
               <p>(2) That I shall at present suppose all along, what <hi>that Holiness</hi> is which I do intend. Now this is not that <hi>outward</hi> Shew and pretence of it, which some plead for; not an Attendance unto, or the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>some</hi> or all <hi>Moral Vertues</hi> only; not a Readiness for some <hi>Acts of Piety and Charity,</hi> from a superstitious proud Conceit of their being
<hi>Meritorious</hi> of Grace or Glory. But I intend that <hi>Holiness</hi> which I have before described, which may be reduced to these three heads: (1) An <hi>internal Change</hi> or Renovation of our Souls, our Minds, Wills and Affections by Grace. (2) An <hi>universal Compliance</hi> with the Will of God in all Duties of Obedience, and Abstinence from Sin, out of a Principle of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> (3) A <hi>Designation</hi> of all the <hi>Actions of Life</hi> unto the Glory of God by Jesus Christ, according to the Gospel: This is <hi>Holiness;</hi> so to be, and so to doe, is to be Holy. And I shall divide my Arguments into Two sorts: 1. Such as prove the <hi>Necessity</hi> of Holiness as to the <hi>Essence</hi> of it, Holiness in our Hearts and Natures; 2. Such as prove the <hi>Necessity</hi> of Holiness as to the <hi>Degrees</hi> of it, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in our Lives and Conversations.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> First then; <hi>The Nature of God</hi> as revealed unto us, with our Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him, the Obligation that is upon us to Live unto him, with the Nature of our Blessedness in the Enjoyment of him, do require indispensibly that we should be <hi>Holy.</hi> The <hi>Holiness of Gods Nature</hi> is every where in the Scripture made the Fundamental Principle and Reason of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of Holiness in us. Himself makes it the <hi>ground</hi> of his Command for it, <hi>Levit. 11. 44. For I am the Lord your God, ye shall therefore sanctifie your selves, and ye shall be Holy, for I am Holy.</hi> So also <hi>Chap. 19. 2. Chap.</hi> 20. 7. And to shew the everlasting Equity and Force of this Reason, it is transferred over to the Gospel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15, 16. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of Conversation, because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> God lets them know, that his Nature is such, as that unless they are sanctified and Holy, there can be no such Entercourse between him and them as ought to be between a <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>People.</hi> So he declares the Sence of this Enforcement of that Precept to be, <hi>Levit. 11. 45. I brought you out of the Land of Aegypt to be your God, ye shall therefore be Holy, for I am Holy.</hi> Without this, the Relation designed cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:48389:256"/> that I should be <hi>your</hi> God and you should be <hi>my</hi> People. To this Purpose belongs that Description given us of his Nature, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 6. <hi>For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in Wickedness, neither shall Evil dwell with thee. The Foolish shall not stand in thy sight, thou hatest all Workers of Iniquity. Thou shalt destroy them that speak Lying, the Lord will abhorre the Bloody and Deceitfull man.</hi> Answerable unto that of the Prophet; <hi>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and canst not look on Iniquity, Hab.</hi> 1. 13. He is such a God, that is, such is his Nature, so pure, so holy, that previous to the Consideration of any free Acts of his Will, it is evident, that he can take no pleasure in <hi>Fools, Lyars,</hi> or <hi>Workers</hi> of <hi>Iniquity.</hi> Therefore <hi>Joshua</hi> tells the People, that if they continued in their <hi>sins,</hi> they could not serve the Lord, for he is an <hi>Holy God, Chap.</hi> 24. 19. All the Service of <hi>unholy</hi> Persons towards this God, is utterly lost and cast away, because it is inconsistent with his own Holiness to accept of it. And our Apostle argues in the same Manner, <hi>Heb. 12. 28, 29. Let us have Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may serve God acceptably, with Reverence and Godly Fear. For our God is a consuming Fire.</hi> He layes his Argument for the <hi>Necessity</hi> of Grace and Holiness in the <hi>Worship</hi> of God, from the Consideration of the <hi>Holiness</hi> of his <hi>Nature,</hi> which as a <hi>consuming fire</hi> will devour that which is unsuited unto it, inconsistent with it. There would be no end of pursuing this Reason of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of Holiness, in all places where it is proposed expressely in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> I shall only adde in General, that God of Old strictly required, that no <hi>unholy,</hi> no <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> no <hi>defiling</hi> thing should be in the Camp of his People, because of his <hi>presence</hi> among them who is himself <hi>holy,</hi> and without an exact Observance hereof he declares, that he will depart and leave them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> If we had no other Argument to prove the <hi>Necessity of Holiness,</hi> and that it is indispensibly required of us, but only this, that the God whom we serve and worship is absolutely <hi>Holy,</hi> that his Being and Nature is such, as that he can have no delightful Entercourse with any that are
<hi>unholy,</hi> it were abundantly sufficient unto our purpose. He who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth not to be Holy, had best seek another God to worship and serve, with our God he will never find Acceptance. And therefore the Heathen, who gave up themselves unto all filthiness with delight and greediness, to stifle the Notions of a <hi>Divine Being,</hi> that they might not controll them in their Sins and Pleasures, fancied such gods to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as were <hi>wicked and unclean,</hi> that they might freely conform unto them, and serve them with satisfaction. And God himself lets us know, that men of wicked and <hi>flagitious</hi> lives, have some secret thoughts that he is not <hi>Holy,</hi> but like themselves, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. For if they had not, they could not avoid it, but they must either think of leaving him or their sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> But we must yet further observe some things to evidence the Force of this Argument. As (<hi>First,</hi>) That unto us, in our present State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the <hi>Holiness of God</hi> as absolutely considered, merely as an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Eternal Property of the Divine Nature, is not the immediate Ground of, and Motive unto Holiness, but it is the <hi>Holiness of God</hi> as <hi>manifested</hi> and <hi>revealed</hi> unto us in <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> Under the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:48389:256"/> we who are sinners can make on <hi>Conclusion</hi> from it, but that of <hi>Joshua, He is an Holy God, a Jealous God, he will not forgive their Iniquities, nor spare.</hi> This we may learn indeed from thence, that nothing which is <hi>unholy</hi> can possibly subsist before him, or find Acceptance with him. But a <hi>Motive</hi> and <hi>Encouragment</hi> unto any <hi>Holiness</hi> that is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<hi>Perfect,</hi> no Creature can take from the Consideration thereof. And we doe not, we ought not to urge any such Argument for the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness,</hi> as cannot be answered and complyed wit by the Grace of God as to the Substance, though we come short in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it. My meaning is, that no Argument can be rationally and usefully pleaded for the Necessity of <hi>Holiness,</hi> which doth not contain in its self an Encouraging Motive unto it. To declare it necessary for us, and at the same time impossible unto us, is not to promote its Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. They understand neither the <hi>Holiness</hi> of <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>man,</hi> who suppose that they are absolutely and immediately suited unto one another, or that under that <hi>Notion</hi> of it, we can take any <hi>encouraging Motive</hi> unto our Duty herein. Nay no Creature is capable of such a <hi>Perfection in Holiness,</hi> as absolutely to Answer the <hi>Infinite Purity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> without a <hi>Covenant-Condescention, Job 4. 18. chap.</hi> 15. 15. But it is the
<hi>Holiness</hi> of God as he <hi>is in Christ,</hi> and as in Christ represented unto us, that gives us both the <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Motive</hi> unto ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> Wherefore, God in dealing with his people of Old in this matter, did not propose unto them to this End the Absolute Perfection of his own Nature, but his being <hi>Holy, as he dwelt among them,</hi> and <hi>was their God,</hi> that is in Covenant, both which had respect unto Jesus Christ. In him all the glorious Perfections of God are so represented unto us, as we may not thence onely <hi>learn</hi> our Duty, but also be <hi>incouraged</hi> unto it. For,</p>
               <p>(1) All the <hi>Properties</hi> of God as so represented unto us, are more
<hi>Conspicuous, Resplendent, Alluring</hi> and <hi>Attractive,</hi> than as <hi>Absolutely</hi> considered. I know not what Light into, and Knowledge of the <hi>Divine Perfections, Adam</hi> had in his state of Innocency, when God had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself onely in the Works of Nature; Sufficient no doubt it was to guide him in his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> or that Life which he was to live unto him. But I know that now, all our knowledge of God and his Properties, unless it be that which we have in and by Jesus Christ, is insufficient to lead or conduct us in that Life of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> which is necessary unto us. He therefore gives us the <hi>Light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Glory in the face of Jesus Christ, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 6. That is, clear
<hi>Manifestations</hi> of his <hi>Glorious Excellencies.</hi> The <hi>light of the knowledge</hi> hereof is a clear, useful, saving Perception and understanding of them. And this is not onely <hi>Directive</hi> unto <hi>Holiness,</hi> but also <hi>Effective</hi> of it. For thus beholding the Glory of the Lord, we are <hi>changed into the same Image,</hi> from <hi>Glory to Glory, Chap.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <p>(2) In particular. The <hi>Fiery Holiness of God,</hi> is represented unto us in Christ, so, as that although it lose nothing of declaring the indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Necessity of <hi>Holiness</hi> in all that draw nigh to him, yet under such a <hi>Contemperation</hi> with <hi>Goodnesse, Grace, Love, Mercy, Condescension,</hi> as may invite and encourage us to endeavour after a <hi>Conformity</hi> thereunto.</p>

As was observed before, the Consideration of it absolutely neither requires nor admitts of any but that which is <hi>absolutely perfect,</hi> and where there is any one failing, the whole of what we doe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,

This therefore can only perplex and torture the Soul of a sinner, by pressing on him at the same time the Necessity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of Holiness, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 14. But now as <hi>God</hi> is in Christ, through his Interposition and Meditation, he accepts of such an <hi>Holiness</hi> in us, as we are capable of, and which no man hath any discouragement from endeavouring to attain.</p>

From this Fountain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we draw immediately as the Reasons of the Necessity, so prevalent Motives unto Holiness in our Souls. Hence some things may be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced. As (First,) That the Mediation of <hi>Christ,</hi> and in particular his Satisfaction, is so farre from being an Hinderance of, or a <hi>Discouragement</hi> unto <hi>Holiness,</hi> as some blasphemously pretend, that the great funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Reason of it in us, namely, the <hi>Holiness</hi> of God himself, can have no influence upon us, without the supposition of it and Faith in it; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Faith be built hereon, no sinner upon a view of Gods Holiness as absolutely considered, can have any other thoughts but those of <hi>Cain, My sin is great it cannot be pardoned.</hi> God is an Holy God, I cannot serve him, and therefore will depart out of his presence. But the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> of God as manifested in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> including a supposition of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> made unto what is required by its absolute <hi>Purity,</hi> and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention thereon to accept in him, that Holiness of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Sincerity</hi> which we are capable of, doth equally maintain the indispensible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of it, and encourage us unto it. And we may see what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Conclusions will be made on these different Considerations of it: Those who view it only in the first way, can come to no other issue in their thoughts but that which they express in the Prophet, <hi>Isa. 33. 14. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire, who among us shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit with everlasting burnings.</hi> God <hi>fiery Holiness</hi> serves towards them unto no other End but to fill them with terror and despair. But other Inferences are natural from the Consideration of the same <hi>Holiness,</hi> in the latter way. <hi>Our God,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is a consuming fire;</hi> what then, what follows as our Duty thereon? <hi>Let us have Grace whereby we may serve him acceptably with Reverence and Godly fear, Heb.</hi> 12. 28, 29. There is no such forcible Reason for, no such powerful Motive unto our <hi>Adherence</hi> unto him in <hi>Holy Obedience.</hi> Such different <hi>Conclusions</hi> will men make from these different Considerations of the <hi>Holiness</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> when once they come to be serious and in good earnest about them.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label>(Secondly,) It follows from hence also, that our <hi>Holiness</hi> under the
<hi>New Covenant,</hi> although it have the same general Nature and one <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal End</hi> with that which was required in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> yet
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:48389:257"/> as it hath an <hi>especial Spring</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> which that had not, and relates unto sundry <hi>Causes</hi> which the other had no concernment in, so it is not of the same <hi>especial use</hi> therewith. The immediate End and Use of that
<hi>Holiness</hi> in us, was to answer the <hi>Holiness</hi> of God <hi>absolutely</hi> as expressed in the Law, whereon we should have been Justified. This is now done for us by <hi>Christ</hi> alone, and the <hi>Holiness</hi> which God requireth of us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects onely those Ends which God hath proposed unto us, in Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his own <hi>Holiness,</hi> as he will Glorifie it in Jesus Christ; which must be afterwards declared.</p>
               <p>(<hi>Secondly,</hi>) We may consider in what particular <hi>Instances</hi> the Force of this Argument is conveyed unto us, or what are the especial Reasons why we ought to <hi>be Holy because God is so.</hi> And they are three.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label>(1) Because herein consists all that <hi>Conformity</hi> unto God, whereof in this World we are capable, which is our <hi>Priviledge, Preeminence, Glory</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi> We were Originally Created in the <hi>Image</hi> and
<hi>Likeness</hi> of God. Herein consisted the <hi>Priviledge, Preeminence, Order,</hi> and <hi>Blessedness</hi> of our first state; and that for the Substance of it, it was no other but our <hi>Holiness,</hi> is by all confessed. Wherefore, without this Conformity unto God, without the <hi>Impress</hi> of his <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> upon us, we do not, we cannot stand in that <hi>Relation</hi> unto God which was designed us in our Creation. This we lost by the Entrance of sin. And if there be not a way for us to acquire it again, if we do not so, we shall alwaies come short of the Glory of God, and of the End of our Creation. Now this is done in and by <hi>Holiness</hi> alone, for therein consists the <hi>Renovation</hi> of the <hi>Image</hi> of God in us, as our Apostle expressely declares, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24. with <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. It is therefore to no purpose for any man to expect an <hi>Interest</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> or any thing that will prove Eternally to his Advantage, who doth not endeavour after
<hi>Conformity</hi> unto him. For such a man despiseth all the <hi>Glory</hi> that <hi>God</hi> designed unto himself in our Creation, and all that was Eminent and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly bestowed upon our selves.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> He therefore whose Design is not to be <hi>like unto God,</hi> according to his Measure, and the Capacity of a Creature, alwayes misseth both of his <hi>End,</hi> his <hi>Rule,</hi> and his <hi>Way.</hi> Our Saviour would have his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to do all things so, as that they may be the <hi>Children of their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, Matth.</hi> 5. 45. that is, <hi>like him,</hi> representing him, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do their Father. And the truth is, if this Necessity of <hi>Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto God</hi> be once out of our View and Consideration, we are easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned aside by the meanest Temptation we meet withall. In brief, without that <hi>Likeness</hi> and Conformity unto God, which consists in
<hi>Holiness,</hi> as we do under his Eye bear the Image of his great Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary the <hi>Devil,</hi> so we can have no especial Interest in <hi>him,</hi> nor hath he any in <hi>us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) The Force of the Argument ariseth from the Respect it bears unto our Actual <hi>Entercourse</hi> and <hi>Communion with God:</hi> This we are
<hi>called</hi> unto, and this in all our Duties of Obedience we must endeavour to attain. If there be not in them a <hi>real Entercourse</hi> between God and our Souls, they are all but <hi>uncertain beatings of the Ayre.</hi> When we are Accepted in them, when God is Glorified by them, then have we in
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:48389:258"/> them this <hi>Entercourse</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with God. Now whereas God is <hi>Holy,</hi> if we are not in our Measure <hi>holy</hi> according to his Mind, this cannot be. For God neither <hi>accepts</hi> of any Duties from unholy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, nor is he <hi>glorified</hi> by them; and therefore as unto these Ends doth he expreslely reject and condemn them. It is a good Duty to
<hi>Preach the Word;</hi> But <hi>unto the Wicked God saith, What hast thou to doe to declare my Statutes, or that thou shouldest take my Covenant in thy mouth, seeing thou hatest Instruction, and castest my Words behind thee, Psal.</hi> 50. 16, 17. Seeing thou art <hi>unholy.</hi> To <hi>pray</hi> is a good Duty; But unto them that are not <hi>washed</hi> and made <hi>clean,</hi> and <hi>put not away the evil of their Doings from before</hi> his <hi>Eyes,</hi> saith God, <hi>When ye spread forth your hands I will hide mine Eyes from you, and when ye make many Prayers, I will not hear, Isa.</hi> 1. 15, 16. And the like may be said of all other Duties whatever.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> It is certain therefore, that whereas God is <hi>Holy,</hi> if we are not so, all the Duties which we design or intend to perform towards him, are everlastingly lost, as unto their <hi>proper Ends.</hi> For there is no Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course nor Communion between <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness: God is Light, and in him is no Darkness at all; and if we say, we have Fellowship with him, and walk in Darkness,</hi> as all unholy Persons doe, <hi>we lye, and doe not the truth; but if we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, we have Fellowship one with another; and truely our Fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Christ Jesus, 1 Joh. 1. 6, 7. v.</hi> 3. Now what man that shall consider this, unless he be infatuated, would for the Love of any one <hi>sin,</hi> or out of Conformity to the World, or any other thing, whereby the <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of Holiness is impeached, utterly lose and forfeit all the Benefit and Fruit of all those Duties wherein perhaps he hath laboured, and which he hath, it may be, been at no small <hi>charge</hi> withall. But yet this is the Condition of all men, who come short in any thing that is <hi>essentially necessary</hi> unto universal Holiness. All they doe, all they suffer, all the Pains they take in and about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duties, all their complyance with Convictions, and what they do therein <hi>within</hi> doors and <hi>without,</hi> is all lost, as unto the great Ends of the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and their own <hi>Eternal Blessedness,</hi> as sure as God is <hi>Holy.</hi>

This is out utmost <hi>End,</hi> which if we come short of, (<hi>Life</hi> it self is the greatest Loss) better ten thousand times we had never been. For without it, a Continuance in Everlasting Miseries is inseparable from our State and Condition. Now this is never attainable by any
<hi>unholy</hi> Person. <hi>Follow Holiness,</hi> saith our Apostle, <hi>without which no man shall see God. For it is the pure in Heart only</hi> that shall see God,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 8. It is hereby that we are <hi>made meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, Col.</hi> 1. 12. Neither can we attain it before we are thus made <hi>meet</hi> for it. No <hi>unclean</hi> thing, nothing that defileth or is defiled, shall ever be brought into the glorious Presence of this
<hi>Holy</hi> God. There is no Imagination wherewith Mankind is besotted, more foolish, none so pernicious as this, That Persons not <hi>purified,</hi> not
<hi>sanctified,</hi> not made <hi>holy</hi> in this Life, should afterwards be taken into
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:48389:258"/> that <hi>state of Blessedness</hi> which consists in the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of God. There can be no Thought more Reproachfull to his Glory, nor more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Nature of the things themselves. For neither can such Persons <hi>enjoy</hi> him, nor would God himself be a <hi>Reward</hi> unto them. They can have nothing whereby they should adhere unto him as their
<hi>chiefest Good,</hi> nor can see any thing in him that should give them Rest or Satisfaction; nor can there be any <hi>Medium</hi> whereby God should Communicate himself unto them, supposing them to contue thus <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy,</hi> as all must doe who depart out of this Life in that Condition. Holiness indeed is <hi>perfected</hi> in Heaven, but the <hi>Beginning</hi> of it is invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably and unalterably confined to this World; and where this fails, no hand shall be put unto that Work unto Eternity. All <hi>unholy</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons therefore who seed and refresh themselves with Hopes of Heaven and Eternity, doe it meerly on <hi>false</hi> Notions of God and Blessedness, whereby they deceive themselves. Heaven is a place where as well they <hi>would</hi> not be, as they <hi>cannot</hi> be; in it self it is neither desired by them, nor fit for them. <hi>He that hath this Hope indeed,</hi> that he shall see God, <hi>purifieth himself even as he is pure, 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 2. 3. There is therefore a manifold <hi>Necessity</hi> of Holiness impressed on us, from the Consideration of the <hi>Nature of that God</hi> whom we serve and hope to enjoy, which is <hi>Holy.</hi>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> I cannot pass over this Consideration, without making some especial
<hi>Improvement</hi> of it. We have seen how all our <hi>Concernment</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> in God both here and hereafter, do depend on our being <hi>Holy.</hi> They invented a very <hi>effectual</hi> Means for the Prejudicing, yea indeed a fatal Engine for the Ruine of true <hi>Holiness</hi> in the World, who built it on no other <hi>bottome,</hi> nor pressed it on any other <hi>motive,</hi> but that the Acts and Fruits of it were <hi>Meritorious</hi> in the sight of God. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be Believed and complyed withall or not, true <hi>Holiness</hi> is ruined, if no other more effectual Reason be substituted in its room. Reject this <hi>Motive,</hi> and there is no need of it; which I am perswaded hath really taken place in many, who being taught that <hi>good Deeds</hi> are not <hi>meritorious,</hi> have concluded them <hi>useless.</hi> Comply with it, and you destroy he <hi>Nature</hi> of true Holiness, and turn all the pretended Duties of it into Fruits and Effects of <hi>spiritual Pride</hi> and blind <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</hi> But we see the <hi>Necessity</hi> of it with respect unto God, hath other Foundations suited unto, and consistent with the Grace and Love and Mercy of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And we shall fully shew in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, that there is not one <hi>Motive</hi> unto it, that is of any real Force or Efficacy, but perfectly complyes with the whole Doctrine of the free undeserved <hi>Grace</hi> of God towards us by Jesus Christ; nor is there any of them which gives the least Countenance unto any thing of worth in our selves, as from our selves, or that should take us off from an absolute and universal Dependance on Christ for <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> But yet such they are, as render it as <hi>necessary</hi> unto us to be Holy, that is, to be <hi>sanctified,</hi> as to be Justified. He that thinks to please God, and to come to the Enjoyment of him without <hi>Holiness,</hi> makes him an <hi>unholy</hi> God, putting the highest Indignity and Dishonour imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable upon him. God deliver poor Sinners from this Deceit. There is no Remedy, you must leave <hi>your Sins,</hi> or <hi>your God.</hi> You may as easily
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:48389:259"/> reconcile <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> the one remaining Heaven and the other Hell, as easily take away all Difference between <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness, Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> as procure Acceptance for <hi>unholy</hi> Persons with <hi>our God.</hi> Some live without God in the World; whether they have any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Being</hi> or no, is not material: They live without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto him, either as unto his <hi>present</hi> Rule over them, or his <hi>future</hi> Disposal of them. It is no wonder if <hi>Holiness,</hi> both Name and Thing, be universally despised by these Persons; their Design being to serve their Lusts to the utmost, and immerse themselves in the Pleasures of the World, without once taking God into their Thoughts, they can do no otherwise. But for Men who live under some <hi>constant sense</hi> of God, and an eternal Accountableness unto him, and thereon do many things he requires, and abstain from many Sins that their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Opportunities would suggest and prompt them unto, not to endeavour after that <hi>universal Holiness</hi> which alone will be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, is a deplorable <hi>Folly.</hi> Such men seem to Worship an <hi>Idol</hi> all their dayes. For he that doth not endeavour to be <hi>like unto God,</hi> doth contrarily think wickedly that <hi>God is like</hi> unto himself. It is true, our Interest in God is not <hi>built upon</hi> our Holiness, but it is as true, that we have none <hi>without</hi> it. Were this Principle once well fixed in the Minds of men, that <hi>without Holiness no man shall see God,</hi> and that enforced from the Consideration of the <hi>Nature</hi> of God himself, it could not but influence them unto a greater Diligence about it, than the most seem to be engaged in.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> There is indeed amongst us a great Plea for <hi>Morality,</hi> or for <hi>Moral Vertue;</hi> I wish it be more out of Love to <hi>Vertue</hi> its <hi>self,</hi> and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of its <hi>Vsefulness,</hi> than out of a Design to cast Contempt on the
<hi>Grace</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as it is declared by the faithfull Dispensers of it. However, we are bound to believe the Best of all men. Where we see those who so plead for <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> to be in their own Persons, and in their Lives, <hi>modest, sober, humble, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, self-denying, charitable, usefull</hi> towards all, we are obliged to believe, that their Pleas for <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> proceed from a Love and Liking of it.

If these are the things which they intend, what is the matter with them? why are they so afraid of the <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Expressions</hi> of the Scripture? Why will they not speak of the things of God in Words that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> teacheth? Men never dislike the <hi>Words</hi> of God, but when they dislike the <hi>Things</hi> of God; Is it because these Expressions are not <hi>intelligible,</hi> People do not know what they mean, but this of <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand well enough? We appeal to the <hi>Experience</hi> of all that truely
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:48389:259"/> fear God in the World unto the contrary. There is none of them, but the Scripture Expressions of the <hi>Causes, Nature, Work</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of Holiness, do convey a clear <hi>experimental Apprehension</hi> of them unto their Minds: Whereas, by their <hi>Moral Vertue,</hi> neither themselves, nor any else, do know what they intend, since they do or must reject the common received Notion of it, for <hi>Honesty</hi> amongst men. If therefore they intend that <hi>Holiness</hi> hereby which is required of us in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that particularly on the Account of the <hi>Holiness of that God</hi> whom we serve, they fall into an high Contempt of the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, in despising of those Notices and Expressions of it, which being used by the Holy Ghost, are suited unto the <hi>spiritual Light</hi> and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of Believers; substituting their own arbitrary, doubtfull, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Sentiments and Words, in their Room and place. But if it be something else which they intend, as indeed (evidently it is, nor doth any man understand more in the Design, than <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Vsefulness</hi> in the World, things singularly <hi>good</hi> in their proper place) then it is no otherwise to be looked on, but as a Design of Sathan to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the <hi>true Holiness of the Gospel,</hi> and to substitute a deceitfull and deceiving Cloud or <hi>Shadow</hi> in the Room of it.</p>

But as this Supposition doth transform Believers into <hi>Monsters</hi> of Ingratitude and Folly, so it is built on no other Foundation than this, that if Christ take away the

For the present I shall return no other Answer unto those Objections, but that the Objectors are wholly mistaken in our Thoughts and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions concerning that God whom we serve. God in Christ whom we Worship, hath so revealed his own <hi>Holiness</hi> unto us, and what is

That the <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Mercy,</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> of this God, who is <hi>our God,</hi> should encourage those who indeed <hi>know</hi> him, unto Sin, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance them in a Neglect of <hi>Holy Obedience</hi> to him, is a <hi>monstrous</hi> Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.

                  </gap>, of the <hi>Divine Nature, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Such a new spiritual
<hi>Nature</hi> as represents that of God himself: Being <hi>begotten by him,</hi> we are made partakers of his <hi>Nature.</hi> But though all Children do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the <hi>Nature</hi> of their Parents, yet they may be, and some of them are very <hi>deformed,</hi> and bear very little of their <hi>Likeness.</hi> So is it in this matter; we may have the <hi>Image</hi> of God in our Hearts, and yet come short of that <hi>Likeness</hi> unto him in its Degrees and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we ought to aim at. And this happens Two wayes; (1) When our Graces are <hi>weak, withering,</hi> and <hi>unthrifty;</hi> for in their flourishing and <hi>fruit-bearing</hi> is our <hi>Likeness</hi> unto God evidenced, and in them doth the Glory of God in this World consist. (2) When by the <hi>Power</hi> of our Corruptions or our Temptations, we contract a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity;</hi> something that hath the Likeness of the <hi>old crooked Serpent.</hi> Where either of these befall us, that our <hi>Graces</hi> are <hi>low</hi> and <hi>thriftless;</hi> that our <hi>Corruptions</hi> are <hi>high</hi> and <hi>active,</hi> frequently discovering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; there, though the <hi>Image of God</hi> may be <hi>in</hi> us, there is not much of his <hi>Likeness upon</hi> us, and we come short of our Duty, in this great and Fundamental Duty of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Profession.</hi> So far as it is thus with us, may we not, ought we not greatly to <hi>blame</hi> our selves? Why are we so slow, so Negligent in the pursuit of our principal <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> and <hi>Happiness?</hi> Why do we suffer <hi>every</hi> thing, why do we suffer
<hi>any</hi> thing to divert our Minds from, or retard our Endeavours in this Design? Wherefore, that I may contribute something to the <hi>awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening</hi> of our Diligence herein, I shall adde some few <hi>Motives</hi> unto it, and some <hi>Directions</hi> for it, that herein we may be found <hi>perfecting Holiness in the Fear of the Lord,</hi> which is the only way whereby we may be <hi>like</hi> unto him, in this World.</p>

                  <hi>First,</hi> In our <hi>Likeness</hi> unto God, consists the Excellency and Preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of our <hi>Nature,</hi> above that of all other Creatures in the world, and of our <hi>Persons</hi> above those of other Men, who are not partakers of his <hi>Image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, (1) With Reference unto other Things, this is the highest Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency that a <hi>Created Nature</hi> is capable of. Other things had <hi>External Impressions</hi> of the <hi>Greatness, Power,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of God upon them; Man alone in this lower world was capable of the <hi>Image of God</hi> in him. The Perfection, the Glory, the Preeminence of our <hi>Nature</hi> in the first Creation, was expressed only by this, that we were made in the <hi>Image and likeness of God, Gen.</hi> 1. 26, 27. This gave us a Preeminence above all other Creatures, and hence a <hi>Dominion</hi> over them ensued. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God made a distinct grant of it unto us, that we might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understand and be thankfull for our Priviledge; yet was it a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Consequence of his <hi>Image in us.</hi> And this is that which <hi>James</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, where he tells us, that <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>God</hi> in Wisdom and Soveraignty; and not attaining what we <hi>aymed</hi> at, we lost what we <hi>had, Gen.</hi> 3. 5. Being in <hi>honour we continued not, but became like the Beasts that perish, Psal.</hi> 49. 12. we were first <hi>like</hi> God, and then <hi>like Beasts, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 12. By the loss of the <hi>Image</hi> of God, our Nature lost its Preeminence, and we were reduced into order amongst
<hi>perishing Beasts.</hi> For notwithstanding some feeble <hi>Reliques</hi> of this <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> yet abiding with us, we have really, with respect unto our proper End, in our lapsed Condition, more of the <hi>Bestial Nature</hi> in us, than of the <hi>Divine.</hi> Wherefore the Restauration of this <hi>Image</hi> in us by the Grace of <hi>Jesus Christ, Ephes. 4. 24. Col.</hi> 3. 10, is the Recovery of that
<hi>Preeminence</hi> and <hi>Priviledge</hi> of our Nature which we had foolishly lost. Hereby there is an <hi>Impression</hi> again made upon our <hi>Natures</hi> of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of God, which gives us a <hi>Preeminence</hi> above other Creatures, and a <hi>Rule</hi> over them; yea, that whole <hi>Dominion</hi> which Mankind scrambles for with Craft and Violence, over the residue of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, depends on this <hi>Renovation of the Image of God</hi> in some of them. Not that I judge that mens Right and Title to their Portion and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests in this world, doth depend on their own <hi>Personal Grace</hi> or <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> But that if God had not designed to renew his <hi>Image</hi> in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Jesus Christ, and as the Foundation thereof to take our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into <hi>Vnion</hi> with himself in the person of his Son, and thereby to gather up all things unto a <hi>New Head</hi> in him, and to make him the <hi>first-born</hi> of the Creation, the Head and <hi>Heir of all,</hi> he would not have continued any thing of Right or Title therein. It was upon the <hi>Promise</hi> and the <hi>Establishment</hi> of the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> that this Right was restored unto us. So it is expressed in the <hi>Renovation</hi> of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> with <hi>Noah</hi> and his Children, <hi>Gen. 9. 1, 2. God blessed Noah and his Sons, and said unto them, Be fruitfull and multiply, and replenish the Earth; and the fear of you, and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the Earth, and upon every fowl of the Air, and upon all that moveth on the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:48389:261"/> Earth, and upon all the Fishes of the Sea, into your hand are they delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi> which is an <hi>expresse Renovation</hi> of the <hi>Grant</hi> made unto us at our first Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28. The Right whereunto we had lost, in our Loss of the <hi>Image of God.</hi> And therefore in that service wherein the Creature is continued unto Mankind, it is made <hi>Subject to vanity,</hi> and put into bondage, in which state though it groan, and look out as it were for Deliverance, it must continue until God hath accomplished the whole Design of the glorious <hi>liberty of his Children, Rom.</hi> 8. 20, 21. Whatever they may <hi>Pride</hi> themselves in, their Parts or Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, however they may sport themselves in the <hi>Vse</hi> or <hi>Abuse</hi> of other Creatures, if this <hi>Image of God</hi> be not renewed in them, they have really no great <hi>Preeminence</hi> above the things which perish under theirhands, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. God having Exalted our Natures by Union with himself in the Person of his Son, requires of us to preserve its Dignity above others.</p>

<hi>folly</hi> and intolerable <hi>negligence?</hi> We have no other way, but Thriving and Growing in that <hi>Likeness of God</hi> which we have here in <hi>Holiness.</hi> Hereby alone are we <hi>transformed into the Image of God, from Glory to Glory; 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 18. From one glorious Degree of Grace unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, untill one great <hi>Change</hi> shall issue all Grace and Holiness in <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory:</hi> And in our Desires for Heaven, if they are <hi>regular,</hi> we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider not so much our Freedom from <hi>Trouble</hi> as from <hi>Sin;</hi> nor in our Aym in the first place so much at <hi>compleat Happiness,</hi> as <hi>perfect Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> And they who desire Heaven, as that which would only ease them of their <hi>Troubles,</hi> and not as that which will perfectly free them of <hi>Sin;</hi> will fall into a state wherein <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Trouble</hi> shall be Eternally inseperable. As therefore we would continually tend towards our
<hi>Rest</hi> and Blessedness, as we would have assured and evident <hi>Pledges</hi> of it in our own Souls, as we would have Fore-tastes of it, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Acquaintance with it, (as who would not know as much as is possible of his <hi>Eternal Blessedness</hi>) this is the Design which we ought to pursue. It is to be feared, that the most of us know not
<hi>how much of Glory</hi> may be in present Grace, nor how much of <hi>Heaven</hi> may be attained in <hi>Holiness</hi> on the Earth. We have a Generation amongst us, that would fain be Boasting of <hi>Perfection,</hi> whilest in their Minds they are evidently under the Power of <hi>Darkness, corrupt</hi> in their Affections, and <hi>worldly</hi> in their Lives. But our Duty it is, to be alwayes <hi>perfecting Holiness in the fear of the Lord.</hi> This pursued in a due Manner, is continually transforming the Soul into the <hi>Likeness</hi> of God.

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is from our <hi>Likeness</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi> unto God alone, that we are or may be <hi>usefull</hi> in the World in a due Manner and Order. I shall have Occasion to speak more unto this afterwards, and shall therefore here only touch upon it, with respect unto one Concernment or Circumstance. God is the great <hi>Preserver</hi> and <hi>Benefactor</hi> of the whole Creation: He is <hi>good</hi> and doth <hi>Good,</hi> the sole Cause and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>all Good,</hi> that in any kind, any Creature is made partaker of. And there is no <hi>Property</hi> of God more celebrated in the Scripture than this of his <hi>Goodness,</hi> and his giving out of the Fruits of it to all his Creatures. And he is so <hi>only Good,</hi> that there is nothing so in any sence but by a <hi>participation</hi> of it, and a <hi>Likeness</hi> unto him therein. They therefore who are <hi>like</hi> unto God, and they only, are <hi>usefull</hi> in this World. There <hi>is</hi> indeed, or at least there <hi>hath</hi> been, much Good, usefull <hi>good</hi> done by others, on various Convictions, and for various Ends: But there is one <hi>flaw</hi> or other in all they doe. Either Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, or Vain-glory, or Selfishness, or Merit, or one thing or other, gets into all the Good that is done by <hi>unholy Persons,</hi> and brings Death into the Pot, so that although it may be of some use in <hi>particulars,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to individual Persons, in some Seasons, it is of none unto the <hi>general</hi> Good of the whole. He that bears the <hi>Likeness</hi> of God, and in all that he doth, acts from that Principle, he alone is truely <hi>usefull,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents God in what he doth, and spoyls it not by false Ends of his own. If therefore we would keep up the <hi>Priviledge</hi> and <hi>Preeminence</hi>
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:48389:262"/> of our <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> if we would make due and daily <hi>Accessions</hi> towards Glory and Blessedness, if we would be of any <hi>real use</hi> in this World, our great Endeavour ought to be, to <hi>grow</hi> up more and more into this <hi>Likeness</hi> of God, which consists in our <hi>Holiness.</hi>

This were a large <hi>Theme,</hi> I shall confine it unto one Instance. The glorious Properties of God, as we have shewed before, are manifested and revealed in Jesus Christ, <hi>in his Face do they shine forth.</hi> The only way whereby we <hi>behold</hi> them, whereby we have an <hi>intuition</hi> into them, is by Faith. In Christ are the glorious Excellencies of God represented unto us, and by Faith do we behold them. And what is the <hi>Effect</hi> hereof? <hi>we are changed into the same Image and Likeness, from Glory to Glory, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 18. This is the great Mystery of Growing in <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and Thriving in the <hi>Image</hi> of God, which the World being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, have laboured in vain by other Means to satisfie their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Convictions. But this is the great Way and Means of it, appointed and blessed of God unto that Purpose; namely, constantly by <hi>Faith,</hi> in a way of Believing the Revelation made in the Gospel, to view, behold, and contemplate on the <hi>Excellencies</hi> of God, his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Holiness, Righteousness, Love</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> as manifested in Jesus Christ; and that so as to make use of, and apply unto our selves and our Condition the Effects and Fruits of them, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Gospel. This is the great <hi>Arcanum</hi> of <hi>growing</hi> up into the
<hi>likeness of God;</hi> without which, however men may <hi>multiply Duties</hi> in a Complyance with their Convictions, they will have never the more
<hi>Conformity</hi> to God. And all Professors who come short in this matter, do or may know, that it ariseth from their want of a constant Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of <hi>Faith</hi> on God in Christ. If therefore we have a real Design, of being yet <hi>more like unto God,</hi> which is our <hi>Priviledge, Safety, Glory, Blessedness,</hi> this is the way we must take for its Accomplishment. Abound in Actings of <hi>Faith,</hi> and we shall thrive in <hi>Holiness.</hi> And they are but Acts of <hi>Presumption</hi> under the Name of <hi>Faith,</hi> which do not infallibly produce this Effect.</p>

<pb n="514" facs="tcp:48389:263"/> other Endeavours to that Purpose will be in vain. And he that <hi>loves God</hi> sincerely, will be <hi>like</hi> him.

But of all Kinds <hi>Divine Love</hi> is most effectual to this purpose, as having the best, the most noble, proper and attractive Object. It is our Adherence unto God with
<hi>Delight,</hi> for what he is in himself, as manifested in Jesus Christ. By it we <hi>cleave unto God,</hi> and so keep near him, and thereby derive <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Vertue</hi> from him. Every Approach unto God by ardent Love and Delight is <hi>Transfiguring.</hi> And it acts it self continually by (1) <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation;</hi> (2) <hi>Admiration,</hi> and (3) <hi>Delight</hi> in Obedience.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Love</hi> acts it self by <hi>Contemplation.</hi> It is in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it to be meditating and Contemplating on the Excellencies of God in Christ. Yea, this is the <hi>Life</hi> of it, and where this is not, there is no <hi>Love.</hi> An heart filled with the <hi>Love</hi> of God, will Night and Day be exercising it self in and with Thoughts of Gods glorious Excellencies, rejoycing in them. This the <hi>Psalmist</hi> exhorts us unto, <hi>Psal. 30. 4. Sing unto the Lord, O ye Saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> And <hi>Love</hi> will do the same with respect unto all his other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. See to this purpose, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. throughout. And this will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our <hi>Likeness</hi> unto him; our Minds by it will be <hi>changed into the Image</hi> of what we Contemplate, and we shall endeavour, that our Lives be <hi>conformed</hi> thereunto.</p>

The common Instance of <hi>Jacob</hi> is known, of whom it is said, that his <hi>seven Years Service seemed short,</hi> and so <hi>easie</hi> to him, for the <hi>Love</hi> he
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:48389:263"/> bare to <hi>Rachel.</hi> He did that with <hi>Delight,</hi> which he would not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards undergoe for the greatest Wages. But we have a <hi>greater</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: Our Lord Jesus Christ sayes concerning all the Obedience that was required of him; <hi>Thy Law O God is in my heart, I delight to do thy Will.</hi> And yet we know how terrible to Nature were the things he <hi>did</hi> and <hi>suffered</hi> in Obedience to that Law. But his <hi>unspeakable Love</hi> to God and the Souls of men, rendred it all his <hi>Delight.</hi> Hence follows <hi>Intension</hi> and <hi>Frequency</hi> in all the Duties of it. And where these two are, <hi>Intension</hi> of mind and spirit, with a <hi>Frequency</hi> of holy Duties, both proceeding from <hi>Delight,</hi> there <hi>Holiness</hi> will thrive, and consequently we shall do so in our <hi>Conformity</hi> to God. In brief, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Likeness</hi> unto God are inseperable, and proportionate unto one another. And without this, no <hi>Duties</hi> of Obedience are any part of his <hi>Image.</hi>

               <p>(1) And the first is such, as I shall give many <hi>Names</hi> unto it is its Description, as the Scripture doth also, but the thing intended is one and the same. This is <hi>Goodness, Kindness, Benignity, Love,</hi> with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to do <hi>good,</hi> to <hi>forgive,</hi> to <hi>help</hi> and <hi>relieve,</hi> and this towards <hi>all</hi> Men, on <hi>all</hi> Occasions. And this also is to be considered in Opposition unto an evil <hi>Habit</hi> of Mind exerting it self in many Vices, which yet agree in the same general <hi>Nature;</hi> such are <hi>Anger, Wrath, Envy, Malice, Revenge, Frowardness, Selfishness;</hi> all which are directly opposite to the Grace of <hi>Holiness,</hi> at present instanced in and pleaded for. And this I fear, is not so considered as it ought to be: For if it were, it would not be so common a thing as it may be it is, for men to plead highly for the <hi>Imitation</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and almost in all they doe, give us a full <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation</hi> of the <hi>Devil.</hi> For as this universal <hi>Benignity</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to all, is the greatest Representation of the <hi>Nature</hi> of God on the Earth; so is <hi>Fierceness, Envy, Wrath</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi> of that of the Devil. Would we then be <hi>like</hi> unto our Heavenly Father, would we manifest that we are so unto his Glory, would we represent him in and unto the World, it must be by this <hi>frame</hi> of spirit, and Actings constantly suited thereunto. This our Blessed Saviour instructs us in and unto,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44, 45. A Man, I say, thus Good, his Nature being cured and rectified by <hi>Grace,</hi> thence <hi>usefull,</hi> and <hi>helpfull,</hi> free from Guile, Envy and Selfishness, Pride and Elation of Mind, is the best <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> we can have of God on the Earth, since the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of Christ was removed from us.</p>

And no small part of our <hi>Holiness</hi> consists herein. Many Lusts, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and distempered Passions are to be subdued by <hi>Grace,</hi> if we design to be Eminent. Strong <hi>Bents</hi> and Inclinations of Mind to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with innumerable <hi>Provocations</hi> and <hi>Exasperations</hi> that will befall us, must be corrected and discarded.

                  <hi>drove</hi> of Temptations, all whose force consists in a pretence of <hi>care for Self,</hi> must be scattered or resisted.

Wherefore <hi>Truth and sincerity in Words,</hi> for that at present I confine my self unto, is an Effect of <hi>Renovation</hi> of the <hi>Image</hi> of God in us, and a <hi>Representation</hi> of him to the world.

<hi>holy; Holy</hi> as he is in Christ, <hi>reconciling</hi> the sinfull World unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and therefore indispensibly requires, that those whom he <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, receives, accepts</hi> into his <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with himself, should be <hi>Holy</hi> also. And these things are not only consistent, but inseperable. Without the Consideration of this <hi>Grace</hi> in God, we can have no Encouragement to be <hi>Holy;</hi> and without the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> in us, that Grace can neither be <hi>glorified</hi> nor <hi>usefull.</hi>

                  <hi>It is the Eternal and Immutable Purpose of God, that all who are his in a peculiar manner, all whom he designs to bring unto Blessedness in the Everlasting Enjoyment of himself; shall antecedently thereunto be made Holy.</hi> This Purpose of his, God hath declared unto us, that we may take no wrong Measures of our <hi>Estate</hi> and <hi>Condition,</hi> nor build Hopes or Expectations of future Glory, on sandy Foundations that will fail us. Whatever we are else, in Parts, Abilities, Profession, Moral Honesty, Usefulness unto others, Reputation in the Church, if we are not <hi>personally, spiritually, Evangelically Holy,</hi> we have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in that <hi>Purpose</hi> or <hi>Decree</hi> of God, whereby any Persons are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed unto Salvation and Glory. And this we shall briefly confirm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ephes. 1. 4. He hath chosen us in Christ, before the Foundation of the World, that we should be holy, and unblameable before him in Love.</hi> But is this that which <hi>firstly</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> we are ordained unto, and that for its own sake, namely, <hi>Holiness,</hi> and Unblameableness in the Obedience of Love? No; we are <hi>firstly</hi> Ordained unto <hi>eternal life, Acts</hi> 13. 48. we are <hi>chosen from the Beginning unto Salvation, 2 Thess.</hi> 2. 13. That which God in the <hi>first</hi> place intends as his <hi>End</hi> in the
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:48389:266"/> Decree of <hi>Election,</hi> is our <hi>Eternal Salvation,</hi> to the <hi>prayse of the Glory of his Grace; Ephes.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 11. How then is he said to Choose us that we should be <hi>Holy?</hi> in what sence is our <hi>Holiness</hi> proposed as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of God in <hi>Election?</hi> It is as the <hi>indispensible Means</hi> for the attaining of the <hi>End</hi> of Salvation and Glory. I doe, saith God, choose these poor lost Sinners, to be mine in an <hi>especial manner,</hi> to save them by my Son, and bring them through his Mediation unto <hi>Eternal Glory;</hi> But in order hereunto, I do <hi>purpose</hi> and <hi>decree,</hi> that they shall be <hi>holy</hi> and unblameable in the Obedience of Love, without which as a
<hi>Means</hi> none shall ever attain that <hi>End.</hi> Wherefore, the Expectation and Hope of any man, for Life and Immortality and Glory, without previous <hi>Holiness,</hi> can be built on no other Foundation but this, that God will Rescind his <hi>Eternal Decrees,</hi> and change his Purposes, that is, cease to be God, meerly to comply with them in ther Sins. And who knowes not what will be the <hi>End</hi> of such a cursed Hope and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? The contrary is seconded by that of the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 8. 36. Whom he did Predestinate, them he also Called.</hi> Wherever <hi>Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> unto Glory goes before, concerning any Person, there Effectual
<hi>Vocation</hi> unto Faith and Holiness infallibly ensues: And where these never were, the other never was. So 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 13. God hath <hi>chosen you from the Beginning unto Salvation, through the Sanctification of the Spirit.</hi> Chosen we are unto Salvation, by the free <hi>Soveraign Grace</hi> of God: But how may this <hi>Salvation</hi> be actually obtained? how may we be brought into the <hi>actual possession</hi> of it? Through the <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> and no otherwise. Whom God doth not sanctifie and make <hi>Holy</hi> by his Spirit, he never <hi>chose</hi> unto <hi>Salvation</hi> from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. The Councels of God therefore concerning us, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on our <hi>Holiness;</hi> but upon our <hi>Holiness</hi> our future <hi>Happiness</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends in the Councels of God.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> Hence we may see, wherein lyes the <hi>Force</hi> of the Argument for the
<hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness,</hi> from Gods Decree of <hi>Election;</hi> and it consists in these two things:</p>
               <p>(1) That such is the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>unalterable Decree</hi> of God in this Matter, that no Person living, can ever attain the End of <hi>Glory</hi> and
<hi>Happiness,</hi> without the Means of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Holiness.</hi> The same Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Purpose respecteth both. I shall afterwards shew, how the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible and indissolvible Connexion of these things is established by the Law of God. Our present Argument is from hence, that it is <hi>fixed</hi> by Gods <hi>Eternal Decree.</hi> He hath ordained none to Salvation, but he hath ordained them Antecedently to be <hi>Holy.</hi> Not the least <hi>Infant</hi> that goes out of this World, shall come to Eternal Rest, unless it be <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and so made <hi>habitually</hi> and <hi>radically</hi> Holy. He chooseth none to Salvation but <hi>through the sanctification of the Spirit.</hi> As therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else we have or may seem to have, it is contrary to the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, that we should come to the Enjoyment of him, if we are not <hi>holy,</hi> so it is contrary to his Eternal and unchangeable <hi>Decree</hi> also.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label>(2) It ariseth from hence, that we can have no <hi>Evidence</hi> of our
<hi>Interest</hi> in Gods Decree of <hi>Election,</hi> whereby we are designed unto
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:48389:267"/> Life and Glory, without <hi>Holiness</hi> effectually wrought in us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as our <hi>Life</hi> depends upon it, so do all our <hi>Comforts.</hi> To this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose speaks our Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. The Foundation of God stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sure, having this Seal, The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> It is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Election</hi> which he intends, and he proposeth it as that alone which will give security against <hi>Apostasie</hi> in a time of great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Trials; As our Saviour doth likewise, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. Every thing else will fail, but what is an especial Fruit and Effect of this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</hi> What therefore is incumbent on us with respect thereunto, that we may know we have an Interest in this single Security against final
<hi>Apostasie?</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>And let every one that nameth the Name of Christ, depart from Iniquity.</hi> There is no other way to come unto an
<hi>Evidence</hi> thereof, but by a Departure from all <hi>Iniquity,</hi> by universal
<hi>Holiness.</hi> So the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> directs us, to <hi>give all diligence to make our Election sure, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 10. Sure it is in it self, from all Eternity.
<hi>The Foundation of God standeth sure.</hi> But our Duty it is to <hi>make it sure,</hi> and certain unto ourselves. And this is a thing of the highest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and Concernment unto us, whence we are required to <hi>give all Diligence</hi> unto that End. How then may this be done or effected? This he declares in the foregoing Verses, and it is only by finding in our selves, and duely Exercising that Train of <hi>Gospel Graces</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> which he there enumerates, <hi>Vers.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> It is evident therefore and necessary from Gods Decree of <hi>Election,</hi> that if we intend either <hi>Eternal Glory</hi> hereafter, or any <hi>Consolation</hi> or
<hi>Assurance</hi> here, that we must endeavour to be <hi>holy, and unblameable before him in Love.</hi> For whomsoever God purposeth to <hi>save,</hi> he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth first to <hi>sanctifie;</hi> neither have we any ground to suppose, that we are built on that <hi>Foundation</hi> of God which standeth sure, unless we depart from all Iniquity. What further <hi>Motives</hi> may be taken from the <hi>especial Nature</hi> of this Decree, shall be considered when we have removed one Objection out of our way.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label>
                  <hi>Some there are, who apprehend that these things are quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For they say, that a Supposition of Gods Decree of</hi> personal Election <hi>is a Discouragement unto all Endeavours for</hi> Holiness, <hi>and an effectual Obstruction thereof in the Lives of Men. And under this pretense chiefly, is the Doctrine concerning it blasphemed and evil spoken of.</hi> For, <hi>say they,</hi> if God have freely from Eternity chosen men unto Salvation, what need is there that they should be Holy? They may live securely in the pursuit of their Lusts, and be sure not to fail of Heaven at the last. For Gods Decree cannot be frustrated, nor his Will resisted. And if men be not elected, whatever they endeavour in the Wayes of Holy Obedience, it will be utterly lost, for eternally saved they cannot, they shall not be. This therefore is so far from being a Conviction of the Necessity of Holiness, and a Motive unto it, as that indeed it renders it unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and useless; yea defeats the Power and Efficacy of all other Arguments for it, and Motives unto it.</p>
               <p>Now this Objection, if not for the sake of those who make use of it as a <hi>Cavil</hi> against the <hi>Truth,</hi> yet of those who may feel the <hi>force</hi> of it in the way of a <hi>Temptation,</hi> must be removed out of our way: To this End, I answer two Things:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="523" facs="tcp:48389:267"/> 1. In <hi>general;</hi> that this <hi>Perswasion is not of him that calleth us.</hi> This way of <hi>arguing</hi> is not taught in the Scripture, nor can thence be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Doctrine of Gods <hi>free Electing Love</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> is fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared therein. And withall, it is proposed as the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and made a great <hi>Motive</hi> thereunto. Is it not safer now for us to adhere to the plain <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> confirmed by the <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> of the Generality of Believers, captivating our Understandings to the Obedience of <hi>Faith,</hi> than hearken unto such perverse Cavils as would possess our Minds with a <hi>Dislike</hi> of God and his Wayes? Those who hate <hi>Gospel Holiness,</hi> or would substitute something else in the room of it, will never want Exceptions against all its Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. An <hi>Holiness</hi> they lay claim unto, and plead an Interest in. For, as I said formerly, a Confession in <hi>general</hi> of the Necessity hereof, is almost the onely thing wherein all that are called <hi>Christians</hi> do agree. But such an <hi>Holiness</hi> they would have, as doth not spring from <hi>Eternal Divine Election,</hi> as is not wrought in us Originally by the Almighty
<hi>Efficacy</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> in our Conversion, as is not promoted by free <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> through the Imputation of the <hi>Righteousness of Christ.</hi> Now this is such an <hi>Holiness</hi> as the Scripture knoweth nothing of, unless it be to reject and condemn it. Wherefore, this Objection proceeding onely from the Craft of Sathan, opposing the Wayes and Methods of Gods <hi>Grace,</hi> when he deareth not openly oppose the thing it self, it is safer for a Believer to rest quietly in clear <hi>Scripture Revelation,</hi> than to attend unto such proud, perverse and froward Cavillings.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> 2. In <hi>particular;</hi> we are not onely obliged to believe all <hi>Divine Revelations,</hi> but also in the <hi>Way, Order</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> wherein by the
<hi>Will</hi> of God they are proposed unto us, and which is required by the
<hi>Nature</hi> of the things themselves. For Instance, The Belief of <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is required in the Gospel: But yet no man is obliged to Believe, that he shall be <hi>eternally saved</hi> whilest he lives in his Sins, but rather the contrary. On this Supposition, which is plain and evident, I shall in the ensuing Propositions, utterly cast this Objection out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label>(1) The Decree of <hi>Election</hi> considered <hi>absolutely</hi> in it self, without respect unto its <hi>Effects,</hi> is no part of Gods <hi>revealed Will.</hi> That is, it is not Revealed, that this or that man, is, or is not <hi>elected.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can be made neither Argument nor Objection, about any thing wherein <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Obedience</hi> are concerned; For we know it not, we cannot know it, it is not our Duty to know it, the Knowledge of it is not proposed as of any <hi>use</hi> unto us, yea it it is our <hi>sin</hi> to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. It may seem to some, to be like the <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Knowledge of Good and Evil</hi> unto <hi>Eve;</hi> good for <hi>Food,</hi> pleasant to the <hi>Eyes,</hi> and much to be <hi>desired</hi> to make one <hi>wise,</hi> as all secret Forbidden things seem to carnal Minds. But men can gather no <hi>Fruit</hi> from it but Death. See
<hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. Whatever <hi>Exceptions</hi> therefore are laid against this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> as it is in it self, whatever <hi>Inferences</hi> are made, on supposition of this or that mans being or not being <hi>elected,</hi> they are all <hi>unjust</hi> and
<hi>unreasonable,</hi> yea proved <hi>contending with God,</hi> who hath appointed
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:48389:268"/> another Way for the Discovery hereof, as we shall see after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label>(2) God sends the <hi>Gospel</hi> to men in pursuit of his <hi>Decree of Election,</hi> and in order unto its effectual Accomplishment. I dispute not what other End it hath or may have, in its <hi>indefinite proposal</hi> unto all. But this is the first Regulating, <hi>principal</hi> End of it. Wherefore, in the preaching of it, our Apostle affirms, that he <hi>endured all things for the Elects sake, that they might obtain the Salvation which is in Jesus Christ, with eternal Glory, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 10. So God before-hand commanded him to stay and preach the Gospel at <hi>Corinth,</hi> because <hi>he had much People in that City,</hi> namely, in his <hi>Purpose</hi> of Grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 10. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 47. <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 48.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label>(3) Wherever this <hi>Gospel comes,</hi> it proposeth <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> by
<hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> unto all that shall <hi>believe, repent,</hi> and yield <hi>Obedience</hi> unto him. It plainly makes known unto men their <hi>Duty,</hi> and plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth unto them their <hi>Reward.</hi> In this state of things, no man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the highest <hi>Pride</hi> and utmost Effect of <hi>Vnbelief,</hi> can oppose the secret <hi>Decree</hi> of God unto our known <hi>Duty.</hi> Saith such a one, I will neither <hi>repent,</hi> nor <hi>believe,</hi> nor <hi>obey,</hi> unless I may first know whether I am <hi>Elected</hi> or no, for all at last will depend thereon. If this be the Resolution of any man, he may go about his other Occasions, the Gospel hath nothing to <hi>say</hi> or <hi>offer</hi> unto him. If he will admit of it on no other terms, but that he may set up his <hi>own</hi> Will and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Methods, in Opposition unto and Exclusion of those of <hi>God,</hi> he must, for ought I know, take his own Course, whereof he may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent when it is too late.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label>(4) The <hi>sole Way</hi> of God's Appointment, whereby we may come to an Apprehension of an Interest in <hi>Election,</hi> is by the <hi>Fruits</hi> of it in our <hi>own Souls:</hi> Nor is it Lawfull for us to enquire into it or after it any other way. The Obligation which the Gospel puts upon us to
<hi>believe</hi> any thing, respects the <hi>Order</hi> of the Things themselves to be Believed, and the <hi>Order</hi> of our <hi>Obedience,</hi> as was before observed. For instance; when it is declared, that <hi>Christ dyed for Sinners,</hi> no man is immediately obliged to believe, that Christ dyed for him in <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> but only that he dyed to <hi>save Sinners,</hi> to procure a <hi>Way of Salvation</hi> for them, among whom he finds himself to be. Hereon the Gospel requires of men <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience:</hi> This are they obliged to comply withall. Untill this be done, no man is under an Obligation to believe, <hi>that Christ dyed for him in particular.</hi> So is it in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Election:</hi> A man is obliged to believe the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it upon the first Promulgation of the Gospel, because it is therein plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. But as for his own <hi>personal Election,</hi> he cannot believe it, nor is obliged to believe it any otherwise, but as God reveals it by its
<hi>Effects.</hi> No man ought, no man can justly Question his own <hi>Election,</hi> doubt of it, or disbelieve it, untill he be in such a Condition as wherein it is impossible that the <hi>Effects</hi> of Election should ever be wrought in him; if such a Condition there be in this World. For as a man whilest he is <hi>unholy</hi> can have no Evidence that he <hi>is elected,</hi> so he can have none that he is <hi>not elected,</hi> whilest it is possible that
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:48389:268"/> ever he <hi>may be Holy.</hi> Wherefore, whether men are <hi>Elected</hi> or no, is not that which God calls any immediately to be conversant about.
<hi>Faith, Obedience, Holiness,</hi> are the inseperable Fruits, Effects, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of <hi>Election;</hi> as hath been proved before. See <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 4. 2 <hi>Thess. 2. 13. Tit. 1. 1. Acts</hi> 13. 48. In whomsoever these things are wrought, he is obliged according to the Method of God and the Gospel, to believe his own <hi>Election:</hi> And any Believer may have the same Assurance of it as he hath of his <hi>Calling, Sanctification</hi> or <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> for these things are inseperable. And by the <hi>Exercise</hi> of Grace are we obliged to secure our Interest in <hi>Election, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 11. But as for those who are as yet <hi>Vnbelievers</hi> and <hi>unholy,</hi> they can draw no Conclusion that they are not <hi>elected,</hi> but from this Supposition, that they are in a state and Condition wherein it is impossible that ever they should have either <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Holiness;</hi> which cannot be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed concerning any man but he that knowes himself to have sinned against the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, all the supposed <hi>strength</hi> of the Objection mentioned, lieth onely in the <hi>Pride</hi> of mens Minds and Wills, refusing to submit themselves unto the Order and Method of God in the Dispensation of his <hi>Grace,</hi> and his Prescription of their <hi>Duty,</hi> where we must leave it.</p>

Rom.</hi> 8. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33.

For we have no way to express our Resentment of this <hi>Grace,</hi> our Acknowledgement of it, our Thankfulness for it, but by an <hi>holy fruitfull</hi> Course of <hi>Obedience;</hi> nor doth God on the Account hereof require any thing else of us. Let us therefore enquire what Sence and Obligation this puts upon us; That God from all Eternity, out of his meer <hi>Soveraign Grace,</hi> not moved by any thing in our selves, should first choose us unto <hi>Life</hi> and
<hi>Salvation</hi> by Jesus Christ, decreeing immutably to save us out of the perishing multitude of Mankind, from whom we neither then did in his Eye or Consideration, nor by any thing in our selves ever would differ in the least? What <hi>Impression</hi> doth this make upon our Souls? What <hi>Conclusion</hi> as to our Practice and Obedience do we hence educe? Why saith one, <hi>If God hath thus chosen me, I may then live in sin as I please, all will be well and safe in the latter End, which is all I need care for:</hi> But this is the Language of a <hi>Devil,</hi> and not of a <hi>Man.</hi> Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions possibly of this nature, by the Craft of Sathan, in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Deceitfulness of Sin, may be injected into the Minds of Believers; as what may not so be? But he that shall foment, embrace, and act <hi>practically</hi> according to this Inference, is such a <hi>monster</hi> of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety</hi> and <hi>presumptuous Ingratitude,</hi> as <hi>Hell</hi> it self cannot parallel, in

<hi>Holy Obedience,</hi> is utterly unacquainted with the <hi>Nature</hi> of Faith, and its whole Work and Actings towards God, in the Hearts of them that believe. Is it possible, that any one who knowes these things, can suppose, that those in whom they are in <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> can be such stupid, impious and ungratefull <hi>Monsters,</hi> so devoid of all Holy Ingenuity, and filial Affections towards God, as meerly out of despight unto him, to cast Poyson into the <hi>Spring</hi> of all their own Mercies? Many have I known complain, that they could not arrive at a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Perswasion</hi> of their own <hi>Election;</hi> never any, who when they had <hi>received</hi> it in a due Way and Manner, that it proved a <hi>Snare</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that it tended to ingenerate <hi>loosness</hi> of Life, <hi>Vnholiness,</hi> or a Contempt of God in them. Besides, in the Scripture it is still propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and made use of unto other Ends. And those who know any thing of the Nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> or of the <hi>Love</hi> of God, any thing of Entercourse or <hi>Communion</hi> with him by Jesus Christ, any thing of
<hi>Thankefulness, Obedience</hi> or <hi>Holiness,</hi> will not be easily perswaded, but that Gods <hi>Electing Love</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> is a mighty constraining <hi>Motive</hi> unto the due Exercise of them all.</p>

<hi>Enjoyment</hi> of God. But it will be said, That if it be supposed or granted, that those who are Actually <hi>Believers,</hi> and have a sence of their <hi>Interest</hi> herein, may make the use of it that is pleaded; yet as for those who are <hi>unconverted,</hi> or are otherwise uncertain of their
<hi>spiritual State</hi> and <hi>Condition,</hi> nothing can be so <hi>discouraging</hi> unto them as this Doctrine of <hi>Eternal Election.</hi> Can they make any other Conclusion from it, but that, <hi>If they are not Elected, all Care and Pains in and about Duties of Obedience are Vain; if they are, they are Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi> The <hi>Removal</hi> of this Objection shall put a Close unto our Discourse on this Subject. And I Answer:</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>25</label>(1) That we have shewed already, that this Doctrine is <hi>revealed</hi> and <hi>proposed</hi> in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> principally to acquaint <hi>Believers</hi> with their Priviledge, Safety, and Fountain of their <hi>Comforts.</hi> Having therefore proved its <hi>Vsefulness</hi> unto them, I have discharged all that is absolutely <hi>needfull</hi> to my present Purpose. But I shall shew more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that it hath its <hi>proper Benefit</hi> and <hi>Advantage</hi> towards others also.</p>
               <p>For, (2) Suppose the Doctrine of <hi>Personal Election</hi> be Preached unto Men, together with the other <hi>Sacred Truths</hi> of the Gospel: Two
<hi>Conclusions,</hi> it is possible, may by sundry Persons be made from it. (<hi>First,</hi>) That whereas this is a Matter of great and <hi>Eternal Moment</hi> unto our <hi>Souls,</hi> and there is no way to secure our <hi>Interest</hi> in it, but by the Possession of its <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> which are saving <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holiness;</hi> we will, we must, it is our Duty, to use our <hi>utmost</hi> Endeavours, by Attaining of them, and Growth in them, to make our <hi>Election sure.</hi> And herein, if we be <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>diligent,</hi> we shall not sail. Others (<hi>Secondly</hi>) may conclude, That if it be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that those who shall be <hi>saved</hi> are <hi>chosen</hi> thereunto <hi>before the Foundation of the World,</hi> then it is to no Purpose to go about to
<hi>Believe</hi> or <hi>Obey,</hi> seeing all things must fall out at last, according as they were Fore-ordained. Now I ask, which of these Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, is (I will not say, <hi>most suited</hi> unto the Mind and Will of God, with that Subjection of Soul and Conscience which we owe to his <hi>Soveraign Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> but whether of them is) the
<hi>most rational,</hi> and most suitable to the Principles of sober <hi>Love of our selves,</hi> and Care of our <hi>Immortal Condition?</hi> Nothing is more certain, than that the latter <hi>Resolution</hi> will be infallibly Destructive (if pursued) of all the <hi>Everlasting Concernments</hi> of our Souls; Death and Eternal Condemnation are the unavoidable Issues of it. No man giving himself up to the Conduct of that Conclusion, shall ever come to the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of God. But in the other way, it is
<hi>possible</hi> at least, that a man may be found to be the Object of Gods <hi>Electing Love,</hi> and so be <hi>saved.</hi> But why doe I say, it is
<hi>possible?</hi> there is nothing more <hi>infallibly certain,</hi> than that he who pursues Sincerely and Diligently the Wayes of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi>
                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:48389:273"/> which are, as we have often said, the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Election,</hi> shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the End <hi>Everlasting Blessedness;</hi> and ordinarily, shall have in this World a Comfortable <hi>Evidence</hi> of their own <hi>personal Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> This therefore on all Accounts, and towards all sorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in an invincible Argument of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness,</hi> and a mighty <hi>Motive</hi> thereunto: For it is unavoidable, that if there be such a thing as <hi>personal Election,</hi> and that the <hi>Fruits</hi> of it are <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> it is utterly impossible, that without

We exhort you, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk, and please God, so you would abound more and more; for you know that Commandment we gave you, by the Lord Jesus; for this is the Will of God, even your Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> or <hi>Holiness;</hi> whereunto he addes one <hi>special Instance.</hi> This is that which the Commandments of Christ require, yea this is the

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> Our Enquiry must be, What <hi>Force</hi> there is in this Argument, or whence we doe conclude unto a <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> from the
<hi>Command</hi> of God. To this End, the <hi>Nature</hi> and proper <hi>Adjuncts</hi> of these Commands are to be considered; that is, we are to get our Minds and Consciences <hi>affected</hi> with them, so as to endeavour after
<hi>Holiness</hi> on their Account, or with respect unto them. For whatever we may doe, which seems to have the <hi>Matter of Holiness</hi> in it, if we do it not with respect unto Gods <hi>Command,</hi> it hath not the <hi>Nature of Holiness</hi> in it. For our <hi>Holiness</hi> is our <hi>Conformity</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> of God; and it is a Respect unto a <hi>Command</hi> which makes any thing to be <hi>Obedience,</hi> or gives it the <hi>formal Nature</hi> thereof. Wherefore, as God rejects That from any place in his <hi>Fear, Worship,</hi> or <hi>Service,</hi> which is resolved only into the <hi>Doctrines</hi> or <hi>Precepts of Men, Isa.</hi> 29. 13. so for men to pretend unto I know not what <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Light</hi> and <hi>Readiness</hi> unto all <hi>Holiness,</hi> from a Principle <hi>within,</hi> without Respect unto the <hi>Commands</hi> of God <hi>without,</hi> as given in his
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:48389:274"/>
                  <hi>Word,</hi> is to make <hi>themselves</hi> this <hi>own God,</hi> and to despise Obedience unto him who <hi>is over all, God blessed for ever:</hi> Then are we the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God,</hi> Then are we the <hi>Disciples of Christ,</hi> when we doe <hi>what</hi> is Commanded us, and <hi>because</hi> it is Commanded us. And what we are not <hi>influenced unto</hi> by the Authority of God in his <hi>Commands,</hi> we are not <hi>principled for</hi> by the Spirit of God administred in the
<hi>Promises.</hi> Whatever Good any man doth in any Kind, if the <hi>Reason</hi> why he doth it be not Gods <hi>Command,</hi> it belongs neither to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness nor Obedience. Our Enquiry therefore is, after those things in the <hi>Commands of God,</hi> which put such an <hi>indispensible Obligation</hi> upon us unto <hi>Holiness,</hi> as that whatever we may <hi>be</hi> or we may <hi>have</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, will be of no Use or Advantage unto us, as unto Eternal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness, or the Enjoyment of him.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> But to make our Way more <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>safe,</hi> one thing must yet be premised unto these Considerations. And this is, that <hi>Gods Commands</hi> for <hi>Holiness</hi> may be considered two wayes: (1) As they belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and are Parts of the <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> (2) As they belong and are inseparably annexed unto the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> In both respects they are <hi>materially</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> the same; that is, the same <hi>Things</hi> are required in them, and the same <hi>Person</hi> requires them, and so their
<hi>Obligation</hi> is Joynt and Equal. Not only the Commands of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> do oblige us unto Holiness, but those of the <hi>Old</hi> also, as to the Matter and Substance of them: But there is a great Difference in the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of these Commands, as considered so <hi>distinctly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, (1) The <hi>Commands</hi> of God as under the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> do so require <hi>universal Holiness</hi> of us, in all Acts, Duties and Degrees of them, that upon the least Failure, in Substance, Circumstance, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, they allow of nothing else we doe, but Determine us <hi>Trangressors of the whole Law.</hi> For with respect unto them, <hi>whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is Guilty of all, James</hi> 2. 10. Now I acknowledge, that although there ariseth from hence an <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation unto Holiness,</hi> to them who are under that Covenant, and such a <hi>Necessity</hi> of it, as that without it they must certainly perish; yet no Argument of the Nature with those which I insist upon, can hence be taken to <hi>press</hi> us unto it. For no Arguments are <hi>forceable</hi> unto this Purpose, but such as include <hi>Encouragements</hi> in them unto what they urge. But <hi>that,</hi> this Consideration of the <hi>Command</hi> knoweth nothing of, seeing a <hi>Complyance</hi> with it is in our Lapsed Condition absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible; and for the Things that are so, we can have no Endeavours. And hence it is, that no man influenced only by the <hi>Commands</hi> of the Law, or first Covenant <hi>absolutely</hi> considered, whatever in particular he might be forced or compelled unto, did ever sincerely Ayme or Endeavour after <hi>universal Holiness.</hi>

                  <pb n="535" facs="tcp:48389:274"/> (2) The <hi>End</hi> why these Commands require all the Duties of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> of us, is that they may be our <hi>Righteousness before God,</hi> or that we may be <hi>Justified</hi> thereby. <hi>For Moses describeth the Righteousness which is of the Law, that the Man which doth those things shall live by them, Rom.</hi> 10. 5. that is, it requires of us all Duties of Obedience unto this <hi>End,</hi> that we may have <hi>Justification</hi> and Eternal <hi>Life</hi> by them. But neither on this Account can any such Argument be taken as those we enquire into. <hi>For the deeds of the Law no man can be justified: If thou Lord shouldest mark Iniquities, O Lord who shall stand? Psal.</hi> 130. 3. So prayes <hi>David, Enter not into Judgment with thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, for in thy sight shall no man living be justified, Psal. 143. 2. Rom.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. And if none can attain the End of the Command, as in this sense they cannot, what <hi>Argument</hi> can we take from thence to prevail with them unto Obedience? Whoever therefore presseth men unto <hi>Holiness,</hi> meerly on the <hi>Commands</hi> of the Law, and for the
<hi>Ends</hi> of it, doth but put them upon <hi>tormenting Disquietments,</hi> and deceive their Souls. However men are indispensibly <hi>obliged</hi> hereby, and must Eternally perish for want of what the Law so requires, who do not or will not by <hi>Faith</hi> comply with the <hi>only Remedy</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision that God hath made in this Case. And for this Reason are we necessitated to deny a <hi>Possibility of Salvation</hi> unto all to whom the Gospel is <hi>not preached,</hi> as well as unto those by whom it is <hi>refused.</hi> For they are left unto this Law, whose <hi>Precepts</hi> they cannot answer, and whose <hi>End</hi> they cannot attain.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> It is otherwise on both these Accounts with the <hi>Commands</hi> of God for Holiness under the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> or in the Gospel. For,</p>
               <p>(1) Although God in them requireth <hi>universal Holiness</hi> of us, yet he doth not do it in that strict and <hi>rigorous</hi> way as by the <hi>Law,</hi> so as that if we fail in any thing either as to the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi> of its performance, in the Substance of it, or as to the Degrees of its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that thereon both that and all we doe besides, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. But he doth it with a <hi>Contemperation</hi> of <hi>Grace and Mercy,</hi> so as that if there be an universal <hi>sincerity,</hi> in a Respect unto <hi>all</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he both pardoneth many sins, and accepts of what we doe, though it come short of <hi>Legal Perfection;</hi> both on the Account of the
<hi>Mediation</hi> of Christ. Yet this hindreth not, but that the <hi>Law</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Gospel</hi> doth still require <hi>universal Holiness</hi> of us, and a Perfection therein, which we are to do our utmost Endeavour to comply withall, though we have a Relief provided in <hi>sincerity</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Mercy</hi> on the other. For the Commands of the Gospel doe still declare what God <hi>approves,</hi> and what he doth <hi>condemn,</hi> which is no less than <hi>all Holiness</hi> on the one hand, and all <hi>Sin</hi> on the other, as exactly and extensively as under the Law. For this the very <hi>Nature</hi> of God requireth, and the Gospel is not the <hi>Ministry of Sin,</hi> so as to give an <hi>Allowance</hi> or <hi>Indulgence</hi> unto the least, although in it Pardon be provided for a <hi>multitude</hi> of sins by Jesus Christ. The Obligation on us unto <hi>Holiness</hi> is Equal as unto what it was under the Law, though a <hi>Relief</hi> be provided where unavoidably we come short of it. There is therefore nothing more certain, than that there is no <hi>Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="536" facs="tcp:48389:275"/> given us as unto any Duty of <hi>Holiness,</hi> by the Gospel, nor any Indulgence unto the least sin. But yet upon the Supposition of the Acceptance of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and a <hi>perfection of Parts,</hi> instead of <hi>Degrees,</hi> with the <hi>Mercy</hi> provided for our Failings and Sins; there is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to be taken from the <hi>Command</hi> of it unto an indispensible <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness,</hi> including in it the highest <hi>Encouragement</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after it. For, together with the Command, there is also <hi>Grace administred,</hi> enabling us unto that Obedience which God will accept. Nothing therefore can avoid or evacuate the Power of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Argument from it, but a stubborn <hi>Contempt</hi> of God, arising from the Love of <hi>Sin.</hi>

<hi>Law</hi> did, namely, that thereby we might be <hi>Justified in the sight of God.</hi> For, whereas God now accepts from us an <hi>Holiness</hi> short of that which the Law required, if he did it still for the <hi>same End,</hi> it would reflect Dishonour upon his own <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>

               <p>For (First,) if God can accept of <hi>a Righteousness unto Justification</hi> inferiour unto, or short of what he required by the <hi>Law,</hi> how great severity must it be thought in him, to bind his Creatures unto such an exact <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> at first, as he could and might have dispensed withall? If he doth accept of <hi>sincere Obedience</hi> now unto our Justification, why did he not do so before, but obliged Mankind unto absolute Perfection according to the Law, for coming short wherein they all perished. Or shall we say, that God hath <hi>changed his Mind</hi> in this matter, and that he doth not stand so much now on <hi>rigid and Perfect Obedience</hi> for our Justification, as he did formerly? Where then is the Glory of his <hi>Immutability,</hi> of his <hi>Essential Holiness,</hi> of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
<hi>Rectitude</hi> of his <hi>Nature</hi> and Will?</p>

Must it not be looked on as a Doctrine <hi>less Holy</hi> than that of the <hi>Law?</hi> For whereas the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>absolute perfect sinless Holiness</hi> unto our Justification, the Gospel admits of that to the <hi>same End,</hi> on this Supposition, which is every way imperfect, and consistent with a multitude of Sins and Failings? What can be spoken more to the Derogation of it? Nay, would not this indeed make <hi>Christ the Minister of Sin,</hi> which our Apostle rejects with so much Detestation? <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 17. For to say, that he hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited that our <hi>imperfect Obedience,</hi> attended with many and great sins (<hi>for there is no man that liveth and sinneth not</hi>) should be accepted unto our <hi>Justification,</hi> instead of <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>sinless Obedience</hi> required under the Law, is plainly to make him the <hi>Minister of Sin,</hi> or one that hath acquired some Liberty for sin, beyond whatever the Law allowed. And thus upon the whole matter, both <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> in whom and whereby, God unquestionably designed to declare the
<hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> of his own <hi>Nature,</hi> much more Gloriously than ever he had done any other way, should be the great means to darken and obscure them. For in and by them on this Supposition, God must be be thought (and is declared) to accept of a <hi>Righteousness</hi>
                  <pb n="537" facs="tcp:48389:275"/> unto our Justification, <hi>unspeakably inferiour</hi> unto what he required before.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> It must be granted therefore, that the <hi>End</hi> of Gospel <hi>Commands</hi> requiring the Obedience of <hi>Holiness</hi> in us, is not, that thereby or <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we should be Justified.</hi> God hath therein provided another <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> for that End, which fully, perfectly, absolutely answers all that the Law requires; and on some Considerations is far more <hi>Glorious</hi> than what the Law either did or could require. And hereby hath he exalted more than ever the Honour of his own <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> whereof the External Instrument is the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which is also therefore most Holy: Now this is no other but the <hi>Righteousness of Christ imputed</hi> unto us; for he is the <hi>End of the Law for Righteousness unto them that do believe, Rom.</hi> 10. 4.

<hi>other Ends</hi> unto our <hi>Holiness,</hi> and so unto his <hi>Command</hi> of it, under the Gospel, all of them consistent with the Nature of that Obedience which he will accept of us, and such as we may attain through the Power of <hi>Grace,</hi> and so all of them offering new <hi>Encouragements</hi> as well as <hi>Enforcements</hi> unto our Endeavours after it. But because these
<hi>Ends</hi> will be the Subject of most of our <hi>ensuing Arguments,</hi> I shall not here insist upon them. I shall only adde two things in General. (1) That God hath <hi>no design</hi> for his own Glory, in us or by us, in this World or unto Eternity, that there is no <hi>especial Communion</hi> that we can have with him by Jesus Christ, nor any Capacity for us to enjoy him, but <hi>Holiness</hi> is Necessary unto it, as a <hi>Means</hi> unto its <hi>End.</hi> (2) These <hi>present Ends</hi> of it under the Gospel are such, as that God doth no less <hi>indispensibly require</hi> it of us now, than he did when our
<hi>Justification</hi> was proposed as the <hi>End</hi> of it. They are such in brief, as God upon the Account of them judgeth meet to <hi>command us to be Holy</hi> in all Manner of <hi>Holiness,</hi> which what Obligation and Necessity it puts upon us so to be, we are now to enquire.</p>

<hi>necessary</hi> that we should be Holy, on the Account of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of Gods Command. <hi>Authority</hi> wherever it is <hi>just,</hi> and exerted in a due and equal Manner, carryeth along with it an <hi>Obligation</hi> unto Obedience.

If the <hi>Authority</hi> of Parents, Masters and Magistrates, did not oblige Children, Servants and Subjects, unto <hi>Obedience,</hi> the World could not abide one moment out of <hi>Hellish Confusion.</hi> God himself maketh use of this Argument in general, to convince men of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> of Obedience. <hi>A Son honoureth his Eather, and a Servant his Master; if I then be a Father where is mine Honour, and if I be a Master where is my Fear, saith the Lord of Hosts unto you Priests who despise my Name?

If in all particular Relations, where there is any thing of <hi>Superiority,</hi> which hath the least parcel of <hi>Authority</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying of it, <hi>Obedience</hi> is expected, and exacted; is it not due to me who have all <hi>Authority,</hi> of all Soveraign Relations in me towards you? And there are two things that enforce the <hi>Obligation</hi> from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on this Consideration, <hi>Jus imperandi,</hi> and <hi>Vis exequendi,</hi> both
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:48389:276"/> comprized in that of the Apostle <hi>James, ch. 4. v. 12. There is one Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, who is able to save and to destroy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. He who <hi>commands</hi> us to be Holy, is our <hi>Sovereign Law-giver;</hi> He that hath <hi>absolute</hi> Power to prescribe unto us what <hi>Lawes</hi> he pleaseth. When Commands come from them who have <hi>Authority,</hi> and yet are themselves also <hi>under Authority,</hi> there may be some secret Abatement of the <hi>Power</hi> of the Command. Men may think either to <hi>appeal</hi> from them, or one way or other <hi>subduct</hi> themselves from under their Power. But when the Power <hi>immediately commanding</hi> is <hi>Sovereign</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,</hi> there is no room for Tergiversation. The <hi>Command</hi> of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the absolute Power of a <hi>Sovereign Legislator.</hi> And where it is not complyed withall, the <hi>whole Authority of God,</hi> and therein God himself is <hi>despised.</hi> So God in many places calleth <hi>sinning</hi> against his Commands, the <hi>despising of him, Numb. 11. 20. 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 30. the
<hi>despising of his Name, Mal.</hi> 1. 6. the <hi>despising of his Commandement,</hi> and that in his <hi>Saints</hi> themselves, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 10.</p>

<hi>Sovereign Authority</hi> over us, and to live in Defiance of him. This <hi>state</hi> I suppose there are few who would be willing to be found in: To be constant <hi>Despisers</hi> of God, and Rebels against his <hi>Authority,</hi> is a Charge that men are not ready to own, and do suppose that those who are so indeed, are in a very ill Condition. But this and no better is the <hi>state</hi> of every one who is not <hi>holy,</hi> who doth not follow after <hi>Holiness.</hi> Yet so it is, propose unto men the true Nature of <hi>Evangelical Holiness,</hi> press them to the Duties wherein the Exercise of it doth consist, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them with <hi>Evidence</hi> as clear as the Light at Noon-day, that such and such Sins, such and such Courses wherein they live and walk, are absolutely inconsistent with it, and irreconcileable unto it, yet for the most part it is but <hi>little</hi> they will heed you, and <hi>less</hi> they will doe to answer your Exhortations.

<hi>Rebels</hi> against God, <hi>Despisers of him,</hi> that they have utterly broken the <hi>Yoke,</hi> and cast off his <hi>Authority,</hi> and they will <hi>defie</hi> you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<hi>revile</hi> you. But yet these things are inseperable; God having given his <hi>Command</hi> unto men to be Holy, declared his <hi>Sovereign Will</hi> and Pleasure therein, if we are not so accordingly, we are not one Jott better than the Persons described. Here then in the first place we found the <hi>Necessity of Holiness,</hi> on the <hi>Command</hi> of God. The <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> wherewith it is accompanyed, makes it <hi>Necessary:</hi> Yea, from hence if we endeavour not to thrive in it, if we watch not diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against every thing that is contrary unto it, we are therein and so far <hi>Despisers of God,</hi> and his <hi>Name,</hi> as in the places before cited.</p>

               <p>But (2) I suppose it is a <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Eternal Rewards and Punishments,</hi> that is principally here intended. The <hi>Killing</hi> here, is that mentioned by our Saviour, and opposed to all <hi>Temporal</hi> Evil, and Death it self,
<hi>Matth. 10. 28. Fear not them who can kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but rather fear him who is able to destroy both Soul and Body in Hell.</hi> And this <hi>keeping alive,</hi> is a Deliverance from the <hi>Wrath to come</hi> in Everlasting Life. And this is that which gives an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Efficacy to the <hi>Command.</hi> Every Command of a Superiour doth
<hi>tacitly include</hi> a <hi>Reward</hi> and <hi>Punishment</hi> to be intended. For a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is made of what is <hi>pleasing</hi> and what is <hi>displeasing</hi> unto him that gives the <hi>Command;</hi> and therein is there a virtual Promise and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> But there are two Reasons why for for the most part they do but little <hi>influence</hi> the Minds of Men who are inclined unto their <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</hi> (1) The first is, that the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> declared, are such as men think they do justly preferre their own <hi>satisfaction</hi> in the Transgression of the Lawes, before them. It is so will all <hi>Good men,</hi> with respect unto Lawes made contrary to the Lawes of God; and <hi>Wise men</hi> also may do so with respect unto <hi>useless Lawes,</hi> with trifling Penalties; and <hi>Evil men</hi> will do so with respect unto the <hi>highest Temporal Punishments,</hi> when they are greedily set on the satisfaction of their Lusts. Hence I say it is in the first place, that the Minds of men are so little influenced with those <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> that are annexed unto Humane Lawes. And (2<hi rend="sup">dly,</hi>) a <hi>secret Apprehension</hi> that the <hi>Commanders</hi> or Makers of the Lawes, neither will nor are able to
<hi>execute</hi> those <hi>Penalties</hi> in the case of their Transgression, evacuates all the
<hi>Force</hi> of them. Much they ascribe to their <hi>Negligence,</hi> that they <hi>will not</hi> take Care to see the <hi>Sanction</hi> of their Lawes executed; more to their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> that they <hi>shall not be able</hi> to find out their Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and somewhat in sundry Cases to <hi>their Power,</hi> that they <hi>cannot</hi> Punish nor Reward, though they would. And for these Reasons are the Minds of men little influenced by <hi>Humane Lawes</hi> beyond their own honest Inclinations and Interest. But things are quite otherwise with respect unto the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Commands</hi> of God that we should be <hi>Holy.</hi> The <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> called by the Apostle <hi>Killing</hi> and <hi>Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive,</hi> being <hi>Eternal,</hi> in the highest Capacities of <hi>Blessedness</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,</hi> cannot be Ballanced by any Consideration of this present World, without the highest Folly and Villany unto our selves. Nor can there be any Reserve on the Account of <hi>Mutability, Indifferency, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Impotency,</hi> or any other Pretence, that they shall not be Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. Wherefore, the <hi>Commands</hi> of God which we are in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of, are accompanyed with <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Threatnings,</hi> of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Blessedness</hi> on the one hand, or of <hi>Misery</hi> on the other. And these
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:48389:277"/> will certainly befall us, according as we shall be found <hi>Holy</hi> or <hi>Vnholy.</hi> All the Properties of the <hi>Nature</hi> of God are immutably engaged in this matter; and hence ensues an <hi>indispensible Necessity</hi> of our being
<hi>Holy.</hi> God <hi>commands</hi> that we should be so, but what if we are not so? Why as sure as <hi>God is Holy and Powerfull</hi> we shall Eternally perish, for with the Threatning of that <hi>Condition,</hi> is his <hi>Command</hi> accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Case of Disobedience. What if we doe comply with the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> and become <hi>holy?</hi> Upon the same ground of <hi>Assurance,</hi> we shall be brought unto <hi>Everlasting Felicity.</hi> And this is greatly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Commandement. Some perhaps will say, that to yield <hi>holy Obedience</hi> unto God with respect unto <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> is <hi>servile,</hi> and becomes not the <hi>free spirit</hi> of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. But these are vain Imaginations: The <hi>Bondage</hi> of our own <hi>spirits</hi> may make every thing we doe <hi>servile.</hi> But a due Respect unto Gods <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Threatnings,</hi> is a principal part of our <hi>Liberty.</hi> And thus doth the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness,</hi> which we are engaged in the Demonstration of, depend on the <hi>Command</hi> of God, because of that
<hi>Authority</hi> from whence it doth proceed, and wherewith it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed. It is therefore certainly our Duty, if we would be found walking in a Course of <hi>Obedience,</hi> and the Practice of <hi>Holiness,</hi> to keep a <hi>sence</hi> hereof constantly fixed on our Minds. This is that which in the first place God intends in that great Injunction of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Gen. 17. 1. I am God Almighty, walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> The way to walk <hi>uprightly,</hi> to be sincere or <hi>perfect</hi> in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is alwayes to consider, that he who requires it of us is <hi>God Almighty,</hi> accompanyed with all the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and under whose Eye we are continually. And in <hi>particular</hi> we may apply this unto <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Occasions.</hi>

The first are the <hi>Poor;</hi> And it is their <hi>Folly, Stupidity</hi> and sensual <hi>Lusts,</hi> that keep them off from attending to the Command. <hi>Jerem. 5. 3, 4. They have refused to receive Correction, they have made their Faces barder than a Rock, they have refused to return; therefore I said, Surely these are Poor, they are sottish, for they know not the Way of the Lord, nor the Judgement of their God.</hi> There are a sort of <hi>poor</hi> incorrigible Sinners, whose Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency ariseth much out of their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> Blindness and Folly, which they please themselves in, although they differ but little from the <hi>Beasts that perish.</hi> And such do we abound withall, who will take no Pains for, who will admit of no Means of <hi>Instruction.</hi> But there is another <hi>sort</hi> of Sinners to whom the Prophet makes his Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and discovers the Ground of their incorrigible Impenitency also; <hi>I will get me to the Great men, and will speak unto them, for they have known the Way of the Lord, and the Judgement of their God; v.</hi> 5. Great men, by Reason of their <hi>Education</hi> and other Advantages, do attain unto a Knowledge of the <hi>Will of God,</hi> or at least may be thought
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:48389:278"/> so to have done, and would be esteemed to excell therein. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not likely to be Obstinate in sin, meerly from <hi>stupid Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and Folly. No, saith the Prophet, they take another Course.
<hi>They have altogether broken the Yoke, and burst the Bonds.</hi> They are like a Company of rude Beasts of the Field, who having broken their Yokes and Cords, do run up and down the Fields, treading down the Corn, breaking up the Fences, pushing with the Horn, and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on all before them. This is the Course of men in the Pursuit of their Lusts, when they have <hi>broken the Yoke of the Lord.</hi> And this the Prophet declares to be the <hi>especial Evil</hi> of Great Men, the Rich, the Mighty, the Honourable in the World. Now this <hi>Breaking of the Yoke,</hi> is the Neglecting and Despising of the <hi>Authority</hi> of God in the Command. Seeing therefore that this is the <hi>especial Temptation</hi> of that sort of Persons, and Things innumerable there are of all sorts, that concurre to render that Temptation prevalent upon them, let all those who are of that Condition, and have the least sincere Desire after
<hi>Holiness,</hi> watch diligently, as they love and value their Souls, to keep alwayes and in all things, a due Sence of the <hi>Authority</hi> of God in his Commands upon their Minds and Consciences. When you are in the

Remember, that it is your <hi>especial Temptation</hi> to doe otherwise. And if you do yet abhorre those who by this Means are come to be <hi>Sons of Belial,</hi> or such as have altogether <hi>broken the Yoke,</hi> and run up and down the World in the pursuit of their Lusts, saying,

<hi>good</hi> and <hi>usefull</hi> unto us, and that our Complyance with them is our <hi>present,</hi> as well as it will be our <hi>future</hi> Happiness.

For, if they should exceed all the
<hi>Strength</hi> which we either have, or he is pleased to give unto us, they would be like the <hi>Jewish Ceremonies,</hi> a Yoke which we could not bear, and a Law not only <hi>grievous</hi> but <hi>unprofitable.</hi> But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, our Apostle expressely affirms, and so may we, <hi>that he could do all things,</hi> that is, in the Way and Manner, and unto the End for which they are required in the Gospel, <hi>through Christ that strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</hi> Some would confound these things, and cast all into Disorder. They would have men that are under the <hi>Old</hi> Covenant, to have a Power and <hi>spiritual</hi> Strength to fulfill the Commands of the <hi>New,</hi> which God hath never spoken of nor declared, and which indeed is contrary to the whole Design of his <hi>Grace.</hi> They would have men, who having broken the <hi>Old</hi> Covenant, and forfeited all their Strength and Ability which they had by it for Obedience, and are not initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>New</hi> Covenant, yet to have a Power of their own to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Command of the one or the other, which God neither giveth nor is obliged to give, nor is it necessary to prove that the <hi>Command is Equal and Holy.</hi> For, as was observed, God giveth us no <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> but in, with, and by vertue of some <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> And there is no more required to prove them to be <hi>just and equal,</hi> but that they are <hi>easie</hi> unto them who walk with God in that Covenant whereunto they do belong, and that, that <hi>Performance</hi> of them shall be accepted which they have <hi>Power</hi> for.

<hi>Power</hi> to answer its <hi>Commands.</hi> Nor doth it belong unto the <hi>Equity</hi> of the Command of the <hi>New</hi> Covenant, that those who are not yet made partakers of it by <hi>Grace,</hi> should have <hi>Power</hi> to fulfill them. Nay, if they had so, and should do so accordingly, (were any such thing possible) it would not avail them.

<pb n="545" facs="tcp:48389:279"/> the Performance of the <hi>Commands</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> Covenant in the Way and Manner which are required therein, would not avail them who are really under the Rule and Law of the <hi>Old,</hi> which admits of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing short of <hi>absolute perfection.</hi> But what the <hi>Law speaks, it speaks unto them that are under the Law;</hi> and what the <hi>Gospel</hi> speaks, it speaks unto them who <hi>who are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> And the

<hi>possible</hi> unto them both for Matter and Manner, by vertue of that Strength and Power which was concreated with them, but <hi>easie</hi> and

<hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude.</hi> When by the <hi>Fall</hi> this <hi>Covenant</hi> was broken, we lost therewith all <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> to comply with its Commands in <hi>holy</hi> Obedience. Hereupon, the <hi>Law continued holy, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, holy, just and good,</hi> as our Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. For what should make it otherwise, seeing there was no Change in it by <hi>Sin,</hi> nor did God require <hi>more</hi> or <hi>harder</hi> things of us than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?

And so <hi>the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was Ordained to Life, we find to be unto Death, Rom.</hi> 7. 10. Towards all therefore that remain in that State, we say, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is still <hi>just</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> but it is neither <hi>easie</hi> nor <hi>possible.</hi> Hereon God brings in the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> by Christ, and renews therein the Commands for <hi>holy Obedience,</hi> as was before declared.

<hi>Almighty Grace</hi> effectually to <hi>enstate</hi> men in the <hi>New</hi> Covenant, and we shall contend with them or against them, that by vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they have that <hi>spiritual Strength</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> administred unto them, as render all the Commands of it to be not onely <hi>possible</hi> but <hi>easie</hi> also, yea <hi>pleasant,</hi> and every way suited unto the Principle of an <hi>Holy Life</hi> wherewith they are endued. And this we make an Argument for the
<hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness.</hi> The Argument we have under Consideration, is that whereby we prove the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> with respect unto <hi>Gods Command</hi> requiring it, because it is a Fruit of Infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> and
<hi>Goodness.</hi> It is so in an especial Manner as it belongs unto the <hi>New Covenant.</hi> And therefore by our Disobedience or living in Sin, unto the Contempt of Gods <hi>Authority,</hi> we adde that of his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and
<hi>Goodness</hi> also. Now that it is so a <hi>Fruit</hi> of them, appears in the <hi>first</hi>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:48389:280"/> place from hence, that it is <hi>proportioned</hi> unto the <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> which we have to <hi>Obey.</hi> Hence Obedience in Holiness becomes <hi>equal, easie,</hi> and <hi>pleasant</hi> unto all Believers who sincerely attend unto it. And this fully evinceth the <hi>Necessity</hi> of it, from the <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude</hi> of the contrary.

This is that which ruines the Attempt of many for <hi>Holiness,</hi> and renders what they doe, (though it be <hi>like</hi> unto the Acts and Duties of it) not <hi>at all to belong unto it.</hi> For, what we do in our <hi>own strength,</hi> is no part of <hi>Holiness;</hi> as is evident from the preceding Description of it. Neither doth the Scripture abound in any thing more, than in Testifying that the Power and Ability we have to fulfill the <hi>Commands</hi> of God as given in the <hi>New</hi> Covenant, is not <hi>our own,</hi> nor from our selves, but meerly from the <hi>Grace</hi> of God administred in that Covenant; as <hi>John. 15. 5. Phil. 2. 13. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 5. It will be said then, where lies the Difference? Because it is the meer Work of <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>instate us in the Covenant,</hi> you conclude that we have <hi>no power</hi> of our <hi>own</hi> to that Purpose. And if when we are in

I Answer: The <hi>first</hi> Work of Grace is meerly <hi>upon</hi> us. Hereby the Image of God is <hi>renewed,</hi> our Hearts are <hi>changed,</hi> and a Principle of spiritual Life is <hi>bestowed</hi> on us.

For the <hi>first;</hi> it is that which God so frequently, so expressely promiseth, where he sayes, that he will <hi>take away the Heart of Stone, and give us an Heart of Flesh, that he will write his Laws in our Hearts, and put his Fear in our inward parts;</hi> that we shall <hi>fear him,</hi> and <hi>never

It is sufficient unto our present Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that in and by these <hi>Promises,</hi> we are <hi>made partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> and are therein endowed with a constant <hi>Habitual Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> and <hi>Inclination</hi> unto all Acts and Duties of <hi>Holiness;</hi> For our

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>29</label> And here we may stay a little, to confirm our <hi>principal</hi> Assertion. Upon the Supply of this Grace, which gives both <hi>Strength</hi> for, and a constant <hi>Inclination</hi> unto Holy Obedience, the <hi>Command</hi> for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<hi>equal</hi> and <hi>just, meet</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to be complyed withall. For none can refuse a Complyance with it in any Instance, but their so doing is contrary unto that <hi>Disposition</hi> and <hi>Inclination</hi> of the <hi>New Nature</hi> which God hath implanted in themselves. So that in them to <hi>Sin,</hi> is not only contrary to the Law <hi>without</hi> them, to the Light of their
<hi>Minds,</hi> and Warning of their <hi>Consciences,</hi> but it is so also unto that which is their <hi>own Inclination</hi> and Disposition, which hath sensibly in such Cases a <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Violence</hi> put upon it, by the Power of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and Temptations. Wherefore, although the <hi>Command</hi> for
<hi>Holiness</hi> may and doth seem <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>burdensome</hi> unto Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Persons, as we have observed, because it is against the <hi>habitual bent</hi> and Inclination of their whole Souls; yet neither is it, nor can it be so unto them who cannot <hi>neglect</hi> it, or act any thing against it, but that therein also they must Crucifie and offer <hi>Violence</hi> unto the <hi>Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> of the <hi>New Creature</hi> in them, which are their own. For in all things, <hi>the Spirit lusteth against the Flesh, Gal.</hi> 5. 17. and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the <hi>New Creature</hi> is Habitually against <hi>Sin,</hi> and for <hi>Holiness.</hi> And this gives a mighty constraining Power unto the <hi>Command,</hi> when it is Evident in our own <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Consciences,</hi> that it requires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of us but what we do or may find an <hi>Inclination</hi> or Disposition in our own <hi>Hearts</hi> unto. And by this Consideration we may take in the <hi>Power</hi> of it upon our Souls, which is too frequently disregarded. Let us but upon the <hi>proposal</hi> of it unto us, consider what our Minds and Hearts say to it, what Answer they return, and we shall quickly discern how <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>just</hi> the <hi>Command</hi> is. For I cannot perswade my self, that any <hi>Believer</hi> can be so <hi>captivated</hi> at any time under the Power of Temptations, Corruptions, or Prejudices, but that (if he will but take Councel with his own Soul, upon the Consideration of the <hi>Command</hi> for <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and ask himself what he would have,) he will have a plain and sincere Answer, That indeed
<hi>I would doe and have the Good proposed,</hi> this <hi>Holiness,</hi> this Duty of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Not only will <hi>Conscience</hi> answer, that he must not do the <hi>Evil</hi> whereunto Temptation leadeth, for if he doth, Evil will ensue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the <hi>new Nature,</hi> and his Mind and Spirit will say, This <hi>Good I would doe,</hi> I delight in it, it is Best for me, most suited unto me. And so it joyns all the <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> in hath in the Soul, with the <hi>Command.</hi> See to this Purpose the Arguing of our Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 20, 21, 22. It is true, there is a <hi>Natural Light</hi> in Conscience, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the <hi>Command</hi> in its Proposal, and urging <hi>Obedience</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:48389:282"/> which doth not make it <hi>easie</hi> to us, but where it is alone, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth its <hi>Burden</hi> and our <hi>Bondage;</hi> For it doth only give in its Suffrage unto the <hi>Sanction</hi> of the Command, and addes to the <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> wherewith it is attended. But that <hi>Complyance</hi> with the <hi>Command</hi> which is from a <hi>Principle of Grace,</hi> is quite of another <hi>Nature,</hi> and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly facilitates Obedience. And we may distinguish between that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance</hi> with the Command which is from the <hi>Natural Light</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which <hi>genders unto Bondage,</hi> and that which being from a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Principle of Grace,</hi> gives <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Ease</hi> in Obedience. For, the first respects principally the <hi>Consequent</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> or <hi>Disobedience,</hi> the Good or Evil that will ensue upon them; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. Set aside this Consideration, and it hath no more to say: But the latter respects the <hi>Command</hi> it self, which it embraceth, delighteth in, and judgeth
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> with the Duties themselves required, which are <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and suited thereunto.</p>

                  <pb n="551" facs="tcp:48389:282"/> 6. 6, 7, 8.

I know not what vain Imaginations have seemed to possess the Minds of some, that they have no need of Respect unto the <hi>Command,</hi> nor to the <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Threatnings</hi> of it, but to Obey meerly from the Power and Guidance of an <hi>inward</hi> Principle. Nay, some have supposed, that a Respect unto the <hi>Command</hi> would vitiate our Obedience, rendring it <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Servile.</hi> But I hope, That Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which hindred men from discerning the <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Complyance</hi> which is between the <hi>Principle</hi> of Grace in us, and the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Command</hi> upon us, is much taken away from all sincere Professors.

Some would make the <hi>Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to be their Rule, some in what they doe, look no further for their Measure than what carryes the Reputation of <hi>common Honesty</hi> among men. He that would be <hi>holy</hi> indeed, must alwayes mind the <hi>Command</hi> of God, with that Reverence and those Affections which become him to whom God speaks immediately. And that it may be Effectual towards us, we may consider:</p>

He doth not give out unto us a <hi>single Command</hi> that we should be <hi>Holy,</hi> (which yet were sufficient to Oblige us for ever) but he gives his Commands unto that Purpose, <hi>Line upon line, line upon line, precept upon precept, precept upon precept.</hi> He that shall but look over the Bible, and see almost every Page of it filled with <hi>Commands,</hi> or <hi>Directions,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions</hi> for <hi>Holiness;</hi> cannot but conclude, that the Mind and <hi>Will</hi> of God is very much in this matter, and that our Concernment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is inexpressible. Nor doth God content himself to <hi>multiply Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> in General, that we should be <hi>Holy,</hi> so as that if we have Regard unto him they may never be out of our Remembrance, but there is

<hi>especial</hi> Commands for that also. No man can instance in the least Duty that belongs directly unto it, but it falls under some <hi>especial</hi> Command of God. We are not only then under the Command of God in <hi>general,</hi> and that often reiterated unto us, in an awfull Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence whereof we ought to walk, but upon all Occasions, whatever we have to do or avoid in following after <hi>Holiness,</hi> is represented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in <hi>especial</hi> Commands to that purpose. And they are all of them a Fruit of the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> of God towards us. Is it not then our Duty alwayes to consider these <hi>Commands,</hi> to bind them unto our Hearts, and our Hearts to them, that nothing may seperate them? Oh that they might alwayes dwell in our Minds, to influence them unto an inward constant Watch against the first Disorders of our Souls, that are unsuited to the <hi>inward Holiness</hi> God requires, abide with us in our Closets, and all our Occasions for our Good.</p>

Hence are they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with Exhortations, Entreaties, Reasonings, Expostulations, Promises, Threatnings, all made use of to fasten the Command upon our Minds and Consciences.

Were these things to be treated of severally, it is manifest how great a part of the <hi>Scripture</hi> were to be transcribed. I shall therefore only take a little Notice of the <hi>Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement</hi> of the <hi>Command</hi> for <hi>Holiness,</hi> by those especial <hi>Promises</hi> which are given unto it. I do not intend now the <hi>Promises</hi> of the Gospel in
<hi>general,</hi> wherein in its own Way and Place we are interested by <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> but of such <hi>peculiar</hi> Promises as God enforceth the <hi>Command</hi> by. It is not for nothing that it is said, that <hi>Godliness hath the Promise of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come; 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 8. There is in all the Promises an <hi>especial Respect</hi> unto it, and it gives them in whom it is an <hi>especial Interest</hi> in all the Promises.</p>

<hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Heart.</hi> So also it hath the <hi>Promises</hi> of <hi>this Life,</hi> and that in things <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>spiritual.</hi> In things <hi>temporal</hi> we may take out from amongst many that <hi>especial Instance</hi> given us by the <hi>Psalmist; Blessed is he that considereth the Poor.</hi> Wisely to consider the <hi>poor</hi> in their Distress, so as to Relieve them according to our <hi>Ability,</hi> is a great Act and Duty of <hi>Holiness.</hi> He that doth this, saith the Psalmist, <hi>he is a

The Lord will preserve him and keep him alive, and he shall be Blessed on the Earth, and thou wilt not deliver him into the hand of his Enemies; the Lord will strengthen him upon the Bed of languishing, and thou wilt make all his Bed in his sickness, Psal.</hi> 41. 1, 2, 3. Many especial Promises in the most important <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns</hi> of this Life, are given unto the Right discharge of this one Duty. For <hi>Godliness hath the Promise of this Life.</hi> And other Instances might be multiplyed unto the same Purpose.

<hi>If ye do these things ye shall never fall, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 10. The Promise of <hi>Permanency</hi> in Obedience, with an absolute <hi>Preservation</hi> from all such Fallings into <hi>Sin</hi> as are inconsistent with the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> is affixed unto our <hi>Diligence</hi> in <hi>Holiness.</hi> And who knowes not how the <hi>Scripture</hi> abounds in Instances of this Nature?

<hi>For this purpose was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the Works of the Devil, 1 John</hi> 3. 8.

And for their <hi>Objects;</hi> the proper immediate Object of the <hi>Priestly Office</hi> is <hi>God</hi> himself, as is evident both from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Office, and its proper <hi>Acts.</hi> For as to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Office. <hi>Every Priest is taken from among men, and ordained for men in things pertaining unto God, that he may Offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for sins, Heb.</hi> 5. 1. A <hi>Priest</hi> is one who is appointed to deal with God, in the behalf of them for whom he executes his Office. And the Acts of the <hi>Priestly Office</hi> of Christ are two; <hi>Oblation</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>First;</hi> For the <hi>Priestly Office</hi> of Christ, all the proper Acts of it do
<hi>immediately</hi> respect God himself, as hath been declared. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he doth not by any <hi>Sacerdotal Act</hi> immediately and efficiently work Holiness in us. But the <hi>Effects</hi> of these <hi>Priestly Acts,</hi> that is, his
<hi>Oblation</hi> and <hi>Intercession,</hi> are of two sorts: (1) <hi>Immediate,</hi> such as respect God himself; as <hi>Attonement, Reconciliation, Satisfaction.</hi> In these consist the <hi>first</hi> and Fundamental End of the <hi>Mediation</hi> of Christ. Without a Supposition of these, all other things are rendred Useless. We can neither be <hi>sanctified</hi> nor <hi>saved</hi> by him, unless Sin be first <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated,</hi> and God <hi>attoned.</hi> But they are not of our present Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. (2) The <hi>Mediate Effects</hi> of Christs <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Acting respect us, and are also of two sorts. 1. <hi>Moral,</hi> as our <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>Sin. 2. Real,</hi> in our <hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Holiness.</hi> And hereunto as God doth Design them, so he Effecteth Holiness in all Believers, by vertue of the <hi>Oblation</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of Jesus Christ; Wherefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>immediate</hi> Actings of that Office respect God alone as their proper Object, yet the Vertue and Efficacy of them extend themselves unto our Sanctification and Holiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tit. 2. 14. He gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good Works.</hi> His <hi>giving himself for us,</hi> is the common Expression of his <hi>Offering</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Sacrifice to God as a Priest, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. And this he did not only that he might <hi>redeem us from Iniquity,</hi> from the Guilt of our Sins, and Punishment due unto them, which are regarded in <hi>Redemption,</hi> but also that he might <hi>purifie us</hi> to himself, <hi>sanctifie</hi> us, or make us Holy and Fruitfull, or Zealous of <hi>good</hi> Works. His Blood as through the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit</hi> he Offered himself unto God, <hi>purgeth our Consciences from dead Works, to serve the living God, Heb.</hi> 9. 14. There is <hi>a purging of Sin,</hi> which consists in the Legal Expiation of it, in <hi>making Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Heb.</hi> 1. 3. But the <hi>purging of a Sinner,</hi> or of the <hi>Conscience,</hi> is by Real Efficiency, in <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which is here declared to be one End of the <hi>Oblation</hi> of Christ. So where he is said to <hi>wash us from our Sins in his own Blood,</hi> namely, as <hi>shed</hi> and <hi>offered</hi> for us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. it is not only the Expiation of <hi>Guilt,</hi> but the Purification of <hi>Filth</hi> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>

I shall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that <hi>Holiness</hi> being one especial End for which Christ <hi>gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for us,</hi> or Offered himself unto God for us, without a Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:48389:285"/> thereof, it is impossible that we should have the least Evidence of an Interest in his <hi>Oblation</hi> as to any other End of it. And as for those who are never made <hi>Holy,</hi> Christ never <hi>dyed</hi> or <hi>Offered</hi> himself for them. I cannot understand what Advantage it is unto <hi>Religion,</hi> to affirm that the most of them for whom Christ dyed as a <hi>Priest,</hi> or offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself an <hi>Oblation</hi> to God, shall have no Benefit thereby as to
<hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Glory;</hi> and incomparably the most of them without any espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Fault of their own, as never <hi>hearing</hi> of him. Neither can I find in the Scripture a double Design of Christ, in giving himself for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; towards <hi>some,</hi> that they may be <hi>redeemed from all Iniquity</hi> and
<hi>purified</hi> to be his <hi>peculiar</hi> Ones; towards <hi>others,</hi> that they may yet be left under the <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of their Sins. And it evacuates the <hi>force</hi> of the <hi>Motive</hi> unto the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> from the Consideration of the <hi>Oblation</hi> of Christ, where men are taught that <hi>Christ offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Sacrifice</hi> for them who are never made <hi>Holy.</hi> Wherefore I say, no <hi>unholy person</hi> can have any certain Evidence that he hath an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the <hi>Oblation</hi> of Christ, seeing he gave himself to <hi>purifie them</hi> for whom he was Offered.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the <hi>Prophetical Office</hi> of Christ, the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Men</hi> alone are its immediate <hi>Object,</hi> and of all the Acts and Duties of it. He is therein Gods <hi>Legate</hi> and Ambassador, his Apostle and Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger unto us. Whatever he doth as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> he doth it with us and towards us in the <hi>Name</hi> of God. And there are two Parts or <hi>Works</hi> of Christ in this Office, relating onely to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> he taught: (1) The <hi>Revelation</hi> of God in his <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> in the Mystery of his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> by his <hi>Promises,</hi> that we may <hi>believe</hi> in him. (2) The <hi>Revelation</hi> of God in his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Commands,</hi> that we may <hi>obey</hi> him. For the <hi>first,</hi> wherein indeed his <hi>Prophetical</hi> Office was principally exercised, see <hi>John 1. 18. Chap. 1. 2. John</hi> 17. 6. The Revelation of the <hi>Preceptive Will</hi> of God made by Jesus Christ, may be considered two wayes. 1. As he was <hi>peculiarly</hi> sent to the <hi>House of Israel,</hi> the <hi>Minister of the Circumcision for the Truth of the Promises of God unto the Fathers, Rom.</hi> 15. 8. (2) With respect unto the <hi>whole Church</hi> of <hi>all Ages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1) The <hi>first,</hi> which took up much of his <hi>personal Ministry</hi> in the Flesh, consisted in the Declarations, Exposition, and Vindication that he gave unto the Church of <hi>Divine Precepts</hi> for Obedience, which had been given before. God had from the Beginning, and in especial Manner at the Promulgation of the <hi>Law</hi> on <hi>Sinai,</hi> and the ensuing Expositions of it by the Prophets, given Excellent Precepts for <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> But the People unto whom they were given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>carnal,</hi> they were not able to bear the <hi>spiritual Light</hi> and <hi>Sence</hi>
                  <pb n="557" facs="tcp:48389:285"/> of them, which was therefore greatly Veyled under the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> Not only the <hi>Promises,</hi> but the <hi>Precepts</hi> also of the <hi>Law,</hi> were then but obscurely apprehended. Besides, the Church being grown corrupted, there were solemn Expositions of Gods Commands received amongst them, whose sole Design was to <hi>accommodate</hi> them unto the Lusts and Sins of men, or to <hi>exempt</hi> men if not totally, yet in many Instances from an Obligation unto Obedience to them. Our Blessed Saviour applyes himself in the Discharge of his <hi>Prophetical Office</hi> with respect unto the <hi>End</hi> of the Command, which is our <hi>Holy Obedience,</hi> unto both these, in the Declaration of its Excellency and Efficacy.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> And (<hi>first</hi>) he declares the <hi>inward spiritual Nature</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> with its respect unto the most secret Frames of our Hearts and Minds, with the least Disorder or Irregularity of our Passions and Affections. And then (<hi>secondly</hi>) he declares <hi>the true Sence of its Commands,</hi> their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Signification and Extent, vindicating them from all the corrupt and false Glosses which then passed current in the <hi>Church,</hi> whereby there was an Abatement made of their <hi>Efficacy,</hi> and an <hi>Indulgence</hi> granted unto the Lusts of Men. Thus they had by their <hi>Traditional Interpretation</hi> restrained the Sixth Commandment, <hi>Thou shalt not Kill,</hi> unto <hi>actual Murder;</hi> and the Seventh, <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adultery,</hi> unto <hi>actual Vncleanness;</hi> as some now would restrain the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment unto the <hi>Making of Images</hi> and <hi>Worshipping</hi> them, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>primary</hi> Intent of the Precept restraining all <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> unto <hi>Divine Institution.</hi> How in his <hi>Doctrine</hi> he took off these Corruptions, we may see <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 21, 22, 27, 28.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> Thus he restored the <hi>Law</hi> to its <hi>pristine Crown,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> have a Tradition that it shall be done in the Dayes of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Herein did the Lord Christ place the <hi>Beginning</hi> of his <hi>Prophetical Office</hi> and Ministry, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 6, 7. He opened, unveyled, explained and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<hi>the Preceptive part of the Will of God</hi> before Revealed, to the End that by a Complyance therewith we should be <hi>Holy.</hi> The full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Mind and Will of God in the <hi>Perfection and Spirituality</hi> of the <hi>Command,</hi> was reserved for Christ in the Discharge of his Office. And he gave it unto us, that we might have a perfect and compleat Rule of <hi>Holiness.</hi> This therefore was the <hi>immediate End</hi> of this Work or Duty of the <hi>Office</hi> of Christ. And where we Answer it not, we reject that great <hi>Prophet</hi> which God hath sent, to which <hi>Excision</hi> is so severely threatned.</p>

Hence are they called <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Commandements in distinct sences; such are <hi>Faith</hi> in God through himself, <hi>Brotherly love, Denyal</hi> of our <hi>selves</hi> in taking up the Cross, doing <hi>Good</hi> for <hi>Evil,</hi> with
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:48389:286"/> some others of the same Kind: And how a great part of <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> consists in these things, is known. Besides, he also teacheth us all those <hi>Ordinances of Worship</hi> wherein our Obedience unto him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto our <hi>Holiness</hi> also; whereby it is enlarged and promoted. This I say is the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Prophetical</hi> Office of Christ, wherein he Acts towards us from God, and in his <hi>Name,</hi> as to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the <hi>Will of God</hi> in his <hi>Commands.</hi> And it is our <hi>Holiness</hi> which is his only End and Design therein.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> There are three things considerable in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> that Christ teacheth. (1) That it reacheth the <hi>Heart</hi> it self, with all its <hi>inmost</hi> and <hi>secret Actings,</hi> and that in the <hi>first</hi> place. The Practice of <hi>most</hi> goes no further but unto <hi>Outward Acts;</hi> the Teachings of many goe no further, or at <hi>best</hi> unto the <hi>Moderation of Affections.</hi> But he in the <hi>first</hi> place requires the <hi>Renovation</hi> of our <hi>whole Souls,</hi> in all their Faculties, Motions and Actings, into the <hi>Image</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 1. Ephes.</hi> 4. 23, 24, 25. (2) It is <hi>Extensive.</hi> There is nothing in any kind pleasing to <hi>God,</hi> conformable to his <hi>Mind,</hi> or complyant with his <hi>Will,</hi> but he <hi>requires</hi> it; nothing <hi>crooked,</hi> or <hi>perverse,</hi> or <hi>displeasing</hi> to God, but it is <hi>forbidden</hi> by him. It is therefore a <hi>perfect Rule</hi> of Holiness and Obedience. (3) <hi>Clearness, Perspicuity</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of Divine

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label>(First.) Hereby I say, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Christ for <hi>universal Obedience,</hi> in all the Duties of it, becomes to be <hi>absolute,</hi> every way <hi>compleat</hi> and
<hi>perfect.</hi> And it is a notable Effect of the <hi>Atheistical</hi> Pride of Men, that pretending to design <hi>Obedience</hi> (at least in <hi>Moral Duties</hi>) unto God, they betake themselves unto other Rules and Directions, as either more <hi>plain</hi> or <hi>full,</hi> or <hi>efficacious,</hi> than those of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which are the <hi>Teachings</hi> of Christ himself, as the great <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Apostle</hi> sent of God to instruct us in our Duty. Some goe to the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> and the Use of <hi>Right Reason,</hi> that is, their <hi>own,</hi> as their <hi>Guide;</hi> and some adde the <hi>Additional Documents</hi> of the <hi>Philosophers:</hi> They think a Saying of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> or <hi>Seneca;</hi> or <hi>Arrianus,</hi> being wittily suited to their Fancies and Affections, to have more <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> in it than any <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> The Reason why these things are more pleasing unto them than the <hi>Commands</hi> and <hi>Instructions</hi> of Christ, is because proceeding from the Spring of <hi>Natural Light,</hi> they are suited to the Workings of natural Fancy and Understanding; but those of Christ proceeding from the <hi>Fountain</hi> of Eternal <hi>spiritual Light,</hi> are not comprehended in their Beauty and Excellency, without a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the same <hi>Light</hi> in us, guiding our <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our <hi>Affections.</hi> Hence take any Precept <hi>general</hi> or <hi>particular</hi> about

Such a Contempt have men risen unto of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, and the great <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Church.

<pb n="559" facs="tcp:48389:286"/> which God made use of in the <hi>giving of the Law.</hi> For he gave the <hi>Law</hi> by the <hi>Ministry of Angels,</hi> who being meer Creatures, he manifested the Dread of his own Presence among them, to give <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> unto their Ministrations. But when he came to Reveal his <hi>Will</hi> under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> it being to be done by him in <hi>whom dwelt the Fulness of the Godhead Bodily,</hi> and who was intrusted himself with all Divine Power, he did no more but <hi>indigitate</hi> or declare which was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and give us a <hi>Command</hi> in General to <hi>hear him.</hi> And this he did with respect unto what he had fixed before as a Fundamental Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Heaven, namely, that <hi>when he should raise up and send the great Prophet of the Church,</hi> whosoever would not <hi>hear</hi> him should be <hi>cut off from the people.</hi> A Complyance therefore with this <hi>Command,</hi> in
<hi>hearing the Voyce of Christ,</hi> is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all Holiness and Gospel Obedience. And if men will be moved neither with the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> nor

<pb n="560" facs="tcp:48389:287"/> take them for an undoubted and infallible <hi>Rule.</hi> There are some ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Commands I acknowledge, so clear in the Light of <hi>Nature,</hi> as that no question can be made, but that what is required in them is our Duty to perform: Such are they, that God is to be <hi>loved,</hi> that others are not to be <hi>injured,</hi> that every ones <hi>Right</hi> is to be rendred unto him, whereunto all Reasonable Creatures do assent at their first Proposal. And where any are found to live in an open Neglect or seem to be Ignorant of them, their Degeneracy into <hi>Beastiality</hi> is open, and their Sentiments not at all to be regarded. But goe a little further, and you will find all the great <hi>Moralists</hi> at endless uncertain Disputes about the <hi>Nature</hi> of Vertue in general, about the <hi>Offices</hi> and
<hi>Duties</hi> of it, about the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Measures</hi> of their Practice. In these Disputes did most of them consume their Lives, without any great Endeavours to express their own <hi>Notions</hi> in their <hi>Conversations.</hi>

<hi>Moralists</hi> seem to care for nothing but the <hi>Name; Vertue</hi> it self is grown to be a <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>uncouth</hi> thing. But what is commanded us by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> there is no room for the least <hi>haesitation</hi> whether it be an infallible Rule for us to attend unto or no. Every Precept of his about the meanest Duty, is equally certain and infallibly declarative of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> of that Duty, as those of the greatest, and that have most Evidence from the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> If once it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that Christ requires any thing of us by his <hi>Word,</hi> that he hath taught us any thing as the <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Church, there is no Doubt remains with us, whether it be our Duty or no.</p>
               <p>(3) The whole <hi>Rule</hi> of Duties given by the most <hi>improved Light</hi> of Nature, setting aside those that are purely <hi>Evangelical,</hi> which some despise, is <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>partial.</hi> There are sundry <hi>Moral</hi> Duties which I instanced in before, which the Light of Nature as it remains in the lapsed depraved Condition of it, never extended it self to the Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of. And this <hi>Obscurity</hi> is evident from the Differences that are about its <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Directions.</hi> But now as the <hi>Revelation</hi> made by Christ, and his Commands therein, is Commensurate unto Universal Obedience, and gives Bounds unto it, so that there is no Duty of it but what he hath commanded, and it is sufficient to discharge the most specious Pleas and Pretences of any thing to be a Duty towards God or Man, by shewing that it is not required by him; so his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Directions are <hi>plain</hi> and evidently <hi>perspicuous.</hi> I dare chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the greatest and most Learned <hi>Moralists</hi> in the World, to give an Instance of any one Duty of <hi>Morality,</hi> confirmed by the Rules and Directions of the highest and most Contemplative <hi>Moralist,</hi> that I will not shew and evince, that it is more plainly and clearly required by the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> in the Gospel, and pressed on us by far more <hi>effectual</hi> Motives than any they are acquainted withall. It is therefore the highest <hi>Folly</hi> as well as <hi>Wickedness,</hi> for Men to design, plead, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Learning Duties of <hi>Obedience</hi> from others rather than from Christ the <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Church.</p>

<pb n="561" facs="tcp:48389:287"/> say <hi>Who teacheth like him?</hi> There was that Eminency in his <hi>personal Ministry</hi> whilest he was on the Earth, as filled all men with Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence it is said, that <hi>he taught with Authority, and not as the Scribes, Matth.</hi> 7. 29. and another while <hi>they wondred at the Gracious words which he uttered, Luke</hi> 4. 22. And the very <hi>Officers</hi> that were sent to apprehend him for Preaching, came away astonished, saying,
<hi>Never man spake like this Man, John</hi> 7. 46. It is true, it was not the Design of God, that Multitudes of that hardned Generation should be Converted by his <hi>personal Ministry, John</hi> 12. 38, 39, 40. as having another to fulfill <hi>in</hi> them, <hi>by</hi> them, and <hi>upon</hi> them; yet it is evident from the Gospel, that there was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Divine Power</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying his <hi>Ministerial</hi> Instructions. Yet this is not that which I intend, but his continued and <hi>present Teaching</hi> of the Church by his
<hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> He gives that Power and Efficacy unto it, as that by its Effects every day it demonstrates it self to be from God, being accompanyed with the Evidence and Demonstration of a <hi>spiritual Power</hi> put forth in it. This the Experiences, Consciences, and Lives of Multitudes bear witness unto continually. They do and will to Eternity attest what <hi>Power</hi> his <hi>Word</hi> hath had to <hi>enlighten</hi> their Minds, to <hi>subdue</hi> their Lusts, to <hi>change</hi> and renew their Hearts, to <hi>relieve</hi> and
<hi>comfort</hi> them in their Temptations and Distresses, with the like Effects of Grace and Power.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> This also is one great <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Kingly Power</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> For as such doth he <hi>subdue</hi> our Enemies, and preserve our Souls from Ruine. And those are our Adversaries, which fight against our <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Condition</hi> and Safety; such principally are our <hi>Lusts,</hi> our <hi>Sins,</hi> and our <hi>Temptations</hi> wherewith they are accompanyed. These doth our Lord Christ subdue by his <hi>Kingly Power,</hi> quickening and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening in us by his Aids and Supplyes of Grace, all Principles of <hi>Holy</hi> Obedience. In brief; the Work of Christ as a <hi>King</hi> may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto these Heads. (1) To make his Subjects <hi>free.</hi> (2) To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them in <hi>safety,</hi> delivering their Souls from Deceit and Violence. (3) In giving them <hi>Prosperity,</hi> and encreasing their Wealth. (4) In establishing assured <hi>Peace</hi> for them. (5) In giving them <hi>Love</hi> among themselves. (6) In placing the <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Welfare</hi> of his Kingdom in all their <hi>Affections.</hi> (7) In Eternally <hi>Rewarding</hi> their <hi>Obedience.</hi> And all these he doth principally by working <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> in them, as might be easily demonstrated. I suppose none question but, that the principal Work of Christ towards us as our <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> is in <hi>making</hi> and <hi>preserving</hi> of us <hi>Holy.</hi> I shall not therefore further insist thereon.</p>
               <p>It remains that we improve these <hi>Considerations,</hi> unto the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our present Argument concerning the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Holiness.</hi>

This is the <hi>great Deceit</hi> whereby Sathan, that Enemy of the <hi>common Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> hath Ruined the Generality of Mankind who profess the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> The Gospel openly declares a Way of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> by Jesus Christ. This is thus farre admitted by all who are called
<hi>Christians,</hi> that they will allow of no other Way for the same <hi>End,</hi> unto competition with it. For I speak not of them who being <hi>profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> and hardened in Sins, are Regardless of all future Concernments; but I intend only such as in general have a desire to <hi>escape the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Hell,</hi> and to attain <hi>Immortality</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> And this they do at least <hi>profess</hi> to doe by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as supposing that the Things to this purpose mentioned in the Gospel, do belong unto them as well as unto others, because they also are <hi>Christians.</hi> But they consider not that there are certain <hi>Wayes and Means,</hi> whereby the Vertue and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all that the Lord Christ hath done for us, are conveyed to the Souls of men, whereby they are made partakers of them. Without these we have no Concernment in what <hi>Christ</hi> hath done or declared in the Gospel. If we expect to be <hi>saved</hi> by Christ, it must be by what he doth and hath done for us, as a <hi>Priest,</hi> a <hi>Prophet</hi> and a <hi>King:</hi>
                  <pb n="563" facs="tcp:48389:288"/> But one of the principal Ends of what he doth in all these, is to make us <hi>Holy;</hi> and if these be not effected in us, we can have no Eternal Benefit by any thing that Christ hath done or continueth to doe as the

<hi>Gospel,</hi> is greatly to be bewailed. They contract to themselves the
<hi>Guilt</hi> of the two greatest Evils that any Reasonable Creatures are liable unto in this World. For (1) they <hi>wofully deceive and ruine</hi> their own
<hi>Souls.</hi> Their whole Profession of the Gospel is but a Crying <hi>peace, peace,</hi> when <hi>sudden destruction</hi> lyes at the Door. They deny <hi>the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.</hi> They are
<hi>bought</hi> and <hi>vindicated</hi> into the Knowledge and Profession of the <hi>Truth,</hi> but in their <hi>Works</hi> they deny him whom in <hi>Words</hi> they own, <hi>whose Damnation sleepeth not.</hi> For men to live in Covetousness, Sensuality, Pride, Ambition, Pleasures, Hatred of the <hi>power</hi> of Godliness, and yet to hope for <hi>Salvation by the Gospel,</hi> is the most infallible Way to hasten and secure their own <hi>Eternal Ruine.</hi> And (2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>,) they cast the greatest <hi>Dishonour</hi> on <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that any Persons are capable of casting on them. Those by whom the Lord Christ is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as a <hi>Seducer,</hi> and the Gospel as a <hi>Fable,</hi> do not more (I may say not so much) dishonour the one and the other, as those doe, who professing to <hi>own</hi> them both, yet continue to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> in an
<hi>unholy Condition.</hi> For as to the <hi>open Enemies</hi> of Christ, they are judged and condemned already, and none have Occasion to think the worse of him or the Gospel for their Opposition unto them: But for those
<hi>others</hi> who profess to <hi>own</hi> them, they endeavour to represent the Lord Christ as a <hi>Minister of Sin,</hi> as one who hath procured Indulgence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men to live in their Lusts and Rebellion against God; and the Gospel as a Doctrine of <hi>Licenciousness</hi> and <hi>Wickedness.</hi> What else can any one learn from them concerning the one or the other? The whole Language of their Profession is, that Christ is such a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the Gospel such a <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> as that men loving Sin, and living in Sin, may be <hi>saved</hi> by them. This is that which hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected all kind of <hi>Dishonour</hi> on <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and put a stop unto its Progress in the World. These are they of whom our Apostle makes his bitter Complaint, <hi>Phil. 3. 18, 19. Many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the Enemies of the Cross of Christ, whose End is Destruction, whose God is their Belly, and whose Glory is in their Shame, who mind Earthly things.</hi> How many that are called <hi>Christians</hi> doth this Character suit in these dayes? Whatever they think of themselves, they are <hi>Enemies of the Cross of Christ,</hi> and do trample under their feet the <hi>Blood of the Covenant.</hi>

                  <hi>Lord Christ</hi> requireth and expecteth from his <hi>Disciples</hi> in this World.

<hi>unto him</hi> that so <hi>dyed for us,</hi> and by vertue of whose Death <hi>we live, Rom. 14. 7, 8, 9. He gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar People, zealous of good Works, Tit.</hi> 2. 14. But we need not to insist hereon. To deny that we ought to <hi>glorifie</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> Christ in the World, is to <hi>renounce</hi> him and the Gospel.

<hi>Death</hi> which he <hi>underwent.</hi> Concerning all these there ever was a great <hi>Contest</hi> in the World, and it is yet continued.

<hi>Death</hi> as justly <hi>deserved;</hi> which was the sence of the <hi>Pagan World,</hi> and the <hi>Apostate Judaical Church</hi> of Old, as it is of many at this Day.

This he calls all his Disciples to <hi>avow</hi> unto and <hi>express</hi> in the World, and by their so doing is he
<hi>glorified</hi> (and no otherwise) in a <hi>peculiar</hi> manner. A Testimony is to be given unto and against the World, that his <hi>Life</hi> was most <hi>Holy,</hi> his
<hi>Doctrine</hi> most <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> his <hi>Death</hi> most <hi>precious</hi> and <hi>Efficacious,</hi> and consequently that he was sent of God unto his great Work, and was accepted of him therein; Now all this is no otherwise done but by <hi>Obedience</hi> unto him in <hi>Holiness</hi> as it is <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>fruitfull.</hi> For,</p>
