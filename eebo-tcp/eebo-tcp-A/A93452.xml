            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Sober and Serious REPRESENTATION to ſuch as are or may be in POWER,
tending to the Happy Settlement of theſe Diſtracted NATIONS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Erſons in Power muſt remember that they are ſubject to like paſſions and imperfections with others, and that they are under very ſtrong tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
to Pride and Selfiſhneſs, and Wilfulneſs, againſt which they have need to keep a conſtant and ſevere watch; the rather becauſe
God hath by our late ſtrange and frequent mutations ſhewn unto us the inſtability of all earthly Power, in caſe they diſpleaſe God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
the people. This being premiſed, I take the boldneſs in all humility to ſuggeſt:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the great Wiſdome and Intereſt of Governours lies not in a violent reſtraining of Peoples hands, but in a ſweet prevailing
upon their hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That a Free State (of all Governments) can worſt be ſetled without engaging the affections of the generality of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and therefore the Rulers of it ought to make it their great deſign (as Chriſt did in his Church) to make them a willing People in the
day of their Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is not to be expected that the affections of people ſhould be regained and recovered from thoſe diſcontents, animoſities and prejudices (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are filled) in a moment; but it is a work of time, and to be done leaſurely, and a work which may be ſpoiled by Precipitation: As he that ſhall
ſcrue up a ſtring in an Inſtrument to the higheſt at firſt, ſhall break it in pieces, while another that brings it up by degrees, may ſafely raiſe it to an higher
pitch. Magiſtrates being Parents, muſt bear with their childrens weakneſſes, and pardon their frowardneſs, and not immediately reject all that do not at the
firſt word comply with all their deſires: Nor muſt they <hi>Jehu</hi>-like, drive on furiouſly; but rather with <hi>Jacob,</hi> conſider the tenderneſs of the children and
flocks, and lead them with gentle and eaſie marches, leſt if they be over-driven, they dye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the affections of people are not to be gained by ſome fair Expreſſions, and verbal Declarations, (in which the generality of men have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to put very little confidence) but by viſible Demonſtrations and effectual Actions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> That it is impoſſible to ſettle the Nation as a Free State, but upon the Baſis of the ſober party, the others b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing ſo inconſiderable in their numbers
and intereſt, (which therefore muſt be impoſed upon the reſt by an high hand, to their great regret, and with their great charge) ſo odious to the body of the
Nation,) which therefore would perpetuate diviſions and animoſities in the Nation, and ſo occaſion everlaſting Broils and Wars, and Hazards) ſo inconſiſtent
with themſelves, with their own principles, their own promiſes, and many times their own former actions, and ſo much reſolved to ſubject all Civil Affairs and
Intereſts to their own private conceptions in Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That it is vain and unreaſonable to imagine that a State may bottom it ſelf upon both Parties, there being ſuch a manifeſt impoſſibility of ſerving
two Maſters, eſpecially ſuch who are, and are like to be at ſo wide and irreconcileable a diſtance in their principles, ſpirits, deſigns and endeavours, that the
one will be continually provoking, ſubverting, and counter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> working the other, and thereby tear out the bowels of their common Mother, and weaken the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and make way for any Forraign Adverſary; (moſt perſons being more willing to be inſlaved by Forreigners, than by the baſeſt of their own people)
And that they will no more cement, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an the Ark and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gon could ſtand together, or than the Iron and Clay in <hi>Daniels</hi> Image could concorporate, (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality
of which mixture was one occaſion of its fall) And that State which ſeeks by ſuch a Syncretiſm to gain both, will indeed diſoblige both Parties, and
render their Government ungrateful to all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That together with Scripture and Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the experience of theſe times makes it evident, that no ſettlement is like to be had in the State, unleſs
there be ſome order and eſtabliſhment in the Church; the diſtempers in the one, ſo eaſily and univerſally paſſing into the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> That our preſent Rulers cannot more promote their own intereſt, than by diſcovering their own intentions in ſome ſignal and real way on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Miniſtry, Learning and Univerſities, and diſcountenancing that turbulent Generation of Quakers, Fifth Monarchy men, and Rigid Anabaptiſts,
(by whom having been diſturbed and deceived twice, it will be none of the wiſeſt actions to put them into a capacity of deceiving them the third time) that the
whole Nation may ſee that their Rulers do make a difference between ſuch modeſt and humble, and quiet ſouls, as through tenderneſs of conſcience and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
frailty, are overtaken with ſome errors of leſſer importance, and ſuch as overthrow the Faith, and ſubvert the foundations of Religion, and make no
bones of trampling upon our Laws. Liberties, Civil Authorities, and Principles of righteouſneſs, when they ſtand in the way of their particular opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> That they would be tender in the preſſing of Oaths, which have been ſo frequently urged, and ſo fearfully violated, that many are afraid even of
lawful Oaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in particular, that the Oath of Abjuration may not be preſſed, which</p>
            <p>1. Is unneceſſary and inſufficient; For, Suppoſe it not to be ſufficient, that is already done, to make it Treaſon for any man to move for the bringing
in of the Old Line; and ſuppoſe that the Magiſtrate ſhall think fit to impoſe an engagement upon Members of Parliament; Is not this enough without an Oath
of Abjuration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if men make conſcience, a bare engagement will be ſufficient; and if they make no conſcience, ten thouſand abjurations will have no hold
of them: And if the one being owned before a mans entrance into the Houſe, doth not tye him when he is entred, neither will the other: Let men be as cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as they can, when all is done as it is their duty that they ought; ſo it is neceſſary, they muſt truſt the Providence of God with future things.</p>
            <p>2. It is (at the leaſt ſeemingly) unlawful, as it is an appearance of the higheſt evil; <hi>viz,</hi> viſible breach of all Covenants, &amp;c. (And we know
even lawful things are to be avoided, when they have but an appearance of evil) as it is a real and great ſcandal, not only to ſuch as are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to the Old Royal Family, but to thouſands of others, (and they Perſons Sober and Judicious) And beſides, it is a confining of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
for who can ſay that the Affairs of the World, and of the Nation, may not be reduced to ſuch a poſture, that it may be not only lawful,
but alſo neceſſary to take in a Branch of that Family upon terms, and that that may be the only viſible means to prevent the total ruine of theſe three Nations?
Suppoſe one of that Line hereafter ſhall be, and by ſufficient and ſatisfying evidences appear to all People to be a Perſon truly Gracious, (as who can
tye the hands of Gods Grace?) and heartily ready to forgive all His Enemies, and (beſides that principal Security His ſuppoſed Godlineſs gives) to give what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
further Security can be deſired or had unto the Godly Party of the Nation; as alſo to thoſe that have purchaſed His Lands, that they ſhall enjoy them:
Suppoſe withall, That in Caſe of a Refuſal, all Neighbouring Princes and States reſolve to Contribute their Utmoſt and United Strength towards His Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
(which no Wiſe man will ſay is impoſſible) Suppoſe alſo that our Ships, the Walls of our Nation, are vanquiſh'd and broken, which (unleſs we
will with the Vain Spaniards, fancy them to be an Invincible Navy) muſt needs be allowed for a poſſibility: And ſuppoſe the hearts of the whole Nation, and the
beſt men moſt freely and fully towards Him: And Laſtly, That the then preſent (but now future) Magiſtrates by their Ungodly and Unrighteous, and Selfiſh
Carriages, ſhould render themſelves Odious to the whole Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which no man that conſiders the confeſſed Corruption and Degeneration of ſome, at leaſt of
the Magiſtrates of theſe laſt Times, can deny to be poſſible) I ſay in this Caſe, I ſuppoſe there would be no Pious and Publick-ſpirited Perſon but would judge it
his Duty to uſe all lawful Endeavours, if not for the Reſtauration of the whole Line, yet at leaſt for the Reſtitution of ſuch a Perſon, for which there could be
no way, but by the violation of that Oath which he had raſhly and ſinfully engaged himſelf in; thereby defrauding himſelf of that Liberty which God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had given him, and preventing himſelf in that Duty, which the ſaving of his Country from total and certain ruine may indiſpenſably require of him.</p>
            <p>3. It is againſt Rules of Prudence, and looks too like a ſecret deſign of ſome Extravagants in Religion, however others may be engaged in it, thereby to
provoke and irritate, and diſoblige the Sober Party in the Nation, (the moſt of whom may be gained by degrees, by the juſt and pious, and laudable actions
of their Magiſtrates) and craftily to oblige the State to lean again upon that broken Reed which hath ſo oft pierced into their hands: And it ſeems to be like the
opening of the wound again, when there is ſome tendency towards a cloſure; or like the remanding of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the Wilderneſs, when they were coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſome ſettlement in the Land deſigned for them: And therefore it is humbly deſired, that in ſo nice a juncture of Affairs, and ſo tickliſh a time as this is, there
may be a forbearance of corroding Medicaments, and people may be won by Lenitives.</p>
            <p>To which might be added, That the effect of this and ſuch like Oaths and Engagements, will in all probability be, that multitudes of Sober, Peaceable and
Tractable Perſons who fear an Oath, will refuſe to ſwear even that which poſſibly they may be willing to do; and the Power of the Nation will in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
fall into the hands of ſuch Perſons, as are either men of no conſcience, who can without any ſcruple both take and break any Oath, (when occaſion ſerves)
or ſuch as are men of unſound Principles in matters of Religion, and ſo Animoſities will be begotten, continued and increaſed, and the Publick Peace
