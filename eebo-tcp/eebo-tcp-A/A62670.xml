            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ESSAY
CONCERNING
Obedience to the Supreme Powers, &amp;c.</head>
         <div type="introduction">
            <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE Design of these Sheets (which one would
think should be no difficult Task), is to persuade
People to act for the Good and Prosperity of the
Community they are Members of, and in which their own
is included; and to convince them, That it is their Duty
as well as Interest, to bear True Faith and Allegiance to
the present Government. Which Design, that I may the
better perform, it will be necessary to premise somewhat
about Government in general, and the Grounds and
Measures of Obedience to it; by which I hope I shall be
able to shew, What is the Duty of Subjects, not only in
the present Juncture of Affairs, but in all Changes and
Revolutions.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. I. Of Government, and the Origine of it.</head>
            <p>GOvernment is, as it is usually defined, <hi>The Care of
other Peoples Safety;</hi> which consists in Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and securing them from being destroyed or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64861:4"/>
oppressed by one another, as well as by Strangers; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
the Grievances of those that are injured, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the like for the future, by punishing Offenders.
In order to which, the Governor must have a Right to
command the Natural Force of those that expect his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
to enable him the better to put his Laws and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
in execution. Tho without Power Government can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist, yet Power and Government are not one and
the same thing; a man may be in the Power of another,
and yet may not be governed by him; it is necessary that
this Power be made use of for Protection, without which
it is impossible to be protected; so that Protection and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
are the same thing; for where people are not
protected, they are still in the state of Nature, and without
Government.</p>
            <p>It is Government alone that gives the Form, Life, and
Unity to a Civil Society, or Body Politick, by which the
several Members have their mutual Influence, Sympathy,
and Connection; so that to be a Member of a Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to be under Government, is the same thing; and
to be without Government, and to be in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
are reciprocal, and predicated of one another. None
can pretend to be or claim any Civil Rights as a Member
of a Society, without owning the actual Government that
makes it a Society; and they that disown the Government
of the Society they live in, do outlaw themselves, and
virtually declare themselves no Members of it; because
they have reduced themselves to a state of Nature, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning
there is amongst them a common Judge, who has
a Right to decide their Controversies, and redress their
Injuries, and in whose Determinations they are obliged to
acquiesce.</p>
            <p>God, who is the Author of every good thing, may be
said in a more special manner to be so of Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is absolutely necessary to the Well-being of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64861:4"/>
and He, by the Law of Nature, which obliges
mankind to act for their good, has instituted it, and has
since by his Positive Law ratified and confirmed it; yet He
did not constitute any particular Form of Government, but
left mankind at liberty to dispose of themselves, as they
(when they instituted Societies) thought fit. God was so far
from taking this Liberty from any Nation, that when he
was pleased to take upon himself the Office of King over
his own People the <hi>Jews,</hi> he first required their Consent;
and a Contract between God and the People (as is plain by
the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>Exodus)</hi> was the Foundation of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.
And since it is not by God's Positive Law, That one
Form of Government, rather than another, is any where
established, there can remain no other way by which any
Government can be erected, or that one man can have a
Right to command over others, but by the Law of Nature,
or by the Consent of the Parties concerned: But there is
no Law of Nature for any one Form of Government, so
as to make the rest unlawful; or that one person, rather
than another, should have the Sovereign Administration
of Affairs: Nor can there be any one Law of Nature ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
why any particular person should have a Power over
so many Millions of different Families, with no manner of
relation and dependance one upon another, and who are
by Nature equal, being of the same rank, promiscuously
born to the same Advantages of Nature, and to the use of
the same common Faculties: And therefore it remains,
That Government must be derived from Consent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Men are not by Nature free; because they are born
subject to their Parents, (who by the Law of Nature have an
Absolute Power over them): Therefore they could not chuse
Governors for themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Power that Parents have over their Children,
does not extend to their Lives or Properties, or hinder them
from being free, tho they are born in a condition which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64861:5"/>
makes them for some time incapable to exercise their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
It is the duty of those by whose means they come
into the world, to take care and provide for them until
they are able to provide for themselves; which Duty Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
cannot effectually discharge, except they have a
Power to correct and manage them as they think fit.</p>
            <p>Children are obliged to take the same care for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
if they chance by losing their Reason to fall into the
same helpless Condition; which they cannot perform, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they have also in their turn, a Power to govern them
too, and even to use Forcible means, when they think it
necessary.</p>
            <p>Whoever has the Charge of educating a Child, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be his Father or a Stranger, must have the same
Power over him; and this a Child, tho an Absolute King,
must be forced to submit to. The information of his mind,
the health of his body, and even the necessities of life,
make it absolutely necessary: And if this be not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with Sovereign Power, much less is it with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
A man may be said to be by Nature Free, as well as
Rational, tho he be not capable of exercising both, until
such an Age; and the same Age that sets him free from
the Power of a Tutor, sets him free from the Power of
his Parents, tho nothing can set him free from that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
(which is not inconsistent with the state of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
which he must for ever owe them.</p>
            <p>But that Filial Reverence does not give his Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(to whom by the Law of God and Nature he is obliged
to pay equal Honour and Reverence) a Power over his Life
and Properties, or any Jurisdiction over him: (Whilst
he is part of the Family, it is true he must be subject in
matters that concern the Family, because there can be but
one Master in a Family). If Parents had an Absolute
Regal Power, all Civil Government would be unlawful,
because it would deprive all Fathers of that Paternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64861:5"/>
Power, which by the Law of Nature (which is supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to all Human Laws) does (upon their having Children)
become their Right, and which the Government could no
more justly deprive them of, than of that Duty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which Children by the same Law of Nature are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to pay them; and which too, if Government were
nothing but Paternal Power, must belong to it. But if
this Notion were true, this would not give Governors a
Power over Parents themselves, or over those who have
no Parents in being, because Paternal Power can affect
none but Children: And the Supreme Magistrate, who
does not beget his Subjects, can have no Natural nor any
other Right to it, but as it is conveyed to him by
Consent; except the First-born from <hi>Adam</hi> (which the
Asserters of Paternal Power do affirm) hath an Universal
Hereditary Right, (the Absurdity of which Opinion has
sufficiently been exposed by a late most Ingenious Author);
supposing which to be true, it is plain that no other can
have the same Right; so that until that mighty Monarch
prove his Claim, all the Civil Power that is now in the
world, must come by Consent; and there is nothing but
that, can give another a greater Power than Parents pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to over their Children; and which Children are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to obey, even contrary to their Parents Commands;
and which gives them a Power of Life and Death over
their Parents, as it frequently happens in Elective Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
which Governments it is visible have their Power
from the People; and this way too at first must come the
Power in all Hereditary Governments; for the first of a
Family could not have an Hereditary Right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The Power of Government could not come from the
People, because they have no Power over their own Lives;
and therefore could not give that to another which they had not
themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64861:6"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, men having no power over their own
Lives, could not part with a Power they had not; yet Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
will have all the Power which is necessary for the
Ends of Government, by the Peoples giving them that
Power which by the Law of Nature they had over the
lives of one another; for by that Law every one had a
Right to take away the life of another, if he could not
otherwise secure his own, or what was in order to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
it; and might do the same in defence of any inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
person, and could punish any one for injuring him or
his neighbours, because by it he acted for his own and their
security: And if Punishment ought then to be inflicted,
some one must have a Right to inflict it; and if any one
had a Right, all being by Nature equal, every one must
have the same Right; the exercise of which Right men
have parted with to their Governors; so that they alone
have now the only Right to punish with loss of life, or any
less Punishment, in all cases, except in those where upon
the suddenness of the danger, Protection cannot be had
from them, or where they wholly neglect, or are incapable
to protect them; There mens Natural Liberties still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
and they may in Defence of their own Lives, or
what is necessary to support them, justly take away the
lives of the Aggressors. And any Law which should take
this Power from the people, would be null and void, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the people never did or could give the Magistrate
such a Power as should hinder them from acting for their
own Preservation, when necessity required it.</p>
            <p>The Magistrate having then his Power from the People,
it is very certain he can have no more Power than they
were capable of giving him, or did give him; who, because
people (who had no Arbitrary Power over the Lives of one
another) were not capable of giving it him, can have no right
to take away the life of any person, except it be for the
Publick Good. Nor can men, though at the Command
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64861:6"/>
of the Magistrate, without being guilty of Murther, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
any of their lives, when the good of the Society does
no way require it. Nay, by the mutual Assistance, which
by the Law of Nature Mankind owe one another, they
might, if he should endeavour to destroy any, when it is
evident it is no way beneficial to the Publick, justly Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Magistrate, if Opposing him would not be a
greater Damage to the Publick. As men could not give
the Magistrate a greater Power than they had over the lives
of one another; so the Power they gave him was not
only for the defence and safety of their Lives, but to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them in the enjoyment of their Properties, and to
judge concerning them by known and impartial Laws.
Men having no Power to destroy what was beneficial to
others, could not give him a right to Waste, or Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
(which is the necessary effect of Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the Uncertainty of the Enjoyment destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all Labour and Industry) what God has ordained for the
Necessaries, or Conveniences of Life. They that Assert
the Magistrate has more Power than the People could or
did give him, must prove he has it from God, who alone
could give it him; but God, except to the <hi>Jews,</hi> gave no
other Law about Government, or any other matter, but
those of Nature. And Christ, whose Kingdom is not of
this World, did not give more, or take away any Power
from the Magistrate: So that what ever Power was given
him by Man, he still enjoys the same without any addition
or diminution.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. Of Passive Obedience.</head>
            <p>THerefore it is very evident, That whatever Rights
or Liberties men did not part with to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
those they have still retained in themselves; and
no person can have a right to their Obedience in those
things wherein they have given him no right to command;
nor are they (which otherwise would be the consequence)
obliged to pay him more obedience than they owe him,
but may defend their Rights against any that has no right
to take them away.</p>
            <p>In the most Absolute Hereditary Government, if the
Governor should endeavour to alienate it, or any of the
essential parts of it to a Stranger, he may be justly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
because the People have not given him such a
right, nor is a right to dispose of a Government,
necessary to his governing them; but such an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
shall be interpreted so far good (because Acts
are not so to be interpreted as to be of no effect) as
is in his power to make it good; <hi>it shall be esteemed a good
Resignation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the same, if not greater Reason, the King in a mixt
Government may be opposed, if he should endeavour to
alienate any of the parts of the Government, which are
by the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> annexed to the Crown, as in
<hi>England</hi> the Supremacy in Ecclesiastical Matters is; There
the People may oppose the King, if he should attempt to
separate the Supremacy from the Crown, especially if he
should endeavour to make the Pope Supreme; because, if
they did not oppose him in that Attempt, they must either
be <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>High Treason,</hi> in owning the Pope's Supremacy,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64861:7"/>
or be destroyed when the Pope's Supremacy is established,
for <hi>refusing</hi> to be guilty of <hi>High Treason;</hi> it being Treason
by the Laws to own his Supremacy. Whoever owns the
Pope's Supremacy, is incapable of being himself Supreme
in Ecclesiasticals; and he that cannot be Supreme in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticals,
cannot be Supreme in Civils, because being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Legislative, they cannot be enjoyed apart.</p>
            <p>In a mixt Government, where the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> of
King, Lords and Commons (which is the only Supream
Power, because it gives Laws to all) is divided, part in
the King, and part in the People; if either part invadeth
the other's Right, the <hi>usurping part</hi> may be justly opposed,
because it invadeth what is the <hi>Sovereign Right</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>None can have a share in the Legislative Power, but who
must have a right to defend that Power; because any other
than a <hi>Sovereign Right</hi> to the <hi>Legislative,</hi> to which all are
Subject, would be nonsense; and whoever has the <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
Power, if he had not a share in the <hi>Legislative,</hi> would
be subject to it. And he that is intrusted with the Execution
of the Laws, can have no more Power than the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
has given him; and where the People have a share in
the Legislative, <hi>they have the same Right to their Privileges,</hi>
(viz.) <hi>the Laws of the Land, as the King has to his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives;</hi>
because the Consent of both is equally necessary
to the altering the Laws, as it was to the making of them.</p>
            <p>In a mixt Government, a King, beyond the Limits of his
Kingly Power, is so far from having a Right to Obedience,
either Active or Passive, that by <hi>assuming such an Vnlimited
Power, he loses all his Legal Power, which consists in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to the Laws enacted by the Legislative;</hi> and by
it abdicates the Government; for he that ceases to govern
according to those Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by governing Arbitrarily and
contrary to Law, ceases as much to govern in the eye and
intent of the Law, as he that ceases to govern at all; and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64861:8"/>
by governing Arbitrarily (the Constitution admitting of
no such Governor) destroys the very Essence of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Power, and renounces (the only Right he has) his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Right. For no person can have at the same time a Will
to rule according to Law, and a Will to rule contrary to
Law; and he that wills the latter, cannot will the former,
and so willingly renounces his Legal Government; and by
making his Will the Law, he assumes the whole Legislative
Power to himself, which wholly destroys the former Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
for <hi>a new Legislative is a new Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and if the whole be destroyed, the share the King
has in it must be so too, except a part can subsist, when the
whole, by which and in which he enjoyed his part, is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>
            <p>Whereever people have established a mixt Government,
they are presumed to grant all that is necessary to maintain
that Government; which could not be, if one part had
not a Right to hinder the Encroachment of the other.</p>
            <p>It is Nonsence to brag of the Happiness which people
enjoy in living under a Limited Monarchy, if it had no
other Limits than the Will and Pleasure of the King; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
then he would be as Absolute as the <hi>French</hi> King or
Grand-Siegneur, and his Subjects would be as mere slaves
as the vilest of theirs, since they would hold their Lives
and Properties by no other Tenure, than the Pleasure of
the King who is absolute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it may be asked,</hi> Who shall judge between them, if
either should usurp the Right that belongs to the other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I answer,</hi> None can judge as a superior in whose sentence
both sides must acquiesce, because that would suppose some
one superior to the Supreme Legislative Power: Or if the
Judges of the Land should have an Absolute Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
in these matters, and people should be obliged to
submit to whatever they decr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, they could make either
Party the Supreme Legislative Power, or themselves, by
declaring themselves to be so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64861:8"/>
None, as a Superior, can call him to an account who
has a share in the Legislative; but he may be resisted as
well as any other, that should invade the Sovereign Rights
of others, with which he has nothing to do.</p>
            <p>Where people have not parted wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h their Rights, it must
be presumed they have retained a Power to judge whether
those Rights are invaded, or else the design of preserving
those Rights would be to no purpose.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, Tho it be no Treason, or any
manner of Injury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Injustice, for People to defend their
Rights against a King that has no Right to take them
away, yet for their own sakes people are obliged to submit
to his Arbitrary Government, because opposing him might
create a War more destructive than all the effects of his
Arbitrary Power. But what King would resign his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
rather than oppose a Rebel? And if a single
person thinks he is not obliged to part with his Civil
Right, how can he expect, that Millions (were it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it could be for their common good) should part with
theirs? Since too, every one of them has the same Right
to their Privi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eges (the Laws of the Land) as he has to
his Crown, why should they be more obliged to suffer their
own rather than a Foreign Prince to destroy their Rights?
Since the attempt is a greater Crime in him, because he
breaks his Oath, and the Trust that is reposed in him, and
is guilty of the highest Ingratitude to the People who have
given him so much Power.</p>
            <p>By the same Argument, good men ought not to resist
Robbers and Pirates: And if a man should be obliged to
quit all for fear of bloodshed, how bravely would the good
of mankind be promoted, and what a blessed Peace would
the world enjoy? which would consist in Violence and
Rapine, and which would only be maintained for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of Robbers and Oppressors.</p>

Whoever does but consider the Poverty, the Misery, the

the generality not only want Conveniences, but even the
Necessaries of Life, and how by Tyranical Government
the Richest and most Flourishing Countries (as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
those under the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire) are depopulated
and almost turned to desarts, so that the Inhabitants are thin
and few, as well as wretched and barbarous; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
compares them with those that live under Mixt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
where the Inhabitants are generally above

manner of Conveniences and Pleasures of life; or does but
consider the happy condition that <hi>Greece</hi> and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

and what they now suffer; or has but read Bp. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s
Remarks on <hi>Italy, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> must be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
That it is not the Interest of a Nation to let their King
be Arbitrary; and that they cannot pay too dear for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
their Liberties. In making themselves Absolute,
Kings act against their own Safety, as well as the Good of
the People, because a Mixt Government is not only best
for the Subjects, bnt for the Security of Kings, They being
oftner Deposed and Murthered (as all the Histories of the
World do testify) in Absolute than in Limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies.</p>
            <p>Can any one think, that the United Provinces (in spite
of the long War they had to maintain their Privileges)
are not as Populous, Rich, and Potent, and upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
in as flourishing a condition, as they would have
been, had they been possessed with the Doctrine of Passive
Obedience, and tamely submitted to the Encroachments
and Arbitrary Power of <hi>Spain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had the Doctrine of Passive-Obedience been all-along
practised, Mankind would have been in a more slavish
condition than any now are, that live under the most Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranical
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64861:9"/>
Governments; it is the fear that people may by ill
usage be provoked to violate this Doctrine, that keeps the
greatest Tyrants within some bounds, and makes them go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
more mildly and moderately than otherwise they
would. It is, I think, no great Argument of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of an Opinion, when the not observing it, or even the
very probability of breaking it, has preserved mankind in
a much better condition than they would have been, had
the Supreme Powers been certain, that that Doctrine would
have been inviolably observed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English,</hi> who are the freest Nation in the world,
cannot consider the Happiness they enjoy, in comparison
of those that live under Absolute Monarchies, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a just Veneration for their Noble Ancestors, who have
(tho not without the expence of their best blood) secured
to them those Liberties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they now enjoy: And the present
Age would have strangely degenerated, had they not been
as zealous to have transmitted the same down to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>
            <p>Most of the <hi>European</hi> Nations were once Masters of the
same Freedom the <hi>English</hi> still enjoy. Those great Swarms
of people that came out of the <hi>North,</hi> and subdued most
part of <hi>Europe,</hi> upon settling themselves in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
they conquered, made their Generals Kings, and their
Chief Officers their <hi>Concilia Magna,</hi> or <hi>Parliamenta,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whose Consent no Laws were made, or scarce any thing
of Importance done: Which Government the <hi>English</hi> have
best preserved, being a Nation too tenacious of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be Complimented out of them; and (as they to
their Cost have found, who have attempted it) of too
great a Courage to be Forced out of them.</p>
            <p>It cannot then justly be concluded to be against the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good of the Nation to oppose Arbitrary Government,
because more lives might perhaps have been lost by it, than
by the Tyranical Government of all the Kings since the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64861:10"/>
Conquest; because those Kings were not Absolute, and
when they endeavour'd to be so, were always opposed.
But had it not been thought lawful to oppose them, and
they had been as Absolute as the Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience</hi>
would have permitted them, I would ask whether then (for
that is the true state of the question) the Nation would
have been as Populous and as Rich as it is at present by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
its Liberties, and opposing all Usurpation? There
is, I think, no reason to doubt, if Arbitrary Government
had prevail'd, but that the Countrey would have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to as poor and as beggarly a condition, and would as
much have been depopulated as any Province under the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>There can be no greater Argument than the universal
Consent of the Nation, that what they so unanimously
concurred in, was not against their Common Good; and
nothing but a Danger as Universal as it was great, could
make all people so desirous of a Revolution: And there
could be no pretence from the Publick Good of not resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when Slavery it self was not the end, but only in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to extirpate an Heretical Nation; which all Popish
Princes by their Religion are obliged to do; and there was
no reason to suppose the late King (had not the Design
been so notorious) less zealous than his Neighbours <hi>Where
it is notorious that a King has a Design to enslave the Nation,
there can be no great danger in opposing him;</hi> because it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for him, (the Lands and Riches being in so many
hands), to be able to influence so great a Number of the
Gentry and Nobility, as shall be sufficient to oppose the
Common Interest.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more pernicious to Government, than
to encourage those that publish such Doctrines as tend to
destroy the Rights and Privileges of the people: Who are
quick-sighted enough to find out the weak side of such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
as tend to their hurt; and it makes them suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64861:10"/>
that some sudden Designs are carrying on against
them, and prepares their minds to receive any ill impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against the Government. What happened in King
<hi>Charles</hi> the First's time, is an undeniable Instance of this,
where the encouraging and preferring almost none but
such as preached up that <hi>Sensless Doctrine,</hi> created such
Jealousies, Fears, and Mistrusts in the minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
of whom too many were irritated by Persecution <hi>(for
Passive-Obedience and Persecution, like Brethren in Iniquity,
go hand in hand)</hi> that nothing but the Ruin of that Prince
could satisfy their Jealousies. That Doctrine had like to
have produced a more fatal Consequence in his Son's time,
by encouraging him (who had the weakness to think, that
those who when uppermost were Bigots for it, would sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to it when they themselves came to suffer) to invade
the Rights and Liberties of the People.</p>

            <p>THE Consideration of <hi>the Publick Good,</hi> which is <hi>the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Law</hi>
by which both King and People ought to
guide their Actions, does oblige Subjects to obey in all
things that are in the least disputable, and even to acquiesce
in whatever a King does, if in the whole he promotes the
Publick Good. It is not barely the breaking a Law, or
stretching the Prerogative, in this or that Point, can do any
great mischief; except it be done with a Design to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Liberties of the People, and establish Arbitrary
Government. In many cases the good of the Whole may
require the Laws to give place to the Executive Power,
because it is impossible upon the account of the infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Accidents and Circumstances that attend Human
Affairs, to foresee, and by Laws to provide for all the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64861:11"/>
that concern the Publick: Laws can only respect
what does generally happen; there must be a vast number
of Particulars, where a rigid Observation of Law must be
hurtful; and it will be necessary that a Power to Dispense
with the Penalties of the Laws, should be lodged with
the King, whose Power cannot be too large, if he useth it
for the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>The <hi>only Enemies</hi> to the present Government (at least
amongst the Protestants) are <hi>the Asserters of Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi>
who tho they think it for the Publick Good to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a King to inslave a Nation, rather than oppose him, yet
are so absurd as to think they are obliged in Conscience to
disturb the Government that protects them, and raise a Civil
War (tho the consequence should be never so fatal) to
restore a Prince, whose Return would, if the War did
not, compleat the Ruin of the Nation. The Falseness and
Absurdity of which Opinion, I shall endeavour to make
manifest: And to shew, That it is the <hi>Indispensable Duty of
all that are Protected by a Government, to bear True Faith and
Allegiance to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I suppose I need not spend many Words, to shew the
Absolute Necessity of Government, for the Good and
Well-being of Mankind; or that it was for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that men parted with their Liberties (for what else
could be an <hi>Equivalent?)</hi> but for the mutual Defence and
Security which they receive by Government, which is the
sole Design and End of all Laws, Punishments, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
As this Reason was at first the sole Motive for
submitting to particular persons, so it is the only reason
still for continuing Allegiance to them; and when this
Reason ceaseth, Natural Liberty does return, and then
men are obliged for the sake of their own Safety and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
to pay Allegiance where it is most for their own
Interest and Advantage.</p>
            <p>Obedience is due to Government, and not to the Person
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64861:11"/>
that governs but upon the account and for the sake of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
otherwise people might be obliged to pay Allegiance to a
King after he had resigned his Regal O<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fice. <hi>It is impossible
for a King to lose his Government, and not lose the Allegiance
of his Subjects, because they are Relatives;</hi> and according to
the nature of all Relatives, one cannot subsist without the
other.</p>
            <p>Natural Relations, as that between Father and Son,
last as long as both Parties Live; but Artificial ones, (if
I may so term them) as those between Master and Servant,
King and Subject, may be destroyed during their Lives;
and when these Relations cease, all Obligations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on both
sides cease. The Relation between Sovereign and Subjects
is destroyed, when the Sovereign will no longer Protect
his People, and so freely withdraws from the Government,
or when he is deprived of the Power of Protecting them,
and so is driven from his Government; which, as to the
People, (for whose sake Government was Instituted) has
the same effect; and they equally lose that Protection and
Defence, for the sake of which alone Allegiance is paid,
whether the Sovereign will not, or cannot any longer Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
them, and is forced to leave his Government in the
hands of others; whereby those that were his Subjects are
as incapable of paying him Allegiance, as he is to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
them; and the same Force that will justifie his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, will equally justifie their Transferring their
Allegiance: And since no Society is able to subsist without
having Justice Administred, and enjoying those other
blessings that are derived from Government: Either they
must by living without Government become a prey to
every one, or else there is a necessity of preserving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by paying Allegiance to the new Government.</p>
            <p>If Obedience were due purely to the Title, Subjects
would be very great Rebels in refusing to pay Obedience to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64861:12"/>
a Madman with a Legal Title, and in placing another in
the Throne: What other reason can be assigned for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
him, but that the good of the Commonwealth
requires Obedience to be paid to a Person that can Protect
them; which since a Madman cannot, it is their Duty to
pay Obedience to another that can. Is not a Person that has
lost his Government, as unable to Protect the People, as
he that has lost his senses? And would not the indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to restore him by violent means, be more pernicious to
the Publick, than suffering a Madman in the Throne?
For though the incapacity proceeds from different Causes,
the one being a Natural, the other a Moral one, yet the
reason, the <hi>Publick good,</hi> is the same, for not endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Restore one, as it is for Deposing the other.</p>
            <p>Though the next of Kin may have a right to be a Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
to a Minor, yet if admitting him would prejudice
the affairs of the Minor, he ought to be denied that Right,
or rather that Right ceaseth, because it is against the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and advantage of the Minor, for whose sake alone he
was appointed Guardian: So in matters of <hi>Government,
(which is an Office that had no other grounds for its being institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but the good of the People, who are always in their Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi>
and such Sovereign Curators are constantly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the management of their Affairs): Any particular
Person's Right to that Office must cease, if he cannot be
admitted without great prejudice to the Minors; and as the
number is disproportionate between one and a whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and as the lives of a number of Persons are to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
before the interest of a single Minor; so much strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
will the Argument hold in behalf of the People, and
the greater will the Crime be in attempting to admit any
Person into that Office, when it cannot be done without
involving the Nation in manifest Ruin.</p>
            <p>Therefore in most cases where one King has Power
enough to turn another out of his Kingdom and get into
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64861:12"/>
his Throne, it is highly probable he will be able to keep it
against any Opposition from the Person he Conquered:
So that they who set up for his Interest, expose themselves
to certain Ruin and Destruction. But though it might
so happen that they might succeed in the Attempt, yet
since it could not be done without a manifest injury to the
Nation, by Disturbing the Peace and Quiet of it, by
causing the Effusion of so much Blood, Rapine, Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and those intolerable Calamities which Civil War
does produce, it would be so far from being a Duty, that
it would be a sin of the first magnitude to Attempt it; it
would be contrary to the greater and prior obligation which
they owe to the Publick.</p>
            <p>For none can have a Right inconsistent with <hi>the Publick
Good,</hi> which <hi>is the only Fundamental Law of all Societies;</hi>
contrary to which, no Law (and consequently no Legal
Right, which is built upon Law) can be valid; to which
as to a center, each man's Actions ought to tend, because
the more universal any good is, the more it ought to be
imbraced; and <hi>Societies could not subsist, but must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
fall into a state of War and Confusion, if every man should
prefer the advantage of any particular Person before the Good
of the whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As every particular Person's interest must yield to the
general Good of the Society; so must that of a particular
Society submit to the more universal Good of all Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and no Principles can be true (however they may
serve a particular turn) that, if generally practised,
would be against the Good of all Societies; but nothing
can be more destructive and pernicious to all human So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
than those Principles which assert that Allegiance
must be only Paid to him that hath a Legal Title; because
it must oblige vast numbers in all Revolutions to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
for the sake of a single Person, rather than sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to another who is in the same station and by whose
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64861:13"/>
Power they might be Governed and Protected.</p>
            <p>It is a Doctrine of most dangerous consequence, and if
embraced would destroy the best part of Mankind, and fill
the whole world with Blood and Confusion; for in such
Revolutions (which frequently happen) what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will suffer its Enemies (the more still the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous)
to enjoy equal privileges with its dutiful Subjects?
thereby enabling them to destroy that Government, which
by all tyes of Conscience they must think themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to, as Subjects to its Enemies.</p>
            <p>The safety and quiet of their peaceable Subjects, as
well as self preservation, will oblige the Supreme Powers
to extirpate them, for it is impossible for men of these
Principles, if they act accordingly to live quiet under a
Government which they suppose has no Legal Right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their actions are not in their own power, but in that
of the Dispossessed Prince, who has the same Indispensable
Right to Command them, as he had before he was outed
of the Throne. Therefore they are obliged, whatever
they promise, or whatever specious pretences they make,
to act contrary to them, when either his Interest or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
do require it.</p>
            <p>Can it be supposed, that when men submitted to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
(because it was absolutely necessary for their
Preservation) that they submitted on such terms, as should
oblige them in so many cases to run into those inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
which they desired to shun, rather than live in peace
and quiet under a Government which does actually Protect
them?</p>
            <p>Nothing can justifie such Principles, except the <hi>Misery</hi>
and <hi>Destruction,</hi> not the <hi>preservation</hi> of human Societies,
be the <hi>Supreme Law;</hi> or that it is a sin to act for the general
Good of a Society, and a Duty in the People to expose
themselves to certain destruction, rather then act for their
own good, in a matter which was solely Instituted for their
good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:64861:13"/>
A man may be obliged to suffer rather than act against
his Duty, but that he should be obliged to suffer rather
than do his Duty in promoting the general good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is to me a strange Paradox. If it be a Duty to act
for the Publick good, and the general interest of a Society;
and if the more Universal the good be, the more it ought
to be sought for; then the means that are necessary to this
duty, or end, must be as necessary as the end it self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the end prescribes the means.</p>
            <p>So that if the paying Obedience to the Present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
be for the good and happiness of the Nation, it must
be a Duty in every one to do it; and on the contrary, if
endeavouring to disturb the present Settlement, and to
Restore the Late King be (as I think no Protestant can
doubt it) to the disadvantage, and against the good and
interest of the Nation, it must be a sin. And can there
be more dreadful consequences (than what in all human
probability, must happen upon Unsetling the Present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,)
to our Estates, Liberties, and Lives, and what
ought to be dearer than all, to our Holy Religion? Except
Popery, and <hi>French</hi> Tyranny, which include in them
Slavery both of Body and Soul, are to be courted at the
expence of a Civil War.</p>
            <p>The paying Obedience to those that are in Possession, is
a Doctrine that tends so much to the interest of human
Societies, and of all the particular Members thereof, that
even those who Oppose it, if they consulted their own
happiness, must wish it were true; and what greater
Argument can there be of the truth of it, than that it is
so conducive to the good of Mankind?</p>
            <p>And that common Objection, or rather Reflection,
That it is interest makes these Tenets, which require Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Present Government, so universally imbraced,
which (howsoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it be uncharitably designed) is so far from
destroying the credit of them, that it is a demonstration of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64861:14"/>
their truth; because they are for the Good of Particulars
of which the Publick is made up.</p>

         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. IV. Of God's Laws.</head>
            <p>THE Publick Good of Societies, is not only the
foundation of all human Laws, (upon which all
Legal Rights depend, which cease to oblige, and are null
and void, when contrary to it) but is even the foundation
of God's Laws, which concern men with relation to one
another.</p>
            <p>For God, who is infinitely happy in himself, could
have no other motive in creating man, but to make him
happy in this Life, as well as that which is to come; and
accordingly if mankind would follow those Rules that are
prescribed by God in order to their behaviour towards one
another, in what happy, blessed, and flourishing State
wonld they be in? And what misery and confusion even in
this Life does deviating from those Rules create, besides
the Punishment they receive in the Life to come, for acting
against their good in this. Do not the circumstances as
they tend to the advantage or disadvantage of human So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
make things good or evil? And are they not the
only rule to judge of God's Laws by; as for instance, the
Commandment declareth in general terms it is not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to Kill; yet it is a duty in the Magistrate to Kill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is for a Publick good, which is the only rule by
which to distinguish between Murther and Justice. Even
a private Person may kill in his own defence; and such
a Liberty is for the Publick good; nor do Christ's Precepts,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64861:14"/>
which forbid all manner of Revenge, and require Forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Injuries, hinder any from punishing those that injure
them by Legal courses; because the punishing them tends
to promote the Publick Interest of Mankind.</p>
            <p>It is unlawful to take what is anothers without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
yet if it be for the Common good, it is not only
Lawful, but a Duty, as Blowing up of houses in case of
Fire, against the consent of the Owner, or digging in a
man's Ground to prevent an Innundation; if a Ship be in
danger to be lost, it is the Duty of those that are in it, in
order to preserve the Ship, to throw any man's Goods over
Board, though contrary to his consent; and if a Ship
wants Water, She may Lawfully, even by Force, take
some from another Ship, if that Ship in all likelyhood
hath enough to carry her to the next Watering-place.</p>
            <p>In case of necessity it is Lawful for a private Person to
take from another what is necessary for his Subsistence, if he
whose it is, be not in the same want; nay, even what is
Devoted to God in such cases it is Lawful to take; and
Christ makes <hi>David's</hi> eating the <hi>Consecrated Bread,</hi> an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<hi>à Fortiori,</hi> to justifie what his Disciples in their
Hunger took from man; in such cases the Natural Right
of self-preservation returns, and though People are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
punished for taking from another in their necessities,
yet that does not prove it Unlawful, but the Punishment
is inflicted only to prevent a gap being laid open to <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinism,</hi>
which would be inconsistent with the Publick
good and convenience; for the sake of which a Person
ought sometimes to suffer, though it be undeservedly.</p>
            <p>What is more inviolable then a promise to return what
one is intrusted with? Yet none are obliged to return a
Sword to that Person who designs to Attempt his own
Life, or that of anothers; much less ought we to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to give any one the Power of the Sword, tho he
has never so much Right to it, if the Attempt would prove
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64861:15"/>
fatal to a great number of lives, and contrary to the good
of the Society, for whose sake alone he has that Right;
nor can any one be obliged to ruin or prejudice a Society for
the Right of a particular Person, when the Right which
that Person has, was only for the preservation of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
What is more sacred then Truth? Yet even that
is dispensed with, when it is evident the contrary is for the
good of those to whom it is spoken, and no prejudice to
any other Person, as in the case of Melancholly and Sick
Persons, and Children, or such like instances If Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths
were forbid, not because they were Injuries, but
barely because they are Untruths, all Parables, Fables and
Novels would be Unlawful.</p>
            <p>What can be more unjust than to take away the Life of
an Innocent Person? Yet if it be for the Publick good, it
is so far from being Unjust, that it is a Duty in those that
have the Publick Administration of Affairs to do it. And
all Governments act no other ways when by force they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Innocent Persons to the Wars where it is unavoidable,
but that great numbers must be slain: Tho it seldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to be for the good of a Society that an innocent Person
should suffer, yet the only thing that Government looks
after in punishing, is the <hi>Common good,</hi> and it may justly
cause an innocent Person to suffer, if it be for the General
good; because the <hi>lesser</hi> (the <hi>particalar)</hi> which is then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<hi>sub ratione mali,</hi> must give place to the <hi>greater,</hi> the
<hi>General good.</hi> Not only the Publick, but a Private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
has a Right to take away the Life of an Innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
if he cannot otherwise preserve his own. And most
Casuists are of Opinion, that a man (if parting with his
Life should happen to be beneficial to the Publick) ought,
as <hi>Codr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> did, freely to lay it down; but they all agree,
that a man ought to part with any thing that is less than
Life, or not endeavour to recover what he has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64861:15"/>
of, if he cannot do it without detriment to the
Publick, much less ought any to assist him in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
            <p>In short, There is no Law that wholly relates to Man,
but ceaseth to oblige, if upon the infinite variety of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
which attend human Affairs, it happens to be
contrary to the Good of man.</p>
            <p>But in things of a higher nature, and which are Moral
in themselves, and relate to the Worship and Honour of
God, it is not Lawful upon pretence of Temporal interest,
to dispense with any of those Duties, because it is not
Lawful to do evil that good may come; and the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
good, which is the less, ought to give place to the
greater the Eternal: Though even in these cases, things
which relate to God's Worship, if merely positive,
must yield to the good of Particular men, because they
are (as Christ speaks of the Sabbath) made for man,
and not man for them. But in things designed for the
Temporal interest of mankind, the standard of Good and
Evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the Publick good, and things are Commanded or
Forbidden, as they are either good or hurtful to Mankind,
and what in some circumstances may be a Duty, in others,
if it prove inconsistent with the Publick good, would be a
Sin, and the contrary a Duty; and then acting for the
Publick good, would not be doing Evil that Good might
come of it, but by the circumstances altering the case, it
would cease to be Evil.</p>
            <p>The design, end, and intent of all God's Laws, is the
Worship or Reverence that is due to the Deity, and the
Love that is due to man. The love of God and ones
Neighbour, our Saviour saith, are the Two grand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
on which hang all the Law and the Prophets,
(and in a much more eminent manner does the Gospel,
whose Precepts, as they teach the mutual Duty of man
towards man, are nothing but Love and Charity)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64861:16"/>
that it is evident, that no Doctrine can be true that is in the
least inconsistent with these Two Commandments, the
Love of God and of ones Neighbour: But how can he be
said to love his Neighbour, (which is an indefinite word,
and carryeth the sence of an universal) who will have
vast Numbers sacrificed to the interest of a Single person?
Or how can it be presumed, that God, who has declared
he is no respecter of Persons, and has made all men
by Nature equal, should act so inconsistently with himself,
as to require that great Numbers should lose their Lives,
and be exposed to all manner of Misery, for so inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a trifle, as the advancing a single Person to a Post,
which is attended with as great Cares and Troubles, as
Honours and Riches; or that he should prescribe about
Government (which could have no other ground for its
Institution but the good of the Society) I say, that he
should prescribe such rules, as in most Revolutions must
tend to their Ruin and Confusion?</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. Of the Law of Nations.</head>
            <p>UPON this foundation of the General good of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
have certain Rules and Customs been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Nations in their intercourse with one another,
which are called the Law of Nations (without which no
Correspondence either in Peace or War could be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
which only by tacite consent, and general practice of
Nations, upon the account of their evident utility, and
common profit, have obtained the force of Laws, and are
looked on as sacred. The Supreme Powers, neither by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64861:16"/>
themselves, nor Representatives, ever met, or enacted such
Laws, nor have other Nations Power to oblige any Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Independant State, which cannot be bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
these Customs, or Practices, but as they tend to the
General good and advantage of all Societies.</p>
            <p>Every Nation is at Liberty to appoint what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or manage its own Affairs within its
self, as it thinks best. The Laws of Nations relate only
to their Commerce, and Correspondence one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Princes are no other way concerned by the Law
of Nations with one another, but as they have the Power
of making Peace or War, and all other Leagues for those
Nations they Rule.</p>
            <p>It is not at all material what Right they have to this
Power, it is sufficient the Nations then own them for their
Sovereigns, and have intrusted them with this Power;
it would be an endless, as well as useless task, for Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
before their admission, to prove the just Right their
Masters have to those Titles and Powers they assume to
themselves.</p>
            <p>All Treaties, except they appear to be merely Personal,
though made with Usurpers, will oblige Legal Princes,
if they succeed, and so <hi>vice versa,</hi> and a League made with
a Nation, when under a King, will oblige that Nation
(provided they continue free) though the Government
should be changed to a Commonwealth, because Leagues
are National, and made with Princes only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Nations they are Representatives of. But
when they lose this Power, and the Nations are no longer
concerned in their Acts, they lose all manner of Right that
did belong to them by the Law of Nations; because these
Privileges are (as <hi>Grotius</hi> calls them) <hi>bona Regni,</hi> and did
belong to them only as they were the Publick Persons,
or Representatives of their respective Nations, which
when they cease to be, they have no more Right to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64861:17"/>
them, then they had before they were these Publick
Persons.</p>
            <p>But because the same intercourse between Nations will
always be necessary, which cannot be maintained, but
with those who have the Supreme Power; and they that
have that Power, must have a Right to those Privileges,
upon the account of the Nations they Represent; and
the Dispossessed Princes, must with their Kingdoms
lose their Right to them, because more than one
at the same time, cannot have the same Right for the
same Nation: And though some Princes (out of design,
or hatred to their Enemies) may allow outed Princes
some of those Privileges that belong only to those that have
<hi>Summum imperium,</hi> yet they have no Right by the Laws of
Nations to claim them, but they, as well as those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their broken fortunes, can be esteemed no other than
Subjects, during their stay, to those Kings in whose Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
they abide; where they are so far from having a
Power of making Peace or War, or any other National
Contracts, that they cannot, without License first obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from those Princes in whose Dominions they are, send
any to treat with other Princes, or receive any sent by
them; much less allow them those Privileges which are
due to Persons of a Publick Character. And it would be
unreasonable that Sovereigns should be obliged to allow
them, or any sent by them, those privileges, when they
are incapable of returning the same. And with as little
reason can any Prince in anothers Dominions pretend to
grant Commissions to private Men of War, to disturb the
Trade and Commerce of any Nation, because he cannot
claim in another Prince's Territories a Power (which can
only belong to the Sovereignty of those Dominions) to
Judge, Condemn, or Restore according to the Maritime
Laws, the Ships and Goods which are taken by those that
act by his Commission. So that the Privateers themselves
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64861:17"/>
would be their own Judges, whether what they take was
Lawful Prize, which in effect would be a power to rob
whom they had a mind to. Therefore by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
all who act by such a Commission, are esteemed as
Pirates.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Obligation of Human Laws.</head>
            <p>ALL Writers allow, That the Leagues and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
which Princes make with one another, do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them to one another, no longer then they are in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of their Kingdoms, because the sole reasons of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
these Leagues, were upon the power each Kingdom
had to afford mutual Assistance and benefit to one another;
and if this be a constant practice with Kings, that their
Treaties oblige them no longer than when each King has
Possession of his Kingdom; Why will they not allow the
same reason to hold for Subjects, that they should be free
from all Obligations to Princes, when they no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any Protection from them? Seeing that was the only
ground and sole cause of their paying them Allegiance;
and in truth they cannot be any longer obliged, then the
reason for obliging them holds: For why should People be
obliged, when there is no reason they should be so? no Laws
can bind any longer, than the reason for Enacting them
holds good; and when the sole reason that made them
Laws, ceaseth, the Laws themselves must so too; much
more must any particular Law be null and void, when not
only the reason of keeping it ceaseth, but the keeping it
does thwart the general intent and design of all Laws,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64861:18"/>
which is the good and happiness of the Societies; to
which all Laws are but means; and there is no reason that
the means should oblige, when the end for whose sake the
means were ordained cannot be obtained by those means,
much less when they become destructive of the sole end
for which they were ordained.</p>
            <p>If there were a Law that Ships should sail on such aside
of the Channel, and the sole reason, whether expressed or
not, were for avoiding the dangerous Sands that were on
the other side; if the Sands should chance to be removed
to the safe side of the Channel, the Pilot would be so far
from being bound upon the account of that Law, to run
his Ship upon the Sands, that he would break the Law if
he kept to the Letter of it, and would observe the Law by
going contrary to the Letter: So again, if a Law that
required Obedience to one particular Person, should
happen to be destructive of the Publick good, and of fatal
consequence to the Community, the Letter of the Law
would oblige no more in one case than in the other; nay,
the reason of not observing the last would be stronger
upon the account of the disproportion of the number:
But the true meaning and intent of the Law would in one
case as well as the other, oblige People to act contrary to
the letter of the Law; and people would be as much
bound to pay Obedience, where it would be for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good, as in the other case, the Ship would be to sail
on the safe side of the Channel.</p>
            <p>The occasion of not a few Mistakes in this important
Controversie, ariseth from mens judging by the same rules,
(tho the reasons are extremely different) in cases which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Supreme Powers, as they do in those which relate to
private Persons. In cases between private Persons, there is a
Superior to decide all controversies, and <hi>to do right and justice;
for which end he was made their Superior:</hi> So that if any one by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64861:18"/>
Fraud or Violence possesseth himself of another's Right,
the Law is open, and redress may be had without any
danger to the Publick; nay, <hi>The Publick Safety consists in
having private mens wrongs redressed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to the Supreme Powers, whatever Right or Titles
they have, people are obliged to submit to those in Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
because there is no Superior Court (as in case of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
persons) to judge of their Rights; and Possession,
by all Laws, gives a man a Right, till he be legally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed;
and if a man cannot be turned out by Course of
Law, (as it is evident he that is in Possession of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot), he ought still to enjoy what he possessed:
For it is against the Nature of all Civil Societies to appeal
to the Sword, to prevent which they were instituted: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
Force can never decide Civil Controversies, nor can
the Sword be a proper Judge of Wrong or Right; it can
only determine who is the strongest, not who has the best

the people (instead of giving him that Punishment
which by the Law of Nature, and God's Positive Law,
is due to such Crimes), are obliged to pay him
Obedience, to which he can have no other Right but
Possession; for whilst his King was alive, and in Possession
of the Government, he could have no Right; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an Action so barbarous as murdering him that was (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
both his Father and King, which is against all Right,
Law, and Justice, could never give him any Right or
Just Title, because it is against all Conscience and Reason,
that a man should reap any advantage by an Act so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously
wicked; and any Law that should allow a man
any benefit by so enormous a Crime, would be as sinful it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64861:19"/>
self: Nor can a man in any other case reap any advantage
by his own Turpitude; but here, because there is no supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to punish him, nor can Obedience be refused him
without Injury to the Publick, it is peoples Duty, instead
of punishing him, to pay him Obedience. And certainly
the same Reason will hold for paying Obedience to any
that get Possession of the Government, since none can get
it more unjustly.</p>
            <p>All Legal Rights must depend upon the Laws, and all
Laws, for their Authority, upon the Government; and
when that Government is at an end, all the Laws that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
it must be so too, and can no more oblige than the
<hi>English</hi> Laws can in a Foreign Countrey; because a
Power to put Laws in execution (whereby people
are protected) is essential to all Laws, because it is
essential to all Government, on which the Laws depend;
and without such a Power no Civil Society, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
no Civil Laws can subsist.</p>
            <p>No particular Law can bind in those circumstances,
where all Laws would cease to bind; and there is no reason
that some Laws should oblige, when all Laws would have
no obligation; as they would not oblige if there were no
Power to put them in execution; because men, when there
is no Power to restrain them from acting as they have a
mind to, would be in the state of Nature, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without any Laws but those of Nature.</p>
            <p>Without a Coercive Power, the Laws become a dead
Letter, or at best but Advice; so that there can be no Laws
that can oblige people to act against the present Powers,
because by being against the present Powers they cease to
be Laws.</p>
            <p>If a Law that should oblige people not to pay Obedience
to the actual Possessors of the Throne, had they not a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Title to it, were not in its own nature null, or could
subsist after that Government to which it required Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64861:19"/>
was destroyed, it would be void upon account of
its Impiety; because as long as the Legal Princes continue
dispossessed, which might extend to some Centuries, it
would overturn all Government, and all Civil Society,
which are instituted for the good of mankind, and which
Nature hath qualified man for, by making him a Sociable
Creature.</p>
            <p>Can any man in his senses think, that a particular Prince's
Interest can stand in competition with the very Being of
Human Societies, and the Preservation and Safety of the
People? Is it not absurd to suppose, that Legal Rights
that owe their Being to Civil Societies, should oblige
people to put an end to Civil Societies; and that Laws
that are but the Rules of Government, should destroy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
it self, or that Human Laws should be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Law of Nature, or take away that Natural
Right which people have to act for their own good and
preservation, which is a Right that is superior to all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Laws, and for the sake of which all Human Laws
were made.</p>
            <p>All Human Laws are made <hi>cum sensu humanae imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis;</hi>
nor do Legislators themselves design they shall
oblige in case of great and pressing Inconveniences, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that a moral Necessity does destroy the Vertue and
Force of them.</p>
            <p>The Good and Interest of the People, is the Supreme
Law, to which the Rights and Titles of Princes must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
and where it is for the good of the Nation that they
should be governed by such a particular person, That person
best and most Legal Right, because it is built upon the
Supreme and Fundamental Law of all Societies. And
whoever designedly breaks this most Sacred Law, may
justly be accounted a Rebel; and as the Crime would be
greater in them than others, if they who are hired by Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to protect them from Robbers, should rob them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64861:20"/>
so if Princes, who are intrusted by the people
with Power, in order to Protect the Society, should make
use of that Power to the Detriment of the Society, the
Crime in them would be so much the greater, by how
much more they are obliged to act otherwise.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. Objections answered.</head>
            <p>Object. UPON supposition that the Good of the Society
is the Grand Vltimate Law, yet these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which require Obedience to the Possessor, cannot be true,
because they are against the Peace and Happiness of Nations,
by encouraging Rebellion against all Princes, in obliging people
to pay the same Allegiance, even to those that unjustly depose
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> These Principles are so far from being destructive
to the Peace and Quiet of Nations, or encouraging Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against their Governors, that they require Obebience to
all in Possession, upon pain of Damnation; but if neither the
fear of Eternal Punishment in the life to come, nor the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
that can be afflicted upon them in this, can secure
people from rebelling, I must confess my Ignorance, I know
nothing that can. It is the Duty of all Subjects to do their
utmost to defend the Government; that is but a just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and what is due for its protecting and defending
them: But if by the Chance of War, or any other way,
it should lose the Power of Protecting them, they are not
obliged to have their Throats cut, rather than pay Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to that Government, by whose Favour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
they subsist, and enjoy what they have. And that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64861:20"/>
Prince is very unreasonable, and acts against the rules of
Humanity, as well as Charity, who when he is able no
longer to Protect the People, would rather have them
destroyed, then own that Government that can.</p>
            <p>Nothing can justify such an inhuman and barbarous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
except it can be proved that men entred into Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
barely for the sake and interest of a single Person; and
that if his pleasure or profit require it, Millions of Lives
must be indispensably sacrificed. This is to place Men in
a worse condition than the Beasts are; if they are in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
obliged to lose their Lives to gratifie the unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
Pride, Ambition, Revenge, or Interest of a single
Person.</p>
            <p>It is strange that any <hi>English-men,</hi> who are the Freest
Nation in the world, should have such Notions of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they are no other then the King's Properties:
Though it is but reasonable that men who design to bring
the most insupportable Slavery on themselves, should
qualifie themselves for it by Notions and Principles so much
below the dignity of human Nature.</p>
            <p>These Principles are so far from being any ways preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to Mankind, that it is they alone which in all Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
can secure human Societies, and make Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
easie and safe both to Kings and Subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by putting
an end to those otherwise endless Disputes of Titles.
And Princes may without Fears or Jealousies mind the
Publick good, because it secureth them who are in Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
against all Pretences.</p>
            <p>The most that can be Objected, Is that a Prince that
has once lost his Dominions, may by these Principles
chance to lose the hopes of ever recovering them
again.</p>
            <p>A Prince that is unjustly expelled, ought to acquiesce
if he has no way of Recovering his Kingdom but by
disturbing the Peace and Quiet of a Nation; he ought not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64861:21"/>
to make use of such Unlawful means for the Recovery of
his Kingdom; and certainly others can have no reason to act
against the good of the Community for his Interest, when
he himself is obliged not to act.</p>
            <p>The interest of a Prince is only more Sacred then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,
when that of the Publick is involved in it, but
when that is no longer concerned in his actions, he ceaseth
to be the Publick Person, and is but upon equal terms
with other private men, and ought as well as any other to
acquiesce, rather than disturb the Quiet or Peace of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And there is then the same reason for not endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Restore him, as there was at first for not turning
him out.</p>
            <p>All the ill consequences that can happen in this case, are
that the less hopes Princes have of being Restored by such
Unlawful means, the more careful (it's hoped) they will be
in Governing the Commonwealth, and more afraid of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Illegal Practices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If all Persons how unjustly soever they get a Crown,
have the same Right (their Consent) to the Obedience of the
People, then there can be no such thing as an Vsurper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He who without any just Cause destroys the
Right that any Prince hath to the Allegiance of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
by making him uncapable to Protect them, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects
them himself, may be called an Usurper: Though
the People by the former Prince's losing his Power to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
them, are reduced to the State of Nature, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
free from any Allegiance, and may Lawfully or
rather are obliged (every one else being out of a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Protect them) to consent to be Governed by him,
who has the Power to Protect them, who being so Chosen,
has the only Right a King can have, the Consent of the
People, who are as much obliged to Obey him, as they
are any King whatever. The former King is so far then
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64861:21"/>
from being their Legal King, that he is no King at all, nor
has any manner of Right to their Allegiance. It is true
the Usurper having done him an Injury ought to make
him satisfaction, and (if he can without any damage to
the Publick) ought to place him in that condition he was
in before he made him uncapable to Protect the People;
who then, for the sake of Protection which they receive
from him, are obliged to pay him Obedience. The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Right to be restored by the Usurper, is the only
Right a Prince that is unjustly Deprived of his Regal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
can pretend to. And when I speak of his Legal Right,
I mean nothing but this by it; Amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> though
none could have a Legal Right but one of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
because they were obliged by God himself to chuse
a King from amongst their Brethren, and God afterward,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 3. entail'd the Crown upon the Posterity of
<hi>David,</hi> yet when these were disabled to Protect the people
by their being in the Power of Strangers, it was so far
from being a Crime, that it was their Duty (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Divine Legal Right any of their Brethren
could pretend to) to pay Allegiance to them, though for
the most part they were Usurpers, having no just Cause
to conquer them.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="8" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. VIII. Of Conquest.</head>
            <p>IF the Supreme Powers upon the suddenness of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
or by any other reason become uncapable of
Defending or Securing to them the Lives and Goods of
their Subjects, they are, as to those particular Cases, in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64861:22"/>
state of Nature, and by their own Authority may justly
take away the Lives of any that Assault them. There can
be no reason why (if in all other cases no Protection can
be had from those they have consented to be Protected by)
they are not in the state of Nature, and by consequence
at Liberty to pay Allegiance to those who have a Power to
Protect them. And this is consonant to the sence and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Mankind ever since there has been Government in
the world, who when their former Governors had lost the
Power of Protecting them, thought themselves notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any Tyes, Oaths or Laws that might be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the contrary, free from any Obligation as to them;
and because they could not subsist without Government,
they have always consented to pay them Allegiance who
had the Power to Protect them.</p>
            <p>And there are no Nations in the world, but have seldom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or oftener, practised it; and this is, perhaps the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all the Governments which are now extant. And
this practice does not only obtain as to whole Nations, but
even to less places; as to Towns, and Castles, which never
scruple to pay Allegiance to their new Masters, though they
change them more than once in a Campaign.</p>
            <p>I wonder what powerful Reasons (never before discover'd
to the world, and for ought I can see by their Writings, still
undiscovered) have now obliged private persons to deviate
from the universal practice of Mankind, in refusing to pay
Allegiance to the present Government, which alone has the
power to protect them.</p>
            <p>The answer to this is, That Conquest gives the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Powers a right, and that people submit to them as to
Conquerors; but the <hi>English</hi> are no conquered Nation,
which (though it is nothing to the purpose, as I shall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
shew) is, I confess, a great truth.</p>
            <p>The King was so far from invading and conquering the
Nation, that it was to secure their Rights and Priviledges,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64861:22"/>
that he exposed his Sacred Person to such dangers: But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own Principles, one of these two they must
grant (for there is no <hi>medium),</hi> That the Late King either
freely parted with his Government, and if so, there can be
no manner of pretence for paying him Allegiance; or that
he was driven out by a Superior Force, which in other terms
is being conquered: So that then (according to these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples)
His Present Majesty must have a right to whatever
King <hi>James</hi> possessed.</p>
            <p>Conquest in it self, and barely considered, can give no
manner of Right; for what obligation can lye on a Nation
to pay obedience to any one for battering down their
Towns, killing their Inhabitants, destroying their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
and in short, for doing all manner of Outrages? Must
a Nation, as a grateful return for these kindnesses, be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to pay him all manner of obedience? Can any man in
his senses think these Injuries can give the Actor of them a
title to peoples obedience? or that mere force can give a
right? for then every one that was stronger than another
would have a right to govern him.</p>
            <p>Conquest, by destroying the power the former King had
to protect his Subjects, sets them at liberty from any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
they owed him; because they owed none to him,
but upon the account of being protected by him: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
does not by this get a right to their Allegiance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
to free people from the power of another, and to have
a right to command them himself, are different things. They
being once free from Government, and by consequence in
the state of Nature, nothing can give the Conqueror right
to their Allegiance, but their own Consent. By which it
appears, that Mankind hath been often in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and considering the often Changes, and Revolutions,
there could be few, or no legal Governments in the world,
if in such Circumstances, all ties to their former Governors
were not absolutely dissolved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:64861:23"/>
But here it may be objected, That their Consent was not
voluntary, but forced; and therefore could not ob<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ige
them, or give the Conquerors a right.</p>
            <p>The conquered may in a sense be said to be forced to
what they did, because they are bound by a moral Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to act for their own preservation, and happiness;
and for that reason they were obliged to leave the state of
Nature, and be governed by him that had the power
to Protect them; none are forced to be Protected against
their own Wills, they by the former Government's
dissolution, were reduced to a state of Nature, and if the
Prince under whose Power they are, will not afford them
his Protection, they would still remain in that state; but
they by claiming civil Rights, (which they can only enjoy
by his Governing them) and referring their common
Differences to be decided, and their Grievances to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
by him, or those that Act by his Authority, have put
themselves out of the state of Nature, and have freely
owned his Government by their Actions, which were vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
for they were not forced to have recourse to him
for Protection in their Natural Rights, or obliged to claim
any Civil ones; and this is looked upon by Mankind as a
free and voluntary consent, the most part of whom have
no otherways than by their actions owned any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Though their consent was obtained by forcible means,
yet that would not destroy the validity of it: It is true, in
a Civil Society, all Contracts obtained by Force are void,
but then the Force ought to be proved, for the presumption
is against it, and Judges declare for a validity of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
if the Forcible means which were used to obtain it,
are not proved.</p>
            <p>But between Independent Nations, where force on one
side is lawful; where there is no superior Judge to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
the differences, or to judge whether force were justly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64861:23"/>
imposed, both sides either thinking or pretending they are in the
Right, all Leagues and Covenants, by whatever forcible means
obtained, are valid, and the Good of Mankind (which is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Reason) does require it should be so, otherwise Wars
would be perpetual, or not to be ended but by the utter Ruin of
the Weaker, or Conquered Party; because there could be no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Agreement, or Peace between them, if they had a Liberty,
under pretence of Force, of breaking their Promises whenever
they had an opportunity.</p>
            <p>In all such cases it is Lawful to Promise, there being no Superior
(as amongst private persons) to take from them the Liberty of
making such Contracts; and the Good of Mankind does oblige
People to fulfil those Lawful Promises. They cannot properly be
said to be forced to Promise, because it was in their power to
avoid Promising: Nor is their Consent Conditional but Absolute,
and it is their greater Good (either presumed, or real) that obliges
them to make such Contracts. For the same reason all Prisoners of
War are obliged to stand to their Paroles, and to pay whatever
they promise for their Liberties.</p>
            <p>The reason is the same for paying Allegiance to the New Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
whether by a just or unjust way the old one was dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and Mankind have all along equally submitted to Conquerors,
whether the Cause of Conquest were Just or not: As few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
have had a Just Cause for all the Mischiefs they have done.
The reason for Submission is not how one Man gets others into his
Power, or whether he had a just Cause of destroying the former
Prince's Power, but whether they consent to be Governed by him
after they are in his Power. It is for their own sake, and not for
his, that they submit to his Government: They may act against
their own Good in not submitting to the Conqueror, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him no Right if they do not submit: It is not the Conquest it
self, let it be never so just, but the after-consent that makes them
Subjects.</p>
            <p>A Just Cause of War may make it no injustice to Dethrone a
King, becanse he gave sufficient Provocation; but how can one
Prince's injuring another, absolve Subjects of their Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance?
and give the Injured Prince a Right to Command them;
who, if he hath any Right besides their Consent, when he has put
them into a capacity to Consent, must have it before the Conquest;
for mere Force cannot give or take away a Right, it can only put
him in Possession of his Right; and if he had any Right to their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64861:24"/>
Allegiance before Conquest, I cannot see but that in Conscience
they were bound to Transfer their Allegiance, and join with him
against their former Prince, who by giving a just cause of War had
Forfeited his Crown.</p>
            <p>Though the Nation be not Conquered, yet no reason can be
urged for submitting to Conquerors, but what will hold as strongly
for paying Allegiance to the present Government. Has not the
Late King as much lost his Power to Protect the People, as if he
had been driven out by Conquest? Is it not the Present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alone that makes the People a Civil Society? Is it not by it
that they are Protected in their natural Rights, or can claim any
Legal ones? which are the only reasons which oblige People to
submit to Conquerors. And are not they that endeavour to disturb
it, as much within the power and reach of the Government, as if
they were Conquered? And has not the King and Parliament as
Absolute a Power as any Conqueror?</p>
            <p>The only difference is, That without feeling any of those fatal
Miseries which attend Conquest, they enjoy the Protection of the
Government, and owe their Preservation to it; and the Nation
instead of losing any of their Rights and Liberties, enjoy
greater, and are secured from the worst of Slaveries, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they had inevitably fallen into: So that they have infinitely
stronger obligations to pay Allegiance, than if they had been
Conquered; to which their Zeal and Loyalty ought to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>

         <div n="9" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. IX. Of Possession.</head>
            <p>ALL Writers, I think, allow, That after a Possession of a
long continuance, (though they extreamly differ how much
time is necessary) a Right does accrue to the Possessor, though
there are some of the Right Line still in being. If it be unjust to
pay the first Possessor Obedience, I cannot see how a long Possession
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64861:24"/>
can alter the case. A continuance in an injustice may make the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
greater, but not alter the nature of things, and make
the greatest Wrong to be Right. Though all things are done in
Time, yet Time it self operates nothing.</p>
            <p>This Mistake (as a great many others are) is occasioned by the
parallel men draw between private Persons (who are tyed up by
Laws that are Enacted by the Supreme Powers) and the Supreme
Powers themselves. By the Laws of most Nations, if private
men neglect to make a Legal demand of their Rights in a certain
time appointed by the Laws, they lose them, and a Right does
accrue to the possessor; but this depends upon a Law Enacted by
the Supreme powers, who have a Right to dispose of private
Estates as they judge best for the publick good; whose Laws can
oblige none but their own Subjects. But what authority have the
Subjects, or the possessor to dispose of the Legal Prince's Rights?
Besides, it might justly be imputed to a private man's own neglect,
if, when the Law is open, he does not recover his Right: It may
well be presumed he hath relinquished it. But that cannot be said of
a Prince who has no Court of Justice to appeal to, or any other
likely way to recover his Right, yet by bearing the Arms and
Title, and by other ways still asserts his Right.</p>
            <p>How numerous are the instances of Princes possessed of Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
belonging to others, and who have been so for a great many
years? Yet none dare affirm the Subjects that pay them allegiance,
are, and have been all along Traitors: To give but one instance
amongst hundreds; The Kings of <hi>England</hi> have a Right to the
Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and have constantly claimed it by causing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be stiled Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and by bearing the Arms of
that Crown; yet none will condemn the <hi>French</hi> as Traitors, who
have all along paid allegiance to the <hi>French</hi> Kings. But if the
Kings of <hi>England</hi> by tract of time have lost their Right to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the <hi>French,</hi> and before that time it was Treason for
those of that Nation to pay allegiance to the <hi>French</hi> Kings, I
should be glad to know what Month, or Year, it ceased to be
Treason; for it is a thing of mighty consequence to know how
long it is Treason to obey a King in possession, and when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Treason not to obey him. In short, if a King can have a Right
to a Countrey, and it be no Crime in those of that Countrey not to
pay him allegiance, it demonstrateth that allegiance is not annexed
to the Title, but that it is due to the person that does protect them.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> Though Time does not give a Right, yet the Acts, or the no
Acts, that is, the omission of some, may in time amount to a resignation

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant a man's mind may be expressed by acts as well as
words: yet it would be a very hard cafe to condemn all those of
Treason who have paid allegiance to the possessors, before they had
sufficient grounds to believe the Legal Prince or his Heirs had by
their acts (if such acts could destroy the Right of the next of
Kin) resigned their and their Legal Successors Right to the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
In how few cases is there reason for such presumption? If
till then all people should be obliged to be destroyed rather than
pay allegiance; what a Destruction would it make in the World?
Would it not in most cases expose, at least the Good and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
to certain ruin? And others could notpreserve themselves
without a Sin, whose reward is Damnation.</p>
            <p>Long possession is not at all necessary to justifie the peoples Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
for that very moment the people receive protection and
defence from the new Powers, they ought to pay them the same
allegiance as if they had been in possession of the Government a
Thousand Years. The less time a Nation has been setled, the
more need it has of rest and peace, and the more dangerous would
any violent Revolution be.</p>

            <p>BY Opposing those in possession of the present Government, the
ill affected act not only against the preservation and happiness
of the Nation, but are guilty of the basest and foulest ingratitude,
by endeavouring to destroy those persons to whose protection they
owe their preservation, and the safe enjoyment of what they
have. Who else secureth them from being stript and plundered of
all they have, their Wives and Daughters Ravished, and perhaps
they and their whole Families Murthered? What better usage
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64861:25"/>
could they expect, if they were left to the mercy of the Rabble,
or to the discretion of every one to use them as they pleased?
Can any man in his Conscience think he is obliged to destroy those
persons from whom he receives such benefits? Is it not Serpent-like
to sting that bosom that warms them? Is this all the grateful
returns they can make to the Father of their Countrey? For if that
Command of <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother</hi> extends to Governors;
since they do not beget their Subjects, it must be for protecting
and defending them, that that Title is due: Therefore it can be
due to none but those in Possession, for none but they do protect
and defend them.</p>
            <p>Could they justly blame the Government if it did not protect
them, who make it their business to ruin it, when too without
their being protected, they would quickly be reduced to a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of not being able to give it the least disturbance? What favour
can they justly expect, when they not only disown the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but think themselves obliged in Conscience to make War
upon the Society that owns it? Nay, they are actually in the state
of War, and only watch for an opportunity to fall on. What
excuse can a Government have for endangering the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
by protecting those who are no part of it, but are profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Enemies to it?</p>
            <p>It is a cruel Mercy to endanger a whole Nation for the sake of its
Enemies. Nay, why should they have more favour than Foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
It is so far from being an excuse, that it aggravates their
Crime, that it is to their <hi>own Nation</hi> they are Enemies, and that it
is in their <hi>own Countrey</hi> that they are endeavouring to raise a Civil
War. Though they were still Members of the Body Politick,
yet, as a man is obliged to cut off any of his Limbs to preserve the
Body Natural, so the Government is obliged to do the same for the
Body Politick, if it be necessary for its preservation.</p>
            <p>It is frequently urged by the <hi>Jacobites</hi> and their Favourers, That
what they do, is upon the account of Conscience, and therefore they
ought not to suffer for it; which is but a sorry Reason to hinder
the Government from taking all necessary means to preserve it self,
and to prevent the ruin of the Nation. But this Argument looks
very odly from them who were so zealous to persecute others about
things, in which neither the Honour of God, nor the Good of the
Commonwealth were concerned. It is as absurd as sinful for any
to persecute their Brethren on pretence of Religion, for things
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64861:26"/>
which they themselves own to be no part of Religion, but merely
in themselves indifferent. But to return,</p>
            <p>If they will not be thought <hi>Enemies</hi> to the Society, but part of
it, ought they not to act equally with the rest, for the Peace and
Quiet of it, and submit to the Head, that rules and governs it?
How can they pretend to be Members of the Society, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
claim any Civil Rights by being so, without owning the
actual Government that makes them Members of the Society?
Do they not, by disowning the Government, renounce the benefit
of the Laws, (which only can be put in execution by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and Out-law themselves? How can they have any more
right to the protection of the Government, if they Out law them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
than if the Government, by putting them out of its prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
had Out-lawed them? So that it is wholly by the favour of
the Government (for they have no true pretence to them) that
they enjoy any Legal Rights. If they think they should be severely
dealt with, if the Government did not protect them, why do they
not what is necessary to enable the Government to protect them?
If they <hi>will</hi> the <hi>Consequence,</hi> the protection of the Government;
ought they not to <hi>will</hi> the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> all that is necessary to it? And
if it be lawful to desire and to receive the Advantages which flow
from Government (which I suppose no <hi>Jacobite</hi> will be so hardy as
to deny) why must not the means that are necessary to obtain
these Advantages, be so too?</p>
            <p>How can they that are willing to be protected by any person,
be unwilling (except they desire Contradictions) that that person
should have a power to govern them, because without such a power
he cannot protect them; and they that are willing to receive an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
protection, are presumed to be willing to pay all obedience that
is necessary for that end; which is an Obedience as universal as the
Protection they expect. It is evident, That he that is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an universal Protection from a Government, is willing that
the Government should have a coercive Power over all others, to
restrain them from injuring him; and that it should have sufficient
Authority to do justice, and oblige all people to pay obedience
to the Laws, when they are put in execution for his sake, because
in it wholy consists his Protection; and he that is willing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
should have power over all other people upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
ought to be willing the Government should have the same
power over him, for the sake of others, except he would be the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64861:26"/>
only man in the Nation without Government; and is unwilling to
do that himself, which he would have all others (whatever their
Principles are) to do.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Nonjurers</hi> do desire to be protected, and do actually receive
the protection of the Government, (though at the same time they
pretend it is against their Consciences) it is manifest they do own
the Government, and by their Actions consent to submit to it; and
what force can a Protestation have against their own Acts?</p>
            <p>Do not the <hi>Jacobites</hi> upon all occasions <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y for protection to the
Government? and apply themselves to those Ministers, as Legal
Officers, who act by no other Authority than their Majesties? And
have they not constant recourse to the Courts, whose Proceedings
are in their Majesties names and authority? Do not all Writs
run in their names, and do they not Prosecute people in
their Majesties names as acting against the Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of our Sovereign Lord and Lady King <hi>William</hi> and Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c. And do they not apply themselves to the King's Ministers
for the benefit of those very Laws which are enacted by the present
Government, and by consequence own the Authority that makes
them? How then can they own the Ministers, and not own the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by which they act? and if the taking a Commission from the
King for the administration of publick Justice, or in defence of the
Kingdom, be owning the Authority of the King, why must not
the complying with them, as such, be owning the Authority by
which they act? but if they don't own the Ministers to act by Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Authority, then they must confess their Sentences are so many
Robberies and Murthers, because they have no just Authority for what
they do, and they make themselves accessary, since it is at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
they commit them. Is it not esteemed by all Laws owning
the Authority of a Court, to appeal to it? Is it not owning the
Pope's Authority, to appeal to him, or any Commissioned by him?
Is it not by the Law of Nations, and an universal consent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
an acknowledging a Government, to receive Protection from it?</p>
            <p>Do not all that go into a Foreign Prince's Dominions, during
their stay, by receiving the Protection of the Government, own
themselves subject to it (except Ambassadors, over whom Soveraigns
have agreed to suspend the exercise of their Right) and are they not
obliged equally with the Natives, to pay Allegiance; and a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Treason; and so tried, if they attempt any thing against it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And upon this head, all private attempts upon a Prince in his own
Countrey, have been abhorred by all Nations; and those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64861:27"/>
any thing of this Nature, have not been treated as just Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
though in time of War; because the presumption is, They
enter as Subjects into the Dominions of that Prince that protects
them.</p>
            <p>If applying to a King, as such, for his protection, and receiving
it, be not owning his Authority, Princes have but a small securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the obedience of the greatest numbers of their Subjects, who
have no otherwise obliged themselves to own their Government,
but by receiving protection from them.</p>
            <p>The denying, That addressing to a Government for protection,
and receiving it, is owning That Government, layeth a mighty
gap open to Rebellion, by destroying the obligation of all Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but what is built upon verbal Promises; <hi>So that Men of those
Principles ought to be looked upon as Enemies of all Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By examining what it is that gives Government a right to the
obedience of men, who are by nature free, it will the better appear
what right the present Government has to the Allegiance of those
it protects.</p>
            <p>The reason that is usually given, why people are obliged to obey
any particular Government, is (no Prince being so ridiculous as to
pretend a right, as the First-born in a direct Line from <hi>Adam</hi> or
<hi>Noah)</hi> because it was the intent of those who first formed the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
that such persons, and their Successors (if they made the
Government Hereditary) should have a right to govern the Nation
for ever. But how could they, whose Authority with their Being
ceased so long since, oblige the Consciences of those who were not
then in being? or how could any Acts or Compacts of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
take away the natural Liberty of those that were born so many
years after, and who have the same right to freedom as they had?
Or how could their Compacts oblige those that are not descended
from them, but come from other Countries into the Society, and
make it a sin in them not to obey the present Governors of any
Society, upon whose Authority alone, and not upon the Founders
of the Society, depends the validity of all former Laws, which can
only bind, because it is the will of the present Powers they should;
otherwise no Laws could be repealed, if their very being did not
depend upon the pleasure of the present Supream Powers, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
they shall oblige, until they declare the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:64861:27"/>
Others say, That being born in a Countrey, makes one a Subject
for all his life to the Government of that Countrey; but why should
being in a Countrey, by being born in it, make one become a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
more than being in the same Countrey at another time. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
common Experience shews this to be false, because whoever
is born in a Countrey where his Parents are Foreigners, may, as it
is allowed by all, leave that Countrey when he pleaseth. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it may be said, he is a Subject to that Prince where his Parents
were born. What if they were born under the same Circumstances?
or suppose his Parents are of different Countreys, as if a <hi>Dutch</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and an <hi>English</hi> Man have a Child in <hi>France;</hi> since <hi>France</hi> does
not pretend to him, which of the Nations can claim him for their
Subject? or must he be divided? So that the difficulty still remains,
how people come to be obliged to obey any particular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
which I think can only thus be solved.</p>
            <p>Every person, though he be born free, yet he is for the sake of
his own safety, obliged to part with his Liberty, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
under the protection of Government. Nor can he be secure in
what he enjoys but by it. Nor can he have a right in a Countrey (that
is already possest) to any thing, but by owning the Government of
that Countrey. And by pretending to the Priviledges the rest of
the Society enjoy, he has owned himself a Member of the Society,
and a Subject of the Government of it. And this is the only way
that any (except by verbal Promises) consent to become subject to
Government.</p>
            <p>The consent of particular persons being separately and singly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
unthinking people take little notice of it, and suppose they
are as naturally Subjects, as men; and consequently, that they have
no more right to free themselves from their Subjection, than from
their Human Nature; nay, must suffer themselves to be destroyed
rather than endeavour it.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, If a man is no-ways bound to a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but by his own Consent, and if the Acts of his Ancestors no
way oblige him, he is not bound to stand to their divisions of the
Lands, but he may, <hi>pro virili,</hi> put in for a share, as he might, when
all things were in common.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If it would be injustice in any one to go into a Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
to the Laws of which he is not bound, and seize any Land in
it, on pretence that the divisions of the Land were formerly made
by people whose Acts could not oblige him, and therefore he had
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64861:28"/>
as just a right as any of the Inhabitants, to a share in the Land; if
this were injustice in him, why would it not be so in one that is born
in that Countrey? What Right can he, that comes from no other
place, but from Nothing, pretend to, more than he that first came
from another Countrey. If a Countrey be wholly possessed, and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied,
(which by the Law of Nature, antecedent to all Human Laws,
gives a right) by being improved and cultivated by the labour and
industry of the Inhabitants, who are so very numerous, that the Land
does not produce without vast labour, sufficient to maintain them,
what right can any that comes into this Countrey, either by being
born in it, or any other way, have to their labour, by usurping any part
of this Land, which was long since possessed, and divided amongst the
the Inhabitants, who having a full power over their own Properties,
might subject them to what Laws they pleased, (and which the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative
Power may still continue) and permit none to have a right
to them, or enjoy any advantages by them, or so much as to be in
the Countrey without owning the Government of it? And it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reasonable that no Government should suffer any to remain in its
Dominions, who will not own its Authority, or be subject to the
Laws of the Countrey. If it were unjust, before Lands were divided,
to have robbed any one of the Fruits of the Earth, that he by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
had made his property, why should it not be as much inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to seize upon that Land, which is now as much another's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
as the gathered Fruits were then? But I shall speak no more
upon this Subject, because it is, in his Essay of Government, so fully
handled by that wonderfully Ingenious, and Judicious Author, whose
Works of all sorts one cannot enough commend.</p>
            <p>Whatever Society people chance to be Members of, whether it
be their Native, or any other, they are, during their stay, equally
obliged, for the sake of the protection they receive, to Pay Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the Governors of that Society. It is not material, whether
they enjoy Properties for their lives, years, weeks, or days, the
greatest part of the Natives have no more Properties, or enjoy no
greater Advantages by the Government, than Foreigners, yet they
are obliged to pay the same Allegiance the rest of the Society do.</p>
            <p>But here it may be objected, That there is a natural Allegiance
due to the Governors of the first Society Men are of, (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be due to any other) without whose consent they cannot leave
the Society, and when abroad, are obliged, when they command
them, to return.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:64861:28"/>
Man being born free, (that distinction of legal and natural Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
being wholly groundless) is still Master of all that Liberty he
has not parted with; and if the Laws of the first Society, to which
he has consented, by being a Member of it, have not obliged him
not to leave the Society without the consent of the Governor, he
is at liberty to transport himself into what Countrey he pleaseth,
and to stay in it as long as he pleaseth. It is for the interest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
that they should not be debarred the liberty of living where it
is most for their interest; and because Nations could not maintain
any Trade or Commerce one with another, if people that went
from one Countrey to another, had not a power to return when
they had a mind to it; that Liberty, by the Law of Nations, is equally
allowed to all: They, it is true, who have left a Countrey, whether
it was that they were born in, or any other, yet as long as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
any Property in it, are obliged, if they intend to save their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
to leave all other Countreys, when commanded. Men oftner
having Properties in their Native, than in any other Countrey,
has given occasion to some to conclude, That there was a natural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
on them to return, when commanded: But there can be no
reason assigned from Nature, why more Allegiance should be due to
the Governors of that Countrey in which they were born, than to
the Governors of that Countrey they afterwards voluntarily go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
where for the Protection they receive, they are obliged to pay
the same Allegiance as they did when they were in their Native
Countrey. And if a Foreign Prince should get the power of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
them in their Native Countrey, they would be obliged to pay
him the same allegiance, as they did when they were under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
in another Countrey: Because in each Countrey the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is the same.</p>
            <p>Though they that reside in a Foreign Society, are equally subject
with the Natives, to the Laws of it; and by opposing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
would be equally guilty of Treason; yet if during their stay, any
alteration happens in the Government, contrary to the Laws, they
never scruple to pay allegiance to him that gets possession of the
Government, though his Title be never so illegal. I see no reason
why they should not do the same in their first Society, since what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Society they are in, during their stay, they are equally obliged
to obey the Laws of that Society.</p>
            <p>Are not these Reasons as strong for paying allegiance to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Government? Can any man enjoy the Priviledges of the Society,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64861:29"/>
without being a Member of the Society? or can any one be a Member
of a Society, without owning the Head of it, or paying their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to him? or is there any other Head that rules and governs
the Members, but the present King? Is it not by his Authority, that
the Members of the Society receive an universal Protection, as to
their Lives, Liberties and Estates, under whose Government they
are, or else they are under none, but in the state of Nature? And
there is no Reason, or Law, to oblige people to remain in a state so
inconsistent with their happiness. And it would be injustice for any
to remain in that state, because they would be their own Judges in
all the Disputes they had with others, who were willing to refer their
Differences to a standing impartial Judge; nor have any been guilty
of it, but all, not excepting the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> by making use of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Government, have left the state of Nature, and
have owned themselves subject to it. After this, what pretence <hi>can</hi>
any Member of the Society have of refusing to pay their allegiance
to a King, whom they have all along by their actions owned, and by
whom they have been secured from groaning under the worst of
Slaveries, which had been to them the more intolerable, because of
the great liberty and freedom they before enjoyed; so that all the
Reasons that can well be imagined to oblige people firmly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to any Sovereign, do all conspire to tie them up in the strongest
bonds of allegiance and fidelity to the present King and Queen.</p>
            <p>By what hath been said, I think it is evident, how absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it is for the good of Mankind to submit to those persons that
are capable of protecting them, and that applying to them for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
is acknowledging their Government, and Authority, and
that the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> in using the protection of the Government, and at
the same time opposing it, as far as they dare, act basely, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,
ungratefully and inconsistently.</p>
            <p>But they that oppose the Government, after they have sworn to
be true to it, break all Tyes both Sacred and Civil; for if neither
their Oaths, nor the good of the Society they pretend to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of, nor the duty they owe the Government for protecting
them, can oblige them; no bonds whatever (for these are the
most inviolable) can hold them: How can any Prince, or private
person, trust them, since they have destroyed all manner of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
trust, and confidence men have in one another? All the answer
to this is (I mean of the <hi>Non-swearers,</hi> for the others are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of giving any) That they act upon the presumed consent of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64861:29"/>
the <hi>outed Prince,</hi> who (they suppose) is willing, that they should
obey the present Government in all things which are for the good
of the Society, and their own preservation, provided it be not
contrary to his interest. Which answer is not at all to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
because it supposeth they are still obliged to disturb the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace, and raise Civil Commotions for his interest, and notto
own the present Government, though it should be absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for their preservation.</p>
            <p>Can any Civil Society be preserved, if private Men are obliged
not to obey those that actually Govern it, except they think it for
the interest of a person who is a declared Enemy to the Society?
and when every thing that tends to the support and advantage of
the Society, because it makes the present Government more potent,
must be against his interest? What if the late King has no other
way to regain his Throne but by the Ruin and Confusion of the
Nation? must the <hi>Jacobites</hi> assist him in Ruining the Nation? as it
is plain by their Principles they are obliged to do; for if once
they think that they are obliged to act against the good of the
Society by raising a Civil War, it is certain there is no mischief,
provided it be for his interest, that they ought to stop at. And
it is plain by their rejoycing at any publick Calamity that happens
to the Nation, that they are ready if they thought it at present
for his interest, to fire all the Towns in <hi>England,</hi> or act any more
horrid Villany. But if they disown these Principles, and say they
are obliged to act for the preservation and good of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
contrary to his Interest and Consent, then they are obliged to
obey the present Government, because that is for the good
of the Community, and for the safety of particular persons,
who if they have the Late king's Consent to do such acts as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
infer the owning the authority of the Government, they
have his Consent to own and obey the Government. And then
according to their own Principles, they can have no pretence of
denying allegiance to it. If such acts do not amount to an
owning the authority of the Government, then most people
never owned the Late King's authority, because they owned it no
other way then by receiving protection from him.</p>
            <p>It is strange that not only those that receive protection from
the Government, but even those that have thrust themselves into
places of the greatest Trust, and consequently have the greatest
Obligation to bear true allegiance to Their Majesties, should own
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64861:30"/>
they have no Right to it; and the greatest Compliment they can
give them, is, That they are King and Queen <hi>de Facto;</hi> which in
other words is calling them Usurpers; and is, even whilst they are
their Servants, owning themselves Subjects of the Late King.
Men of such Principles cannot accept of Places of Trust, but for
verybase ends; for they must either design to act against their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
in acting against the interest of him they esteem their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Rightful King, or else they must design to betray their
Trust in acting for his interest; which, when it is their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
too, and they may have what Price they demand for
betraying their Trust, there can be no doubt but they will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to serve him who they think has the Right Title to their
allegiance. The fatal consequences that have happened to the
Nation upon trusting men of those Principles, have too well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
the truth of it. But to return,</p>
            <p>If doing all those acts the Male-contents do in order to the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Persons and Properties, be not owning themselves Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Government, there was no reason for Mankind to
have submitted to, and owned any Government; since according
to their Principles they could have all manner of protection and
defence without any Government; because they (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend)
enjoy protection from the Government without owning
its authority over them, or any duty in them to obey.</p>

               <hi>PErhaps it will be said,</hi> Tho upon supposition that there is no reason
why people should pay Allegiance any longer than they are protected,
yet if they have otherwise tyed themselves by their Oaths, they are in
Conscience obliged by those Oaths. <hi>But I answer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such Oaths (if ever such were imposed) would be so far from
binding, that they would be null upon the account of the sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of them, as being directly against the good of human So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.
In all Promises and all Oaths concerning things that are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64861:30"/>
not Moral, this tacite condition is always included, of their not
being, or upon alteration of the Circumstances becoming contrary
to the publick Good; and this is without all doubt to be observed
about Government, because it was instituted for no other reason
but for the publick Good.</p>
            <p>Oaths do not alter the nature of allegiance, or make it due
where it was not before, or any ways extend it, but only add a
new tye to pay that allegiance which is due upon the account of
protection; he that lives under a Government, though he has
not Sworn to it, owes it the same allegiance as he that has; and if
he should deny his allegiance to it, would be equally guilty of
Treason, though not of Perjury. It is evident by the universal
practice of Mankind, that no Subjects ever thought themselves
obliged by their Oaths of Fidelity, which Governments have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
imposed on them, when they ceased to be protected by
them. The Legislative power, especially where the people have a share
in it, are presumed to recede as little as possible from natural
equity, and to design by imposing such Oaths, the good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Society; whose interest it is, that they that have
the publick Administration of affairs should not be disturbed. But
it is not at all material whether this or that man, provided they
are well managed, has the direction of them: Nor can it without
the greatest absurdity be supposed, that such numbers of men as
Societies are composed of, who are by nature equal, should oblige
themselves by the most solemn Tyes to become most miserable, by
living without protection; nay, to lose even their lives rather
than own the Government that can protect them, for no other
reason, but barely an extraordinary fondness to one of their
Number, to give him, not the Necessaries or real Conveniences of
Life, but only an Office (for Government is no other) which is
but an imaginary happiness; for if Government were a real
happiness to the Persons that possess it, several upon their parting
with it would not have found themselves happier then before.
That people should be true to those that have the administration of
Civil affairs, is all that Oaths of Fidelity require: and it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the words of it, that the late Oath of Allegiance required
no more, and to extend it further then the King in Possession, is
not reconcileable with the reason, end, and design of paying obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
which is the peace aud happiness of the Society, which
can never be maintained if people may, for the sake of a single
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64861:31"/>
person, disturb him that has the Administration of their common
affairs; and it would require impossibilities, because a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is incapable of paying allegiance to a King when out of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Government.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XII. Of the Act of Parliament of the 11 of Hen. 7.</head>
            <p>BEsides no Act of Parliament ought to be so interpreted, as by
bare implication to destroy a former Act, as such an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
would the Eleventh of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. Chap. 1. a Law still in
force, which does declare, <hi>It is against all Law, Reason, and
Conscience, that Subjects,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>any thing should lose or forfeit for doing
their Duty and Service of Allegiance. Be it Enacted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that attends upon the King and Sovereign Lord for the time being,
and does him true and faithful Service of Allegiance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall not any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be molested.</hi> What can be plainer then that it is the duty of
every Subject to bear true saith and allegiance to the King in being?
And to encourage them in their duty, the Laws does secure them
from any manner of Molestation for the time to come, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
it against all Law, Reason, and Conscience that any should
suffer upon that account.</p>
            <p>The people would be in a most miserable condition, should they
be in danger of being Hang'd for not obeying the King in being, or
for obeying him, to be punished by the succeeding Kings as Traitors.</p>
            <p>The endless quarrels, almost to the utter Ruin of the Nation,
between the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> made the necessity of
such a Law very evident: Tho this then was no new Law but only
declarative of the ancient Law (for they supposed it before to be
against all Law, as well as Reason and Conscience, that, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> By
which Law it is plain, that a King in possession has the same Right
to the Peoples allegiance, as any King whatever; because no King
has any other then a Legal Right to the peoples obedience, which
this Law declareth is the Right of all that are in possession of the
Government. And accordingly it has been the opinion of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64861:31"/>
Lawyers, that Treason cannot be committed but against a King in
possession, and there can be no Treason committed but against him
to whom allegiance is due; and Acts of Parliament made in the
Reigns of such Kings (though not confirmed by succeeding Kings)
are valid, and oblige the Subjects, as much as those made by such
as are usually call'd Legal Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it may be Objected,</hi> That if they who were instrumental in a
Rebellion, may not endeavour to restore their Legal Prince, they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of a possibility of making restitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Those that unjustly deprive a King of his Crown, ought
no doubt to Restore him; but if another has got possession of the
Government, by what has been said, I think it is plain they ought
to obey him. There can be no dispute, but they that were no way
instrumental in the Revolution, but did their Duty in Defending
him in the possession of his Crown, were free from any obligation
as to him, when he had lost the power of protecting them; and
were bound for the sake of their own preservation to pay allegiance
to him from whom they received protection, and obliged to defend
him to the utmost; but if the rest of the Society who receive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
from him are obliged to oppose him, then the Society must
be divided, and of necessity run into Civil Wars, which is against
the nature of Civil Societies, and inconsistent with the duty of
self-preservation, which obligeth men not to expose their lives but
to obtain a greater good than their lives, which can only be the
publick Good, not the single Interest of any one person.</p>
            <p>They that were instrumental in raising a Rebellion, were no
doubt guilty of a very enormous crime, but that which made it so,
was not barely the injury they committed against the Prince (to
whom, if alone considered, the breach of a promise in refusing to pay
obedience to him, could be no greater crime than a breach of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to another person) but the fatal mischief &amp; irreparable damage
they did the Commonwealth: And a new Commotion, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
would be more destructive; and a Nation by being so
much weakned by the former, would be less able to bear a new
War. It is a greater sin, if the persons themselves are only consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
to take away the life, of one man, than to deprive another
of any worldly advantage; it is only the publick that makes it
otherwise, but the publick in both cases is equally concerned, and
the consequences may be as fatal in disturbing the Usurper's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as that of a Legal Prince. That which makes the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64861:32"/>
Crime of Rebellion of so deep a dye, is, because Rebels put it
out of their power to make reparation for all the misery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
a Civil War creates; nor is endeavouring to bring the
same Calamities upon a Nation, a proper way to make them amends.
If there be no other way to make reparation to their injured King,
but by engaging the Nation in Civil Wars, they ought not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
making him reparation by such unlawful ways.</p>
            <p>The not restoring a Person to the Crown that he is unjustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of, can only be considered, when the publick is no longer
concerned in his Actions, and the Affairs of the Nation are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by other hands, as an injury to a single person, and the
greatness of the injury, is to be judged not by the value of the
thing it self, but what he that is unjustly deprived of it, suffers by
the loss of it. What is absolutely necessary for the subsistence of
one person may be but superfluities to another; and as the Widows
Mites were greater Charity than what the Rich out of their Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
gave; so the Robbing her of them, because she could less
spare them, would have been a greater injury, and consequently a
greater sin, than Robbing a Rich man, that could better spare it,
of a thousand times as much.</p>
            <p>Tyrants, it is true, rob great numbers of the conveniences,
and very often of the necessaries of Life; but Usurpers only hinder
single persons from enjoying, not the necessaries or conveniences of
Life, but Superfluities, because all the necessaries, and even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of life, can be had without a Crown. Yet the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
without all dispute, if they can without any injury to the
publick, ought to restore the Government to those from whom
they do unjustly wrest it; but if they do not, Subjects for the
sake of Government, to which Sacred Ordinance, Obedience by God
himself, as well as man is annexed, ought to submit. Christ and his
Apostles make no distinction, but command Obedience to all in
possession, by annexing God's Authority to the Office of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIII. Of Proofs of Scripture concerning Obedience to those that
actually Administer Government.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>CHRIST</hi> in the Directions he gave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and to the multitude about their Behaviour to the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> requires Obedience to be paid them
only upon the account of Possession; saying, <hi>The Scribes
and Pharisees sit in Moses's seat, all therefore whatsoever they bid
you observe, that observe and do:</hi> and gives no other reason for
this great Obedience in doing and observing whatever they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but because they sat in <hi>Moses</hi>'s seat; that is, were possessed
of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Authority, who in the <hi>Theocracy</hi> was the Chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.
Not that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> had so great a power as
<hi>Moses,</hi> but as far as they did enjoy his Seat, Throne, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
so far they were to be Obeyed: They were then the greatest,
as well as chiefest part of the grand <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> which in all causes
where the <hi>Romans</hi> had left the <hi>Jews</hi> to their Liberty, had the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power both in Civil and Ecclesiastical matters. (There
were not in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Republick two distinct independant Powers,
one for Civil, another for Ecclesiastical Causes). If the people
were then obliged to pay so great Obedience, barely upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Possession, why may not the same direction serve for a
standing rule to the multitude in all times? And not only to the
Inferiors, but even to the Supreme Magistrate himself <hi>Christ</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
Obedience upon no other account but that of possession.
If <hi>Caesar</hi> be in possession of the Empire, as it did appear by his
Coining of Money and Stamping his Image upon it, that being a
mark of Sovereignty and Empire, but not of any Legal Title to
it; then <hi>Caesar</hi> is to have Tribute and all other parts of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
paid him.</p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in express terms requires Obedience to <hi>the powers
that be,</hi> and declares there is no Power but what is from God.
The <hi>Jews</hi> being influenced by the Priests and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were obliged by their Law to place no Stranger over
them, scrupled to pay obedience to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, because
they were Strangers and not capable of a Legal Right, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the Law did not oblige them but when it was in their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64861:33"/>
own choice, and not when they were under the power of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
to whom for the sake of protection they were obliged to
pay obedience; St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to take away these scruples, assures them
all Powers are from God. If St. <hi>Paul</hi> had only meant Legal Powers,
since none but <hi>Jews</hi> were capable of being such, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Error. But the reason why St. <hi>Paul</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
men to submit, will demonstrate that all <hi>actual Rulers</hi> are meant
and none but they, because they alone are a Terror to evil works,
and a Praise to the good, none but the <hi>actual Ruler is a Minister of
God, a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil, or a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of God for good.</hi> What can more fully demonstrate that the
reason of obedience is for the benefits men receive by Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
And what makes the Crime of Resisting them so great, is,
because men Oppose those by whom they receive so many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages?
It is because they have the power of the Sword (which
includeth all manner of Punishment) by which they secure and
protect their Subjects from all manner of injury and violence of
ill men; and being Ministers of God for good, includeth all the
good they receive both to their Persons and Properties; <hi>for which
cause you pay tribute also, for they are God's ministers continually attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon this very thing.</hi> It is their dispensing these advantages to
Mankind, that makes them God's Ministers and God's Ordinance
(the Scripture affirming those things that are necessary for the
good of Mankind to come from God, as plowing and sowing,
<hi>Isaiah</hi> 28. from Verse the <hi>23d.</hi> to the <hi>29th.)</hi> If it once be known
(as the discovery cannot be difficult) who it is that beareth the
Sword, who administers Justice, who Rewards, and who Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
if the Apostle's word is to be taken, subjection is not only
due to him for Wrath, but for Conscience-sake: and the same
Apostle exhorts, That <hi>prayers be made for Kings, and all in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty.</hi>
These reasons can only concern those that have <hi>actual</hi>
Power and Authority, by whose protection those that live under
them may lead such lives; and if it be our duty to pray that we
may lead such Lives, it must be our duty to enable them that
have Authority over us, to secure us in the enjoyment of a quiet
and peaceable Life. Do the Principles or Practices of the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi>
suit with this Doctrine? who instead of Praying for those in
Authority, make it their business by opposing them, to destroy not
only our Quiet and Peace, and even all Godliness and Honesty too,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64861:33"/>
by endeavouring to set up again a Popish Governor, and by
consequence, to introduce a Religion, whose Principles are
destructive of true Godliness and Honesty, as well as the Peace
and Quiet of the Professors of them. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> for the same
reason requires people to submit to the Supream Magistrate,
whom he calls the Ordinance of Man; so that it is plain, that
God by approving this Human Ordinance, approves it as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and requires obedience to it for the same Reasons that men at
first instituted it. And it is the power Governors have to do Good
that makes them to be not only God's Ordinance, and God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
but even <hi>Gods;</hi> for since they are not Gods by nature, (tho
by some peoples arguing one would suppose they though them such,
or at least Beings in themselves superior to the rest of Mankind) it
must be for the protection they afford, that they are termed so; who
when they do no longer protect the people, cease to be a <hi>Human</hi>
Ordinance, and then too they cease to be a <hi>Divine</hi> one: And the
same Reasons that obliges people to submit to them, when they act
for the good of the Society, does as much oblige people to oppose
them, if they design to ruin and destroy them. It cannot well be
supposed, that God who has obliged Mankind to preserve their
lives, and consequently to use the means that are necessary for that
end, should require People to suffer themselves to be destroyed, to
gratify the Lust, or Barbarity of a single Person, or a few; who
are by Nature but their Equals, and only above them by being in
an Office which they erected only for their Convenience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes no manner of exception, but declareth, <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
resists shall receive damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Apostle requireth obedience to Parents in all things;
so he requireth obedience to Masters, Husbands, Pastors, without
mentioning any Exceptions; so here the Apostle (which was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for his purpose) declareth all people ought to obey the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Powers, without mentioning this exception, which from the
nature, end, and design of Government, and even from those Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which he gives for Obedience, does necessarily flow.</p>
            <p>It cannot be presumed that Christ gave Authority to his Apostles
to make Slaves of Mankind, by giving the Emperors a new Power,
who before by no Law of God or Nature had such a power over peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
lives. All the Power the <hi>Roman</hi> Government had, was immediatly
from the people; who, as it is plain in History, by their mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
erected that Commonwealth; and what power the Emperors
had, was given them too by the people, who by the <hi>Lex Regia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
it upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:64861:34"/>
All that can be deduced from Scripture, is, That obedience is due
to those that protect the people; and nothing can be plainet than
those Texts which require it: By which plain and ignorant people
may know their duty, as well as the learned and wise. It would have
been inconsistent with the Goodness of God to have required obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
on the greatest penalties, and yet leave it so uncertain, as
the <hi>Jacobitish</hi> Principles would render it, to whom obedience is to
be paid. What can be more uncertain than generally Titles are?
And are there not innumerable intricate difficulties, about long
Possession, presumed Consent, a just cause for a total Conquest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
If about these Points the Learned do so extreamly differ, as any one
may perceive, that gives himself the trouble to examine what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have writ upon it, who give good Reasons for destroying one
another's Hypothesis, but none for confirming their own, but what
are liable to equal Exceptions; what means or possibility have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all Mankind, the unlearned and common people, of knowing
their duty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it may be objected,</hi> Though the common people should be mistaken,
invincible Ignorance will excuse them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Not to dispute how far such Ignorance will excuse them; I
am sure it is inconsistent with the Infinite Wisdom of God, to give
such Rules, as almost all Mankind are utterly uncapable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
or guiding their Actions by. But whoever considereth
these Texts of Scripture, will see the falseness of such impious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and must admire the Goodness of God in laying down Rules
so plain, that a well-meaning man cannot mistake them: But if men
will be wiser than God himself, and not be content with those Laws
he prescribes them, but will invent new Rules, and new ways; or by
following the Tradition of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Priests, will disturb the peace
and quiet of Human Societies, by opposing the Powers that be: If
by so doing they incur the severest Punishments here, as well as Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Torments hereafter, with those damned ill-natured Spirits, the
grand Enemies of Mankind, who at first possessed men with these
Maxims so pernicious to Human Societies, they must thank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their too great Subtilty.</p>
            <p>The Primitive Christians all along complied with the Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Empire, and whoever was in possession of it, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aming
his Title, paid him allegiance, and thought him invested with
God's Authority: And as the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and other barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nations on one hand, and the <hi>Saracens, Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> on
the other, without any just cause overturn'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64861:34"/>
Christians were so far from disputing their Titles, or refusing to
transfer their Allegiance to them, that they never scrupled to own
their Government. If these Pharisaical Notions had then been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
or practised, those Nations would have extirpated all the
Professors of Christianity as Enemies to Government and Order, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of being converted to their Religion, as most of the Northern
Nations were. Nor do the Christians, that now live under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
of the Infidels, vary from this Primitive Practice, or scruple
to transfer their Allegiance to any that gets possession of the Sacred
Office of Governing, tho the Legal Prince be still alive. Did not the
<hi>Jews,</hi> though they were commanded by a Divine Law to take a
King from amongst their Brethren, and God himself had intailed
the Crown on the Posterity of <hi>David,</hi> practice the same, as they
fell under the power of the four great Empires? And did they not
submit to <hi>Alexander</hi> without endeavouring to oppose him, when
<hi>Darius,</hi> to whom they had sworn obedience, could no longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
them?</p>
            <p>I shall add but one Instance more, and that shall be of <hi>David,</hi> who
thought it not unlawful, when <hi>Saul</hi> designed to take away his life,
to transfer his Allegiance, and fly to <hi>Achish</hi> King of <hi>Gath</hi> for prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
who made him Keeper of his Head, or Captain of his Guard;
and whilst he was under his protection, he thought it his duty to
pay all manner of Allegiance to him; and (tho contrary to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and the hopes he had of being King after <hi>Saul</hi>'s death) even
to join with the Uncircumcised to invade his own Countrey, and to
sight against the Lord's Anointed, his late King and Father-in-law;
and as appeareth by the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29. 8. was much grieved, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
expostulateth with the King for not permitting him to attend
him in the Battel; <hi>But what have I done? or what hast thou found in
thy servant, so long as I have been with thee until this day, that I may
not go and fight against the enemies of my Lord the King? Saul</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to destroy <hi>David,</hi> had freed him from the Allegiance he
owed him; for he that designs to destroy a person, cannot have a
mind to govern that person he designs to destroy; and if he will
not govern him, he is free from his Government, and at liberty to
pay his Allegiance where he thinks best. And if <hi>David</hi> expected
from the King of <hi>Gath</hi> an universal protection from all his Enemies,
he ought to pay the King an universal obedience.</p>
            <p>If a private person be free from the Government that designs to
destroy him, the Argument will hold as strongly in behalf of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is designed to be destroyed; and whoever attempts it,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64861:35"/>
does not only renounce the Government of the Nation, but puts
himself in a state of War, and declares himself an utter Enemy to
them, who are as much obliged to resist him, as they are any other
Enemy.</p>
            <p>Upon this Head the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> took up
Arms against their Legal King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> (whom they all along ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
as such, and who was Successor to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had
the same right to their obedience as the <hi>Persians</hi> or <hi>Assyrians</hi> had,)
who was resolved to extirpate them if they would not turn Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
And it is manifest, that God by the miraculous assistance he
gave them (for what they did, must be imputed to more than Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Force) did approve of their design. And the same Reasons
will justify any Nation for opposing that Prince, that does endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
upon a religious, or any other account to destroy them.</p>
            <p>By what hath been said, I hope it is plain, that by the positive
Law of God, by the Law of right Reason, by the Law of all Nations,
and the universal practice of Mankind, and the express Law of
the Land, obedience is due to the King who does actually govern
the people; and therefore to the present King and Queen, though
they did not enjoy the Crown (vacant by the late King's Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
by any Legal Right; which Right I think has been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
demonstrated by those that have writ on that Subject, at least
to Lawyers, and men that are competent Judges in such Points, of
which a great many are no more competent Judges, than they are of
Mathematical Demonstrations, which are nevertheless Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but none can be mistaken who they are that do actually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the Nation; and if obedience for that reason be due to them,
other inquiries are needless.</p>
            <p>Therefore I shall only add, That nothing could be more Just, more
Glorious, more Meritorious, than the Prince's coming over to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
three Nations from Slavery and Ruin, by obliging the Late
King (which by all possible Ties he was bound to) to govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law: To which he was so averse, that he was resolved
not to govern at all, if he could not govern Arbitrarily; which
when he plainly saw he could not effect, he threw up the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Which, whatever Force may be pretended, must be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a voluntary Action, because he might have prevented it by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
according to Law; according to that known Axiom,
<hi>Involuntarium ex voluntario ortum habens moraliter pro voluntario ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Throne being actually vacant by his deserting it; What
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64861:35"/>
Reason could hinder the Prince from accepting what was his Right,
when offered him by the Convention of the States of the Kingdom?
Who, (when the Throne is <hi>actually vacant,</hi> and it is not clear whose
Right it is) are, and have always been, the sole proper Judges to
determine to whom it belongs; whose Judgments must give a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Right, because all Legal Rights are held by no other Tenure,
than the Decree of the Supream Judges.</p>
            <p>But supposing the King had no Legal Right, and that the Convention
were not Legal Judges; yet if they were chosen by the Nation, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin,
upon the late King's leaving it, what was necessary to be done
for the preservation of the Nation, it being necessary that somewhat
should be resolved on; that necessity would give them a sufficient
Right to do whatever they found necessary for the preservation
of the Nation: Because no Nation can be brought to that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but it must have a Right to act for its own safety; which it
cannot do, if it have not a Right to appoint Judges to determine
what is to be done, and oblige particular persons to stand to their
Determinations.</p>
            <p>And the Convention ought, if they thought it (of which they
were appointed the Judges) for the safety of the Nation, wholly to
exclude the Late King. And why might they not, if they thought the
Nation could not be safe if he should return, be wholly against his
return, as well as the <hi>Jacobites</hi> themselves (for there were none of
another Opinion then) be against his return, but upon such Terms,
and Conditions, as they thought necessary for the safety of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
And the same necessity that will justify the Late Archbishop
for consenting to put the Soveraign Administration of Affairs into
the Prince's hands, will justify the Convention for continuing it in
the hands of the King, who alone could secure the Nation; and who
had saved them before he ruled them, and to whom it was owing
that they could call any thing (even their Lives) their own. Which,
if it be not the best Title to a Crown, yet at least is the best Title
to Peoples Hearts and Affections, when he is possest of it; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when the chief advantage he gains by it, is but to expose his
Sacred Person for the Security of the Nation: And the enlarging
his Empire has only encreased his Cares and Concerns for the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of those he governs: And all the satisfaction he reaps (which to
a God-like Mind is the greatest) is the power to oblige, and to do
good. The Nation is happy in having a King whom they can trust;
not only because his Interest is the same with theirs, but because, as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64861:36"/>
all the Actions of his Life have demonstrated, no Consideration of
his own could ever divert him from acting what was best for the
Cause he was engaged in; and who is as famous for being true and
just to his Word, as his Enemies are infamous for breaking their most
Sacred Oaths, and Solemn Leagues. In a word, He is a Prince that
has the Vertue, the Fidelity, the Integrity of <hi>Cato,</hi> as well as the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
the Courage, and Conduct of <hi>Caesar.</hi> Never did the happiness
of the best part of Mankind depend more upon a single Life, than
now. Nations of Religions, and all things else, different, do
unanimously agree in acknowledging him to be their chief
Support, the Head, the Heart, the Hand of the Confederacy;
and to him they confess that it is owing, that the Chains that have
been ready to setter <hi>Europe,</hi> have been more than once broken. To
be the Preserver of <hi>Europe,</hi> is a much more glorious Title, than to be
the <hi>Conqu<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> of it: To which may be added, the most excellent of
all Titles, <hi>The Defender of the Faith;</hi> which (tho others have claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of course) he best deserves; since to him it is owing that the
true Faith is publickly professed any-where, and in these Nations
(which is a Blessing cannot be bought too dear) without Cruelty or
Persecution; <hi>For a Nation is constantly in a state of war within it self,
where one Party is persecuting and ruining another, about things which are
in themselves indifferent, and no ways tend to promote the Publick Good.</hi>
In short, There can be no advantage, but what the Nation may justly
expect from a King so zealous to promote their Good, and so able
to perform what he undertakes.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIV. Some Considerations touching the Present Affairs.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>BUT it may be objected,</hi> How can the Nation propose any happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to themselves by this Revolution, since by it they are at so great
Expences to maintain a war against so powerful an Enemy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The more powerful the Enemy is, the greater was the
necessity of this Revolution; for if now the Consederates are
scarce an equal match for <hi>France,</hi> how easily would they have been
over-run, if <hi>England</hi> (which is the most favourable that could
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64861:36"/>
have been expected) had stood Neuter? And when they had been
subdued, what could have hindred the <hi>French</hi> King, being then
so Potent both by Sea and Land, from Conquering this Island?
What opposition could the Militia, joyned with a few raw and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Troops, (for it is this War has made them otherwise) tho
headed by a Commander of so invincible Courage as the Late King,
make against his regular and numerous. Troops? But suppose the
<hi>French</hi> King, who is so famous for keeping his Royal word, would
not have Conquered <hi>England</hi> when he might; what could have
hindred the Late King, assisted by <hi>France,</hi> from using this Nation
as his Cruelty, Covetousness, Bigotry, or <hi>Jesuits,</hi> could have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
him? The <hi>French</hi> King, had he been defective in so funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
a point of Religion, would have obliged him, as he did the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to have Extirpated all the Hereticks. <hi>England</hi>
would have been perhaps by this time a rendezvouz of <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Irish</hi> Apostolick Dragoons, or what is worse, a nest of Priests and
Jesuits. And what milder usage can the Nation expect, if the
Late King, who is under such obligation to <hi>France,</hi> and incensed
by (as he thinks) ill Treatment, should return? Ought not they,
except they are ambitious of being Roasted by a <hi>Smithfield</hi> Fire, or
are in love with the manly exercise of Rowing in the Gallies, to do
their utmost endeavour to stop the farther Progress of <hi>France?</hi>
which only prevails because their Armies are more numerous? If
there were more Forces raised (the Nation is so far from wanting
men, that it can spare about Thirty thousand by easing the Parishes
of those Idle People who are burthensom to them) sufficient to
equal those of the <hi>French;</hi> there is no reason to doubt but the
<hi>English</hi> would beat them, as they have always done, when the
Numbers have been any thing near equal, and force them to quit
other places as shamefully as they did <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The misfortune is not, that we have now a War with <hi>France,</hi>
but that it was so long delayed; and whatever the Nation now
suffers, they wholly owe it to the Two Late Kings, who instead of
hindring, when they might, the growing greatness of <hi>France,</hi>
did under-hand assist and contribute, as far as they durst, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the exorbitant Power of that Kingdom. Though the Charges
of the War, it is true, are burthensome, yet they are common
to almost all <hi>Europe;</hi> nor are they so great as some people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
them, since it does cause little or no alteration in Peoples
way of Living; the same excess in Apparel, and every thing else,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64861:37"/>
and the Interest of Money being as low as ever, (at least it would
be so, did not the King's taking up such large Sums at so great an
Interest, raise the Interest of Money even amongst others) are a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of its plenty: And the Native Commodities of the
Countrey bearing a much better Price than Formerly, chiefly by
reason so much is taken up for the King's use upon account of the
Army or Fleet, must more than repay the Countrey for what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to the War. The Taxes themselves are not so much a
burden, as the unequal way of raising them, and obliging people
to pay so much Money at one time; which cannot well be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but by an Excise, which would make them so easy, and so
equal, that they would hardly be felt. But if they were more
burthensome then they are, then paying of them for some time is
absolutely necessary to preserve their All for ever.</p>
            <p>In the Primitive times, the Christians (especially the Clergy)
would <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> dispose of their own, but even what was Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Pious Uses, and sell the Place that belonged to the Altar
to redeem a Soul from Slavery: Why should they not be now as
Zealous to secure Milions of Souls, Three Nations, and their
Posterity, from a Bondage both Spiritual and Temporal
worse than <hi>Egyptian;</hi> or at least encourage people by
their precept and example freely to contribute to a War
upon which depends the safety of the Church as well as State <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a
War so holy, that if the Cause alone could make them Martyrs, all
that dye in it are such.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, I hope, I have demonstrated, That it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all People to bear true Faith and Allegiance to the present
Government, by Reasons and Arguments which are as firm as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
it self, and which will endure as long as it, because built
upon the same foundation, <hi>The Good of Societies;</hi> and which may
serve for directions in all Changes and Revolutions, as well as for
the justification of that happy one, which (by the Blessing of God
upon His Majesties Heroick Endeavours) preserves us in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all our Happiness both Spiritual and Temporal.</p>
