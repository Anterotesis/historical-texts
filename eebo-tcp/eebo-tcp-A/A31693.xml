            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHARACTER OF A JESUIT.</head>
            <p>HE is a Peccant Humour of the Body Politick, that diſturbs the Conſtitution with Inteſtine Malignity, and after, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Head; if the dangerous Malady had not been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by the Diligence of ſome, and Information of others, its Effects had been Infallibly Pernicious and Deſtructive. He is the ſpurious Iſſue of the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> he was Born in a Tempeſt, and brought up in a Wilderneſs; his Nurſe was ſome Inſatiate Bear, that miſtook him for her Cubb, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards lickt the helpleſs Lump into her own Deform'd Nature. He is an Injurious VVaſp that always frequents the ſweeteſt Soyl; and cannot be contented with his reſpective Delicacies, but will Sting you, though you touch him not, and diſturb your quiet with his angry Buzzings. He is an Ominous Comet, and Portends VVar, Peſtilence, and Famine to that Courtry where he appears. He is an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> that abuſeth his Deluded followers with his ſeeming Luſtre, and inſtead of directing them to their Journeys end, he wilders them in Ignorance, and leads them through Fenny Boggs, and Thorny Brakes, whilſt the Miſguided wanderers muſt work out their Deſtruction with Toyl and Induſtry. He is a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal, and accordingly Gluts himſelf with Proteſtant Fleſh, whilſt his Horſe-leech Thirſt is altogether Inſatiable. His Religion is like that at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> Univerſal and Unconfin'd, though particular upon occaſion. His Truth is <hi>French,</hi> and his Morals <hi>Iriſh:</hi> His Feet are ſwift to ſhed Blood, and his Tongue to Perjure and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane: His Forehead is hard and laſting, but his Ears Tranſitory: His Eyes are unaccountable and aſquint, this looketh to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but his Noſe is <hi>Romane:</hi> His Head is as bare as his Fortunes, and his Ears is as large as his Conſcience: His Coat is an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Freeze, and lined with Equivocation, made a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to turn inſide out: His Breeches are cloſe kneed, to preſerve an Oath of Secreſie, and his Stockings are of a changable colour, moſt ſuiting his Profeſſion: He is Sworn to Celibacy, yet can diſpenſe with Plurality of VVomen: He'l come a Pilgrimage to pay his Adoration to the Crutch of the poor lame Convert in the Goſpel, and after will uſe it to knock out the Brains of the next
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:98615:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Cripple: He'l Sacrifice Virginity to the riſing Ghoſt of his own Luſt, and will drown the VVidow in the Tears of her Orphan: He'l Murther with Zeal and Devotion, and be Villanous with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Licenſe; an Oath with him is no more than a Faſhion, and accordingly he alters it at his pleaſure. He is the repining Ghoſt of his Baniſh'd Religion, that obſcurely ſtalks about, and Angrily demands ſatisfaction for the Injury Receiv'd, and unleſs he be Conjur'd down by a Mageſtrates wand, and the circle of a Rope, with ſome laſting <hi>Tyburn</hi> charm, the uneaſie Goblin will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually diſturb the Kingdomes quiet: an Epitomy of all Villains compris'd into a Method, are qualifications agreeable to one of his Profeſſion: He'l violate Chaſtity and Virgin Innocency upon the Alter, and will ſtop the Mouth of the ſhreiking Sufferer with his <hi>Maſs-Book:</hi> He'l corrupt the thoughts of the ſtricteſt Matron, and perſwade her, that the abuſe of her Husbands Bed is Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: He delights to welter in Blood and Butchery, and will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs himſelf to his great Judge with one hand up to Heaven, and the other upon his Poniard: if his glutted Conſcience after ſuch a deluge in Gore, ſhou'd be nice and ſqueemiſh, one Dram of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will immediately digeſt the Scruple, and prepare the Jaded Actor to attempt a freſh Sally. He is a pernicious Caterpillar, that cannot be content to Feaſt his Sences with the Luſcious Sweets of the Garden, but meanly and baſely, muſt deſtroy the choiceſt Plants: He is the Spawn of the Old Serpent, and can wind himſelf into any myſterious Curl or Figure, whilſt under the gilded and ſpangled Skin, there lies a poyſonous Sting: He is a Villain by Birth, and is accordingly improv'd by Art and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; his Church doth warrant his Attempts, and encourage his proceedings; there is more Religion practis'd on Ship-board, when the Foaming Billows beat, and the buſie <hi>Tarpawlins</hi> are in a ſtickle, or amongſt a company of looſing Gameſters, then in one of their Cloyſters. I have Read of a Jeſuit, that after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſuch Enormities, as the moſt daring Sinner would almoſt dread to repeat, that inſtead of confeſſing his long Muſter-Roll of ſins to his Ghoſtly Father, condemn'd his Ignorance, and ſaid, He <hi>Repented nothing, but that he had not been a</hi> Columbus <hi>in Sins, and diſcovered new Worlds of Iniquities.</hi> He is a Prodigy in Nature, and has deſtroy'd Gods Image in himſelf: His Principles are Deviliſh, and his Practiſes are ſuitable; but ſince he is incorrigible, we'l ceaſe to Laſh him with Satyrical Invectives, and ſo leave him to the Rod of Vengeance.</p>
