            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the vniuersite where a gret nomber of auditors was gathered / and there before the whole multitude I taryed an howr or ij loking whan myne aduersary shuld come. but he although he refrayned from dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacyon (for what purpose or consideracyon I can not tel) yet he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spired me such enuy that there were some that were not a frayd to threaten me that it shuld cost me my life which thing after I had opened to the vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanceler by the councel of certen of the wi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sest men there / and sawe him winke at the matter / I gaue place to this malyce also and departed from thens / specially for as moch as I perceyued there were statutes sent forth from the bisshops and from the whole councel of the reame which were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch that it had bene wickednes not to haue spoken openly against them and yet to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue reproued them it shuld haue bene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a poynt of sedicyon.

thether by the commandment of the king wold suffer none of his vniuersyte to speak against any of the comon lawes. wherfor I determined with my self to serue the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and to change the preaching of the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sse with the scyence of physik wherin I had a litle sight before / And thus I went vnto a very well lerned phisycia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Nicolas which hath practised phisyk in lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thes many yeares with high pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se / whose company I dyd vse certen yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res wherby I did both see and lern many things euen the principal poyntes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that science.

of the scripture in the mother tong. And it fortuned me to haue a like conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion with certen bisshops of Ingland (whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch maynteyne still the bisshop of rome so farre as thei dare) whether all things neces<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sary vnto our saluacyon be conteyned in the scripture / or but a part only and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydue to be taken out of the gloses of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors / out of the actes of old councels and out of popes lousy decreys.

            <p>Whan the lord crumwel had spoken his mynd after this sort with high grauyte (as he was a man of a gret witt / of excellent wisdom and of goodly eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) all the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops did ryse vp and gaue thankes to the kings maiesty for his ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t study and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre toward an vnite and for this vertuos exhortacyon most worthy a christen king.

            <p>This exhortacyon did the archbisshop make most soberly <hi>&amp;</hi> discretely as he is a

man of a singular grauyte / with such swe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenes that it did my hart good to hear him And bicause I did signifye bi some token of my countnance that this admonicyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the archbisshop did please <hi>&amp;</hi> delight me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly wel / the lord cromwel bad me spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke what I thought of this disputacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / but he told the bisshops before that I was the kings scolar and therfor he desiered them to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to heare me indifferently. Than I after the rude maner of the scholes rather than after any courtly solemny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te / bowing my knee for a token of curtesy and reuerence / as It became me / with out any preface at all / bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speake after this maner.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence and iudgement of this disputacyon.
<pb facs="tcp:9376:10"/>
And I think that my lord archbisshop ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th geuen you a profitable exhortacion that ye shuld first agree of the significacyon of a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. whether ye wil call a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a ceremony institute of christ in the gospel to signifie a special or a singular vertu of the gospel and of godlines (as paul namith remissyon of sinnes to be) or whether ye mene that euery ceremony generally whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch may be a token or a significacyon of an holy thing / to be a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For after this latter significacyon I wil not stike to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nt yow that there be .vij. sacramentes and more to If ye wil. But yet Paul semeth to describe a sacrament after the first sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificacion wheras he sayth that circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a token and a seale of the rightwisnes of fayth: This diffinycion of one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sacrament must be vndersto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vnto all sacramentes generally / for the Iewes had but one sacrament only as all the scholastical writers do grant. And he describeth baptyme after the same maner
<pb facs="tcp:9376:10"/>
in the .v. to the Ephesians wheras he sayth that Christ doth sanctifye the church) that is to say all that be baptised) thorow the bath of water in the word of life. For here also he addeth the word and promes of god vnto the ceremony / and Christ also requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth fayth where as he saith / who so euer bileueth and is baptised / shal be saued. And s. Austen describeth a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thus / The word of god coming vnto the element / ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the sacrament / and in a nother place he saith a sacrament is a thing wherin the pour of god vnder the forme of visible thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges doth work secretly saluacyon. And the master of the sentences doth describe a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament no nother wise. A sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t saith he is an inuysible grace and hath a visible forme / and bi this inuysible grace I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne / saith he / remissyon of sinnes. Finally s. Thomas denieth that any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torite to institute a sacrament. Now if ye agree vnto this diffinicyon of a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t / it is an easy thing to iudge of the nomber
<pb facs="tcp:9376:11"/>
of those sacramentes which haue the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest word of god and be institute bi christ to signifye vnto us the remissyon of our sinnes. s. Austen saith that there be but .ij. such sacramentes in the .cxviij. pistle vnto Ianuarius: His wordes be these. First I wold haue the to vndersto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the somme and effect of this disputacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / which is this that our lord Iesus Christ (as he him self saith in the gospel) hath lade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us but with a light and easy yock or burden. Wherfore he hath glewed the felowship of his newe peple with sacramentes / very fewe in nomber / very easy to be kept / and very excellent in signifycacyon / which be baptyme and the supper of the lord and such other if there be any moo commanded in the holy scripture those except which were burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uytute of the peple in the old lawe for the hardnes of their hartes et ce. And agayne in the .iij. boke of the lerning of a Christen man he saith the scripture hath taught us but fewe signes / as be the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
<pb facs="tcp:9376:11"/>
and the solemne celebracyon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberance of the body and blode of the lord et ce.</p>
            <p>The bisshop of london could scarsly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to speake thus moch / but he brake forth and said thus vnto me / where as ye affirme all right and true sacramentes to be institute of Christ or to haue the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest scripture to proue them or that all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes must haue a significacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missyon of sinnes / It is all false. Than I answered that I wold proue all that I had sayd to be true not only by the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re but by the old doctors and by the schole writers also.</p>
            <p>But the bisshop of herforth (whom the kings grace fauored highly both for his sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gular wisdom and lerning / which was tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> newe comne out of germany where he had bene Imbassytor) being moued with the frowardnes of this bisshop of londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sayd vnto me brother Alexander contend not moch with him about the myndes and
<pb facs="tcp:9376:12"/>
sayngs of the doctors and schole writers / for ye knowe that thei in many places doo differ among them selfes and that thei are contrary to them selues also almost in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry article. And there is no hope of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to be made if we must leane to their iudgementes in these maters of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy / and we be comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the kings gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce to dispute by the holy scripture / et c. And he turned him to the bisshops and made a short and pythy oracyon. Think ye not / sayd he / that we can by any sophistical sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltes steale out of the world agayn / the light which euery man doth see / Christ hath so lightned the world at this tyme that the light of the gospel hath put to fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght all misty darknes and it wil shortly ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue the higher ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of all cloudes though we resist in vaine neuer so moch. The lay pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do now knowe the holy scripture better than many of us. And the germanes haue made the text of the Bible so playne and easy by the hebrewe and the greke to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that
<pb facs="tcp:9376:12"/>
now many things may be better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand without any gloses at all than by all the commentarys of the doctors. And more ouer thei haue so openned these controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sys by their writings that wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern may wonder at the blindnes <hi>&amp;</hi> fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode that hath bene hetherto. Wherfor ye must consider ernestly what ye wil deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myne of these controuersys / that ye make not your selues to be mocked and laughed to storne of all the world / and that ye bring them not to haue this opinion of yow to think euer more here after that ye haue neyther one sparke of lerning nor yet of godlines in yow. And thus shal ye lose all your estimacyon and auctoryte with them which before toke yow for lerned men and profitable membres vnto the comon welth of Christendome. For that which yow do hope vpon / that there was neuer heresy in the church so gret but that processe of tyme with the pour and auctorite of the pope hath quenched it / it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
<pb facs="tcp:9376:13"/>
But ye must turne your opinyon and think this surely that there is nothing so feble and weake / so that it be true / but it shal find place and be able to stand against all falshode. Truth is the doughter of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me / and tyme is the mother of truth. And what so euer is beseged of truth can not long continue / and vpon whose syde truth doth stand / that ought not to be thought transitory or that it wil euer falle. All things consist not in painted eloquence <hi>&amp;</hi> strenght or auctorite. For the truth is of so gret pour / strength and efficacite / that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neyther be defended with wordes nor be ouercomne with any strength / but after she hath hidden hir self long / at length she putteth vp hir head and appereth / and as it is written in Esdra / a king is strong / wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne is strongar / yet wemen be more strong But truth excellyth all.</p>
            <p>He spake many more things to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>&amp;</hi> effect very discretely to the high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte of all that hard him. And I thinking
<pb facs="tcp:9376:13"/>
my selfe to be encoraged by his oracyon / I began thus to reason against the bisshop of london.</p>
            <p>Sacramentes be signes or ceremonys which make us certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and sure of the wil of god. But no mans hart can be certen and sure of the wil of god with out the word of god / wherfor it foloweth that there be no sacramentes without the word of god / and such as can not be proued out of the holy scripture ought not to be called sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. The first part of this reason is Sanct Pauls own saing the .iiij. to the Romanes where he saith that circumcisyon is a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and a seale of the rightwisnes of faith. Ergo it requyreth faith to certify mans hart of the wil of god. But the word of god is the foundacyon of faith / the .x. to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ma. Faith cometh bi hearing / and hearing cometh by the word of god. For the mynd must be taught and instruct of the wil of god by the word / like as the ey is taught <hi>&amp;</hi> instruct by the outward ceremony. And
<pb facs="tcp:9376:14"/>
Paul by this saing confuteth this opinyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes shuld make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuos and iust before god for the very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work without faith of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and after this maner doth Paul speak vnto the Ephesyans that christ doth sanctifie his church thorow the bath of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the word of life. And for as moch as he ioyneth the word vnto the ceremony <hi>&amp;</hi> declareth the vertu and pour of the word of god that it bringeth with him life / he doth manifestly teach that the word of god is the principal thing <hi>&amp;</hi> euyn as it were the very substance and body of the sacrament and the outward ceremony nothing els tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a token of that lyuely infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>macyon which we receyue thorow faith in the word and promes. S. Paul also in ministring the sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the lordes supper doth manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adde the wordes of Christ: He toke bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad / saith he / and whan he had geuen than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes he brake it and sayd / take ye this and eate ye this for it is my body. Item do ye
<pb facs="tcp:9376:14"/>
this in my rememberans. Beside this he teacheth euidently that only christ and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne but he had pour to institute a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and that neither the apostels nor the church hath any auctorite to alter or to adde any thing vnto his ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / where as he saith / For I receiued of the lord that which I d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lyuered vnto yow et ce. To what purpose shuld he go a bout to moue the peple to bile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue him and to wi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne their hartes with this protestacyon if it had bene lauful for him to haue made any sacramentes or to haue altered the forme <hi>&amp;</hi> maner of ministring this sacrament / as some men both wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and shamelesly do affirme that the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did alter the forme of baptyme. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had spoken thus moch / the bisshop of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don did interrupt me / and sayd / let us gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the sacramentes may be gathered out of the word of god / yet are you farre decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued if ye think that there is no nother word of god but that which euery sowter and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler do reade in their mother tong. And if
<pb facs="tcp:9376:15"/>
ye think that nothing perteyneth vnto the Christen faith but that only that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in the byble / than erre ye playnly with the Lutheranes. For. S. Iohan saith that Iesus did many things which be not writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton. And. S. Paul commandeth the Thes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>salonians to obserue and kepe certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton tradicyons and ceremonys .ij. Thessa. ij. Moreouer he him self did preach not the scripture only but euen also the tradicyons of the elders Act. xvj. Finally we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued many things of the doctors and councels by tymes which although thei be not writton in the bible / yet for as moch as the old doctors of the church do make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / we ought to grant that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them of the apostles / and that thei be of like autoryte with the scripture / and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally that thei may worthily be called the word of god vnwritton.</p>
            <p>Now whan the right noble lord Crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel / the Archbisshop with the other biss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops which did defend the pure doctrine of
<pb facs="tcp:9376:15"/>
the gospel hard this / thei smyled alytle one vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a nother for as moch as thei sawe him flee euen in the very beginning of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputacyon vnto his old rusty sophistry and vnwritton verites. And I wold haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed further with the bisshop to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed this blasphemos lye / But the lord Crumwel bad me be content for the tyme began to go away and it was .xij. of the clock / and thus I made an end with this protestacyon. Right reuerend master biss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop ye denye that our Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth leane only vpon the word of god which is writton in the bible / which thing if I can proue and declare / than ye wil grant me that there be no sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes but those that haue the manifest word of god to confirme them / vnto this he did consent and than immediately that assemble was dissolued for that day.</p>
            <p>Now the next day whan the bisshops were assembled agayne and I was present with the lord crumwel / there came vnto me
<pb facs="tcp:9376:16"/>
a certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> archdeacon in the name of the arch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bisshop of ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>torbery which told me that the other bishops were greuosly offended w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But he bad me gyue hym the paper wherin I had writton my disputacyon that he might shewe it to the bisshop of londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

right reuerend fathers / yesterday whan I disputed of the sacramentes with the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of london / we came thus farre that those only ought to be called sacramentes which haue the word of god for them / and this point only remained to be further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that nothing ought to be taken for the word of god but only the holy bokes of the old and newe testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For the bisshop of london affirmed that the tradicions and ceremonys wherof the old ecclesiastical wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters do make mencyon / were receiued of the apostles and geuen us of the fathers from hand to hand and therfor thei may be lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called the word of god vnwritto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / and our faith must be proued by them as well as by the holy scripture which is writton in the bible.</p>
            <p>Now I haue determined to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute this saing and opinyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and to shewe by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest testimonys of christ / of the Apostles of the prophetes and also of the old doctors that the Christen faith ought to leane on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:9376:17"/>
vpon the holy scripture and that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of the old <hi>&amp;</hi> newe testament only ought to be had and taken for the word of god. And because there hangeth a nother dispu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon this / that is to say / of the auc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>torite of the doctors and of councels / I wil also speake of them. For cochleus and other blasphemos lyers which for the bellys sake haue salable tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges and in whom the saing which Paul alledgeth against them that mainteyne wicked doctrine for their bellys sake doth very wel agre / saing. The cretya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are alweys false lyers / wicked beastes and slowe bellys. These hipocrites I say / do plainly hold that the church (that is to say the bisshops / as thei vnderstond) hath pour to iudge ouer the scripture and to examyne it / and also that it hath auctoryte to allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we or to refuse the gospel / and to dispense with the .x. commandments and to alter the forme of baptyme and to make newe articles of our faith beside those which be conteined in the scripture. Some there be
<pb facs="tcp:9376:17"/>
that speake yet more reuerently saing that thei contend not of the scripture or of the word of god but of the exposicyon theroff which thei wil haue to be taken and sought of the church and of the doctors which be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of the church / vnto whose iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thei say we ought to stand in all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sys of our faith what so euer thei deere whether thei haue any scripture for them or no.</p>
            <p>This sophistical suttelty although it hath more coning than the first grosse blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy / yet it is to the same effect and thei both haue one end and defend both one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But yet / before the bisshop of londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / there was neuer none so farre past shame as to say that the rytes and ceremonys in the church which can not be proued by the scripture ought to be called the word of god vnwritten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that we ought to byld our faith vp on them as vp on the holy scriptu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re written in the bible.</p>

            <p>But first I wil beate downe this gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se blasphemy / and I wil shewe and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that our whole fayth and all the articles of the christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture of the prophetes and apostles / so that a christen man is bownd to byleue no other thing than such things as may be proued out of that scripture.</p>
            <p>This horrible blindnes of men / and the boldnes <hi>&amp;</hi> malycyos obstinacy which foloweth therup on (wherthorow thei blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme god and his holy word / ) is rather to be lamented than to be conuict with many reasons the thing being so manifest. But the nerer that the brightnes of the sonne of reightwisnes doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e / and the more clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the light of the gospel doth shyne / so

For the false teachers euen whan thei were in the most blind darknes were neuer so bold nor impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to breake out in to such a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as to say the church might make ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we articles of the faith not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in the scripture / or that it hath auctorite to dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

bold as to affirme that the articles of the christen faith ought to be sought not in the scripture but in the gloses of men and in bisshops lawes / or that mans tradicions / ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes and ceremonys receyued in the church and not conteyned in the scripture / ought to be called the word of god vnwritton.</p>
            <p>But I wil cease my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playning seing I know that now is the latter tyme wherof the prophetes / christ / and the apostles did prophecy that there shuld come false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes which shuld face out the gospel and imagyne a newe gospel euen stynking / he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenyssh / old wiuyssh and capcyos fables inuented by the suttyl wit of man as peter and paul calle them / and of these false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes (that is to say Antichrist) did daniel christ and paul admonissh us that he shuld extolle him self a boue god and shuld robbe god of his name / pour / wisdom / and mercy and shuld accuse him of right wisnes / cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elnes and weakenes <hi>&amp;</hi> vnabylyte / which thing we do manifestly see in maner in all

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more if thou byleuest Iesus to be the son of god / than thou shalt grant that he hath sent the holy gost to sanctifye the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacyon that is to say all the faythful accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to his promes / and that he is the god in whose name he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that we shuld be baptysed / lyke as in his fathers name
<pb facs="tcp:9376:34"/>
and his. Ite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the prophetes do beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the holy gost / namely that we must receyue remissyon of synnes thorow his na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me and he promyseth that he wil rayse us vp againe vnto euerlasti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g life. These thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges haue I spoken the more largely for the shameful cauellacyon and blasphemy of London which denyeth that all the articles of our faith can be proued by the scripture / because. s. Iohn saith that Iesus dyd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miracles which be not writton in this boke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now wil I alledge the myndes of Ciril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus and. s. Austen to confute this wicked and blasphemos opinyon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cyrillus writing vpon Iohn. the .xij. chap. speaketh thus: Iohn saith there is a gret multitude and an infinyte nomber of the myracles which the lord did / but those / saith he / which we haue shewed yow be suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficyent to them that reade them diligently for the stablysshing <hi>&amp;</hi> confirmacyon of a perfight fayth / and I am not to be blamed
<pb facs="tcp:9376:34"/>
though I haue not writton them all. For if all were gathered one by one / none left out / the whole world wold not receyue the multytude of the bokes. Wherfor all that he did were not writto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: But all things whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch the writers thought sufficyent both for the fayth and bylefe / and also for the life and conuersacyon of men / that we myght shyne with a right and perfight fayth and with true workes <hi>&amp;</hi> vertues / and so come vnto the kyngdom of heauen thorow our lord christ be wrytton / wherfor it is a newe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye / lately inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in the deuels shop to say that all the articles of the christen fayth can not be proued by the scripture / and that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s tradicyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s besyde the scripture be good workes and please god. Now ye may see that the church in Cyrillus tyme did not acknoulege this wicked blasphemy.</p>
            <p>Austen affirmeth the same writing vp on this place of Iohn / these be writton that ye shuld byliue etc. Our lord Iesus saith he / did many miracles but all be not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb facs="tcp:9376:35"/>
/ for those that shuld be writto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cialy chosen <hi>&amp;</hi> pyked owt as many as wer thought necessary and sufficient for the sal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the faithful. By these auctorites ye may see that thei belye the old doctors which say that they maynteyne any such blasphemy. But now to make an end of alledging any more testimonies. I wil cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te only .ij. specyal and most faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses against this deuelyssh sophistical ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uillacyon and opinyon / namely Peter and Paul and so wil I make an end. For euery man that hath any witt at all may plai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly perceyue that Peter wrote his second pistle against such blasphemers as do imagine a new word of god besyde that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton. For he calleth the scripture euen a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true prophecy and he calleth them false / or lyeng Prophetes which teach co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to this prophetical and Apostolical prophecy or any thing which is not conteyned in it. and he teacheth this rule wherby we shuld auoyde all maner of lyes that we shuld

trye and examine them by this prophetical word or prophetical scripture wherunto he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth us to haue a specyal eye as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the candel which dryueth out and banish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth away all darknes and lyes of the deuel. His wordes be these.</p>
            <p>I wryte vnto yow this second pistle to prick you vp <hi>&amp;</hi> to quycke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your hartes that ye might remember the wordes which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bene told now before by the holy prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes / and also the wordes of our message and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment which be the Apostles of the lord and sauior / for ye must knowe that in the latter dayes there shal come mockers</p>
            <p>Now these mockers he paynteth with specyal colors wher by thei may be known. Thei shal bring in saith he / pernicyos and da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable sectes / or as Paul saith / thei shal speake lies in hypocrisy vnder the color and pretense of holynes. Forbidding to mary <hi>&amp;</hi> to absteyne from the meates which god hath created to be receyued of the faithful with thankes geuyng / And thei shal denie

the lord (saith he) which hath bought or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed them / and the way of the truth shal thei slander and reuyle / as certen blasphem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers do now a dayes speake blasphemosly of paul / because he doth manifestly confute mans satisfaccyons / rightwisnes / and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempcyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by workes. And therfor / saythe he for couetosnes sake thei shal make marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But their doctryne peter calleth disceit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful fables and he sayth that their sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telty must be disclosed by the lantern of the prophetycal scripture. And we haue the word of prophecy / saith he / wher unto ye do well to harken as vnto a candel geuyng lyght in the dark nyght tyl the daye lyght appeare and the mornyng sterre ryse in your hartes / for as moch as ye know that no prophetycal scripture belongeth to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s interpretacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor it was neuer thrust vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:9376:36"/>
us by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wil / But the holy men of god were inspyred of the holy gost / and moued to speake it.</p>
            <p>This is a sure and a substancyal testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute all maner of doctrines and tradicyons besyde the scripture / yea and to refuse all maner of doctors and writars which speake any thing of their own bray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne without scripture to confirme it.

For now our faith is confir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med with a vnwritto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dicyons / with custome / ceremonis / fathers and cowncels with out any word of god / and the manifest scripture is moked out with euery crafty hipocrites Imaginaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and glose. yea it is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of our han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and burnt. Now if these men be not lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers of them selues and estemers of their own wisdom / if thei be not couetos / if thei be not arrogant and vaine glorios / if thei be not braggers and blasphemers / which ymagin a new vnwritto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word / if thei be not dissobedient <hi>&amp;</hi> vnthankful vnto their parentes which wil not ones moue their fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te

            <p>Paul whan he shuld take his last vale of the church or congregacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and byd them farewel for euer / he called a cowncel whose auctoryte and testimony he wold haue to be estemed and regarded of all men / and in that councel he preached thus vnto the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops. I take you all to witnes / and testifye vnto you all this day that y am innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re <hi>&amp;</hi> clere fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the blode of you all / for I ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue kept secret fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you none of those things which concerne your profyght and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon / but I haue opened vnto you all the councel of god for the space of .iij. yeares / day <hi>&amp;</hi> night without ceasing and I mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisshed <hi>&amp;</hi> exhorted euery one of you euen with weping teares. For I know right wel that after my departing there shal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb facs="tcp:9376:43"/>
among yow rauening wolues which shal haue no pyty or compassyon vp on the flock / and certen among you shal teach fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se and wicked doctryne to allure discyples after them / Wherfore take diligent hede both vnto your self and to all your floke / and watch / remembryng that I haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysshed you of these things / for the space of .iij. yere together with gret lamentacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And now brethern / I commit you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word of his grace which is able to edi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fye you and to gyue you an inherytance with all them that be sanctifyed. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here doth paul monissh the councel of the false and lying prophetes and he exhor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth the whole church that thei remember dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly his monicyon wher of he had put them in remembera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce continually for the space of .iij. yeares that thei shuld take hede of those wolues which had deuoured both bodis and soules of men with wicked doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne / opinions <hi>&amp;</hi> tradicions which thei wold thrust in to the church vnder this color and
<pb facs="tcp:9376:44"/>
cloke / that the apostles could not teach all things necessary vnto our faith and salua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon / and that all the articles of the chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten faith are not conteyned in the word of the grace of god. I haue taken yow to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord this day / sayth he / For this cause that if ye cast a way <hi>&amp;</hi> damne your selues tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bileuing theyr persuasions / I am pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re <hi>&amp;</hi> clere from your bloude / <hi>&amp;</hi> christ shal not reken vnto me your damnacyon. For I know that this thing wil come to passe and I tremble and shake / euery ioynt of me / for the miserable perturbacyons and aduersites of the church wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es which speake of the latter dayes / come to my remembrance. And I feared lest christ shuld reken it vnto me vnd lay it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my charge / if I shuld not haue moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed you before.</p>
            <p>And this thing with the horrible blas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phemys and Idolatry which shal opresse the church / hath made me so heauy <hi>&amp;</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reful / and hath caused me to water myne
<pb facs="tcp:9376:44"/>
eyes so oft. But what shal I doo whan I heare danyel sayng. The determinacion is concluded: I can no notherwise do than monissh you that ye heare or receyue no ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we opynions vnder any such cloke or color as though I had not opened vnto you all the councel of god somoch as perteyneth vn to you to know / or as though I had hidden any thing from you which shuld be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary vnto your saluacion. I can not tell what to say more / but only to commit and referre you vnto the word of the grace of god / that is to say / to the holy scriptures which all are able to edifye and to bilde you vpon the tru foundacion which is christ / wherupon the whole church / all the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arckes / prophetes and apostles be bylded and grounded / Christ is the foundacion of the church we be the stones and stikes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch are proued and assayed with diuers ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and aflictions / The holy gost is the master bylder or worck man / and the word of god is the clay <hi>&amp;</hi> lyme which holdeth
<pb facs="tcp:9376:45"/>
the whole bildi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to gether. For by the word of god we are incorporate vnto the church / and by it we abide and remayn in the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che. This word also incorporateth ioyneth / <hi>&amp;</hi> groundeth us perfightly to christ / that we shuld not be drawn away and ledde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with euery blasing wynd of doctryne and so fall a way agayne. This is a good bucler agaynst all the fiery dartes of the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uel. This is the sterne wherby alone / the shyp of the church is ruled. This is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker which ones broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or lost / our faith must nedes vtterly perissh. To this word peter biddeth us loke as vnto a lantern which in the dark night of ignorance / of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pt of god of infidelite and of all weakenes of such hartes as be blinded of the deuel she<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weth the light of faith and the knouledge of gods will that we fall to no heresis nor receyue the doctrine of the false lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes. And by this light which chaseth a way all darknes of errors / Christ and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand us to examen and trye all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:9376:45"/>
of doctrine as by the true toche stone. And Paul biddeth us ronn vnto this in all stormes as vnto the most sure anckar / <hi>&amp;</hi> to resist or withstand all maner of stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge doctrines with the holy scripture / and Christ doth plainly pronounce that by this we shal be iudged at the last day. Iohn wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth / this to be sufficient to obteyne euer lasting life by. And christ sendeth the man which enquired of him by what meanes he might be saued / vnto this scripture / which luke saith that he hath writton with all dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligence. Esay sent them which sought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we reuelacions vnto this word / Christ also sent them which required myracles vnto this: saing Thei haue Moyses and the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phetes if thei wil not byleue them / neither wold thei bylefe if any shuld ryse from dea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>th. By this word doth Moyses command kings to feare god / and he biddeth the prist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to iudge by this word / and at last he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th / let this word be writo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out to you before your eies / that no man may be excused of
<pb facs="tcp:9376:46"/>
ignorance / and he saith further / that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>&amp;</hi> erth shal witnes against us at the latter day / that we geue ouer our selues agayne frely / willingly and wetingly vnto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel / if we receyue any doctryne not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the word of god / or if we iudge <hi>&amp;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyne any thing of the wil <hi>&amp;</hi> plesure of god without some testymony of the holy scripture. Now these testimonys ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thered out of the holy scripture be sufficient against this grosse blasphemy of the vnwritton word.</p>
