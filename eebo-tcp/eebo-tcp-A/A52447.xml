            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>A Short Work needs little Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
and this Work is both
short and slender, so as it may be
easie to make a Gate large enough for
the City it self to run out at. A
Iourney cannot be too little, nor the
Way too plain, for a person of Body
tyred, and Spirits spent by past tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell;
and I may well professe my
<pb facs="tcp:48968:3"/>
self such, having in my dayes galop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
so many Post-stages. In the prime
of my youth I past (or rather lost)
some few years at the Vniversity of
<hi>Cambridge.</hi> Then I came to have
a tast of the Court, but my Father
soon called me from thence, knowing
by dear experience the Air of that
place to be such, as few elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
can long breath there without
falling into a Consumption. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I lived with my Parents at
their <hi>London</hi> habitation, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no employment I surfeited of
Idlenesse, taking my pastime with
some of the most corrupt young men
<pb facs="tcp:48968:3"/>
of those dayes. By Gods grace I
quickly found this unfit for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and therefore I prevailed with
my Father to send me beyond Sea
to travel, where in lesse then two
years I had a view of the best part
of <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> being
present at <hi>Madrid</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> when
the several Marriages for our then
Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> were treated on in
those Courts, and so I became a
partial witnesse of the artifices, and
uncertainty of such Negotiations.
From thence I was employed as a
Soldier in <hi>Holland,</hi> about three
years, Commanding a Foot Company
<pb facs="tcp:48968:4"/>
in our Sovereigns Pay. And there
I ran hazard again of being lost in
debauchery, and especially in the
Vice-rampant of that People. But
by Gods grace I came home scot-free,
though I served under a <hi>Scotch</hi>
Colonel. Then I became a Married
man, and was speedily called to
Publick affairs, being elected to
four successive Parliaments, where
the Service and approaches were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
chargeable, and of no profit
as to my particular. One of these
was that fatal Parliament which set
the whole Kingdom on fire, seeking
to enervate or unsinue all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:48968:4"/>
and that it might the better
be effected, divers of us their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were by Club-law forced from
our station. Yet it pleased God (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by that Parliament) when we
were re-admitted) to put all again
in such a way, as the old Government
was perfectly restored in a succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Assembly. Then I made my full
retreat into the Countrey, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
my experience in businesses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to that course of life; and
now at last I am come to reside at the
chief Mansion-house of our Family,
where I have no other ambition then
to end my dayes with a peaceable
<pb facs="tcp:48968:5"/>
and pious dissolution; So much of
my self tyred and retired, which I
may well be, since the World can
scarcely shew me any thing new. Now
a word or two about my approaches
to this little <hi>Inventary:</hi> Being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken
with old Age, and by divers
infirmities rendred unfit for action, I
entertain my self frequently by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over old Books (whereof I have
good store in several Languages)
without any fixed Study, and among
them I lately perused one, consisting
of certain politick and prudential
Considerations, written by three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<hi>Italian</hi> Authors in an articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="tcp:48968:5"/>
way, and as I was reading, it
fell into my thoughts, that the same
might profitably be done in <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicks,</hi>
which is a path not much
travelled in. Thence I took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to turn my meditations that way,
and having spent same little time
therein, I put my materials together,
and so this small Work received
being, without any further trouble
by way of Method. As for the
Subject, though not of any sublime
consideration, I conceived it fitter
for me to embrace, then N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tes in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Government, as not having
coversed sufficiently with Sovereign
<pb facs="tcp:48968:6"/>
Princes, and taking it to be a high
presumption for private persons to
give them instructions. Yet the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of private Families may
be considerable even with Princes,
because their Principalities are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of Families, and they who are
known to have well governed their
private fortunes, are the rather judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fit for Publick Offices. <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi>
is a subject, that entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Pen of Learned <hi>Aristotle</hi>
himself, but it yieldeth little occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for pleasant conceits or curious
terms, wherefore I must advise all
persons of nimble fancy, to forbear
<pb facs="tcp:48968:6"/>
reading, least it become a kind of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to them; happy it is for this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
that it came into the World so
seasonably; for never was there more
need of good menagery then now, at
a time when Revenues of the Gentry
are fallen beyond what could have
been imagined of late years, and
they are most likely to continue so, if
not to incur a farther diminution.
I meddle not with small Families,
which are concerned in the mysteries
of Agriculture and petty Huswifery,
matters no way suitable to my mind
or experience; and there was no need,
for divers persons of peculiar know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:48968:7"/>
in those matters have written
of them. But it may be demanded,
why I, having been so great a strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler,
do undertake to give Rules
in <hi>Oeconomy?</hi> To which I answer,
That at times I have been a House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
a great part of my dayes,
and more especially in these my latter
years, at which time Men are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to take matters into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
more maturely, then when
distracted with pleasures of youth.
Indeed my nature is not so perverse,
but I receive great contentment in
being beneficial to others, for <hi>In mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimis
prodesse juvat,</hi> better do
<pb facs="tcp:48968:7"/>
a little good, then none at all. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
am I so ill opinioned of this my
Brains production, as to think it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
uselesse, and therefore such
as it is, like a Knight errant, it shall
travel about to seek adventures.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may yield assistance
somewhere; and so I leave it to its
fortune. I expect to be Censured in
all, and not to escape in this Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
as having said too much of
my Self, and too little of <hi>Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
our Subject: But my Face
being masked, the blushes cannot
appear, and therefore I may content
my self to be a patient hearer.</p>

shal be touching the
importance of <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy;</hi> wherefore
let us bring it to the Balance for
tryal. Though a Family (which
is its general object) be very
small in comparison of the State
whereof it is a member, yet
is it not like an <hi>Epicurean</hi> atome,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48968:9"/>
unexposed to sense, but an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
capable of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is of such Concernment as
a State cannot subsist without
it; for Agriculture &amp; Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
are dependant upon fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and a Nation can neither
be fed nor defended without
these, since publick contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
receive their life from them.
There were very evident marks
of Domestical thrift among the
Roman Senators in their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
and the Noble Venetians
now subsist in their greatness by
it. True it is, that States having
obtained much riches, become
subject to extravagant Expense
and Luxury; but these excesses
grow not to their height, till
the State come to its declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48968:9"/>
as it was with the Romans
and Persians. And now having
made our approaches, let us give
a Definition of <hi>Oeconomy.</hi>

                  <hi>Oeconomy</hi> is the Art of well

an Owner with his house and

without Wife and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
And Children will be

               <p>It is an antient <hi>English</hi> Proverb,
That if a man will thrive,
he must ask leave of his Wife;
and thrift is a matter of no

If therefore choyce be
made of a Wife, let him use
as well his Ear as his Eye, that
is, let him rather trust to his

he hears, than to his affection
kindled by sight, that she may
be no lesse useful in the day
than agreeable at night.</p>

It is a perfection

for the <hi>Jews</hi> did
neither enjoyn, nor exercise
it, but were so averse, as (if

truth)<note place="margin">Vxor Ebr. lib. 1. cap. 9.</note> those men who did not
apply themselves to the getting
of Children (except some few

were esteemed as bad as homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides,
being very great offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
against the first general
Commandment, <hi>Encrease and

perpetual Chastity is most
commendable; but to oblige
themselves to it is onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for those who have the gift
of Continence, which is not

our blessed Saviour, having

Therefore it may be mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous

Courses of life there
are different wayes of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but in each there must be
a training up to Vertue and
Piety. A Single life is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part, giving a capability
of beginning the heavenly joyes
here on Earth, by an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Contemplation of the
Divine Excellencies. These
young Women cannot be too
little inur'd to vanity, since
the true businesse of their life
is a pursuance of their dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and worldly businesses
are but accidental. But the
other sort, which in this <hi>faece

may be permitted (as S. <hi>Paul</hi>

it seems, that in their breeding
such strictnesse is not required,

neither is vanity so much to be

that these may assume some

I shall take the freedom to say
something by way of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48968:20"/>
between our <hi>English</hi> Law,
and the Civil or Imperial; as
they relate to Succession for
Inheritance. By the Civil Law
every man is capable of having
legal issue, as well as natural,
and may adopt whom he will,
though he have posterity o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
These adopted Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are as Capable of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
as the natural, so as
not onely the Childlesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
may provide himself of an
Heir, but any other man use
his judgment in choosing one
educated, and of inclination
according to his mind. Why
this is wholly rejected in our
Law, is left to conjecture. Our
Lawyers have this saying, that
God onely makes Heirs, and
we know that he can make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
choyce then we our selves.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48968:21"/>
Sure I am, it may well become
us to submit to his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
To this it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that there is not so much
need of Adoption with Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
people, as with Southern,
for we are more fruitful and
generative than they. And
by Adoption there is a total
change of Blood, and a change
more certain, then if the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
were Spurious, or of
Bastards by the Fathers side.
This is very injurious to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors,
from whom Families
often receive their Honour and
Inheritance, for in the choyce
of a new Heir the Father hath
an election, but not they, who
perhaps may be then deceased;
and for the most part there
remains some of the Kindred
lineally descended from those
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48968:21"/>
Ancestors, who yet become
rejected, though numerous,
and sufficiently deserving. But

               <p>Now we have digressed,
touching upon other Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Children. It may be
pardonable to consider them
about Marriage in some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
The most essential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
lyeth in two poynts,
a multiplicity of Wives, and
power of Divorce; for both
these we must acquiesce in our
Saviours decision, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
against multiplicity of
Wives, and limits the power
of Divorce. The <hi>Jews</hi> (sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their King and High Priest)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48968:22"/>
before the Captivity, might
have as many Wives as they
could maintain; and at this
day the <hi>Mahomitans</hi> permit
<hi>Poligamy.</hi> The <hi>Jewish</hi> King's
Dignity caused a limitation to
him in Marriage; but the <hi>Turks</hi>
prerogative exempts him from
Nuptials altogether. Oh the
vast distance between several
results of Humane reason in
the same matter. I say of
humane Reason, taking the
<hi>Jewish</hi> Matrimonial Customes
to be grounded not upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Institution, but upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
of <hi>Rabins</hi> like to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
cases in our Law. Let us
compare <hi>Monogamy</hi> or single
Marriage, with <hi>Polygamy,</hi> and
somewhat weigh the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
on either side. <hi>Polygamy</hi>
is said to be little lesse than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48968:22"/>
to Nations desirous of
Empire, as were the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
now the <hi>Turks</hi> are, since abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of People is chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
in Conquest; but to
this may be answered, that no
People was ever more ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of ampliating their limits,
then the <hi>Romans,</hi> nor more
desirous to abound in People
then they, as appears by the
Priviledge of <hi>Jus trium libero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
and yet they never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<hi>Polygamy.</hi> It may be
added, for <hi>Pol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gamy,</hi> that a
single Wife wants the spur to
Vertue, which emulation gives
where there is more. But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is a sufficient spur to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and the benefit of Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
may arise from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of other mens ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Wives, as well as from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48968:23"/>
Rivalls in relation to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
But certainly in the
<hi>Oeconomical</hi> way, a multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Wives must be very
inconvenient, as causing many
distractions and altercations
within a Family, to the great
disturbance of the Master; for
if one Contentious Woman be
scarcely supportable, how must
it be where there is many, and
with power almost equal? As
to the power of Divorce,
Christianity doth not allow it,
but in the case of Fornication,
for impotence produceth a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and not a Divorce. But
the <hi>Jews</hi> (and <hi>Romans</hi> also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were Christian) had
a full liberty to Divorce. This
was a great power to the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
Sex, which Women
will readily tax as unjust, as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48968:23"/>
was thought by <hi>Salome</hi> Sister
to <hi>Herod,</hi> who to give a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
for equality between the
Sexes, sent a Bill of Divorce
to her Husband, a thing oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Custome. For
liberty of Divorce, it is said,
that otherwise a man is for life
(and without remedy) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the inconvenience of
a humorous, unquiet, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
Wife; but the fault
is our own, for Marriage
should never be without full
consent on both sides. To
conclude, our Levity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy
is such, as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
unhappinesse would be
much greater, if every man
might be Divorced at pleasure.</p>

with small, doth somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the Soveraign Prince,
his Children the Nobility or
second estate, and the Body
of Servants beareth some simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
to the Commons. And
this comparison may the better
be admitted, because Writers
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48968:24"/>
very considerable fetch their
chief argument for Monarchy
(as being the most natural and
ancient Government) from its
Conformity with the Paternal,
which alwayes supposeth a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
Let us see how this
comparison is proper. All
Power and Office is derived
from the Sovereign in a State,
and so is all from the Master
in a Family. The Protection
and Defence of a Kingdom
belongs onely to the King, and
so of a Family to the Master.
All the People pay tribute to
the Sovereign, and all work
of Servants in a Family, whence
profit may arise, is to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
use. Thus far there is an
agreement, but in other things
a difference. In Monarchy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Subject hath a natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48968:25"/>
in his Prince, and the
relation is indissoluble. But
in a Family Servants have no
natural interest in their Master,
and the relation is onely indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble
between the Father
and his Children. Again, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
is one of the Formes
of political Government, and
a principal end of all such Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is the whole Peoples
welfare, whereof the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
make the greatest part,
whereas in a Family there is
no other design or intention
then profit and convenience of
the Master, and his Servants
have no concernment of their
own in such things as peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belong to the Family. Many
other instances of difference
might be given, but they ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concur in one particular
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48968:25"/>
more, which is this, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them can well subsist
withont due subordinations,
and good order.</p>

Masters gave small wages, and
their Servants expected reward

This kept them in diligence,

their Master, they having an
eye to the reward, which still
remained in his power. But
now by Contract Servants
have Wages equivalent to the

to trust chiefly to his own eye,
cast either upon the whole

act in it. He must not choose

trained up in his Stable, thought
him capable of any kind of
Service, and a considerable
Farm being cast into his hands,
he found it best to employ this
young man as a Bayliff, who
answered his expectation fully

lost his Seed for divers

mentioned Vestments or
Apparrel, I cannot think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
in this place to take that
matter further into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The most natural uses of
Apparrel are these, to defend
against the injuries of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to be a Covering for
the obscene parts of the Body;
which last was the occasion of
our Father <hi>Adams</hi> first piece of

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48968:41"/>
abundant honour on those mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Body which we esteem
least honourable.</hi> Excesse in
bravery of Apparrel causeth
much waste, and therefore some
Rules should be given to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it.</p>
               <p>There can be little said in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
the condition of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
being so different in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Age, Quality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As
for those who are aged, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in a retired way, they
cannot be too moderate, for
much vanity and great age
should be incompatible. Most
indulgence is to be afforded to
people in the flower of their
age, who may find advantage
many wayes by adorning their
persons. I knew a Noble-man
whose course was this, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel
his Daughters in very
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48968:41"/>
plain Habit till they became
Marriagable, and then he trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them one by one in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of more cost, which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
very well, all of them
being seasonably and fitly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of. The same course may
be proper for Male Children,
and the way is not irrational,
for persons so trained up will
return with lesse reluctation to
plain attire, if need be. In the
general, it is a good Rule, to
defer the making of new Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel
as much as may be, which
at the long run becomes a great
saving of charge. And on the
contrary, those who must have
many Suits of Clothes at the
same time, find themselves at
great losse, since the Fashion
cannot but alter, before some
of them have had their full
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48968:42"/>
wearing. That wise and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
People, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> have
a way to distinguish the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and degree of persons by
the form and not the bravery
of their Habit, which of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
must become a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to their State in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
But the wiser part of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Nation must submit it self
to the common usages of the
whole; yet prudence ought to
be shewed in affecting rather
moderation then affectation;
for men are not sooner conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be defective in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by any thing, then by
their Apparrel; and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is incomparably the best

no lesse so in this, then in other

I confesse that Building

This must be meant of Capital

matter of advantage and
profit, because they may be
rented out; as for the other,
the observation is true in both
parts, for the Builders of such
great Houses were persons ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of wast, or rising fortunes,
and they contrived their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to be fit for their present
or approaching condition, and
no man will doubt, but Estates
are much diminished, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be so more and more.</p>
               <p>This puts me in mind of him
who when his Kitchin was
found fault with, as being too
little for his House, answered,
that the littlenesse of the Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
had made the House so great;
and contrariwise, where there
is a very great House and a
small Estate, we may for the
most part say, that the great
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48968:53"/>
House hath made the Estate so
little; for it is like to great
Personal titles, causing the
owner to hoise up more Sail,
then the bottom can bear,
which draweth on his Ruin.
All men know (and some of us
by experience) the great charge
of fitting a large House, and
keeping it in sufficient repair,
together with the uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse
(and seeming shame)
of living there attended by a
small Family, so as it is hard
to give advice to persons in
such condition, especially if
they be fettered so as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               <p>Though it be out of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of our Circle to
consider the niceties of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture,
yet we may give some
touches upon the difference, in
point of convenience, between
Building modern and ancient.
The old way of building was,
to seek out places sheltred from
Wind (unlesse it were for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
and to make thick Walls
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48968:54"/>
with small Windows, covering
much ground with housing of
moderate height. About the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raign
they began to enlarge their
Lights, and of late the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are made high with great
Windows, and much unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
is affected, after the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
manner. I conceive this
fitter for Cities, where ground
is scarce and Houses strengthen
one another being joyned, then
for the Countrey, since to be
expos'd to Tempest is so great
an inconvenience, especially
where the scituation is chosen
high for prospects sake, as is
now usual. Besides this, the
Hall (or basis of Hospitality)
is either wholly left out, or so
contrived as to be without
Chimny of Fire-hearth, which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48968:54"/>
in Winter time should draw
Company together, and give
chearfulnesse to a Family. Great
Staire-cases are also affected,
which fill a house with noyse,
and uniformity doth often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of inward Rooms, and
of Closets, with other little reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
places. These considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and some others make me
lesse forward, then the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
in crying down the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
rusticity of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors;
yet I must confesse, that
not only Beauty both inward
and outward, but even the
fashionablenesse of Building is
to be desired, where it may be
attained with convenience, but
certainly convenience ought to
give the rule. And so I leave
the matter to be taken into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consideration by others of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48968:55"/>
better judgment who have
more space for it.</p>

               <p>It is a rule in Menagery, not
to entertain many Workmen
by the day, nor Women to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
those of the Family within
doors; but in great Houses it
is impossible to avoid day-men,
since there is so much use of
them about repairs, felling and
making up of Wood, and such
like matters. All therefore
that can be done, is to decline
them as much as may be, by
removing the occasion. And
when such are set to work, the
Steward shall do well, morning
and evening, to take accompt
of what is done, by which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48968:55"/>
means they must either be
active in their businesse or run
hazard of loosing employment
afterwards. When any of the
Servants are to work abroad,
the same diligence is to be used
in appointing what is to be
done, and in taking accompt
of it.</p>

to this purpose may be related
that which happned in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily

As he was sitting at his Table

having of their will, but with
wilful people it surpasseth any
other pleasure. This is a very
chargeable entertainment, and
bringeth bitternesse in the end,
for such businesses are for the
most part concluded with little
advantage to any, but the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48968:63"/>
it is therefore much more
convenient (or rather Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an)
to make an end speedily
by Reference, or mediation
of Friends, which is the course
whereunto I would advise our
House-keeper.</p>

               <p>The point of non-residence
at the prime Mansion house is
of so great importance, as the
chief (or at least the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
cause of it, may deserve
consideration. I take it to be
the abhorrence of Solitude,
unto which the Countrey life
is alwayes subject, and in a

in the conceit of those of
the best condition, who have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48968:64"/>
been constantly used to much
converse, and who cannot with
the least contentment apply
themselves to Rural businesses.
I confesse that Melancholly

can be more mischievous, and

               <p>It was an Observation of my
Fathers (and perhaps printed
in his Forest) whereof I may
borrow the substance, and this
it is; That the <hi>English</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
can hardly be prosperous
in government of his Estate;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48968:64"/>
for whereas the Genius of some
other Nations prompteth them
to particular excesses; as the
<hi>Italian</hi> to curiosity of House
and Furniture; the <hi>French</hi> man
to bravery in Habit of Clothes
and other matters of Parade,
as abundance of Pages and
Laquays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the <hi>German</hi>
to variety and excess in Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but they are all frugal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
Our <hi>English</hi> man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
all these together, as also
that of our own, which is, a
number of Menial Servants, and
great plenty in Diet. Of this

               <p>I have conversed much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
in the Family of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
of great fortunes, who
having many Children, would
never send any of them to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
beyond Sea, giving for a
reason, that the seeing of so
great variety and splendour,
made young men dislike their
own native Countrey and place
of Habitation. The truth is,
it proveth to be so too often,
but as I conceive, the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
ariseth from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
disposition and not from
travel, for it is not so with all
Travellers; neither is there rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it, <hi>England</hi> being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with all necessaries of its
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48968:65"/>
own growth; nor is it destitute
of matters of Ornament and
Splendor. In many things we
fall short for curiosity and
beauty, but in other things we
exceed our Neighbours; as
particularly in our Universities,
which have no parallel, and
<hi>London</hi> falleth not much short
of the greatest forrain Cities.
Besides this, our situation is
such, in respect of the Sea, as we
are not in want of curious
Wines, and such delightful
commodities. But to shew ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
how prevalent the persons
disposition may be, the said
Nobleman gave breeding to his
eldest Son, with charge extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
at our Court and chief
City, where vanity so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with him, as afterwards
he bcame the wonder of those

It were needlesse here,

them with variety of places

for no living Creature receives
vexation or damage by it, and
no man can complain that his

               <p>Which qualitie I have
found more constant in Musick,
from which I my self have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a great subsistence in this
my retirement. When I found
my self subject to be pensive,
then by Musical Ayres, Coran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes,
and Sarabands, I was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48968:68"/>
more chearful; and when
I desired to become Serious, the
work was done for me by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Almayns, Fancies, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans;
variety is most pleasing,
and much of this is afforded
even in the diversity of Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Instruments, as the Lute,
Harp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but certainly no Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
can bear up with the Vocal,
to which some suppose a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in Heaven it self; but
howsoever that be, Musick is
found useful in the Service of
God here below (even with
the most rigid who must have
singing Psalms) and so it was
anciently in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church.
I professe not to know any
pleasure exceeding Musick, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that of Contemplation in
matters Divine. Musick indeed
may be said to be sensual, for
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48968:69"/>
it is altogether conveyed by
the Senses, but certainly it hath
a great approach towards Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality,
or else the Prophet
<hi>Elisha</hi> would never have called
for a Minstrel, when an Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was required. I may fear
I have been too tedious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Recreation, to
which I confesse my self a little
partial; and I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

in the way of Religion,
as they will admit nothing of

strength in the end, and so it is
with the mental faculties, if

may be then some use made of
Gaming in a moderate sort. For

               <p>I think we cannot better
Conclude these Observations,
then with some notes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Royal Family or House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
which as I conceive, hath
not its Peer in Christendom;
exceeding all others, as well
for Hospitality, as for Order.
As touching the first, it hath
no parallel; for consider it as
it was in the time of former
Princes (and as I hope now is)
and we may justly say, That
more Flesh and Fish, Bread and
Drink is spent yearly there,
then is consumed in some <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Cities, whose Bishops are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48968:72"/>
of sitting in general
Councels. And for Order, it
resembleth rather a State, then
a Family, having within it or
thereto belonging, establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for Government Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical,
Military, Civil and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.
First, there is a kind of
Cathedral Church, with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
Dean, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> adorned
with a Quire, and Vestments
for the Clergy, as also with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
for Musick very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary:
Then there is a
Judicatory called the <hi>Green-Cloth,</hi>
which determineth in
matters belonging to the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Provisions and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the Lord Steward,
the Treasurer, and Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of the Houshold, are Judges,
with several under Officers.
Thirdly, there is two Military
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48968:72"/>
Companies, one of Horse-men
called Pensioners, all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and the other that of
the old Guard, consisting of
Yeomen, and these are under
Command of two eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
their Captains. Lastly, it
hath a Jurisdiction as well Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
as Criminal appertaining to
it called the Verge, extending
it self twelve miles about the
Court, where the Lord Steward
of the Kings House, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal
and a peculiar Coroner do
respectively exercise a Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and none of the publike
Judges may interpose in cases
proper to that Court uncalled;
which limit of the Verge bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
some similitude to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Territory of a City or State.
Besides this, the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine
of his Majesties Houshold
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48968:73"/>
hath governance of all the
Gentry, and Officers above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stairs,
who are very numerous.
Lawyers tell us, that original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all Justice was administred
within the Royal Family, and
that the Kings Bench was stiled
<hi>Aula Regia.</hi> Of these there
still remains some shadow, in
the stiles of <hi>Teste meipso,</hi> and of
<hi>Coram Rege,</hi> and at this day
the Privy Councel, an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
supposed to consist of the
most eminent persons for Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in the whole Nation, hath
its residence within the Kings
House, with a Jurisdiction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it self over the whole
Kingdom in matters of State.
To this Royal Family relate
two others, whereof one is that
of the Queen Consort, who by
the Law is a person distinct
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48968:73"/>
from the King, and may plead,
or be impleaded apart. The
other is, that of the Prince of
<hi>Wales,</hi> when there is one, and
both these have especial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of State belonging to them.
It is a Prerogative of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Family that the Servants are
obliged to a faithful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
performance of service
domestical, which as I conceive,
is not by the Law permitted in
the case of any person, who is
a meer Subject. And all this
under a Race of Princes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Antiquity, linked in
Blood with most of the Royal
Families of Christendom, and
that in all ages hath given to
the world Illustrious Persons
yielding to none for eminence
in Wisdom, and vertue, and
sometime such, as by forreign
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48968:74"/>
Conquests were famous for
their Martial Power, and in
great part Arbiters of the most
important affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which Royal Race all true-hearted

thy many great Mercies
unto us; but more especially thy
freeing us from danger and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

thy giving of healthful and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
rest unto us therein, whereby
we are enabled to perform the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:48968:75"/>
of this day, and chiefly that
of prayer unto thee. For we
justly confesse, that the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thee is the principal end
of our life; which glorifying is
most advanced, according to
our weak power, by invocation
of thy Name, and by professing
a full dependance upon thee in all
our actions. We confess, that of our
selves without thy especial grace
we cannot step one step towards
thee, by our actings in any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
duty; yet by means of that
grace we are enabled so far to act,
as to obtain acceptance at thy
hands in Iesus Christ, which is
sufficient for us. We above all
expresse our thankfulnesse to thee,
for thy mercies in thy beloved
Son; and more particularly for
his undergoing the shameful
death of the Crosse for us. Grant
<pb facs="tcp:48968:75"/>
O Lord, that by his Blood and
Sufferings, we may be purged
from the old leaven of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and that by Faith in
him our hearts may be purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and disposed to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of whatsoever duties are
required by thee towards the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of everlasting Life.
Grant that we may do all things
with a holy mind and sincere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
in obedience unto thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will, and not with any self-love,
which may be offensive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee a God of pure eyes, who
canst not behold the least iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with approbation; Grant O
Lord, that we may this day apply
our selves to the doing of our
duty, according to our several
relations and subordinations
within this Family, looking still
up unto thee as the foundation of
<pb facs="tcp:48968:76"/>
all power, and under whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
we can onely be happy.
We know O Lord, that dutys per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functorily
done, satisfie the world
but not thee, who art a God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an All-seeing Eye, from
which nothing can be hid, and
who hatest eye-service, being only
well pleased in a pure heart free
from all hypocrisie. We beseech
thee therefore so to guid all our
actions as we may do nothing but
what is acceptable in thy sight,
and that our demeanour this day,
and all the other dayes of our
life may be such, as not to fill
up our measure of iniquity and
sinfulnesse, against the Day of
Iudgement, but that we may then
be accepted of, as pure and holy
by and through the Merits of the

us. O Lord, thy mercies in
Iesus Christ are abundant, and
sufficient to blot out, not onely
ours, but all the sin in the whole
World; Yet thou wilt not do it
to those that are impenitent. We
therefore in his Name beseech thee
to give us humble and penitent
hearts, together with a resolution
to forbear all manner of sin here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
as a thing that is total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:48968:77"/>
opposite to thy nature, and
therefore must become the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of all such persons as
wallow in it without reluctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
We are fully bent, O Lord,
to delight in our own wayes,
and to be linked in Affection
with the things of this World,
which is enmity against thee.
Cure us, we beseech thee, of
this destructive malady, and
enflame our hearts with the love
of thee, which is so precious,
as it cannot be enjoyed without
a renunciation of our wicked
selves, and all our impious
wayes. Create in us, O Lord,
a lively Faith, whereby we may
lay fast hold on the Merits of
our Blessed Saviour, and so
become fully justified in thy
sight O Lord, kindle in us
by thy Holy Spirit a brotherly
<pb facs="tcp:48968:78"/>
affection one unto another, so
as we may be wholly disposed to
do good, and not to delight in
mischief through evil will and
envy. Lastly, we beseech thee,
more especially, to remit our
sins of the day past, and so to
blesse us this Night, as we may
not therein fall into any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by evil thoughts and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
or otherwise, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
quiet and seasonable rest, to
the refreshment of our Bodies
and Spirits, whereby we may
be fitted for such Services as
the day following shall require,
and alwayes retain in our mind
the fear of thee, restraining us
from all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
These mercies, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
else thou knowest to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for us, we beg of thee,
for thy own Mercies sake in
<pb facs="tcp:48968:78"/>
Iesus Christ thy dearly beloved
Son, in whose most absolute
form and words, least our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
should be otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
we conclude them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
