            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>ON my hard Fate as late I pondering lay,</l>
               <l>Spent and bow'd down beneath the Toils of Day,</l>
               <l>By weary Nature to repose constrain'd</l>
               <l>I slept at last, and thus in Sleep complain'd.</l>
               <l>Ah Wretch! to this unhappy Clime confin'd.</l>
               <l>Lost to my Frinds, and cut from human kind;</l>
               <l>A Clime where gentle Zephyrs never blow,</l>
               <l>VVhere frozen Gods keep Court in Ice and Snow.</l>
               <l>The rigid VVinters here come early on,</l>
               <l>With <hi>August</hi> brought, and scarce with <hi>April</hi> gone.</l>
               <l>In other places Nature looks but bare,</l>
               <l>Some marks of Spring continue all the Year;</l>
               <l>But every Winter stript her naked here.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Miry Glebe imprisons Man and Beast,</l>
               <l>And there must come a Drowth to be releas'd.</l>
               <l>No Converse does the tedious Hours beguile,</l>
               <l>But Love and Friendship fly this barbarous Soil.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45570:3"/>None here for ought but <hi>Mammon</hi> will repair,</l>
               <l>And Life has no cessation from its Care.</l>
               <l>Even Honesty it self is banish'd hence,</l>
               <l>And Ignorance sets up for Innocence.</l>
               <l>The Natives are such Brutes, so homely bred,</l>
               <l>They're of a piece with that on which they tread;</l>
               <l>Strangers to Virtue, to all liberal Arts;</l>
               <l>Their Oxen and their Swine have all their Hearts,</l>
               <l>Creatures of equal Intellectual Parts.</l>
               <l>Among each other endless Fewds they sow,</l>
               <l>And Malice lays Manure to make 'em grow.</l>
               <l>In Courts and Senates let them strive and jar,</l>
               <l>Wrangle in Cities, clamour at the Bar.</l>
               <l>But this is strange ev'n in this abject Life,</l>
               <l>Where Matter fails, to find an equal Strife.</l>
               <l>No mutual Trust between 'em e'er presides;</l>
               <l>And Knav'ry follows, when 'tis Interest guides.</l>
               <l>Thus Slander, Strife, and Spight triumphant reign,</l>
               <l>Among these Clumsy Blockheads of the Plain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>How vain are all the Tales the Antients told</l>
               <l>Of a self-teeming Glebe, and of an Age of Gold?</l>
               <l>Of flowry Shades where Peace supinely reigns?</l>
               <l>Of faultless Nymphs, and of the faithful Swains?</l>
               <l>'Tis all Idea—but by Fancy wrought,</l>
               <l>The idle Rovings of a wandring Thought.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45570:3"/>E'en <hi>Cowley,</hi> who a Rural Life had long</l>
               <l>Ador'd, and made it Deathless in his Song;</l>
               <l>When to the Fields he for that Blessing came,</l>
               <l>Found all their boasted Innocence a Name;</l>
               <l>And <hi>Chertsea</hi> stands (to contradict his Rhimes)</l>
               <l>Blam'd in his Prose to all succeeding times.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What Path can here derided Virtue take?</l>
               <l>What Musick can the sighing Muses make?</l>
               <l>Without Converse they lose their Force and Fire,</l>
               <l>And Reason back does to its Spring retire.</l>
               <l>The long remove from Mirth, from Wit and Arts,</l>
               <l>Sets us beneath our very natural Parts.</l>
               <l>If we're nor rising, we go down the Hill,</l>
               <l>For Knowledg knows no mean of standing still.</l>
               <l>The brightn'd Armour glitters to the Sun,</l>
               <l>But only using keeps the Polish on.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus doom'd to Dulness, here I bury'd lye;</l>
               <l>O low, obscure, inglorious Destiny!</l>
               <l>My Youth has vainly, idly took its flight,</l>
               <l>Unknown to Profit, Learning, and Delight.</l>
               <l>Depriv'd of all that can improve or please,</l>
               <l>I live in Deserts, yet depriv'd of Ease:</l>
               <l>Whilst envious Fortune here my Head employs</l>
               <l>In barren Labour, and eternal Noise.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45570:4"/>Depriv'd of <hi>London,</hi> then too little priz'd,</l>
               <l>Before I knew the Blessing I despis'd.</l>
               <l>For towns, like Tallys, Man for Man does fit,</l>
               <l>And Wit does keenest whet it self on Wit.</l>
               <l>Oh Noble City! but too late I mourn</l>
               <l>My Fortune, banish'd never to return.</l>
               <l>I would not have it thought, my Wish intends</l>
               <l>Great Matters—No, free from ambitious Ends:</l>
               <l>Only a Human Fate my Hope invites,</l>
               <l>And Innocence, in which my Soul delights.</l>
               <l>None better cou'd than I contented live,</l>
               <l>With little, or from little, more would give.</l>
               <l>But here I live not, in this Brutal Den</l>
               <l>Banish'd from Town, from Manners, and from Men.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>'Twas here methought a Glorious Form appear'd,</l>

               <l>Her Monumental Tower the Skies out-brav'd,</l>
               <l>And on her Front was fair <hi>AUGUSTA</hi> grav'd.</l>
               <l>And why, said she, dost thou thus sighing lye?</l>
               <l>Why all despondence, yet relief so nigh?</l>
               <l>He that does set so many Captives free,</l>

               <l>So bright a Form, Words of such pleasing sound,</l>
               <l>Oppress with Pleasure, and with Joy confound.</l>
