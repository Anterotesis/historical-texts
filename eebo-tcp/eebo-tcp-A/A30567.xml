            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

befal them after he was gone, they ſhould have no cauſe to ſpeak ill of God, or of his Servant <hi>Moſes.</hi> You have brought us to a fair Land, you gave us many fair Promiſes, that God would be our God, and be gracious to us, and that he would never leave us; yet ſee what befalls us. <hi>Moſes</hi> now leaves this on purpoſe behind him, for ever to ſtop their mouths; as if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould ſay, It's true, the Lord hath made me an Inſtrument of bringing you out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by me hath made many Promiſes to you, to encourage you; and hath choſen you to be a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and led you along all this while: But, if evils do befal you, if you be brought into a ſad, and diſtreſſed Condition after I am dead and gone; Remember what I leave behind me, and know, that God is to be juſtified in All, and his Words is to be juſtified; but you have ſinned and rebelled againſt God, and have brought upon your ſelves all the evil that is come upon you.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57745:4"/>
will ſpeak; and hear O Earth, the words of my mouth.</hi> Why <hi>Moſes,</hi> there was a time thou ſaidſt, <hi>thou was't not eloquent?</hi> but that was becauſe he would excuſe himſelf from work: But here it appears that he was very eloquent; <hi>Give ear, O Heavens, and hearken, O Earth,</hi> as if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould ſay, That, that I am ſpeaking of this people (that are a wretched and ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted people) will not be regarded; but Heaven and Earth ſhall be witneſs againſt them; the Heavens and the Earth ſhall hear. Though what's ſpoken out of the Word by way of reprehenſion of a ſinful people, may be neglected and paſt by; yet know, that there is an Impreſſion upon the Heavens and Earth; and rather then the Lord will want witneſſes, Heaven and Earth ſhall come to witneſs againſt that people.</p>
            <p>After his Preface, which is in the two firſt verſes, He begins with lifting up of the Name of God; <hi>Becauſe I will publiſh the Name of the Lord, Aſcribe the Greatneſs unto our God. He is the Rock, his Work is perfect; for all his waies are Judgment: a God of Truth, and without Iniquity, Juſt and Right is he:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Whatſoever becomes of you, yet the Name of God is Great and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.—And it's a good way to convince and humble ſinners, by lifting up their hearts to ſee the Glory of the Great God, with whom
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57745:5"/>
they have to do, againſt whom they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned—And it was an excellent Argument of <hi>Moſes's</hi> Faith when he was to die; yet he could bleſs himſelf, as it were, in God—as if he ſhould ſay, Well, the Lord hath carried me through many Changes and Troubles, and many Afflictions, varieties of Conditions; and what yet God will do with his people, I know not; but this I am ſure, he is a <hi>Great God,</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> and he is a <hi>Rock,</hi> and his <hi>work is Perfect,</hi> and <hi>all his waies are Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a God of Truth, without Iniquity, Juſt and Right is he:</hi> I am ſure, whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of me, whatſoever bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>

themſelves, that <hi>Their ſpot is not the ſpot of my Children;</hi> It is beyond that could have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; for thoſe that had ſo near a Relation to God as this people had! they are beſpotted and defiled with their ſin, and ſo, as this ſpot of theirs is not the ſpot of his Children. Thus you have the ſcope of the words, and how they came in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their ſpot.</hi> The word tranſlated here <hi>ſpot,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>blemiſh,</hi> a <hi>fault;</hi> 'tis the ſame word that you have in the <hi>17th</hi> of this Book, <hi>i. e.</hi> Thou ſhalt not ſacrifice unto the Lord thy God, any Bullock or Sheep wherein is <hi>blemiſh, or any ill-favouredneſs.</hi> But we know what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> word is; Their <hi>ſpot;</hi> the ſpot of their ſin; that ſin of theirs; that blemiſh is not the ſpot of his Children: What though the Children of God have ſpots, while they live in this world? they have many ſins that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing: But, the ſpots of theſe men is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, it is not the ſpot of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>There are Three Doctrinal points in theſe words; the firſt two implyed, the third ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: The two that are implyed, are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> Firſt, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is a ſpot.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> Secondly, That even the Children of God while they live in this world, have their ſpots.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57745:6"/>
3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Thirdly, (Which is the main and ſcope of the words) That there's a great deal of difference between the ſins and ſpots of wicked and ungodly men, and the ſpots of Gods Children.</p>
            <p>That's that, that I aim at in the choice of theſe words, To ſhew the difference between the ſins of wicked men, and the ſins of the Saints; And I have ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſen this Scripture to handle this point for theſe two end:</p>
            <p>Firſt, To take away that great plea that moſt carnal hearts have, whereby they put off the power of the Word from their hearts, and are ſecure in their ſinful waies. Why, ſay they, can we be without ſin? are the beſt without ſin upon them? now becauſe none are without ſin, therefore they think to put it off, and grow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; and upon this very thought, put off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of truths that they heard preached out of the word, that doth them no good at all, and meerly upon this Reaſon. Now were it that this plea were but taken from them, the word might prevail a great deal more upon them.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, I hope before we have done this Scripture, I ſhall weaken, if not wholly take away that plea that ſecure-ſinners have for themſelves, becauſe all have their ſins: I ſhall ſhew thee, that there is a great deal of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57745:6"/>
difference, perhaps, between thy ſin, and the ſins of a Child of God.</p>
            <p>And then the ſecond End why I choſe this Scripture, is, for the comfort of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. On the one ſide, one man is ſecure and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ardened, becauſe though he hath ſins, why, all men have ſins: On the other ſide, thoſe that are Gods Children, becauſe they feel ſo much ſin in them as they do, they are afraid that they are not Gods Children; they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that their ſins that are in them, doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue them not to be Gods Children. Now they will have help likewiſe in the opening of this point, when they ſhall have laid before them that are the ſins of Gods Children, and the ſins of the wicked, and the differences of them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, for the making way to this great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57745:7"/>
Firſt, A <hi>deſiling ſpot;</hi> a ſpot that doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file, a blemiſh that doth defile the ſoul of man in the preſence of the Holy God: It's contrary to the pure Nature of God, it is the mixture of the ſoul with that that's worſe than its ſelf; it's a defiling thing. The mingling of Gold with Silver, doth not defile the Silver; but mingling of Lead with Silver, doth defile the Silver, becauſe the Lead is worſe than Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: So the Communion that the ſoul hath with God, and as it were, the mingling of the heart in God, and with Divine things, doth not defile it, but make it better; but the ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the heart with the world, it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the ſoul, becauſe the ſoul is mingled with that that's worſe than it ſelf; It is a defiling-ſpot: You know what it is to have the Body beſmear'd with dirt, and have Clothes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted with filth and dirt; look how it is with your Bodies beſmear'd with dirt, or your Clothes, ſo it is with the Face of your Soul in the Preſence of God, when ſin is upon you; It's a defiling-ſpot.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sin it's a ſpreading-ſpot, it's like the ſpot of the Leproſie, that ſpreads more and more; and let a ſinner live never ſo long, this ſpot will beſpread him more and more. If you had a ſpot upon your Fleſh, that were but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at the firſt, it may be you would neglect it; but if you ſaw it ſpread more and more
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57745:7"/>
then you would think there were ſomething in it: It is ſo with thy ſin, when you are young, the ſpot it but ſmall in compariſon; but as you grow, the ſpot ſpreads more and more until you are all over blains and ſpots: So are old ſinners; ſin is a ſpreading-ſpot, it ſpreads in a ſoul, in a family, in any ſociety where ſinners live.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is an infecting-ſpot, a ſpot that of itſelf infects; a Plague ſpot, that doth infect the ſoul, and infects every thing you meddle with, and doth infect the company you converſe with; that's the nature of this ſpot.</p>
            <p>And then Fourthly, It's a ſtaining-ſpot, It doth pain the ſoul, ſo as all the created power in Heaven and Earth is not able to waſh it away; thou mayeſt think little of the ſin that thou committeſt, thou committeſt it, and haſt pleaſure and delight in ſuch a ſinful way, for a quarter of an hour; it may be thy pleaſure laſts no longer; well, but when this pleaſure is done, there's a ſtain left upon thy ſoul that doth mark thee out to Eternal Death; ſuch a ſtain left, that will abide to all Eternity upon the Soul, if onely, that one means be not applied, <hi>the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let all the Angels in Heaven, and Men in the World, put to their wiſdom and ſtrength, to get out the ſtain that is in thy Soul, and it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57745:8"/>
is too little; onely the Blood of the Son of God, can cleanſe and take out that ſtain that is in thy ſoul; ſuch a ſpot is ſin! a ſtaining ſpot! In <hi>Jer. 2. 22 Though thou waſh thee with Nitre, and take thee much Sope; yet thine Iniquity is marked before me, ſaith the Lord:</hi> Ye may uſe many means to get away your ſin, perhaps you may cover it over, or there may be ſome kind of ſlight ſorrow; But it's not all the ſorrow in the World, if thou wert able to ſhed as many tears as there are Drops of Water in the Sea, to waſh away thy ſin, if their were nothing elſe to do it, all thy tears will not do it; It muſt be onely the blood of the Son of God. Many people think to waſh away their ſin swith their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; But they muſt know, there is ſomething beyond ſorrow, it is onely the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> can cleanſe and take away this ſtain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Now, If ſin be ſuch a ſtain, ſuch a ſpot; hence then, let us learn to look into <hi>Gods Glaſs,</hi> to ſee out own ſpots, how we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted by our ſin; if it is ſuch a <hi>Foul,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Spreading,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Staining</hi> ſpot, How is it that Men and Women ſee it not? they ſee not their own faces; Oh! they never were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Gods Glaſs; What's that, you will ſay? why, <hi>James</hi> 1. 23. will ſhew you what the Glaſs of God is, in which you may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57745:8"/>
ſee your Faces, in which you may ſee your ſpots; <hi>If any man be a hearer of the word, and not a deer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural Face in a Glaſs; for he beboldeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and goeth his way, and ſtraightway for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Glaſſes to look into, and to behold the face of their ſouls, but their own carnal conceits, and the wayes of other men, and the like: But if God ſhould but hold the Glaſs of his Law to ſome of your faces, to behold how loathſom you are in the Eyes of God) for ſo they are in Gods eye as this Glaſs preſents them if they are not waſhed in the blood of Chriſt:) and it would be a dreadful ſight to many a ſoul: But yet better that you ſaw it now while there are wayes to cleanſe your ſouls of their ſpots, than when you ſhould die; for if when you ſhould be at the point of Death, and be ready to go to the great God to Receive the ſentence of your Eternal Doom; If conſcience ſhould hold the Glaſs of Gods Law before you, and there make you ſee the ugly face of your ſoul, ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſin, Oh! it would be a ſoul ſinking ſight unto you. Learn you to look now into the Glaſs of the Law, and examine your ſoul by the holy Law of God, that you may ſee your ſpots there; many of you ſpend a great deal of time every morning in looking into the Glaſs, to ſee if all things be well in your face; Oh that you would but ſpend as much time in looking into the Law of God, and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your hearts by the word: There ſtands a Glaſs in the window, and there lies a Book on the ſhelf; Why may not the Law of God
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57745:9"/>
be as well taken, to look into your hearts, as the Glaſs taken to ſee your face in? People are little acquainted with this Glaſs; and therefore know not their own ſouls.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If ſin be ſuch a ſpot, O learn we to be humbled for our ſpots, if we have ſeen them, and to be aſhured of them: if we have ſeen our faces beſmea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

An Ingenuous diſpoſition of heart, is aſhamed if either fleſh or garments beſpotted; but now, one of a ſo did diſpoſition, that is all the week raking in Kennels, or Duſt-heaps, though they be beſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57745:10"/>
hands dayly, O that dayly there might be waſhing of thy heart! If thou haſt committed ſin, let it not lie and ſoak in; if there ſhould any ſpots happen upon your cloeths, you preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay ſalt upon it, to keep it from ſtaining; ſo, ſo ſoon as thou haſt committed ſin, lay the ſalt tears of thy Repentance, though that be not all, the blood of Chriſt is the main thing, to keep thy ſoul clean from this ſtaining-ſpot; and to do it preſently will be a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble; but if you let it ſoak in, you cannot get it out after wards. And ſo it is with ſin that lies long upon the ſoul: O! many of your ſins are old ſtains that have been many years upon you; and as it is in your cloeths that have old ſlains, waſhing will not ſerve, all the Soap you can uſe will not get them out, but you muſt lay them a froſting in a winter night; O! ſo your old ſins; you muſt not think that thoſe old ſpots and ſtains upon your ſoul, that you ſhall get them off ſo eaſily, you muſt be willing to lie a ſoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and froſting, to indure what hardſhip God calls you to, ſo be it that you may be cleanſed from them: It's an expreſſion that I remember <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath: ſaith he, You would have all things good and clean in your houſe; all the furniture in your houſe; yea your

ſhooes if they be beſpotted. you will have them clean: And haſt thou more care of thy very ſhooes, then of thy ſoul that's ſpotted and defiled: O! there's little care for the cleanſing of that: But now my Brethren, theſe things eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſhould be applyed, when we are to go more immediately and ſolemnly into the preſence of God. We muſt look into the Glaſs of the Law every day, be humbled, be aſhamed; and labour to purge the ſpots of our ſouls, and that continnually; But I ſay, when we are to go into Gods preſence in a more immediate manner, as when we are to go to prefer a petition to God, and that, ſuch a petition as concerns our ſouls and Eternal eſtates, when we are to go to hear his word, and worſhip him: When we are to go to his Table, at the Lords Supper, we had need then prepare by looking into that Glaſs, and by being humbled for our ſins, and labouring to cleanſe: Though you care act ſo much for ſpots upon your face and clothes when you are at home, yet when you are to go before your Betters, then what looking is there in the Glaſs to be trim, and to have clothes that are clean waſht. Remember now, that every time thou art to go to worſhip God, thou art to ſet thy ſelf as in his immediate preſence, to have to deal with that infinite holy God whoſe pure eyes cannot indure to beholde

But this is not the Point that I do intend. Yet, O thou godly heart, thou knoweſt this to be a truth, That there are ſpots in thee; yea, ſometimes thoſe that are Godly, think there's nothing elſe but ſpots in them; but be of good comfort in this, though thy Condition be ſad in this world, ſo long as thou art ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet be of good comfort here, Jeſus Chriſt is without any ſpots, Chriſt thy Saviour hath no ſpots. <hi>Heb. 9. 14.

in that regard, being without ſpot, it is of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak able comfort unto a gracious heart, when it ſees it ſelf defil'd and beſpotted by ſin.</p>
            <p>And then yet further, know, That through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, thou art lookt upon thy ſelf, in the point of Juſtification, without ſpot too. The Saints have their ſpots that is, they have their weakneſſes, and ſome ſins, their Sanctification is imperfect; I, but in regard of Juſtification, ſo, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without ſpot: So you have it in <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 7. Where Chriſt ſpeaks of his Spouſe, <hi>Thou art all fair, my Love, there is no ſpot in thee</hi>—You will ſay, This ſeems to be againſt this text: No, not at all; for we may be without any ſpot, in regard of our Juſtification, and yet we may be ſpotted and defiled, and God may ſee that we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with ſpots in our ſanctification.

But on the contrary, if the Lord do let thee lye in the filth of thy ſin, it is an Argument that he never ſet his heart upon thee. As for inſtance, ſuppoſe a man were riding on the high way, and ſees a Child there lie all in the filth, ready to be choak't with the dirt and mire, and to periſh there; well, as he is riding by, he looks upon the Child, and ſees it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57745:15"/>
ready to periſh; and when he hath look't upon it, away he goes and leaves it there; would not every one ſay, Certainly this is not the Father of the Child that rides ſo away. But now if the Father or Mother ſhould come by, and ſee the Child, the Mother would ſcreek out, O my Child! and ſnatches it up, and carries it away, and gets water and waſhes it, and ſo cleanſes the Child. And herein doth the Mother or Father ſhew their love they have to the Child. Thus it is (for all the World) in the love of Chriſt; Chriſt, he ſees all your filthineſs and pollution; he ſees Men and Women wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down in the dirt; Chriſt looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and goes by, leaves them ſtill, and lets them wallow in their corruptions more and more, and paſſes by; ſurely the heart of Chriſt is not much towards them, there's lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle relation that Chriſt or God hath to ſuch as theſe are: But now, when as there is one that belongs to Jeſus Chriſt, and that Chriſt hath ſet his love upon from eternity, Chriſt ſees ſuch a one wallowing in the filth of ſin; O! the very bowels of Chriſt do earn, O! Chriſt takes them, and with his own blood cleanſeth them: and will never leave waſhing and cleanſing of the ſoul, till he hath cleanſed it from all its ſpots, and preſented it before the Father.</p>
            <p>And mark, in the ſecond place; Chriſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57745:16"/>
loved us; and this is a fruit of Chriſts love, to cleanſe us from our ſpots—<hi>And then he gave himſelf, that he might cleanſe us,</hi> perhaps you think it's of little moment to be cleanſed from the filth of your ſin; but Chriſt accounted it ſuch a matter, that he would give his life for it: I account the cleanſing of theſe ſouls from the filth of their ſins, worth my life; I will give my life for it; ſo that it coſt more then Ten Thouſand Worlds to cleanſe a ſoul from the filth of its ſin, as well as from the guilt: I beſeech you conſider of this, that the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a ſoul from the <hi>ſilth</hi> of ſin, did coſt Chriſt that which was more worth than Ten thouſand World; but, O! how many is there that can wallow in ſin, and take delight in it? But I ſay, it is of ſo great conſequence to be cleanſed from ſin, as Chriſt is content to give his very life to cleanſe his Church from ſin—Now if thy heart be thus, that thou account the love of Chriſt to conſiſt in this, and that thou canſt priſe Chriſt upon This, That he gave himſelf, to the end that he might cleanſe thy ſoul from the ſin; ſurely thou doſt priſe cleanſing from ſin indeed; and if thou doſt priſe it at ſo high a rate, this is a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that thou art one of Gods Children: Therefore daily exerciſe thy Faith upon this Chriſt, by the applying of the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to thy ſoul, and the renewing of the

            <p>Again, <hi>Amaziah,</hi> that was a man whoſe heart was not upright with God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. he had likewiſe hired an Army, and there comes a man of God to him, in <hi>v.</hi> 7. ſaying, <hi>O King, let not the Army of Iſrael go with thee, for the Lord is not with Iſrael, to wit, with all the Children of Ephralm</hi>—But ſaith <hi>Amaziah, what ſhall we do for the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred talents, which I have given to the Army of Iſrael?</hi> They had their pay afore-hand, why, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>the Lord is able to give thee much more then this:</hi> and <hi>Amaziah</hi> was content not only to part with his Army, but to loſe the pay that he had given them before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, meerly at the word of God, by one poor Prophet of his: Now one would think, a wicked man that was a Soldier, ſhould have contemned ſuch a meſſage from a poor weak man, and bad him go and meddle with what he had to do with; yet theſe two men did not: But now, you ſhall find <hi>Aſa</hi> that was a godly, man he did not do ſo well: Theſe two the Scripture brands for wicked men at this time when they did ſo, and ſo for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, continued and periſhed in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But now, I ſay, <hi>Aſa,</hi> that the Scripture notes for a godly man, you find him quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57745:20"/>
I have had ſome occaſion to ſpeak to, out of another Scripture: But, for all this, in reſpect of ſome particular acts, and in reſpect of the excellency of their ſouls above others, and in reſpect of ſome circumſtances, one may be worſe than another: But take all together, and the ſpots or ſins of wicked men, are farr worſe than the ſins of the godly; and that I ſhall ſhew in theſe Three regards, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the ſins of wicked men, and the godly; and ſhew, that one is far worſe than the other.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In reſpect of the nature of their ſin.</p>

            <p>And, Thirdly, In reſpect of the preſent dealings of God with them for their ſin—Their ſpots are different in theſe three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, In regard of the nature of their ſpots, and that in divers regards, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept indeed in ſome extraordinary caſes, one of which we ſpoke of before in thoſe example<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, The ſin of a godly man is rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>You will ſay, that, that's but a ſimilitude; what do you mean by that of the ſcar, and a rotten ſore?—</p>
            <p>Why, the plain meaning of it is this, That the ſin of a godly man, it is but the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his ſoul in the making of God to be his laſt End; the frame of a godly man's ſoul is alwayes for God as his laſt End; and his ſin comes in but as an impediment and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto him in this work of his, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God to be his laſt End—But now the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57745:21"/>
that the ſin of a godly man is the hinderance of thy ſoul that's making after God as thy laſt End: But on, the other ſide, it is the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thy ſoul to ſome baſe contentment, as thy cheif good, that thou makeſt to be as thy God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſpot of the Children of God, it is not ſuch a contagious, ſuch an infectious ſpot as the ſpot of the wicked is. It is true, there is an infection in all ſin, ſome contagion; but there's a great deal of difference between the contagion and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the remainer of ſin that is in the Saints, and that that is in the hearts of unregenerate men.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, What difference?</p>
            <p>Difference? Firſt, In this: The contagion and infection of ſin in a wicked man, makes his very perſon to be abominable, and is loathſome, through his ſin: The ſins of the Saints, have no ſuch infection in them; they have not ſuch a contagion in them, as to make their perſons to be abominable and hateful before God: God hates the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; but he hates not the Saints, that have iniquity in them; and this is a wide difference, in their contagion and infection.</p>
            <p>Yea, Secondly, That ſin that is in a wicked man, it doth defile all his actions, ſo as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> makes his very actions, the beſt of his actions,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57745:21"/>
to be turned into ſin: While thou art an un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>regenerate man, thy ſin is of ſuch a contagious nature, that it makes all thy actions ſin, thy beſt actions it turns them even unto ſin: In <hi>Pſal. 109. 7. Let his prayer become ſin:</hi> All thine actions before God are ſinful, thy beſt actions, while thou art an unregenerate man: There is not onely ſin in them, but that ſin hath ſo defil'd them, as they are even turned into ſin to thee: Out of an unclean thing there cannot proceed that which is clean; out of a corrupt Tree there cannot be good fruit. Now, there is nothing but the fruits of ſin, that comes from an unregenerate heart—But now, the Saints, though they have ſin in them, yea, they have ſome ſin cleaving to every one of their actions; there is no action that a Child of God doth, but hath ſome ſin cleaves to it: But yet there is not that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it, as to turn his actions into ſin; no, God looks upon his action as a holy action for all that: The work that he doth, is look't upon as the work of the ſpirit of God in him, though there be evil cleaves to it, as it comes through him: And therefore there is not ſuch an infection in their ſin, as in thine.</p>
            <p>And then, Secondly, The infection and contagion of the ſin of wicked men is ſuch, as it defiles all they meddle with, and makes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that they meddle with, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57745:22"/>
to them: You know what the Scripture ſaith in 1 <hi>Tit. 1. 5. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the pure all things are pure; but to the unbelieving and undefiled, is nothing pure, but even their mind and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is defiled:</hi> The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is that uncleanneſs and filthineſs in thee, while thou art unregenerate, as every thing is made unclean: All the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God are unclean to thee, thou haſt no ſanctified uſe of them; all the Ordinances, the uſe of them to thee are polluted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean: As in the Law, the uncleanneſs of the Leproſie was ſuch, as whatever the Leproſie did touch, it was unclean; ſo it is with thee, whatever thou medleſt with, thy meat, thy drink, thy clothes, thy eſtate, and every thing is made to be unclean to thee. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the diſeaſe of the Plague a very grievous diſeaſe, becauſe they who have it, can meddle with nothing, but it is in danger to be infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; any clothes that they put on, and the meat and drink that they take into them: So it is in the ſins of unregenerate men, all things that they meddle with, are ſpiritually infected to them, and they have no ſanctified uſe of any thing. But it is not ſo with the Saints: They have ſin in them, but you never read that their ſin makes every thing unclean: No, <hi>to the pure all things are pure;</hi> God looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as pure, and they have a holy uſe of Eſtate, they do enjoy Gods Ordinances,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57745:22"/>
Gods Works, Gods Mercy: The wicked therefore, are not onely <hi>ſpotted,</hi> but you find in Scripture, they are called <hi>ſpots,</hi> in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract; becauſe of the impreſſion of their ſin: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. and in <hi>Jude 12. They are ſpots in your Feaſts:</hi> Not <hi>ſpotted,</hi> but <hi>ſpots;</hi> as if they were all turned into pollution</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The ſpots of the Saints are not like the ſpots of wicked men; nor <hi>their</hi> ſin, the ſpots of the Saints in this, they are not ſuch deadly ſpots; the ſpots of wicked men, they are deadly ſpots: Wicked men, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defil'd with their ſin, they lie in their ſin as a Carrion lies in a Common-ſhore; That's the ſimilitude that the Holy Ghoſt uſes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the wickedneſs, &amp; wicked men &amp; women in the World by; 1 <hi>John 5. 19, The whole World lies in wickedneſs;</hi> the meaning of that Text cannot be expreſt better than thus; Look, as you ſee a filthy Carrion, lying dead and rotten in the Common-ſhore, ſo doth the World lie in wickedneſs: Surely their wickedneſs is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner of wickedneſs, than the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the Saints: There's a great deal of difference between a ſickly countenance of a weak man, and the gaſtly countenance of a dead carkaſe: a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſtiffneſs in a mans joynts, or in his fleſh, by reaſon of ſome cold; and the ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a body that lies by the walls; a great
<pb n="04" facs="tcp:57745:23"/>
deal of difference between ſome breakings out of your Children, breakings out of heat, or other humors; and the filthy corruption that is in a dead carkaſe, that breaks out there: The Saints, though they have ſin in them, yet they have a principle of life that works out that ſin that is in them: Now the ungodly, they have ſin, but they have no principle of life to work it out: Hence, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 26. the <hi>Righteous</hi> when they fall, they are ſaid to be like a <hi>troubled Fountain:</hi> Now, you know, a Fountain that's troubled, or if there be dirt and filth put into a Fountain, it's all in a ſoil, and all looks filthy and dirty as any puddle doth; for the preſent you can ſee no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that, and any filthy puddle: But do but ſtay a while, and you will ſee, that the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain having a living ſpring in it, will work out all that filth. But now, if you caſt dirt into a plaſh of water in the high-way, there it lies, and there it putrifies. Juſt thus is the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the ſin of the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and the ſin of the godly; The ſin of the godly is as the troubled Fountain; I, but there is a principle of life to work out that ſin, and will work it out in time; but the ſin of the wicked is like the dirt that is caſt into the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57745:23"/>
hopes of the Saints are ſaid to be <hi>living hopes,</hi> that is, ſuch hopes as is working out that filth that is in their ſouls: The wicked, therefore, their ſpot is a deadly ſpot; but the Saints, they have a principle of life. Take the Saints of God in their worſt condition, when they are moſt overcome by temptation, and yet there is ſome ſymptoms of life; life will appear in them.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, What ſymptoms of life will appear in a godly man or woman, when they are overcome with ſin and corruption? Yes, you ſhall find Four, that will act in them when they are moſt overcom with their corruptions.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is this, If they ſin, if poſſibly they can, they labour to recall themſelves: You ſhall find that their judgments are yet for holineſs and ſtrictneſs in the wayes of God: perhaps they are overcome by a particular temptation, and they are troubled and afraid that there is no grace, and that there is no difference between them and wicked men: I, but you ſhall find that even at that time when they are overcome with temptations, yet their judgments remain for God, and for his truth, and for his way, for the ſtrictneſs of holineſs; and they account the Law of God to be good, and holy, and righteous at that very time. We read of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

you ſhall find almoſt in any; ſo that he was even led Captive, and that he was ſold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin: But yet mark, in <hi>v.</hi> 12. though he had ſuch a conflict with his corruptions, yet <hi>the Law was holy, and juſt, and good;</hi> I think he gives there ſome three Epatnites to the Law of God, when his corruptions did moſt ſtrive againſt the Law of God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law is <hi>holy,</hi> and the Commandment is <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>good:</hi> So you ſhall find gracious hearts, though they be under temptation, and may be overcome with an act of ſin, Well, though I be baſe and vile, though I have a filthy, and carnal, and baſe heart, yet Gods wayes are good wayes, and his Commandments are good Commandments, they are holy and bleſſed Commandments, onely my heart cannot get up to them; I, but though I cannot, yet I would not have the Commandment come down to me, I would not have i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57745:24"/>
againſt the wayes of God; though he may be overcome in an act, or there may be many diſtempers of heart, and paſſions, and the like, out if once he be taken in his judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wayes of God, the goodneſs, and ſtrictneſs, and the holineſs of them, it's to be feared, that this Man is quite gone, and that his ſpot is not the ſpot of Gods Children: In <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. 44. you have a notable Scripture there; and the reading of that Scripture, did hint to me this notion about the difference of the ſins of the one and the other: Now the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie was butas a tipe of the uncleanneſs of ſin: The whole Chapter, you ſhall find, is ſpent in the diſcerning of Leproſie, what is the ſpot of Leproſie, and what not: Now mark, all a long you ſhall find that the Prieſt looking upon the ſpot, and ſeeing it to be thus and thus, ſaith the Text, he ſhall pronounce him unclean; but now in the 44. <hi>v. The Prieſt ſhall pronounce him utterly unclean, his Plague is in his head:</hi> If a man had it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, then the Prieſt was onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him unclean: But now, when the Prieſt comes and looks upon a man, and ſees the Plague to be in his <hi>head,</hi> then ſaith the Text, the Prieſt ſhall pronounce him <hi>utterly unclean:</hi> So here in the Leproſie of ſin, if there be Leproſie of ſin in a mans <hi>affections,</hi> it's very ill, he may be unclean by it; if it be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57745:25"/>
got into his <hi>will,</hi> or got into his <hi>thoughts,</hi> there is a great deal of evil, but if it be got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the upper part of all, if it be got in the ſences, the body, the actions, it may make him unclean; but if it be got into his <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> if a man hath ſuch a corrupt judgment, that he gives a judgment againſt Gods wayes, againſt the goodneſs and ſtrictneſs of them, he gives a judgment againſt the holineſs of the word, and ſaith, What need men be ſo preciſe and ſtrict? and, the Law of God is not ſo ſtrict with men. Now I ſay, when it comes to the judgments of men and women, ſuch a Man or Woman is to be pronounced not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean onely,</hi> but <hi>utterly unclean,</hi> for the Plague is got into his <hi>head:</hi> But there's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

in that act of <hi>David,</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> there, <hi>I have kept the wayes of the Lord; and have not wickedly departed from my God:</hi> But now, <hi>David,</hi> how do you prove that? thou didſt ſin againſt thy God very groſly, why then doſt thou ſay <hi>thou had'ſt not wickedly depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thy God?</hi> why, he proves it in the 22 <hi>v. For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his ſtatutes from me:</hi> That is, as if he ſhould ſay, Why Lord, though I was overtaken with this corruption, yet I made thee to be my end and my ſcope, my heart was yet towards thee; I did not <hi>put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> thy ſtatutes from me, but I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that thy ſtatutes and judgments ſhould ſtand before me; and herein he proves that he had not wickedly departed from God. Can you ſay ſo now? you ſay you have ſin as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but you hope your ſin is not like the ſin of wicked men; but, can you ſay as in the preſence of God, Lord, thou knoweſt that I have not wickedly departed from thee; <hi>For all thy judgments are before me, and I do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

godly men that are not fallen into ſuch great ſins; when did you ever know any one godly man fall to be ſuch an Apoſtate, as to hate the Saints, and yet to turn again to God? for thereby you may know whether he were godly or no; if it were a temptation in one that is godly, though he doth Apoſtatiſe very far, yet he will return back again: But for my part, I never knew it, nor heard of any man, that was a profeſſor of Religion, and fell fo far, as to hate the Saints, to hate other godly men, and to perſecute them, I never knew any example that came again: But now you ſhall have many godly men, that fall foully; I, but yet their hearts are towards the Saints, and they think that they are in a bleſſed condition; Though I have a wicked and vile heart, and I cannot prevail againſt ſuch and ſuch corruptions, yet there are thoſe that are able to prevail againſt their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there are thoſe that are godly, O! they are in a happy condition; O! happy is ſuch a man, ſuch a woman, they are not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with ſuch corruptions as I am over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with: So that, though they be overcome with ſin, yet they will ſtill have their heart towards the Saints, and priſing thoſe that are not overcome with ſuch corruptions as they are.

Fourthly, The laſt ſymptom of ſpiritual life that is in the Saints, is this: Though they be overcome with much corruptions, yet you ſhall find this ever in them, They do not loſe the ſavour and reliſh of the moſt ſpiritual Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and the Word, as others do: Wicked men they are ſo defil'd with their corruptions, that that takes away all their reliſh and taſt of ſpiritual things: They cannot reliſh a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Miniſtry more than a filthy one; but, now take one that ever had any true godlineſs in him, though he be very foully fallen, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps into ſome groſs ſins, yet he is able to taſte the word in ſome degree, he can taſte a difference between Miniſtry and Miniſtry; yea, between Company and Company, between the ſpirit of one Man, and the ſpirit of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I ſay, he doth not wholly loſe his ſavour, but ſtill he hath ſome kind of ſavour, to taſte a difference between that that is ſpiritual, and carnal, and eſpecially in the Miniſtry of the word; he finds ſome ſavour in that; for if ever he was converted, it was a ſpiritual work of the word that did convert him, and there is ſome ſeed of it doth remain in his heart, hence is that of the Holy Ghoſt by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſt.

               </gap>ell as others? I will give you theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, As in the diſtemper of the body, if be conſtant, though it be ſmall, it may

prove deadly: As, if a man hath a Cough, yet if it continues conſtant, it may prove deadly: Take heed of conſtant ſins, though they be ſmall ſins; for if thou goeſt on in a conſtant way of ſin, it may prove deadly.</p>
            <p>And then, Secondly, If the diſeaſe reach to the heart, it proves deadly. In time of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, if you can keep it from the heart, you are well enough: Phyſicians, though they give Medicines to keep the infection from the heart, yet they have never a Medicine to cure the heart, if once the diſeaſe get into it: They can keep it out of the heart, but not get it out of the heart: <hi>Jer. 4. v. 1. O! thy ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Thirdly, When the ſickneſs is an increaſing ſickneſs. <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. 8. When the ſpot <hi>ſpreads,</hi> then the Prieſt muſt ſay, it's a ſpot of Leproſie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:57745:28"/>
Fourthly, A ſickneſ: is then deadly, when Nature is overcome with it, ſo as the party is not ſenſible of his ſickneſs; a Man when he lies ſick, ſo long as Nature is ſtri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing with it, there's good hopes; But one that comes to a man in a ſtrong Feaver, and asks him how he doth; why, well, I thank God; he is not ſenſible of it; O! that makes his wife and all about him turn their heads, and fall a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; It were better he did feel pain: So when men through the cuſtom of ſin, grow ſenſleſs of ſin, that's a ſign that it is unto death: perhaps when thou didſt firſt commit ſin, O, thy conſience did trouble thee; But thou haſt uſed thy ſelf ſo to it, that thou art not ſenſible of it; O it's a ſickneſs to death, and thou art like to dye by it, when by uſe of a ſin, thou comeſt to be ſenſleſs of it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, When a man in a ſickneſs cannot take any thing that will ſtay with him: So I may ſay of the ſin of wicked men, though thy ſin doth indanger thy ſoul, yet there's hope if ſo be that, that that is given thee might ſtay with thee, that is, the Word, that's as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick for thy ſoul: When ſome ſeaſonable truth comes, and is applyed to thy ſoul againſt thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>in, if thou canſt receive in that ingrafted word, that's like to ſave thy ſoul; But, if as ſoon as ever thou heareſt a truth that comes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear to thee, preſently thy heart caſts it up,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57745:29"/>
and it will not abide with thee at all, it is a dangerous ſign that thy ſickneſs is a ſickneſs unto death.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That's a ſickneſs to death, that, when a man doth take that that might help him, yet if it doth not work, then I ſay, it is dangerous too: So, it may be you do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Word, and it doth abide with you a while; but there's no good at all comes of it; it works mighty changes upon others, but nothing at all upon thee: If you come to a phyſicia in that caſe, and ſay, Sir, you did preſcribe ſuch or ſuch a thing, I, but it works not; why, I wonder ſaith he, I have known it hath wrought upon ſuch men and women, that I thought was in as deſperate a condition as one could be, it wrought upon them, I, and did recover them:—So I may ſay to ſome that ſit under the word, their ſouls are ſick, and the word works not upon them; I, but it hath wrought upon others that have been as dangerouſly ſick, why it's an Argument that their ſickneſs was not unto death; God did not intend they ſhould die. But if thou canſt ſit under the word, and it works not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, it's a ſign that thy ſickneſs is unto death.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and Laſtly, The ſuitableneſ that there is in the ſin of one, to the nature of thoſe that have their ſin in them: One
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57745:29"/>
mans ſpot is like the ſpot of a Leproſie, that is, his ſpot is that that is ſuitable to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his ſoul: But now the ſpot of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it's that that is a ſpot indeed; I, but it doth not ariſe from his natural diſpoſition, but meerly an accidental diſtemper: The ſpot of one riſes from the very natural temper of the heart; but the ſpot of theother riſes from ſome accidental diſtemper that comes to him: When a Man or Woman, therefore, ſins, and it is ſuitable to his nature, take him when he is moſt himſelf; I beſeech you conſider this note, for it is as diſcerning as any: If ſo be, that thou be'ſt moſt thy ſelf, then thou be'ſt moſt free for thy ſin; know, that thy ſin is that that comes from thy natural di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and not from any accidental diſtemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: I ſhall ſhew you what I intend, by this: There is Poyſon in a Toad, and there's Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon got into a mans body: Now the Poyſon that is in the Toad, is ſutable to the nature of the Toad, and therefore the Toad likes well enough of it: But now let but a drop of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be in a mans body, O, it preſently makes a great deal of ſtir, and makes him deadly ſick; why, becauſe there's that got in, that is contrary to his nature:—Here's the difference between the ſin of a wicked man, and the ſin of a Child of God: The wicked man's ſin is like Poyſon in a Toad, that's ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57745:30"/>
to his nature; But the ſin of a Child of God is like Poyſon in a mans ſtomack that is contrary to his nature; when a wicked man ſins, he ſinneth of himſelf, as it's ſaid of the Devil, he is a lyar, and when he lies, he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of himſelf, it comes from his own nature; ſo is the ſin of a wicked man; ſin is in it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Element in him, and that's the reaſon that wicked men are ſo unſenſible of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in its proper Element; But now the ſin of the Child of God is out of his place, and that's the reaſon that makes him feel it ſo much.</p>
            <p>Now you will ſay, How may a man make uſe of this Note to know the nature of his ſin? There are five or ſix particulars that I ſhall name about this.</p>
            <p>Firſt, When a Man or Woman is alone in ſecret, that no eye takes notice of them, then to examine themſelves; how doth thy heart ſtand then, when thou art in ſecret, alone? thou canſt not diſcern what the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of thy heart is when thou art in company; thou arr moſt thy ſelf when thou art in ſecret, alone; and, O what hearts of wickedneſs are there when thou art alone! whereas a godly Man, though he may be overcome with ſin in Company, yet when he is alone, his heart is more for God, and ſet againſt his ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:57745:30"/>
Secondly, That may be ſaid to be a mans ſelf, that is the Firſt ſpring of his ſoul: As now, the thoughts and affections in the firſt riſe of them, how are they, how is the guiſe, as I may ſo ſay, or the temper and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy thoughts and thine affections in the firſt riſe of them? As now you may know what is the proper nature of the Fountain, by that that is next to the Spring: Perhaps if the Fountain runs a Mile or two off, then there may come that that may alter the ſtream, that it may not be of the nature of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: So thou mayeſt know what thy nature is, by examining what the firſt working of thy thoughts and thine affections are, when thou art alone.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly, Thou mayeſt know thy ſelf in this, how thou ſtandeſt when thou art got abroad from thoſe that know thee not: You ſhall have many men, that when they are at home, and among their neighbours, they live very fairly and civilly; But let them go a journey abroad among ſome ſtrangers, there they will be roaring, and filthy and unclean, there they all diſcover themſelves: Therefore examine your ſelves in that.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You may know when you are your ſelf, by examining your heart, how it works moſt naturally when you are from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der government: Young people, many of them,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57745:31"/>
they live fairly and civilly all the while they are under Government, but let them be once themſelves, that they are free-men, from under any Government, then will be the moſt natural workings of their hearts: O! then preſently you find that they fly out into wicked Company, why, that was the natural temper of their hearts before.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, You may kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w when you are yourſelf, by what you are in time of proſperity and peace; in time of affliction, then you are, as it were, in Gods Fetters and Irons, and then you will ſpeak very well, and promiſe very fair; but when you are at moſt peace in your own ſpirits, when you have the World at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill, how do your hearts work then? the natural temper and pulſe of your hearts is then when you are in the moſt peace, and the moſt proſperity; when you have all things about you according as you do deſire, then is the moſt natural working of your hearts: It may be you think your hearts is good; why, becauſe you have many good moods in times of ſickneſs; O no, your heart may be very bad for all that: But look how your heart doth work when you are moſt in peace, and free from danger, that's the moſt natural working of a man's heart.</p>
            <p>And then Sixthly, That's the moſt natural working of a man's heart, when he is himſelf,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57745:31"/>
which he doth with moſt deliberation; a man may do otherwiſe then the natural temper of his heart would carry him on to, on a ſudden; But it cannot be ſaid, <hi>a mans ſelf,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>It's not I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me:</hi> But now when a man upon deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and examination, will do a thing, then he doth it when he is moſt himſelf: So that by this you know the difference between the ſins of one, and the ſins of another:—The ſins of wicked men are ſuch as comes from their natural temper, that their hearts do cloſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all when they are moſt themſelves: But, the ſins of the Saints are ſuch, that let them come but to be themſelves, and then their hearts will not cloſe with them ſo much: When temptations riſe, it may draw awaytheir hearts: I, but when they are themſelves, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, they keep godly and gracious; and likewiſe, when they are from under Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are rather better; one that was a ſervant, and gracious then, when he comes to be for himſelf, he is better then, then he was before, for when he was a ſervant, he was much hindered; But when they come to be for themſelves, then they appear to be more gracious: And though upon a ſuddein, they are overcome, yet let them come to deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and then they are moſt for God; ſo that their ſin comes not from their natural diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—Wicked
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57745:32"/>
men when they are moſt themſelves, they ſin moſt; but the Saints, when they are moſt themſelves, they ſerve God moſt: And here's the difference between the ſpot of the wicked, and the ſpot of Gods Children:—</p>

            <p>VVE are now to come to ſhew the differences between the ſpots of wicked men, and godly men, in the different behaviour of their ſouls about their ſin: You ſhall find that the carriage and behaviour of a godly man about ſin, is a great deal different from that that there is in a wicked man; which will appear in many things: As in the firſt place,</p>

that the Saints were guilty of, but ſuch as they are overtaken with: But now, wicked men, <hi>they do overtake their ſins,</hi> rather than their ſins over take them: When a man ſhall be contriving and plotting, he will have ſuch ſatisfaction to a ſinful luſt, I ſay he ſeeks to overtake his ſin, rather than his ſin overtakes him: That's the firſt thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Suppoſe the ſin hath in ſome meaſure overtaken a Saint: Yet in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, it is not eaſily entertain'd: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſin did come and preſent it ſelf, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Child of God, I ſay, ſin is not eaſily entertain'd, it is not admitted upon eaſie terms; a wicked man will admit of his ſin upon very eaſie terms, ſome ſin at leaſt. If your ſervants ſhall leave the door by the latch, you will ſuſpect them to be in covenant with the Thief, that they are one plotting with the other; So when any man ſhall admit of a ſin upon eaſie terms, that ſin ſhall get in eaſily into the ſoul, it's a ſign there is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eague between the ſoul and ſin. A gracious heart is watchful againſt ſin, and is careful to keep it out, to lock and bolt it out: It will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

No, I have ſinned againſt the Lord: He falls down before the word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and acknowledges his ſin, he is eaſily convinc't of his ſin, if he be godly: Whereas a wicked man will ſtand pleading for his ſin, pleading againſt it, that he hath not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, except that you find him out by ſome apparent hand; he will be pleading for his ſin, either that he is not guilty, or if he be guilty, that it is not ſo great, it is but his nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O! a godly man pleads not after this manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap> nature, <hi>O! I was conceived in ſin</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and brought forth in iniquity:</hi> He makes tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:57745:34"/>
did flow from ſuch a wicked nature: It is an Argument of groſs ignorance, of a man or woman that knows not the things of God, and is not acquainted with Scripture, to plead for a ſin, That it is their nature; It is the worſe becauſe of that: If a Thief ſhould come to the barr, and plead before the Judg, Indeed I have committed this theft, but it is my nature; would this be a plea before a Judg? and certainly this plea will not go before the great Judg of all the World, to ſay, it is thy nature; No, the Saints know their ſin is aggravated by that—Secondly, Neither will a Child of God ordinarily plead that it is a temptation; O! I, it is a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that hath prevaild againſt me, I was tempted to it, and ſuch and ſuch were the cauſe of it; I, but a gracious heart will rather charge the wickedneſs that is within it, then charge a temptation; for the truth is, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation could never prevail againſt us, were it not for the wickedneſs of our hearts; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations came to Chriſt, but the Devil finding nothing in him, as the Scripture ſpeaks, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could they not prevail over him: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vere it not for the baſeneſs of thy heart, temptations would not prevail; therefore for thee to put it off, It is thy temptation, O this is a carnal plea: I, but a gracious heart will charge himſelf before the Lord, O! it is</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57745:35"/>
Thirdly, Much leſs will a gracious heart put of his ſin to God himſelf, and ſay, When God gives me more grace, I ſhall do better; but I cannot do any thing of my ſelf; and therefore becauſe God gives me no grace, that's the reaſon I fell into ſuch ſins: This is the boldneſs of the hearts of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to think to put off all their ſins upon God himſelf, as if there were no other reaſon why they commit ſin, but becauſe God is the cauſe of it: As for their part, they would do better, but onely God denies them his grace, and ſo they think to put off all from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even to God. But know, the Lord will find thee out one day, and he will charge thy ſin upon thy ſelf, and thy deſtruction and thy wickedneſs it is from thy ſelf; a gracious heart will not plead for ſin after ſuch away as this is: It's very dangerous when you hear of any that make profeſſion of Religion, to plead for their looſneſs after ſuch a manner as this is. We have cauſe to fear that their ſpot is not the ſpot of Gods Children.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When ſin hath preveil'd in ſome meaſure againſt a Child of God, yet he is quickly ſtopt in ſin; he is eaſily convinc't of it, pleads not for it, and is ready to be ſtopt; a little thing will ſtop the courſe of his ſin.

Fifthly, There's no godly man what ever, though he hath many ſins in him, yet there is no ſin that reigns over him: This is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth, that there is no man or woman in the World that hath the leaſt degree of grace, that is under the power of any reigning ſin: Sin may <hi>dwell,</hi> but not <hi>reign</hi> in them, and the Scripture is ſo expreſs in this, that there can be no gainſaying of it: <hi>Rom. 6. 14. For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you;</hi> why? <hi>for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi> That ſoul that is under the dominion of any ſin, is under the Law, that is, it is under the curſe of the Law, it's in the ſtate of nature, it hath no intereſt in Chriſt: But now if the ſoul come once to be under grace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin muſt not have domminion over you, or God muſt not be faithful, one of them; for this is the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>If you be under grace, ſin ſhall have no more dominion over you:</hi> He doth not ſay, that if you be under grace, then you ſhall commit no more ſin; <hi>but ſin ſhall have no dominion over you;</hi> therefore that man or woman over whom any one ſin hath dominion, certainly is not under grace; This is the word of God, and O that God would carry it unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of whom it doth concern this day, that whoſoever is under the dominion and reign of any ſin, that ſoul for the preſent
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57745:37"/>
is not under grace, he hath no intereſt in the grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now you will ſay, for the reign and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin, What's that?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What the reign and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin is:</note>Firſt, It's apparent in a great many, that they are under the reign of ſin, that is, ſuch men  can go on conſtantly in a way of known-ſins, meerly for content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the fleſh; why theſe are under the power and reign of ſin: Yea, ſometimes a ſin that is a ſecret ſin, may be a reigning ſin: A man may be the ſubject of a King that he never ſaw in all his life: Perhaps he knows not where the King is, and yet he may be his Subject, and he may reign over him: So a ſecret ſin may be a reigning ſin: That's a reigning ſin that a man gives himſelf up to, though it be in never ſo ſecret a way: There's a difference between a Tyrant that co meth violently to force men to ſubmit to him, or one that comes with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſurpriſe, or with any cunning wayes to perſwade men to come in to ſubmit to him, and a Prince that is upon his Throne reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having his Subjects acknowledging themſelves to be as Subjects to him: Now the ſins of the wicked they are reigning, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:57745:37"/>
and the <hi>affections,</hi> it is in the ſin; There is nothing more in the will of a natural man, then his ſin: And therefore the Scripture makes theſe to be all one, the <hi>will</hi> of man, and the <hi>will</hi> of the fleſh: Now when the will yeelds up to the wayes of ſin, then ſin may be ſaid to be in the Throne: But now in a godly man there is a univerſal, ſpiritual, and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable oppoſition unto ſin; though there be ſin abiding in him, yet I ſay, there is a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, ſpiritual, irreconcilable oppoſition unto his ſin; ſin doth not reign in a ſoul: ſo long as there is an oppoſition in a kingdom to any man, certainly he cannot be ſaid to reign: I ſay, if there be a univerſal oppoſition. Now in the ſoul of a Child of God there is an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſin, a univerſal one, a ſpiritual one, and I may put a fourth, a powerful, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, ſpiritual, irreconcilable oppoſition: I'le open theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A powerful oppoſition: That is, he doth not onely wiſh that he could not ſin, and wiſh that he might be otherwiſe, but he makes it to be the great work of his life above all things in the World, to ſet himſelf againſt his ſin; ſo as if God would ſpeak from Heaven and ſay unto him, Poor creature! what would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou that I ſhould do for thee? this ſoul would anſwer to God, Lord, thou that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all things, knoweſt this is the unfeigned

deſire of my ſoul above all things, O giveme but power againſt my ſin, and eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe ſpecial ſins that my nature is moſt inclinable to. O! this is that that my heart is moſt againſt. Many people extreamly deceive themſelves in this, in thinking that they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their ſins, becauſe they have ſome wiſhes, and deſires, they would be glad that things were better with them then they are: I, but doſt thou look upon it as a matter of life and death, and thereupon thy ſoul doth more ſtrongly work in its oppoſition againſt thy ſin, then againſt any thing in the World beſides? many men and women have ſtrong ſpirits in <hi>following</hi> their ſins, but their ſpirits are not ſtrong in the oppoſing of their ſins: But he that is gracious, makes it to be his greateſt and chiefeſt work.</p>
            <p>And then the Second thing, It is a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal oppoſition; and that in theſe Two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</p>
            <p>Firſt, All the faculties in the ſoul do riſe up againſt ſin: There is ſome kind of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a wicked man againſt ſin, that is, his conſcience ſometimes doth oppoſe the luſts that there is in his affections: It may be, a wicked man hath a convinc't conſcience; and his conſcience will not let him to be at quiet; but in his affections there is a liking of ſin, onely his conſcience will not let him

be at quiet:—You will ſay, how ſhall a man diſcern this? You may diſcern it thus; If the oppoſition be meerly in your conſcience and not in your heart and affections, then, though indeed you dare not for the preſent commit ſuch a ſin, yet you could wiſh with all your heart that you might have liberty to do it; you could wiſh that there were not ſuch a Law to forbid it; you could be glad that that Law were more looſe: And you would fain have ſuch a thing not to be a ſin; and if you could commit it quietly without any danger, you would do it: Now the oppoſition is not in your will, it is onely in your conſcience: This is an oppoſition to ſin that a carnal heart may have; that is, he may have his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo flye in his face, as that he ſhall not dare for the preſent to commit his ſin, no not in ſecret; a man may come ſo far: You will ſay, Indeed, many hypocrites may go thus far, as not to commit ſin before others, but yet if it be in ſecret, then they will do it; No, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience may be able to carry a man to this height, that is, not onely to abſtain from ſin becauſe of others, but from the acts of ſin in ſecret, that he dares not for his life (though there be none but God and himſelf together) give way to his ſin, and yet no ſaving-grace all this while:—You will ſay, how can that be? becauſe though his conſcience will
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57745:39"/>
not let him be quiet, yet he would be glad to have his ſin if he might; here's no change of nature that's the evidence, that there is no grace; for if a man abſtain from ſin out of a principle of grace, it is from the change of his nature; and certainly here's no change of nature in this: ſo that it is not a univerſal op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it's but onely in one part of his ſoul: But now the oppoſition of a gracious heart it is in the whole ſoul; not onely my conſcience is againſt my ſin, but my will, and my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; I have a principle in my will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as well as in my conſcience; all the faculties of the ſoul do oppoſe the ſin.</p>
            <p>And then Secondly, It's univerſal, that is, there's the oppoſition of all ſin: not onely of ſome particular ſin, but of every ſin; what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſin be, yet the heart doth oppoſe it: So as it can appeal to God, Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt there is not one way of wickedneſs in me, there's not one ſin that my ſoul gives way to, but there is in my heart an oppoſition againſt every ſin.</p>
            <p>And then I ſay, It's a ſpiritual oppoſition; by that I mean this, that it's an oppoſition, not from arguments onely without that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the danger, or ſhame, or prejudice that will come by it; but the oppoſition is from a contrary ſtream of grace that there is in the heart: There's ſuch a temptation to ſin; but
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57745:39"/>
a carnal heart may think if I commit it, then there may come this ill, and the other evil of it, and ſo I will not commit it: But a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart doth not oppoſe onely from ſuch arguments, but from a contrary ſtream of grace that there is in the ſoul; now when the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſin comes from a contrary ſtream of grace, then the oppoſition is not onely to keep ſin from acting, but indeed it doth decreaſs the habits of ſin: And this ſhould be the care of a godly man or woman, not meerly to keep in, that is, to reſtrain ſin, but let me op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the habits of ſin: Let me find the habits of my ſin to be weakned and mortified in me: Let me follow my corruption to the very root of it, and there labour to get the very root of my corruption to be deaded: O here's the work of a Child of God!</p>
            <p>As now in the oppoſition of a ſtream of water, water that runs in ſuch a ſtream, there may be two wayes to oppoſe it: Either you may make a damm, and ſo damm it up:—Or otherwiſe, if there could be gotten a contrary ſtream, and ſo by that to overpower it; this would be another manner of oppoſition then meerly the damming of it up: If you damm up a ſtream, it riſes up higher and higher, and ſeeks to get vent one way or other; but if there were a contrary ſtream that would carry it ſmoothly away:—So 'tis when the ſins
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57745:40"/>
of wicked men are oppoſed, not onely when they are oppoſed by their friends, that theſe will not let them commit ſuch a ſin; but when their very conſciences oppoſe their ſin, their ſin ſwells up the more, and they ſeek all evaſions how they can get to have liberty to the commiſſion of their ſin; and if once they have but broken over the damm, they run with more violence; as many young people, when they are under government, their ſin is but damm'd up, and their ſins are ſwelling, and their hearts would fain have vent for their ſin, but they dare not: But then afterwards when they come to be for themſelves, their ſin breaks out ſo much the more: But a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart hath a new nature which God hath put into the ſoul, which is contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin: That's the ſpiritual way of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin.</p>
            <p>And then it's an irrecocinlable oppoſition; that is, ſuch a ſoul that hath any truth of grace, will never be reconcil'd with any one ſin: It reſolves with it ſelf, what ever becomes of me, yea though I ſhould periſh eternally, yet I am reſolved to fight againſt my ſin eternally: Yea, at ſuch a time as a ſoul is afraid that God will caſt it away for ever, yet at that time ſuch a ſoul would be loath to ſin againſt God—You ſhall have ſome men that have horrors of conſcience, and they are afraid that God will

               </gap>any grounds upon which wicked men go, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the commiſſion of ſin:—I ſhall but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame them, and yet in the naming of them,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57745:41"/>
I do verily perſwade my ſelf I may ſpeak to many of your hearts.</p>
            <p>As thus: Commit a ſin, why it's but <hi>one,</hi> and I will not live in many ſins: It's but one ſin that I would live in; and in that I hope God may favour me: What, not in one!—Why, Godly men will not do ſo; where was there ever a godly man on the face of the Earth that would allow himſelf in a ſin becauſe it was but one?—</p>
            <p>Secondly, Saith a carnal heart, It's but one, and it's a <hi>little one:</hi> I will not commit ſuch groſs ſins as others do, I will not ſwear, and openly profane the Sabbath, and be drunk, and a Whore-maſter: But ſins in thought, and of a leſſer nature, I hope they may be born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? And what need a man be ſo ſtrict and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe? I, but know, that a gracious heart would never reaſon after ſuch a manner; O no, ſuch a one knows, that the leaſt ſin is a greater evil then the greateſt affliction; that there is more evil in the leaſt ſin, then there is in all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell beſides: And a godly man that underſtands the wayes of God, doth know, that the leaſt ſin muſt have the blood of Jeſus Chriſt to purge it out, that is more worth then ten Thouſand worlds; and therefore he will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> allow himſelf in the leaſt, becauſe it is a little one.</p>
            <p>The Third ground is this:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:57745:41"/>
Why, the <hi>beſt of all have their ſins as well as we:</hi> Thoſe that we read of in Scripture, have they not fallen into foul ſins: But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you mark, though godly men have their infirmities, yet ſhew me any example that ever there was ſince the beginning of the World, any one godly man that did plead for his ſin upon this account, becauſe another godly man had committed it: O! he doth not commit ſin upon ſuch a ground as this is: He will not venture upon the practice of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſees others are guilty of it as well as himſelf; Oh no, If God hath diſhonour by another, let me take heed how I add to this diſhonour, ſaith a gracious heart.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another ground is, <hi>becauſe their ſin is not ſo bad as the ſins of others;</hi> mine is not the worſt: Come and rebuke them for a ſin, why, God grant you never do any worſe—Indeed in matters of affliction we may reaſon from a leſs to a greater, and take up a leſs to prevent a greater; but in matters of ſin we ſhould never make ſuch compariſons; there is a kind of infiniteneſs in ſin, and the leaſt ſin is enough to be my eternal ruine: What's that to me becauſe others do worſe? I beſeech you conſider of it, as we name theſe things, for I do not ſtand to enlarge every one: For the truth is, there's never a one of theſe but might be inlarged into a Sermon, and might
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57745:42"/>
be a great uſe to take away theſe grounds of ſin upon which ungodly men do commit their ſin.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Another is this: A wicked heart will venture upon ſin, why, becauſe he heart that <hi>God is merciful,</hi> and <hi>God's not ſo ſtrict as many make him:</hi> This is a ſign thy ſpot is not the ſpot of Gods Children: Where do we ever find that a gracious heart would ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus, there is mercy with the Lord and therefore let me ſin? O no, the reaſonings of a gracious heart are, <hi>There is mercies with thee, O Lord, that then mayeſt be feared,</hi> and therefore thou ſhalt be feared: Not, there are mercies with thee and therefore thou ſhalt be diſhonoured; If there be ſuch kind of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in thy heart, that thou ventureſt upon ſin upon this ground, becauſe God is merciful, know, that the Lord ſpeaks to thy ſoul this day, that thy ſpot is not the ſpot of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, And farther, Not onely becauſe God is merciful, but God hath been already merciful; Indeed I hear that there is a great deal of danger in ſin, but I have liv'd all this while, and nothing hath come of it; O! for men to ſin upon reaſoning of Gods patience! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath been patient and ſuffered them all this while: O this is wicked boldneſs in thy heart, thou knoweſt not with whom it is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57745:42"/>
thou haſt to deal: Thou haſt eſcaped all this while, O <hi>but a ſinner a hundred years old ſhall be accurſed:</hi> Thy ſpot is not the ſpot of Gods Child, that dar'ſt venture upon thy ſin becauſe thou haſt eſcap'd ſo long a time as thou haſt done.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, And then yet farther; There's another ground that is worſe then all theſe, that ſome will venture upon ſin, why, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath died for ſinners, becauſe there is a purchaſe for the pardon of ſin: Oh this is a moſt deſperate turning the grace of God into wantoneſs, to dare to venture upon the commiſſion of thy ſin becauſe Chriſt came to purchaſe the pardon of ſin! why, did not Jeſus Chriſt come into the World to diſſolve the works of the Devil, and doſt thou make Jeſus Chriſt to be a means to ſtrengthen the works of the Devil: Bold and preſumptuous heart! the Lord rebuke thee, that doſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the blood of Jeſus Chriſt not onely as a common thing, but as a polluted thing, as an unclean thing; ſurely thy ſpot is not the ſpot of Gods Children.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Another ground is this: A temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation comes to ſin, and they will venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: Why? they hope they ſhall repent after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and though I do ſin, it is but repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards; and if I do repent afterwards, then my ſin ſhall be for given me, and not laid
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57745:43"/>
to my charge: But have you any thing in Scripture, That any Child of God committed ſin upon ſuch a ground as this is? and if thou doſt ſo, thy ſpot likewiſe is not the ſpot of Gods Children: O fooliſh and baſe heart, thou wilt do that now, that thou doſt know thou mayeſt wiſh thou had'ſt never done: This is in finite folly; and ſurely God doth not leave his Children to ſuch wickedneſs as this is, to venture upon ſin upon ſuch grounds as theſe are.</p>
            <p>Ninethly, Another ground may be this: They will venture upon it; why? becauſe it may poſſibly ſtand with grace: You ſhall hear ſometimes, many that make ſome kind of profeſſion, to be reaſoning after this manner: They will not indeed commit ſuch things as they think cannot poſſibly ſtand with grace; but if they think it may poſſibly ſtand with grace, they will make that to be the ground of their venturing upon it: O wretched and vile heart, that ſhalt thus reaſon to commit ſin becauſe it may poſſibly ſtand with grace! Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſhould be ſo, that many a man that commits ſuch a ſin ſhould go to Heaven; but is it poſſible that a man commiting ſin upon ſuch a ground, may go to Heaven: There's a great deal of difference between a thing done, and a thing done upon ſuch a ground.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Laſtly, (though many others
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57745:43"/>
might be named) for a man to venture upon a ſin, why, becauſe he hath done much good: This likewiſe is not the ſpot of Gods Child, for one to ſin upon ſuch a ground: I have done ſome good, and therefore I may venture upon ſome ſin: This is the wickedneſs of a mans heart, that if he hath (as they uſe to ſay) kept his Church, he thinks he may have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the week-day the more; if he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout upon the Lords day, he may take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo much the more upon the week-day: O this is an Argument of a baſe and carnal heart, that knows not the wayes of God: To take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty upon ſin at one time, becauſe they have been devout, and done good at another time: That's the next head, the different grounds.</p>
            <p>I ſhall name but one thing more:</p>
            <p>That a godly man in the commiſſion of ſin, he makes his falling into one ſin, to be a means to help him againſt that ſin, and againſt many others: If the Lord ſhall let him fall into ſome one ſin, I ſay, he will make that to be a means to cleanſe many others; but eſpecially, to take heed againſt that ſin: The beſpotting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſome one ſpot, will be a means for the cleanſing of many ſpots: Though he dare not commit ſin upon that ground, yet it falls out ſo in the effect: As ſometimes, if there be a few ſmall ſpots in a Childs Coat, you regard not them; but if there be ſome great ſpot, it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57745:44"/>
cauſes you to waſh the whole Coat: So it is with one that hath any grace, if the Lord (notwithſtanding his watchfulneſs and care) ſhall let him fall into ſome great ſpot, he makes this uſe, To be cleanſing and waſhing of his ſoul, not onely from that ſpot, but from all other ſpots he knows in himſelf; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, to ſet himſelf againſt that particular ſin, he will take heed of ever falling into that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:</p>
            <p>☞ And therefore give me an example in all the book of God, where any one man that was godly, committed the ſame ſin twice: I ſay, after an act of repentance: It's true <hi>Peter</hi> denyed his Maſter thrice, I, but that was as a continued thing, it was not after <hi>Peters</hi> heart was ſmitten and humbled, after his conviction and repentance—And for my part, I know no example from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> of any one Child of God that fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> twice into an outward Act; I do not ſay, the ſins of thought, they may be repented of, an fallen into again, though the heart do labour and ſtrive againſt them; but for an outward a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of ſin that any Child of God did ever fall into after God had ſhown him the evil, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had tepented of it:—And therefore the condition muſt needs be ſad, when it is ſuch as there can be no example in all the Scriptur to parallel it: For I appeal to thee, thou the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57745:44"/>
makeſt any Profeſſion of Religion, and thou falleſt into ſome act of ſin; Either thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth accuſe thee, and thou doſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or it doth not accuſe thee, and thou doſt not repent: If thy Conſcience doth not accuſe thee, and thou doſt not repent, that's a ſign thy heart is not troubled:—Well, if thy heart be troubled, and thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, give me an example of any one Child of God, that fell into ſuch an act of ſin again—Yea, I ſhall ſhew you in divers examples in Scripture, that evermore thoſe Children of God that have been overtaken with their ſin, they have been more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in that grace that is moſt contrary to that ſin, than in any other grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> he fell through cowardiſe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his Maſter: But yet when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of him afterwards, it notes him ſpecially for his boldneſs, in <hi>John 21. 7. Therefore the Diſciple whom Jeſu's loved, ſaith unto Peter, it is the Lord; now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fiſhers Coat unto him, and did caſt himſelf into the Sea:</hi> Oh the love of <hi>Peter</hi> towards Chriſt after he had denyed him! He had denyed Chriſt; but now he was the hoſt forward in his love to Chriſt; he would not ſtay till Chriſt came to the ſhip, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rows himſelf into the Sea, that he might
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57745:45"/>
preſently be with Chriſt; he had broke his love before, and now you ſee how eminent he is in love above the other Diſciples!—And ſo in <hi>boldneſs;</hi> In <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 14. When the <hi>Jews</hi> did mock at the Apoſtles and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the Text ſaith, <hi>That Peter ſtanding up with the eleven, lift up his voice, and ſaid unto them, Ye men of Judea:</hi> Not any of the other would ſpeak, but <hi>Peter</hi> he appears the moſt forward; I, it was becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> had denyed Chriſt, and therefore he would be the moſt forward in manifeſting love to Chriſt—You cannot have comfort that your ſpot is the ſpot of Gods Children, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, if you have been overcome with a ſin, yet afterwards you grow not up in that grace that is moſt eminently contrary to that ſin.</p>
            <p>Another example we have of <hi>Nichodemus Nichodemus</hi> he began to have ſome work o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> grace upon him, but the Scripture notes him for a very timerous man, and that was him ſpecial infirmity, that he was afraid, and ſo would come to Chriſt by night: Now after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when the Scripture takes notice of this <hi>Nichodemas,</hi> eſpecially it obſerves him for his boldneſs, for that which was contrary to that ſinful diſtemper of his heart before This you have in <hi>John 19. 39. And there came alſo Nichodemas, which at the firſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57745:45"/>

            <p>The third is <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea, v. 38. And after this, Joſeph of Arimathea, being a Diſciple of Jeſus, but ſecretly for fear of the Jews, beſought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jeſus:</hi> He was at the firſt ſtep a Diſciple; but dare not appear; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he is noted for one of the moſt forward of all, and would go and own him before <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> himſelf, yea, and at that time when Chriſt was in his loweſt cond ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r: That's a ſign indeed of grace, to own Chriſt when he is in the loweſt condition, when he was crucified and dead; yet now to appear to own him, and that before Princes! O! the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture takes ſpecial notice of thoſe that had fallen into ſin, that afterwards they grew more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent in that grace that was contrary to that ſin, than any other: As it is with a bone that is ſet, it is more ſtrong then before; and ſo it is uſual with thoſe that are godly, if they be once overcome with their ſin, they afterwards grow more ſtrong againſt that ſin: And thus even Acts come to decreaſe Habits; and that's a Paradox in Philoſophy, it's true in Divinity, That the acts of the Saints ſin, come not only to reſtrain them from falling into them again,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57745:46"/>
but it is uſed by God to decreaſs the habits of their ſin. Now I beſeech you carry home theſe things to your ſouls; and O that the Lord would cauſe you to lay your hand upon your hearts, and ſay, Lord have mercy upon me; we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all ſinners, but we ſee that God will find a difference between one ſin and another; and though all have their ſpots, yet, as for my part, I am afraid that my ſpot is not the ſpot of Gods Children.</p>

            <p>I Shall ſpeak to one or two particulars more about this, (and then we come to the laſt thing propounded in the opening of this point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</p>
            <p>The behaviour of the heart of a Child of God toward this ſin.</p>
            <p>The ſins of the Saints they drive them to Jeſus Chriſt: If there be any truth of grace, though weak, thy ſins will drive thee to Jeſus Chriſt, not drive thee from him, but drive thee to him: And make thee priſe Jeſus Chriſt as the Immaculate Lamb of God that is come into the World to take away thy ſin: It will make thee ſet a high price upon Chriſt, and cauſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57745:47"/>
thy heart to follow him with all thy might: Wicked men when they ſin, they turnaway from God and from Chriſt; and the things of Chriſt are leſs ſavoury to them: But the Saints when they ſin, they are put upon the ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, and priſing of him ſo much the more.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Their very ſin makes them to long for Heaven: <hi>O wretched man that I am!</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O!</hi> he flies to Chriſt, and he deſires to be preſent with Chriſt: &amp; ſo the Saints they long for Heaven upon this ground above all other grounds and reaſons, namely, becauſe they know they ſhall never be delivered from the body of ſin and death that they carry about with them, till they come to Heaven, and therefore they priſe the ſtate of Heaven as a glorious ſtate, becauſe they ſhall never ſin more againſt God:—I put it now, in the name of God, to your conſciences this day; you ſay you hope to go to Heaven, what's that for which you priſe Heaven moſt? why, a gracious heart would ſay, O Lord, though I endure ſome ſorrows and afflictions here, yet thou knoweſt that the great burden of all, it is the burden of my ſin; and when I ſhall be taken out of this world, I know I ſhall never ſin more, never ſin more againſt thee. O that day! when ſhall that day come that my ſoul
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57745:47"/>
ſhall never ſin more againſt that God that I do love? Thou that knoweſt all things, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, that this is my deſire after Heaven upon this ground, above all other grounds whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Are you able to ſay ſo as in the peſence of God? this would be a good argument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that though there be ſome ſpots, yet they may be the ſpots of Gods Children: And if it be ſo with thee, then attend to the next point, and that is—</p>
            <p>The different dealings of God with his Children in regard of their ſin, with his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the wicked and ungodly in regard of their ſins—As the behaviour of thy ſoul in reſpect of thy ſin, is different from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo the behaviour of God towards thee will be very different from that of his towards the wicked and ungodly: They may not think to eſcape, ſo as thou mayeſt eſcape.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As in the firſt place: If a Child of God ſins, yet he hath a pardon laid up for his ſin, yea a pardon laid up before the ſin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; I do not ſay, the pardon actually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, but laid up; for to ſay the thing is actually pardoned before committed, it's ſcarce Engliſh, much leſs Divinity: For whatever it be in Gods account, or what God will do, yet when we ſay the ſinner is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, it notes ſome work of God upon the Creation actual in being: As when we ſay the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57745:48"/>
World was created, it was not created from eternity, why, it's a work of God upon the creation, therefore it has a Time: And ſo, what's a work of God in Himſelf? that is from eternity. But what's a work of God upon the creature, that's in time; without any change in Gods nature, any more-then the creating of the World did change his nature; <hi>there are for givneſſes with thee that thou mayeſt be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> they lie up with thee: there are Pardons that lie up with God, there is an Atonement made for the ſins of Gods Children, for the ſins that they have committed, and ſins that they ſhall commit: I ſay, an Atonement is made even for them, and a ranſom is paid: Jeſus Chriſt did tender up himſelf to the Father for a ranſom for all the ſins of the elect, it's laid up there: So ſaith the Apoſtle 1 <hi>John 2, 2. I write unto you, little Children, that ye ſin not, and if any man ſin,</hi> (that I ſhall take notice of by and by) <hi>we have an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he is the propitiation for our ſins:</hi> So that when an ungodly man ſins, there the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death comes out againſt him; But the Lord ſaith concerning his Children. Let their ſouls be pardoned, for I have found a ranſom: Thou ſayeſt, the beſt have their ſin; True, but one man hath a ranſom, hath a price paid for his ſin, and thou haſt none, none for ought thou knoweſt: In that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57745:48"/>
wherein thou art, thou canſt not know that thou haſt any: Here's the difference between Gods dealing with his Children &amp; others, one ſins, and the Lord acknowledges a propitiation preſently, a ranſom, a price, a pardon that's laid in; but he acknowledges it not for thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Yea, in the Second place, the Children of God when they ſin, their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is far different from the ſin of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they have not only a price paid, and a pardon laid up; But you will ſay, how in caſe they do not ſue out their pardon? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs if they ſue it not out, they have not the comfort of it: But yet the Scripture tells us, they have an <hi>Advocate with the Fathe</hi>—If they through ignorance do not know their ſin, how can they ſue out their pardon? yet they have an advocate with the Father continually, and it's the work of Jeſus Chriſt at the right hand of the Father, to be an Advocate to plead for believers, with the Father; when ever they ſin againſt the Father, there ſtands Chriſt their Advocate pleading, he watches if there come in any accuſations againſt them; if the Law, or the Devil, or conſcience ſhal ſend up an accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chriſt ſtands as an Advocate to plead their cauſe: you know I ſuppoſe what an Advocate in Law doth mean; he ſtands to plead the cauſe of his Client; &amp; whatſoever comes in againſt him, he is made acquainted withall, that he may
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57745:49"/>
ſtand to plead: This is the caſe of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; notwithſtanding their ſin, they have an Advocate with the Father: In <hi>1 John 2. 1. My little Children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not;</hi> ye ought not to ſin, take heed of ſinning; <hi>But if ye do, you have an advoc te with he Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous:</hi>—Theſe things that I am ſpeaking, I confeſs may prove dangerous to wicked carnal hearts, that are ready to turn the Grace of God into wantonneſs; but by that they may know, what I ſay belongs not to them, that their ſpots are not the ſpots of Gods Children: Thoſe that ſhall hear of this, and be hardened, or emb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ldned in ſin the more, there need no other Argument to prove that their ſpots a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>f the ſpots of Gods Children, than that: And therefore that what I ſay doth not at all belong to ſuch: but how ever, it doth belong to many of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and therefore they muſt have their portion, though ſuch as it belongs not to will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eady to ſnatch at it: And that's the ſecond thing, in the different way of Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Children when they ſin, and with the ungodly: Thou ſinneſt as others do: Thy ſin for the Act may be the ſame; but when thou haſt ſinned, who ſtands before the Father to plead thy cauſe? what hath Chriſt to do with thee? or thee to do with him? but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57745:49"/>
thy Conſcience, and Law, and Devil ſtands pleading againſt thee, and none to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for thee.</p>
            <p>But, Thirdly, When a godly Man ſins, God deals with him not according to the Law of Juſtice, but according to the Law of Grace; <hi>We are not under the Law</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle concerning believers) <hi>but under grace;</hi> when another ſins, the Law paſſes preſently upon him; but ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The Law cannot paſs upon them to condemn them: They are not to be dealt withall according to the Law, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Grace: Now the ungodly when they ſin, they are dealt withal according to the Law, God will do them no wrong, but the Law muſt paſs upon them.</p>
            <p>Yea, not onely ſo, but they are delivered from the Law, and from all the curſe of the Law; I, the Lord hath promiſed that <hi>he will ſpare them as a Man doth his onely Son that ſerves him:</hi> In <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. laſt. If thou be'ſt a Child, this is thy portion; And <hi>they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, in that day when I make up my Jewels, and I will ſpare them as a Man ſpareth his onely Son that ſerves him:</hi> This is a Text that hath a treaſury of comfort in it to thoſe that are Gods Children, that can by thoſe former notes of the difference of ſin,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57745:50"/>
and their different behaviours towards their ſin, approve themſelves that they belong to God; here's the promiſe, That the Lord will ſpare them as a Father ſpareth his own Son that ſerves him: A Father will not caſt cut his Son from his Houſe, and diſinherit him for every offence that he doth commit; neither will God deal ſo with his Children, though they have ſpots, though they have infimities: And hence we find that God takes advantage againſt ſome for a little ſin, and ſpares another though he be guilty of a greater ſin: Gods mercy is his own, he may deal with his mercy as he pleaſes; he will do juſtly with all, but he will be merciful to whom he pleaſes; and hence it is the Scripture holds forth this, that ſome men the Lord hath taken advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt for ſome ſmaller ſin, and other men the Lord hath ſpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d when they have been guilty of ſome greater ſin; As that notable example of <hi>Saul,</hi> comparing that with <hi>David: David</hi> was one of Gods Children, and had ſpots, I, foul ones; <hi>Saul</hi> he was none of Gods Child, and he had his ſpots, and ſome of them was not ſo foul in regard of the nature of them, as <hi>Davids</hi> were, and yet ſee the different dealing of God with <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> for <hi>Saul,</hi> you ſhall find that God rejects him utterly, and what for? In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 13. You may ſee wherefore God would reject <hi>Saul: And
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57745:50"/>
Samuel ſaid to Saul, Thou haſt done fooliſhly, thou haſt not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee; for now would the Lord have eſtabliſhed thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon Iſrael for ever; But now thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall not continue:</hi>—As if <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould have ſaid, Well, this is the thing for which God will cut thee off, and cut off thy kingdom:—Why, what was it? if you examine the thing what it was, it was nothing but this, That there was an agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> that <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould come to him at ſuch a time: Well, <hi>Samuel</hi> did not come juſt at the time, or ſtaid, as <hi>Saul</hi> thought, ſomewhat too long: <hi>Saul</hi> was brought into great ſtraits, the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him (his enemies:) Now upon this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch great ſtraits, <hi>Saul</hi> had not ſought to God for Gods preſence with him in the battel; now thought <hi>Saul,</hi> I have ſtaid for <hi>Samuel</hi> all this time, and he comes not, and rather then I will go out to battel without making ſupplication to God, and offering ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, I will for this once venture upon it my ſelf, for ſo he ſaith in the 12 <hi>ver.</hi> It was a <hi>burnt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57745:51"/>
cut off and rejected, and his kingdom not to continue—You will ſay now, what was this to the ſin of <hi>David,</hi> of Murder, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterry? Thoſe were ſins of another nature; well, what if they were, yet <hi>David</hi> was a Child, and <hi>Saul</hi> was not, and therefore he will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don one, and condemn the other; and who can ſay to God, what doſt thou?</p>
            <p>And again, another ſin of <hi>Saul</hi> you ſhall find in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. God required of <hi>Saul</hi> to go againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> &amp; utterly to deſtroy him. Well, <hi>Saul</hi> did do according to Gods command, and made a great ſlaughter, but he kept one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome of the Cattel and the fat ones; but he profeſt he kept them not for his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. it was that he might offer for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God: Now <hi>Samuel</hi> comes to him, though <hi>Saul</hi> had thought he had done nothing but that which God was pleaſed withal, for he ſtands to juſtifie himſelf in the 20 <hi>v. And Saul ſaid unto Samuel, yea, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord ſent me, and have brought A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag the King of Amalek, and have utterly deſtroyed the Amalakites:</hi> I have done what God ſent me about.

            <p>Fourthly, The Children of God when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57745:52"/>
from God himſelf; not to cover them ſo but God knows them; for that's either ſimplicity or blaſphemy, one of the two, to ſay that God ſees them not: But to cover, that is, that they ſhall be taken ſo far from the eye of God, that he ſhall never look upon them to charge them with them, but that they ſhall appear before him through the Robes of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt as ſpotleſs, being juſtified through him. So in <hi>Pſal. 32. Bleſſed is the Man whoſe ſin is forgiven, and whoſe iniquity is covered;</hi> all their ſpots are covered and the Lord looks upon them as amiable and lovely in his eye: But now thou haſt nothine to cover thy ſpots, but thy excuſes. See the different condition of a believer, and another man. One man ſins againſt God, and what hath he to cover his ſins? Excuſes, deny als, or lies, and there's all.

God will not charge it upon them as the breach of that great covenant of grace that God hath made with them in his Son, that's an everlaſting covenant; God hath made a covenant to unire their hearts to fear his name, that he will never depart from them; and that he will put his fear into their hearts, and they ſhall never depart from him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their infirmities: This muſt be made good, this covenant that God hath made with them, muſt ſtand. Now, O what a different condition is one in, from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—Now though there may be thoughts in wicked hearts to abuſe theſe things, yet I name them to this end, that you may ſee the exceeding difference between the ſtate of one, and the ſtate of the other; and that ſo by this you may be reſtleſs in your own ſpirits, till you come to know that you are in the ſtate of theſe men that are ſo happy, that is, that you are of the Number of Gods Children—I ſhall not need to ſtand to give further notes and evidences; for the very opening of the point about the defferent behaviour of one in reſpect of their ſin, from the other, will be enough to ſhew who are in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and who not, whom God will deal with all in this gracious manner in reſpect of their ſin, and whom not:—However, men of the World will deal ſo much the more
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57745:53"/>
harſhly with thoſe that do offend; if they can take any one that makes profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion tripping in any thing, they will be more ſevere againſt them, than againſt others, becauſe of their profeſſion. Well, God doth not do ſo, if there be uprightneſs in the heart—No, you will ſay, it's not becauſe of that, but becauſe of cloaking wickedneſs with their profeſſion: Well, if you be ſure your hearts be right in that, that profeſſion your ſouls do love, and therefore it is the great grief of your ſouls that any one that makes profeſſion of Religion ſhould diſhonour it by wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; then (I ſay) can you approve your hearts before God, that your hearts are griev'd and troubled, and not rejoyce at it, that you can ſind any advantage againſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as ſome do?—Then I confeſs, if the thing be vile and foul, and ſuch a thing as you cannot in charity ſee that it may ſtand with truth of grace, to be a meer infirmity, but a wickedneſs: then you may follow it to the very foot and bottom; and thoſe that ſhall trouble the people of God with groſs and vile ſins, and think to colour them over with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, it's juſt with God they ſhould be troubled: But if we have time, we ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat to that in the cloſe of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We come now to the Application of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

God will find out a difference of ſin. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 14. It's ſaid of Chriſt, that his eyes were like a flame of fire: O! Chriſt hath fiery eyes that will pierce through and through thee, wil ſee a great deal of difference between the ſin of one, and the ſin of the other:—I hou thinkeſt it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to plead this, That the beſt have their faults, I beſeech you let me reaſon it a little with you about this—The beſt, ſay you, have their faults; So ſay I too; but the <hi>worſt have ſome good in them,</hi> materially good: Why may not this be as good a reaſon as thine?—There are ſome that are ſav'd, and yet committed ſin as well as I; ſo ſay I, there are ſome in Hell, and yet have done as much good perhaps as ever thou. Why is not the reaſoning of one ſide as

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57745:55"/>
to receive the ſentence of thy eternal doom, then thou wilt have ſuch miſs-givings in thy Conſcience; O! but what if it prove that my ſins be of another nature different from the ſins of the godly, if it prove ſo, I am undone, I am cut off for ever.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, in the ſecond place, what you have heard from this point, ſhould teach you to be very careful in the examining of your ſins, and in labouring to find out of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your ſins are: As we read in the Law, they were ſhut up when there was but a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that their diſeaſe was Lepotous: They were to be ſhut up for ſeven dayes upon meer ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: O that God would but give thee a heart, even to ſhut up thy ſelf, that is, to be thinking in thy reured Meditations, of what nature thy ſin is: It is uſual with thoſe that are godly; with the Children of God, to be afraid (upon any ſin they commit) that their ſin is not the ſin of Gods Children, you ſhall have them ready to ſay, Lord, did ever any of Gods Children do thus? is this ſuch an evil as can belong to a Child of God? is it poſſible that one that hath ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

ſtand with the truth of grace—Thou art ready to think that any thing may ſtand with the truth of grace, and with the ſtate of grace; but one that knows what ſin is, will be afraid of every thing; but moſt people are ſo confident, that they give ſatisfaction to themſelves in any way of wickedneſs: We have all our infirmities and there's an end; as if there were no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between one and another. O that God would cauſe this point to ring in thine ears, when thy Conſcience tells thee of thy ſin, that there is a great deal of difference between tho one and the other; and the truth is, till thou haſt upon examination found this out, that thou canſt with comfort, as in the preſence of God, ſay, that though I have infirmities and ſins, yet upon the examination of my heart, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe rules that have been given out in thy word, I ſee hope that my ſin is no other but the ſpot of Gods Children; and if it be ſo, then the</p>
               <p>Third Uſe is a Uſe of conſolation to all thoſe that have many infirmities, and are burdened with them: Thou haſt ſpots upon thee, and doſt thou find the behaviour of thy ſoul towards them, as heretofore thou haſt heard? be of good comfort in this, that there is no cauſe that thou ſhould raze the foundation upon every failing that thou ſeeſt to be in thy ſelf; this is a wrong to Jeſus Chriſt; and to the Covenant of grace,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57745:56"/>
for one that hath approved himſelf to God upon examination, and hath found the work of grace, upon every failing to raze the very foundation, and think, Surely all that I have done is nought, it's all nothing, it's all but hypocriſie: It's fit indeed for thee upon thy ſin, to examine, and to be humbled; let thy ſin be matter for thy humilation, but not matter for thy diſcouragement, not for the razing of the Foundation; to ſay, Well, I ſhall at length one day periſh by the hands of <hi>Saul;</hi> God will caſt me off at length, ſuch a wretched creature as I am; Take heed of that: Thoſe that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the way of the Goſpel, they know how to be deeply humbled for their ſin, and yet not to be diſcouraged by their ſin.</p>
               <p>And further, As thou ſhouldeſt not raze the Foundation, ſo thou ſhouldeſt not be afraid to come into Gods preſence. Thou haſt failed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, thou muſt come into Gods preſence, onely take heed of coming boldly, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, as many there are that abuſe the Grace of God, and think becauſe of Chriſt, they may come with impudence; no, the grace of Chriſt doth not at all hinder humiliation, but furthers humiliation, makes it Evangellical indeed; and ſo thou being humbled for thy ſin, thou mayeſt then come with an holy boldneſs into Gods preſence; do not think to fly the preſence of God, becauſe thou haſt ſinned and offended

and bleſs God for the Covenant that he hath made with thee in Chriſt, and the difference that God hath made between thee and others in this thing; magnifie his free grace in the Govenant of grace, for from thence is it that thy ſpot ſhall not be a deadly ſpot; and God will not deal with thee as with the wicked: certainly this is not from the nature of thy ſin, for that may be as hainous as the ſins of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that that makes the difference is the free-grace of God in Chriſt.

it be a means to ſet thy heart ſo much the more againſt ſin, to take heed of ſin: O take heed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing this grace of God: Here will be the ſign whether all this comfort belong to thee or no: If the more thou heareſt it, the more thy heart doth lothe ſin, and thou art the more afraid of ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this, thou doſt the more labour to bleanſe thy fleſh and ſpirit from all the poluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it. Canſt thou ſay thus as in the preſence of God: Lord, when I hear of theſe things, of that bleſſed grace of thine in the Goſpel, what a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference thou art pleaſed to make between one and the other; why, Lord, it breaks my heart, and it makes me more afraid of ſin than any thing in the World: Then thou mayeſt freely apply the comfort that is here, out of this Scripture.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, Let me ſpeak to thoſe to whom this Conſolation doth belong, That thou hadſt heed take heed to thy ſelf, that thou preſerveſt this thy conſolation; for without great care it will hardly be preſerved—I mean by that, this: Thou hadſt need take heed that thou keepeſt thy Conſcience as clean as may be, that thou mayeſt have a clear diſcerning of the difference of Gods dealing between one and the other.</p>
               <p>And therefore, take, heed firſt of any ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt light; hath ever God given thee that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to thy ſoul, that though thou haſt many fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet that God looks upon thee with another eye than upon the wicked?

O what an horrible ſpot is this, that thou ſhalt make the blood of Chriſt to be the cauſe of it, as far as thou canſt! that muſt be an abominable defilement when thou contracteſt filthineſs from the blood of Chriſt, and from the grace of God in the Goſpel. O this is the moſt dreadful ſpot of all ſpots whatſoever! the Lord rebuke thy wicked and curſed heart that ſhalt contract wickedneſs from hearing the Doctrine of free grace: Is there not reaſon of ſpeaking theſe things? for do not you ſee ſome that ſpeak more of free grace then ever they did, and yet more looſe then ever they were before? O theſe are ſpots in our Feaſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and in our converſe and communion; they are ſpots to a Chriſtian profeſſion, ſuch men and women as theſe are: for thy ſpots do not onely defile the own ſoul, but the name of God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. Thou doſt what in the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, to defile the very blood of Chriſt, and to defile the Covenant of grace; in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude 4.

abſolute notes and ſigns of a reprobate, but theſe are the two blackeſt. One is, God gives a man up to his hearts deſire in wicked wayes—And the other, is to turn the grace of God into wantoneſs. How vile are thoſe ſpots likewiſe, that men come now through the knowledg that they ſay they have of the Covenant of grace, to have no kind of work of conſcience upon them fortheir ſin? Now their Conſciences do not at all trouble them for their ſin, there's no kind of ſenſe at all upon them upon that account, and all becauſe of grace (as they ſay:) Well, that ſpot muſt needs be an irre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>coverable ſpot, that there's no ſenſe at all of.—And if it come to that, now thou canſt take liberty to ſin freely, and haſt no conſcience at all of this thy ſin, I ſay, thy ſpot is a moſt dreadful ſpot, and 'tis to be fear'd an irrecoverable ſpot; all the mercy of God that ſerves to help to eaſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers when they have committed their ſins, doth but plead againſt thee, to aggravate thy ſin—</p>
