            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TWELVE
QVERIES
Humbly preſented to the ſerious Conſideration of the High Court of
PARLIAMENT. About the two Soule-oppresſing yokes of a
Forced Maintenance and Miniſtry,
That have more oppreſſed the Conſciences of the Knowing and Godly People of this NATION, then all the
Tyranny either of the KING or BISHOPS beſide.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, whether it is warrantable for Magiſtrates to force all the People in a Nation, City or Town (ſome
of them being godly, others being not, yet diſcerned to be ſo) into one way of Church-communion, and
to ſubmit unto one and the ſame Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>2 Secondly, whether it is yea or no the duty of ſuch as feare the Lord in a Pariſh or Pariſhes neer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent,
to joyne themſelves together, to walke in Church-communion apart from thoſe that yet appeare
ungodly.</p>
            <p>3 Thirdly, whether it is the duty of ſuch a People to chooſe a Miniſter one or more, ſuch as they are perſwaded in
their Conſciences are faithfull, and able likewiſe to edifie and build them up, and alſo to inſtruct ſuch poore ſoules as ſhall
come in among them to heare.</p>
            <p>4 Fourthly, when a People are at the Charges to maintaine ſuch a Miniſtry. Whether it is not a great Oppreſſion to
force them to maintaine another Pariſh Miniſter, whether they judge him worthy or not.</p>
            <p>5 Fifthly, whether it is not a ſinne in Magiſtrates to force upon any people a Miniſter, of whom their Conſciences
are not ſatisfied: which if it were an evill in the Biſhops (as all our zealous Miniſters have ſaid) why then is it not as great
a ſinne in Magiſtrates now?</p>
            <p>6 Sixthly, whether it is according to the appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, for Magiſtrates to force from the People a
Maintenance for the Miniſtry; And if ſo, in what Text of Scripture it is to be found.</p>
            <p>7 Seventhly, whether it is a probable way or meanes to advance the Goſpel, to force a Maintenance for the Miniſtry,
or whether it is not rather a meanes whereby to foſter an Idle, Proud, and ſluggiſh Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>8 Eighthly, which be the moſt watchfull, Painfull, and Profitable Preachers at this day. Namely thoſe that have
nothing but by a voluntary Contribution, or thoſe that uſually goe to Law for maintenance.</p>
            <p>9 Ninthly, whether it can be expected that ſuch a Miniſtry will ever worke any effect upon the ſoules of ſuch as are
forced to maintain it againſt their wills.</p>
            <p>10 Tenthly, when a man can take a forc't Maintenance from him or them, on whom his Miniſtry never wrought ſo
far as to make them willing to give it. VVhether this doth not give juſt cauſe to doubt that this man ſeekes the Fleece ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the Flock. And whether a wiſe Man would not ſuffer hard things, rather then commit his ſoul, to the care of ſuch
a Miniſtry, or helpe to maintain it.</p>
            <p>11 Eleventhly, whether doth the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> in his third Chap. and fifth Verſ. deſcribe a true Miniſtry or no, in
theſe words: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord concerning the Prophets that make my people to erre, that bite with their teeth, and cry
peace, and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare warr againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12 Twelfthly, The Premiſes conſidered, whether it be not a duty incumbent upon the Magiſtrates (while the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
is in their hands) to breake the neck of thoſe Antichriſtian Yokes aforeſaid, &amp; the only way to glad the hearts of all
Gods people, and to be called the Repairers of Iſraels Breaches.</p>
