            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>AN ANSWER TO THE <hi>Caſe of Roger Price,</hi>
               </hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>AND TO</hi> The REASONS offered for Setling his Wife a Joynture out of the Mannor of <hi>Weſtbury,</hi> in the County of <hi>Bucks</hi> Humbly offered to the Conſideration of the PARLIAMENT, by Mr. <hi>George Price,</hi> the Second Son, Mr. <hi>Edward Price,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Ann Price,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Rebecca Brandreth,</hi> the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Roger Price,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Deceaſed.</head>
            <p>BY a Settlement of Marriage made the 25th of <hi>June,</hi> 1658. upon <hi>Roger Price</hi>
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Father, he had not power to make a Joynture to his Son's Wife out of the Mannor of <hi>Weſtbury,</hi> nor any part thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roger Price,</hi> the Father, could not by his Indenture dated the 8th of <hi>August.</hi> 1676, nor by his Will, dated 26th of <hi>August.</hi> 1676, ſettle the Mannor of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> or any part thereto belonging, to be a Joynture to his Son's Wife, by reaſon of the aforeſaid Marriage-Settlement. Beſides, he frequently declared to ſeveral perſons, That he had taken all the Care imaginable in his Settlements, and Will, that <hi>Weſtbury</hi> might not be a Joynture to any Wife. And in the ſaid Will he took particular care of his Heir, that not any of his younger Sons ſhould have his Portion, until he attained the Age of Twenty five years, nor Daughter till Twenty two, and if any of them dyed before he or ſhe attained ſuch age, his or her Portion to go to the Eldeſt Son.</p>
            <p>One of the Brothers <hi>Charles Price</hi> is ſince dead, and his Portion fell to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Brother.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Price</hi> the Father, upon making his Will in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1676, <note place="margin">☜</note> granted Nine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities (whereof Four are in being) out of <hi>Weſtbury,</hi> which if their Rights be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from them, will be the utter ruine of the Widows.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Price</hi> the Father left <hi>Roger</hi> his Son 310 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>per annum</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with power to make a Wife a Joynture thereof, which together with <hi>Roger</hi> the Sons Wife's Portion (which is alſo now in Lands) amounts to near 700 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>per annum,</hi> which is or may be ſetled as Joynture for his Wife, and afterwards as he pleaſes, for proviſion for his younger Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roger</hi> the Father ſetled 1500 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>per annum</hi> in Houſes in <hi>London,</hi> for the raiſing of his younger Childrens Portions out of the Profits of the Eſtate, 'tis eleven Years ſince his Death, ſo that the Sum of 16500 <abbr>l.</abbr> is, or might have been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, out of which 7500 <abbr>l.</abbr> hath been paid for the Portions of younger Children; and 'tis preſumed the over-plus is applied as a Proviſion for <hi>Roger</hi> the Son's younger Children, he having near 900 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>per annum</hi> in Lands at preſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Wife's Fortune to live upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roger</hi> the Son hath cut down Timber near to the value of 1500 <abbr>l.</abbr> in the Mannor of <hi>Weſtbury,</hi> within this five Years: Whereas by his Father's Will he ſhould have cut but 100 pounds worth yearly.</p>
            <p>This is the third time that <hi>Roger</hi> the Son hath attempted to obtain an Act of Parliament for the making of a Joynture out of <hi>Weſtbury;</hi> but the Bill hath been twice rejected. All the younger Brothers and Siſters of the now <hi>Roger Price,</hi> not ſo much regarding there Right in Remainderſhip to <hi>Weſtbury,</hi> as the Right of the Son and Heir of the ſaid <hi>Roger Price;</hi> this <hi>Weſtbury</hi> being all the Lands the Heir is like to have. Therefore they do humbly repreſent the Right of the Heir, and Widows, and Fatherleſs to this Honourable Parliament; and pray the Bill for ſetling a Joynture out of <hi>Weſtbury</hi> may be rejected.</p>
