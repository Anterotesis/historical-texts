            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

him; but they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the unregenerate. The dogs did eat the fleſh of Jezebel, 2. Kings 9.36. yet they licked the ſores of Lazarus, Luke 16.21. The ravens pick out the eyes of thoſe that are diſobedient to their parents, Prov. 30.17. yet they fed Elias in the wilderneſſe. 1. Kings 17.6.

Fifthly, they ſerve man, and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his will. The Lion will crouch to his keeper: the Elephant will be ruled and led about by a little dwarf: the Horſe yeelds his mouth to the bridle; the Ox his neck to the yoke; the Cow her dugs to our hands; the Sheep her wooll to the ſhearers.

               <p>Again, it is wonderfull in the numberleſſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Creatures which it containeth. This one word FIAT hath made

               <p>Firſt, for the profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of the ſea, (which is the diſtance between the bottom and <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the waters) it is of that immenſitie that in many places no line can touch it. The common received opinion that the depth of it being meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a plummet ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome exceeds two or three miles, is not to be underſtood (ſaith Breer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood a worthy writer) of the ſea in generall, but onely of the depth of the

               <p>Concerning the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of ſhipping, I find it to be Gods own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If God had not ſaid to Noah, <hi>Fac tibi arcam;</hi> and when he had ſaid ſo, if he had not given him a deſigne, a module, a platform of the Ark, we may doubt whether ever man would have thought of a means to paſſe from
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4317:67"/>
nation to nation, of a ſhip or any ſuch way of trade and commerce. This Ark reſting afterwards on the mountain of Ararat, gave a precedent to other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neare-bordering how ſhips were to be framed. Thus Navigation firſt taught by Almighty God, was afterwards ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the induſtrie of famous men in all ages.</p>
               <p>For the uſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of Navigation may be produced many arguments.<note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof.</note> The firſt and principall is the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of religion; How ſhould the Goſpel have been divulged through
