            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Herein therefore, as none is needed, so I shall make use of no Apology. But the consideration of some Circumstances (needless to be repeated) seem to render an account of the reason of my particular address unto You in this manner, necessary. This therefore I shall give, but briefly;</p>
                        <q>Ne longo sermone morer tua tempora —</q>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:50110:3"/>That which principally in this matter I resolved my thoughts into, was a design to answer my own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and desire, in Testifying a respectful Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to a Person who in a place of Eminency, hath given so fair an example of a singular conjunction in himself, of Civil Prudence, and all manner of useful Literature, with their mutual Subserviency unto each other; an endeavour whereof, the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of all Ages hath esteemed needfull, though few individuals have attained unto it. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a defect in Learning, hath tempted some, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Prudent and Wise in the Management of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, unto a contempt of it; and skill therein, hath given unto others a mistaken confidence, that it alone is sufficient for all the ends of Humane Life, an Industrious Attempt, for a furnishment of the Mind with a due mixture of them both, hath been greatly Neglected, to the no small disadvantage of Humane Affairs. It cannot therefore seem strange, nor ought any to be offended, that one who dares profess a great Honour unto, and Admiration of both these Endowments of the mind of Man, should express them with that respect, which alone he is capable to give, unto Him, who in a Place of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Trust and Employment, hath given a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar instance of their happy conjunction, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Coalesce in the same mind, to enable it unto a regular and steady pursuit of their common ends. Whether I shall by this address attain that end, or no, I know not; but this is that which principally I aimed at therein: And to the Reason whereof I leave the Judgement of my undertakings. But yet I may not omit, that your favour hath also given
<pb facs="tcp:50110:3"/>
me particular grounds for this confidence; and such as have been prevalent against those impressions of discouragements, which I am naturally very liable to admit of, and receive. Your Candid Esteem of some former Endeavours in this kind (and which when carried without the Verge of those Lines of Communication, within whose compass Men and their Writings are Judged by Party and scarce otherwise, have received a fair acceptance in the world) were no small encouragement unto me, not to desert those wearisome Labours, which have no other Reward or End, but the furtherance of Publick Good; especially having this only way left me to serve the Will of God, and the Interest of the Church, in my Generation. It was also through the countenance of your Favour, that this and some other Treatises have received Warrant to pass freely into the world; which though I am uncertain of what advantage they may be unto any, by reason of their own defects, and the prejudices of others; yet I want not the highest Security, that there is nothing in them tending to the least disadvantage unto those, whose concernment lyes in Peace and Truth in these Nations.</p>
                        <p>For the Treatises themselves, which I desire here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to represent to some of your Leisure hours, I shall not offend against the Publick Service, in detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with an account of them.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thou intendest to engage any part of thy time in the perusal of the ensuing <hi>Discourses</hi> and <hi>Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it may not be amiss to take along with thee the consideration of some things concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and aim of their Author, in the Writing and present publishing of them, which are here proposed unto thee. It is now sundry years since I purposed in my self, if God gave life and opportunity, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, according to the measure of the Gift re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, an <hi>Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews.</hi> A Subject this was, I then knew, and now acknowledge, much laboured in by many eminent and learned men, both of old and of late. In particular, some entire Commentaries, composed with good judgment, and to very good purpose, have been published in our own Language. Yea, from him who first began a serious Exposition of this Epistle, and whom none in all things have to this day exceeded, there have passed few ages wherein some or other have not endeavoured the Explication of it. And this also hath been done by men of all sorts and parties, of all perswasions and Opinions in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion; an account of whose several endeavours shall else-where be given. Somewhat there was of encouragement unto me in my designed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and somewhat of quite another tendency in this consideration. The help which I might receive from the sedulous labours of so many learned men, and those in Times, Places, Principles, distant and distinguished from each other; as also managing their common design with great variety as to particular intentions; I looked on as a matter of no small advantage unto me. Some I found had <hi>critically</hi> examined many of the Words, Phrases and Expressions of the Writer; some compared his <hi>Quotations</hi> with the places in the Old Testament from whence they are taken. Some had endeavoured an <hi>Analysis</hi> of the several Discourses of the Author, with the nature and force of the Arguments insisted on by him. The labours of some were to improve the Truths contained in the Epistle unto <hi>Practice;</hi> others have collected the difficulties which they observed therein, and
<pb facs="tcp:50110:5"/>
scanned them in a <hi>Scholastical</hi> way, with Objections and Solutions after their manner. Others had an especial design unto the <hi>Places,</hi> whose sense is controverted amongst the several Parties at variance in Christian Religion; all in their way and manner endeavouring to give light to the intentions of the Holy Ghost, either in particular passages, or in the whole Epistle. The helps and advantages in the investigation of the mind of God, which by their labours might be obtained, I looked on as a great encouragement to undertake the same work with them, and to promote the light of truth thereby. But on the other side, no small ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto the whole work and design did hence also arise. For it might seem to some altogether needless to ingage in that, which so many had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gone through with, to the great profit and edification of the Church. And nothing can or ought more justly to weaken and take off the resolution of any in this kind of endeavours, than that they are needless. For what ever is so, will also thereby be useless, and because useless, burthensome. This consideration, I confess, did for a long time deter me from executing my purpose, of casting my Mite into this Sanctuary. But yet after I had made a through perusal of all the Comments, Expositions, Annotations, or Observations on the Epistle, which by any means I could obtain, I returned again upon sundry considerations unto my former thoughts and resolutions. For, first, I found the excellency of the Writing to be such, the depths of the Mysteries contained in it to be so great, the compass of the truth asserted unfolded and explained so extensive and diffused through the whole body of Christian Religion, the usefulness of the things delivered in it so important, and indispensibly necessary, as that I was quickly satisfied, that the Wisdom, Grace and Truth treasured in this sacred Store-house, are so far from being exhausted and fully drawn forth by the endeavours of any, or all that are gone before us, or from being all perfectly brought forth to light by them, as that I was assured that there was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eft a sufficient ground and foundation, not only for renewed investigation after rich Branches in this Mine for the present Generation, but for all them that shall succeed unto the consummation of all things. For if we find it thus in Humane Sciences, that no Ability, no Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, no Combination of the most happy Wits for their improvement in former Ages, hath precluded the way unto persons of Ingenuity and Learning, to adde considerably in several kinds unto their respective advancement; nor shall the sedulity of this present Age in the furtherance and adorning of them, be ever able to bring them unto any such perfection, as to condemn succeeding Generations unto the slothful and servile drudgery of the meer perusal of their Dictates and Prescriptions, and so by the use of their <hi>Inventions</hi> leave unto others only that of their memory? how much more must we grant the same in things Divine, and the spiritual knowledge of them, whose stores in this life are absolutely inexhaustible, and whose depths are not fully to be fathomed. Again it is evident, that the principal things asserted and taught in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> such as is the Doctrine of the <hi>Person</hi> and the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Jesus Christ, have received a more eager and subtil opposition, since the labours and endeavours of the most in the Exposition of it, than they had done before. And as this renders the vindication of the places wherein they are taught and asserted, necessary, so it is not unknown unto those who are conversant in these kinds of studies, what advantage may be obtained in the investigation of truth by the opposition that is made unto it; especially when that Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is managed with a curious search into every <hi>word</hi> and syllable which may seem to give countenance unto it, as also in the sifting of every tittle

and particle that stands in its way; which course of procedure, the enemies of the Truths mentioned, have with much art and industry engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into. But that which most of all took off the weight of the discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that arose from the multiplied endeavours of learned Men in this kind, was an Observation, that all of them being intent on the sense of the words, as absolutely considered, and the use of them to the present Church, had much over-looked the direct respect and regard that the Author had in the writing of this Epistle to the then past, present, and future condition of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> or Church of the Jews. Looking at these things as dead and buried, of no use in the present state of the Church, they did either wholly neglect them, or pass them over in a light and perfunctory manner. Nor indeed had many of them, though otherwise excellently well qualified, a competency of skill for the due consideration of things of that nature. But yet those that shall seriously and with judgment consider the design of the Writer of this Epistle, the time wherein he wrote it, the proper end for which it was composed, the subject matter treated of in it, the principles he proceeds upon, and his manner of arguing, will easily perceive, that without a serious consideration of them, it is not possible to come to a right comprehension (in many things) of the mind of the Holy Ghost therein. Many Principles of Truth he takes for granted, as acknowledged amongst the <hi>Hebrews</hi> during their former Church state, and makes them a foundation for his own Superstructure; many Customs, Vsages, Ordinances, Institutions, received sense of places of Scripture amongst the Jews, he either produceth or reflects upon, and one way or other makes use of the whole <hi>Mosaical Oeconomy</hi> or <hi>System</hi> of Divine Worship under the Law, unto his own purpose. The common neglect of these things, or slight transaction of them in most <hi>Expositors,</hi> was that which principally relieved me from the fore-mentioned discouragement. And this also was that which at length gave rise unto those <hi>Exercitations,</hi> which take up the greatest part of the ensuing Book. Some of them are indeed indispensibly due to the work it self. Such are those which concern the <hi>Canonical Authority</hi> of the Epistle, the <hi>Writer</hi> of it, the <hi>Time</hi> of its writing, the <hi>Phraseology</hi> of the Author, with the way he proceeds in the <hi>Quotations</hi> of Testimonies out of the Old Testament, and some other of the same tendency; the residue of them were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned meerly by the consideration before insisted on. Some great Principles I observed, that the Apostle supposed, which he built all his arguings and exhortations upon, not directly proving or confirming the Principles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but as taking them for granted; partly from the faith of the <hi>Judaical Church,</hi> and partly from the <hi>New Revelation</hi> of the Gospel, which those to whom he wrote did as yet admit of, and avow. Such were these, <hi>That there was a Messiah promised from the foundation of the world, to be a Spiritual Redeemer of Mankind. That this Messiah was come, and had performed and accomplished the work assigned unto him for the end of their Redemption. That Jesus of Nazareth was this Messiah.</hi> Not one line in the whole Epistle, but is in an especial manner resolved into these Principles, and deduced from them. These therefore I found it necessary to examine and confirm, to unfold, vindicate, and declare, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence unto the Apostles discourse might be manifest, and his arguing from them be understood. It is true, I have so handled them, as all along to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Opinions of the incredulous <hi>Apostate Jews</hi> about them, and to vindicate them from the exceptions of their greatest Masters, of old and of late. But he that shall look on these Considerations and Discourses as a matter only of <hi>Controversie with the Jews,</hi> will but evidence his own weakness
<pb facs="tcp:50110:6"/>
and Ignorance in things of this Nature. Who knows not that they are the very fundamental Principles of our Christian Profession; and which because of that opposition that is made unto them, ought to be frequently inculcated and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed. And if Learned Men find it in this day Necessary for them to dispute for, to prove and vindicate the very Principles of <hi>Natural Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> the Being and Attributes of God, the truth whereof hath left indelible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of it self upon the minds of all the Children of Men; how much more Necessary must it needs be, to endeavour the confirmation and re-inforcement of these grand Principles of Supernatural Revelation, which have no contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of evidence from the inbred inexpugnable light of Nature, and yet are no less indispensibly Necessary unto the future condition of the souls of Men, than those others are. I am not therefore without hope, that the handling of them, as it was necessary unto my design, so it will not be unacceptable unto the Candid Reader. For what is mixed in our Discourses of them concerning <hi>Judaical</hi> Customs, Opinions, Practices, Expositions, Interpretations of Promises, Traditions and the like, will not I hope give distaste unto any, unless it be such as being Ignorant of them, and unacquainted with them, will choose so to continue, rather than be instructed by them, whom they would by no means have supposed to be in any thing more knowing than themselves. I doubt not therefore, but our endeavours on that subject, will be able to secure their own sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to their usefulness, both by the importance of the Matter treated of in them, as also from the Necessity of laying them as a sure Foundation unto the ensuing Exposition of the Epistle it self.</p>
                  <p>Besides these general principles, there are also sundry other things belonging to the <hi>Mosaical</hi> order and frame of Divine Worship, which the Apostle either directly treateth of, or one way or other improves unto his own peculiar design. This also he doth sometimes directly and intentionally, and sometimes <hi>in transitu,</hi> reflecting on them, and as it were only calling them to mind, leaving the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to the Consideration of what concerning them, they had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly instructed in. Such is the whole Matter of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Law, of the Tabernacle, and Utensils of it, of the Old Covenant, of the giving of the Law, the Commands, Precepts, and Sanctions of it in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and I breatnings, Rewards and Punishments. Hereunto also he adds a remembrance of the Call of <hi>Abraham,</hi> with the state and condition of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from thence unto the giving of the Law, with sundry things of the like nature. Without a competent comprehension of, and acquaintance with these things, and their relation to the Will and Worship of God, it is altogether in vain for any one to imagine, that they may arrive unto any clear understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mind of the Holy Ghost in this portion of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Now as I had observed, that the Consideration and Explanation of them had been too much neglected by the generality of Expositors, so I quickly found, that to insist at large upon them, and according as their weight doth deserve, in the particular places, wherein the Mention of them doth occurr, would too often, and too much divert me from the pursuit of the especial design of the Apostle in those places and disenable the <hi>Reader</hi> from carrying on the tendency of the whole in the perusal of it. To prevent both which inconveniencies, I fixed upon the course the Reader will find insisted on; namely, to handle them all severally, and apart, in previous <hi>Exercitations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having given this general Account of my design and purpose in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Discourses; some few requests unto the Reader shall absolve him from farther attendance in this entrance. First, I must beg his Candid Intepreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reporting of some of those <hi>Jewish Fables</hi> and <hi>Traditions</hi> which he
<pb facs="tcp:50110:6"/>
will meet withall in some of the <hi>Exercitations.</hi> I could plead <hi>Necessity,</hi> and Vse; and those such as will evince themselves in the several places and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the Discourses where they are reported. For they are none of them nakedly produced, to satisfie the Curiosity of any; but either the investigation of some truth hidden under them, and involved in them, or the discovery of their rise and occasion, or the laying open of the folly of the pretences of the present <hi>Jews</hi> in their unbelief, doth still accompany their recital. However, I will not rigidly justifie the production of all and every of them, but put it amongst those things, wherein the <hi>Candour of the Reader</hi> may have an opportunity to exercise it self. I must beg also of the <hi>Learned Reader</hi> a consideration of the state and condition, wherein through the good Providence of God I have been, during the greatest part of the time wherein these <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations</hi> were written and Printed; and I shall pray in requital of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that he may never know by Experience, what Impressions of failings, mistakes, and several defects in exactness, uncertainties, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reights and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from the use of Books will bring and leave upon endeavours of this kind. And what ever defects they may meet withal, or complain of in these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, my design was through the blessing of God, that they should have no cause to complain of want of diligence and industry in me. But yet I am sensible in the issue that many things may seem to represent that carelesness of mind, or precipitancy in writing, which is altogether unmeet to be imposed on Men in this knowing age. But what ever other reflections I may be obnoxious unto, for the want of Ability and Judgement, which in me are very small in reference to so great an undertaking, I must crave of the Reader, to believe, that I would not willingly be guilty of so much importune confidence, as to impose upon him things trite, crude, and undigested, which either ordinary pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might have concealed, or ordinary diligence have amended. What ever therefore of that kind may appear unto him, I would crave, that it may be laid upon the account of the condition which I have intimated before.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Epistle</hi> it self, whereof I have given here a <hi>Specimen in the two first Chapters,</hi> I confess, as was said before, that I have had thoughts for many years to attempt something in it, and in the whole course of my Studies have not been without some regard thereunto. But yet I must now say, that after all searching and Reading, Prayer and Assiduous Meditation on the Text, have been my only reserve, and for most useful means of Light and Assistance. By these have my thoughts been freed from many and many an entanglement, which the Writings of others on the same subject, had either cast me into, or could not deliver me from. Careful I have been, as of my life and soul, to bring no prejudicate sense unto the words, to impose no meaning of my own, or other Mens upon them, nor to be imposed on by the reasonings, pretences, or Curiosities of any; but alwayes went nakedly to the word it self, to learn humbly the mind of God in it, and to express it as he should enable me. To this end, I alwayes in the first place considered the sense, meaning, and importance of the <hi>words</hi> of the Text, and the consideration of their Original Derivation, use in other Authors, especially in the <hi>LXX.</hi> of the Old Testament, in the Books of the New, particularly, the Writings of the same Author, was constantly made use of, to that purpose. Oft times the words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed out of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or the things alluded unto amongst that people, I found to give much light into the words of the Apostle themselves. Unto the general rule of attending unto the design and scope of the place, subject treated of, <hi>mediums</hi> fixed on for Arguments, Methods of Ratiocination, I still kept in my eye the Time and <hi>Season</hi> of Writing this Epistle, the state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb facs="tcp:50110:7"/>
of them to whom it was wrote, their Perswasions, Prejudices, Customs, Light and Traditions, the Covenant and Worship of the Church of old, the Translation of Covenant Priviledges and Worship over unto the Gentiles upon a new account, the course of Providential Dispensations that the people were under, the near expiration of their Church and State, with the speedy approaching of their utter abolition and destruction, with the Temptations that befell them on all these various acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>unts; Without which, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for any one Justly to follow the <hi>Apostle,</hi> so as to keep close to his design, or fully to understand his mind and meaning. If any shall think, that I have referred too many things unto the Customs and Vsages of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and looked too much after some guidance in sundry Expressions and Discourses of the Apostle from them; I only Answer, that as when I am convinced by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar instances of mistakes therein, I shall willingly acknowledge them: so for the present I am satisfied, that other Expositors have had much too little regard thereunto. The Exposition of the Text is attended with an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Practical Observations,</hi> answering the great end for which the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle was committed over to all Generations for the use of the Church. If in some of them I shall seem to any to have been too Prolix, I must only An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that having no other way to serve the Edification of the Generality of Christians, I thought not so. Yet to prevent their farther Objections on that account, I intend, that if ever any addition in the same work be prepared for publick view, to regulate my proceedings therein, according as I shall have account from Persons of Learning and Godliness, concerning that course of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, which they esteem to tend most to the good and edification of the Church of God, to whose Judgement I heartily submit these and all other endeavours of the like kind, whereunto I have been, or yet may be called.</p>

What would it advantage him or the cause which some pretend he <hi>favoured,</hi> by reporting the opposition of others to a part of <hi>divine writt</hi> which himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted! Besides they were not the <hi>Arians</hi> of the first rank or edition, for an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto whom <hi>Eusebius</hi> is suspected, but some of their off-spring which fell out into such Sacrilegious opinions and practices as the first leaders of them owned not that are accused in this matter; much less can he be thought to design the reproach of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> Nay these answers are inconsistent, as any one may perceive. He could not at the same time design the rejecting of the <hi>Epistle</hi> in complyance with the <hi>Arians,</hi> and the <hi>calumniating</hi> of them by whom it was rejected, and on whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority his intentions must be founded. But indeed his words plainly manifest that he gives us a naked account of matter of fact, without either prejudice or design: It is yet more incredible, that <hi>Hierome</hi> in this matter should suffer himself to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on by <hi>Eusebius.</hi> That he was the most eminently learned and knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Latine Church</hi> in those dayes, will, I suppose, not be greatly questioned. Now to suppose that he knew not the customes, opinions, and practice of that Church, but would suffer himself to be imposed on by a <hi>stranger,</hi> destitute of those advantages which he had to come unto an unquestionable certainty in it, is a very fond thing. Besides he doth not any where speak as one that reported the words and Judgement of another, but in <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> places expresly affirms it as of his own knowledge; when at the same time in opposition thereunto, he contends that it was received by all other Churches in the world, and all Writers from the dayes of the Apostles.</p>

                     </note> that the <hi>Latine Church</hi> did ever <hi>reject</hi> this Epistle.

But these two things I allow, on the testimonies insisted on. (1.) That sundry particular persons of note and esteem in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> owned not the <hi>Canonical</hi> authority of this Epistle, as not esteeming it written by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul:</hi> (2.)

For it seems utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that if any such <hi>Judgement</hi> had passed, or testimony been given, that <hi>Hierome</hi> living in the midst of that Church, should know nothing of it, but so often affirm the contrary without haesitation. And this undenyably evinceth the injustice of some mens pretensions, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is the only proposer of <hi>Canonical</hi> Scripture, and that upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of her proposal alone it is to be received. <hi>Four hundred years</hi> were passed before she her self publickly received this <hi>Epistle,</hi> or read it in her Assemblies; so far was she from having proposed it unto others. And yet all this while was it admitted and received by all other Churches in the world,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50110:11"/>
as <hi>Hierom</hi> testifies, and that from the dayes of the Apostles, whose judgement the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> it self at length submitted unto.</p>
                  <p>No impeachment then of the <hi>Authority</hi> of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> can be taken from this defect and inadvertency of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> it being convinced to be so by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>suffrage</hi> and Testimony of all other Churches in the world, from the dayes of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> as we shall afterwards more fully declare. Neither are the occasions of this haesitation of the <hi>Western Church</hi> obscure; The <hi>Epistle</hi> was written it may be in <hi>Rome,</hi> at least it was in some part of <hi>Italy, Chap.</hi> 13.24. There no doubt it was <hi>seen,</hi> and it may be <hi>Copied</hi> out before its sending, by some who used to accompany the Apostle, as <hi>Clemens,</hi> who as we have shewed not long after mentioned divers things contained in it. The <hi>Originall</hi> was without question speedily sent into <hi>Judea,</hi> unto the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to whom it was written and directed, as were all others of the <hi>Epistles</hi> of the same Apostle unto those Churches that were immediately intended and concerned in them. That <hi>Copies</hi> of it were by them also communicated unto their <hi>Brethren</hi> in the <hi>East,</hi> equally concerned in it with themselves, cannot be doubted, unless we will suppose them grosly negligent in their duty towards God and man, which we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to do. But the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> living at that time, and for some while after, if not in a <hi>seperation,</hi> yet in a <hi>distinction</hi> by reason of some peculiar observances from the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> especially those of the <hi>West,</hi> they were not it may be very forward in communicating this <hi>Epistle</hi> unto them, being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as they supposed, about an especial concernment of their own. By this means this <hi>Epistle</hi> seems to have been kept much within the Compass of the Churches of the <hi>Jews,</hi> untill after the destruction of the <hi>Temple</hi>; when by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersion, and <hi>coalescency</hi> with other Churches in the <hi>East,</hi> it came to be generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived amongst them; and <hi>non solum ab Ecclesiis orientis, sed ab omnibus retro Ecclesiis &amp; Graeci sermonis Scriptoribus,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> speaks. But the <hi>Latin Church</hi> having lost that advantage of receiving it upon its first writing,<note place="margin">Epist. ad Dardan.</note> it may be also upon the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the removall of its peculiar Argument, upon the finall destruction of the whole <hi>Judaical</hi> Church, and Worship, was somewhat <hi>slow</hi> in their inquiry after it. Those that succeeded in that Church, it is not unlikely, had their <hi>scruples</hi> increased, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they found it not in <hi>common</hi> use amongst their Predecessors, like to the rest of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls Epistles</hi>; not considering the occasion thereof. Add hereunto that by that time it had <hi>gradually</hi> made its progress in its return into the <hi>West,</hi> where it was first written, and attended with the Suffrage of all the <hi>Eastern Churches</hi> began to evince its own Authority, sundry persons who were wrangling about peculiar opinions and practices of their own, began to seek advantages from some <hi>expressions</hi> in it. So did in particular the <hi>Novatians</hi> and the <hi>Donatists.</hi> This might possibly increase the <hi>scruple</hi> amongst the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and make them wary in their admission of that Authority which they found pleaded against them. And well was it for them, that their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about which they disagreed with their Adversaries, were according unto truth, seeing it may justly be feared, that some then would have made them their <hi>Rule</hi> and Standard in their reception or rejection of this Epistle: for it was no new thing for the <hi>Orthodox</hi> themselves to make bold sometime with the Scripture, if they supposed it to run cross unto their conceptions.

Irenaeus <hi>useth this Testimony in his Book against Heresies, for their confutation, who affirmed that Christ took flesh only in appearance; but the Orthodox,</hi> (or Catholicks) <hi>being afraid</hi> (of the importance of that expression) <hi>took away that word out of the Copies, not understanding its use and sense.</hi> So also <hi>Sixtus Sinensis</hi> after he hath informed us, out of <hi>Hilary,</hi> that many <hi>Orthodox</hi> persons denyed the story of our <hi>Saviours Agony,</hi> and bloody Sweat, adds of his own, <hi>Suspicor à Catholicis sublatam esse, pio sed simplici zelo, quod favere videbatur Arianis. I suspect that the Story was taken out of the Copies, by some Catholicks, out of a godly, but simple zeal, because it seemed to favour the</hi> Arians. So great is the power of prejudice, and so little occasions have men taken, whom others have esteemed <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>pious,</hi> to make bold with that word, whereby both we and all our opinions must be judged.

The matter is more certain concerning <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Erasmus:</hi> the former in his <hi>Preface</hi> unto, the other in his last <hi>Annotation</hi> on this Epistle, denying it to be S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and questioning, yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed rejecting its <hi>Canonicall</hi> Authority.

These are the <hi>chief,</hi> if not absolutely all, who have at any time made any <hi>scruple</hi> at the <hi>Authority</hi> of this Epistle. The reasons they make use of to justifie themselves in their conjectures, are amassed together by <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his Note on the 24. Verse of the <hi>last Chapter</hi> of it: But because he mixeth together the Arguments that he insists on to prove S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> not to have been the Penman of it, and the exceptions he puts in unto its <hi>Canonicall Authority,</hi> which are things of a diverse consideration, I shall separate them, and first take out those that seem <hi>absolutely</hi> to impeach its <hi>Authority</hi>; leaving them that oppose its <hi>Penman,</hi> to our ensuing Discourse on that question in particular.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>18</label> The first thing generally pleaded, is the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of its Author or Penman. <hi>Sola omnium Pauli nomen non praefert,</hi> saith <hi>Erasmus.</hi> How unjust and groundless this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is, we shall afterwards fully manifest. At present I shall only shew, that it is in <hi>generall</hi> of no importance in this cause. The <hi>Author</hi> of a Writing being certainly known, may indeed give some light unto the nature and Authority of it; When it is confessed, that the <hi>Penman</hi> of any Book was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <hi>divinely inspired,</hi> and that by him it was written for the use of the Church, there can be no question of its Authority. But this last of his design directed by the Holy Ghost, must be no less known than the former. For a man may write <hi>one</hi> Book by inspiration, and <hi>others</hi> by a fallible humane Judgement; as <hi>Solomon</hi> seems to have done his <hi>Philosophicall</hi> Discourses that are lost. Again, when the Penman of any Writing pretending unto Divine Authority is not esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor doth manifest himself in any thing to have been <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>immediately acted by the Holy Ghost,</hi> the writing it self must needs be lyable unto just Exception. Wherefore it is confessed, that when the Author of any Writing is <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known,</hi> much light into its Authority and Relation unto the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture may be thence received. But when this is <hi>doubtfull,</hi> nothing can thence <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> on either side be concluded. And therefore it hath pleased the Holy Ghost to keep the names of the <hi>Penmen</hi> of many parts of the Scripture, in everlasting obscurity; for he borrows no Countenance or Authority unto any thing that proceeds by <hi>Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from himself, from the names of men. There is not then the least strength in this exception; for be it granted, that we are altogether uncertain who was the <hi>Penman</hi> of this Epistle, yet no impeachment of its Authority can thence be taken, unless it can be proved, that he was not <hi>Divinely inspired.</hi> But yet to shew the insufficiency every way of this Objection, we shall abundantly evince, that indeed the very <hi>ground</hi> and foundation of it is feeble and false; The Penman of this <hi>Epistle</hi> being as well and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known, as those of any portion of Scripture whatever that are <gap reason="foreign">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>19</label> The remaining Objections are more <hi>particular,</hi> and direct to their purpose, by whom they are pleaded. As <hi>First,</hi> that the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Epistle</hi> cites sundry things out of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> which are not therein contained. Such are many of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> related unto in the 11. <hi>Chapter,</hi> and that in particular in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>verse</hi> 21. where he affirms, that <hi>Moses</hi> upon the Terror of the sight that appeared unto him, said, <hi>I exceedingly quake and tremble.</hi> This place <hi>Erasmus</hi> supposeth <hi>Hierom</hi> to have intended, when he sayes that some things are mentioned in this <hi>Epistle</hi> that are not recorded in the <hi>Old</hi> Testament. And <hi>Aquinas</hi> perplexeth himself in seeking for a Solution unto this difficulty. For <hi>First,</hi> he would refer the place to <hi>Moses</hi> sight of the <hi>Angell</hi> in the <hi>Bush,</hi> and not the giving of the Law, contrary to the express Discourse of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. And then, he adds, <hi>dixit saltem facto;</hi> though he <hi>said</hi> not so, yet he <hi>did</hi> so. And lastly, worst of all <hi>vel fortè Apostolus aliâ utitur literâ quam nos non habemus: or it may be the Apostle used another Text that we have not</hi>: But there is no need of any of these evasions. The <hi>Author</hi> quotes no <hi>Book,</hi> nor <hi>Testimony</hi> of the Old Testament, but only
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50110:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
relates a matter of fact, and one circumstance of it, which doubtless he had by Divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> whereof there is no express mention in the place where the whole matter is <hi>Originally</hi> recorded. Thus in the beginning of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> sundry particular Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, (as that about the <hi>Children of Ephraim,</hi> Chap. 7.21.) no where before written, are reported from the same infallible directions that others of the same time were written withall, when they were omitted. And it is uncouth way of proving an <hi>Author</hi> not to write by <hi>Divine inspiration,</hi> because he writeth Truths that he could no otherwise be acquainted withall. Neither is it unmeet for him that writes by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inspiration,</hi> to mention things recorded in other Stories, whose <hi>Truth</hi> is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable, as those are related unto <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>It seems to be of more importance, that if the <hi>Objectors</hi> may be believed, the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>20</label> Writer of this <hi>Epistle</hi> citeth Testimonies out of the Old Testament, <hi>that are no wayes to his purpose,</hi> nor at all prove the matter that he produceth them for; discovering at least, that he wrote with a <hi>fallible spirit,</hi> if not also that he dealt scarcely <hi>bona fide,</hi> in handling the cause which he undertook. <hi>Cajetan</hi> insists on that of the <hi>first Chapter, verse</hi> 5. <hi>I will be unto him a Father, and he shall be unto me a Son,</hi> taken from the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14. or 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> which words, as he supposeth no way belong unto that, in whose confirmation they are produced by the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Epistle. Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> upon his Testimony in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. produced out of <hi>Psalm</hi> 8.4, 5. which as he saith, is urged to the direct <hi>contrary</hi> of the intention of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> and scope of the words. <hi>Eniedinus</hi> insists on the same places and others.</p>
                  <p>Now two things must be supposed to give countenance unto this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. First, That <hi>those who make it,</hi> do better understand the meaning and the importance of the Testimonies so produced out of the Old Testament; than he did by whom they are here alledged. This is the foundation of this Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which if once admitted, it may be easily imagined, how <hi>able</hi> some men will quickly think themselves to question other <hi>allegations</hi> in the New Testament, and thereby render the Authority of the whole dubious. They must, I say, take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves to know the <hi>true meaning</hi> of them, and that in the uttermost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of signification and intention, as given out by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> before they can charge their <hi>misapplication</hi> on this Author. How vain, unjust, arrogant, and presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptious this supposition is, needs little labour to demonstrate. The understandings of men, are a very sorry measure of the Truth, with the whole sense and intendment of the Holy Ghost in every place of Scripture. Nay, it may much more <hi>rationally</hi> be supposed, that though we all know <hi>enough</hi> of the mind and will of God in the whole Scripture, to guide and regulate our faith and obedience, yet that we are rather ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his <hi>utmost</hi> intention in <hi>every</hi> place, than that we know it in <hi>all.</hi> There is a <hi>depth</hi> and breadth in every word of God, because his; which we are not able to fathom and compass to the utmost: It being enough for us that we may infallibly apprehend so much of his mind and will, as is <hi>indispensably</hi> necessary for us to the obedience that he requires at our hands. An humble reverential Consideration of all, indeed almost any, of the Testimonies alledged in the <hi>New</hi> Testament out of the old, is sufficient to evince the truth of this Consideration, We <hi>know but in part,</hi> and we <hi>prophesie</hi> in part, 1 Cor. 13.9. <hi>Quantum est quod nescimus?</hi> how much is it, that we know not? or as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>how small is the word that</hi> we understand of God? <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.24. One sayes well; <hi>est Sacra Scriptura veluti fons quidam, in bono terrae loco scaturiens, quem quo altius foderis, eo magis exuberantem invenies; ita quo diligentius Sacram Scripturam interpretaris, eo abundantiores aquae vivae venas reperies. Brent. Hom. 36. in</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. That Objection then, must needs be very <hi>weak,</hi> whose fundamental strength consists in so vain a presumption. Again, they must take it for granted, that they are afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand fully acquainted with the particular intention of the <hi>Author</hi> in the Assertions which he produceth these <hi>Testimonies</hi> in the Confirmation of; and with all the wayes of arguing and pressing Principles of faith, used by men writing by Divine inspiration.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this <hi>supposition</hi> less rash, or presumptious than the former. Men, who bring their own <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and <hi>preconceived</hi> senses unto the Scripture, with a desire to have them cofirmed, are apt to make such conclusions. Those that come with humility and reverence of his Majesty with whom they have to do, to learn from him his mind and will therein, whatever he shall thereby reveal so to be, will have other thoughts and apprehensions. Let men but suffer the <hi>Testimonies</hi> and <hi>Assertions,</hi> whose unsuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is pretended, to explain one another, and the agreement will quickly appear. And the worst that will ensue, will be only the <hi>emergence</hi> of a sense from them which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50110:13"/>
perhaps they understood not in either of them singly, or <hi>separately</hi> considered. Thus infirm on all accounts is this Objection. For the <hi>instances</hi> themselves; some light will be given unto them from what we shall afterwards discourse of the <hi>Authors</hi> wayes and <hi>Principles,</hi> that he proceeds upon in his Citations of Testimonies out of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in particular in our Exposition of the places themselves, we shall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that his Application of them, is every way suitable to the very letter of the <hi>Text,</hi> and manifest intention of the Holy Ghost: So false and unjust, as well as rash and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptious, is this Objection.</p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>21</label> Neither is there any more <hi>reall weight,</hi> in that which <hi>Erasmus</hi> in the next place ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; namely that some things in it seem to give Countenance unto some exploded Opinions of <hi>Antient Hereticks</hi>; whereof he gives us a double instance. First, <hi>Quod ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum seperans sanctum sanctorum interpretatur coelum: that he interprets the Vail separating the Most Holy Place to be Heaven:</hi> which indeed he neither doth, but only affirms that the <hi>Most Holy Place</hi> in the Tabernacle, was a Type or Figure of Heaven it self, nor if he should have so done, had he given the least countenance unto the fondness of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees,</hi> whom I suppose he intendeth; His whole Discourse perfectly exploding their abominations. His other Instance is in that <hi>vexed place, chap.</hi> 6.6. favouring as he pretends the <hi>Novatians,</hi> denying <hi>recovery by repentance</hi> unto them who had fallen into sin after <hi>Baptism.</hi> But the incompetency of this Objection, rising meerly from their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the true meaning of the Holy Ghost that made it, as for the end for which it was used, hath been demonstrated by many of <hi>old</hi> and late. And the Lord assisting in our Exposition of that place, we shall shew, that it is so far from giving Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unto any <hi>error</hi> or mistake which any man may fall into, contrary to the Gospel, that a more plain, familiar and wholesome <hi>commination</hi> is hardly to be found in the whole Book of God. And this is the <hi>summ</hi> of what I can meet withall, that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against the <hi>Canonical Authority</hi> of this Epistle; which how little it amounts unto, beyond an evidence of mens willingness to lay hold on slight occasions to vent their <hi>Curiosities</hi> and Conceptions, the <hi>Reader</hi> that is godly and wise will quickly perceive.</p>

And such is the Argument of this Epistle; It treats of things which <hi>eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,</hi> nor have they by any natural means, ever entered into the heart of man; and that in absolute Harmony with all other unquestionable Revelations of the Will of God. Now if the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <hi>Original</hi> hereof be not from God, that is by the <hi>inspiration</hi> of the Holy Ghost; then it must be either the invention of some man, <hi>spinning</hi> the whole <hi>Webb</hi> and frame of it out of his own imagination, or from his <hi>diligence</hi> in framing and composing of it from a <hi>systeme</hi> of Principles collected out of other Writings of Divine Revelation. The <hi>First</hi> will not be pretended.</p>
                  <p>Two things absolutely free it from suffering under any such suspicion. First, The nature of its Argument, treating as was said, of such things as <hi>eye hath not seen,</hi> nor ear heard, nor have they entered into the heart of man. The Deity, Offices, Sacrifice, Mediation and Grace of Jesus Christ, are not things that can have any foundation in the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and imagination of man; Yea, being revealed by God, they lye in a direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction unto all that naturally is esteemed <hi>wise</hi> or perfect; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. They exceed the <hi>sphere</hi> of natural comprehension, and are destructive of the principles which it frameth unto it self for the compassing of those ends whereunto they are designed. Nor is it lyable to be esteemed of the other extract; or the <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and wisdom</hi> of man in collecting it from other Books of Divine Revelation, which alone with any colour of reason can be pretended. <hi>Humane</hi> diligence regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by what is elsewhere revealed of God, is <hi>humane</hi> still; and can never free it self from those inseparable attendances which will manifest it so to be. For suppose a man may compose a writing, wherein every <hi>Proposition</hi> in it self shall be true, and the whole in its contexture <hi>materially</hi> every way answerable unto the truth, (which yet must be <hi>accidental</hi> as to the principle of <hi>his</hi> wisdom, understanding, ability, and diligence by whom it is composed, they being no way able to give that effect cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly unto it) yet there will never be wanting <hi>that</hi> in it, whereby it may be discerned from an immediate effect and product of <hi>Divine Wisdom</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. Take but the Writings of any Wise man, who from his own ability and invention hath declared any <hi>Science</hi> in them, and allow his discovery of it to be the absolute compleat rule of that <hi>Science,</hi> so that nothing <hi>beyond,</hi> or <hi>besides</hi> what he hath written about it is true or certain, nor any thing else, but as it hath conformity to, or coincidence with what he hath written, and it will be very difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for any man so to treat of that subject from his Writings, as not to leave sufficient <hi>Characters</hi> upon his own, to difference them from his <hi>Original,</hi> and pattern; For suppose him to have in all things attained the perfect sense of his Guide, which yet it may be, untill all words are freed from their ambiguity will be impossible for any one to do, yet still there will remain such <hi>an impression</hi> of the <hi>Genius</hi> and fancy wherein the Rule was first framed upon it, as the follower cannot express. And how much more will there be so in that which both for <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>words</hi> also, proceeds from the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Will and Wisdom of God. Can it be supposed, that any man should collect by his own industry and diligence a Writing out of that which is given by Him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated thereby, that should absolutely express those infinite Perfections of his nature which <hi>shine</hi> forth in that which is immediately from himself? For that any Writing should be pretended to be undiscernable from them given by Divine inspiration, It is not enough that the matter of it be <hi>universally</hi> true, and that truth no other but what is contained in other parts of Scripture, but it must also have those other <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> and <hi>characters</hi> of a Divine Original which we shall in our progress discover in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> as in other Books of the Holy Scripture: for it is not behind the very choicest of them.</p>
                  <p>And the truth of this consideration, is demonstrated in the instances of <hi>every one</hi> of those Writings which may probably be concluded to have the nearest affinity and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude unto those of Divine inspiration, from the greatness and urgency of their <hi>plea</hi> to be admitted unto that <hi>series</hi> and order. These are the Books commonly called <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrypha</hi>; not one of them is there, wherein <hi>humane</hi> diligence doth not discover its self
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50110:14"/>
to be its fountain and spring. Did this <hi>Epistle</hi> proceed from the same root and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, whence comes it to pass, that it no where puts it self forth unto a discovery and conviction? for that it doth not so, we shall afterwards fully declare. Besides, to close this consideration, the design of the Writer of this <hi>Epistle</hi> manifests that he sought the Glory of God in Christ, according unto his will. With this aim and purpose, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to impose <hi>that</hi> on the Church, as an <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> from God, which was the <hi>product</hi> of his own pains and diligence, is utterly inconsistent. For by no means could he more dishonour God, whose glory in sincerity he appears to have sought, nor wrong the Church whose Good he desired to promote, than by this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing on him, that whereof he was not the Author, so <hi>adding unto his words,</hi> and making himself subject to reproof as a <hi>lyar, Prov.</hi> 30.6. and proposing that unto the <hi>Church</hi> as a firm and stable <hi>rule</hi> and object of faith, which he knew not to be so, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her thereby into error, uncertainty, and falshood. For this whole <hi>Epistle</hi> is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as the Will and Word of God, as coming by <hi>Revelation</hi> from him, without the least intimation of the intervention of the Will, Wisdom or Diligence of man, any other, than is constantly ascribed unto those that declare the will of God by <hi>inspiration.</hi> And if it were not so, the evils mentioned cannot be avoided. And how groundless this imputation would be, our following discourses will manifest. And I doubt not but this whole consideration will be, and is of weight and moment with them who have <hi>their senses exercised in the Scriptures,</hi> and are enabled by the Spirit breathing in them, to discern between Good and Evil, <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Chaff, Jer.</hi> 23.28.</p>

                     </gap> of it, further confirming its <hi>Divine Original.</hi> This for the most part consists in things of <hi>pure Revelation,</hi> and which have no other foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>in rerum natura.</hi> Some Books, even of the Scripture it self, are but the narrations of <hi>actions done amongst men,</hi> which for the substance of them, might be also recorded by humane diligence. But the things treated of in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> are purely divine, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and no wayes to be known but by Revelation. And not only so, but amongst those that are so, There are <hi>four</hi> things eminent in the <hi>subject matter</hi> of this Epistle. First, that the principal things treated of in it, are matters of the <hi>greatest importance</hi> in Christian Religion, and such as concern the very foundation of faith. Such are the Doctrines about the <hi>Person, Offices</hi> and Sacrifice of <hi>Christ,</hi> of the nature of Gospel Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, our Priviledge therein, and Communion with God thereby. In these things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the very <hi>vitalls</hi> of our Profession; and they are all opened and declared in a most excellent and heavenly manner in this <hi>Epistle</hi>; and that, as we shall manifest, in an Absolute <hi>Consonancy</hi> unto what is taught concerning them in other places of Scripture. Secondly, In that some things of <hi>great moment</hi> unto the faith, obedience and consolation of the Church, that are but <hi>obscurely</hi> or sparingly taught in any other places of <hi>Holy Writt,</hi> are here plainly, fully and excellently taught and improved. Such in particular is the Doctrine of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ, with the nature and excellency of his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the execution of the remaining parts and duty of that Office in Heaven; and how the whole of it was <hi>typically</hi> represented under the Old Testament. He that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands aright the importance of these things, their <hi>use</hi> in the faith and consolation of the Church, their influence into our whole course of obedience, the spiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that faith by them interests a believing soul in, the strength and supportment, that they afford under Temptations and Trials, will be ready to conclude that the world may as well want the <hi>Sun in the Firmament,</hi> as the Church this Epistle. And this perswasion we hope through Gods assistance to further in our Exposition of it. Thirdly, Gods way in teaching the Church of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> with the use and end of all the <hi>operous paedogogie of Moses,</hi> manifesting it to be full of Wisdom, Grace and Love, is here fully revealed, and the whole <hi>Aaronical</hi> Priesthood with all the duties and Offices of it <hi>translated</hi> unto the use of Believers under the Gospel. How dark <hi>Mosaical</hi> institutions were in themselves, is evident from the whole state of the Church in the dayes of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles, when they could not see unto the <hi>end of the things that were to be done away.</hi> In their nature they were <hi>carnal,</hi> in their number <hi>many,</hi> as to their reason, <hi>hidden</hi>; in their observation, <hi>heavy</hi> and burdensome, in their outward shew, <hi>Pompous</hi> and glorious; by all which they so possessed the minds of the Church, that very few saw clearly into the use, intention, and end of them. But in this <hi>Epistle</hi> the <hi>veyle</hi> is taken of from <hi>Moses,</hi> the mysterie of his institutions laid open, a perfect <hi>clew</hi> given unto Believers to pass safely through all the turnings and windings of them, unto Rest and Truth in Jesus Christ. Those <hi>hidden things</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> appear
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50110:14"/>
now unto us full of light, and instruction; but we are beholding for all our <hi>insight</hi> into them, and benefit which we receive thereby, unto the <hi>Exposition</hi> and Application of them made by the Holy Ghost in this Epistle. And how great a portion of Gospel <hi>Wisdom</hi> and knowledge consists herein, all men know, who have any spiritual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with these things. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the grounds, reasons, causes, and manner, of that great <hi>Alteration</hi> which God wrought and caused in his <hi>Worship,</hi> by taking down the ancient glorious <hi>Fabrick</hi> of it, which had been set up by his own appointment, are here laid open and manifested, and the greatest <hi>controversie</hi> that ever the Church of God was exercised withall, is here fully determined.</p>
                  <p>There was nothing in the first Propagation of the Gospel and plantation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches, that did <hi>so divide</hi> and perplex the professors of the Truth, and retard the work of promulgating the knowledge of Christ and the worship of God in him, as the <hi>difference</hi> that was about the continuation and observation of <hi>Mosaical</hi> Rites and Ceremonies. To such an <hi>height</hi> was this difference raised, so <hi>zealously</hi> were the parties at variance ingaged in the pursuit of their various apprehensions of the mind of God in this matter, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves thought meet for a season rather to <hi>umpire</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the controversie, by leaving the <hi>Jews</hi> free to their observation, and bringing the <hi>Gentiles</hi> unto a condescention in things of the greatest exasperation, than absolutely and precisely to determine the whole matter between them. And indeed, this being a <hi>difference</hi> wherein the Will, Authority, and Command of God were pleaded on the <hi>mistaken</hi> side, they being all of them clear and full as to the matter by them pleaded for, nothing but an immediate Declaration of the mind of God himself, as to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving and taking off the obligation of his own Law, could put such an end unto it, as that the spirits of men might acquiesce therein. Now the Will of God to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose before the Writing of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> could only be <hi>collected</hi> from the nature and state of things in the Church upon the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and conclusions from thence, which the believing <hi>Jews</hi> were very slow in the admittance of. Add hereunto that many <hi>Prophesies</hi> and promises of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> setting forth the <hi>Glory</hi> and beauty of Gospel worship, under the names and condition of the <hi>Worship</hi> then in use, as of <hi>Priests, Levites, Sacrifices, Offerings, Feast</hi> of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> and the like, lay directly in the letter against that cessation of <hi>Mosaical</hi> Rites, which the <hi>Jews</hi> opposed.</p>
                  <p>Now who was fit, who was able to determine upon these <hi>different</hi> and various In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of God, but God himself? To declare <hi>positively,</hi> that all Obligation from his former commands was now ceased, that his institutions were no more to be observed, that the <hi>Time</hi> allotted unto the Churches obedience unto him in their observance was expired, this was no otherwise to be effected but by an <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And this is done in this Epistle, and that in this <hi>only</hi> as to the <hi>Jews,</hi> whereby it became the main <hi>instrument</hi> and means, of pulling up their old Church-state, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating it anew into the appointments of our Lord Jesus Christ. Neither is this done by a bare <hi>declaration</hi> of Gods <hi>Authoritative interposition,</hi> but in a way of Excellent and <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Wisdom</hi> and condescention, (with a manifestation of Gods Love and care unto his Church, in the institutions that were now to be removed; and the progress of his Wisdom in their gradual instruction as they were able to bear,) the whole nature, design and intendment of them is evidenced to be <hi>such,</hi> as that having received their full <hi>End</hi> and accomplishment, they did of themselves naturally expire and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear.</hi> And hereby in that great <hi>Alteration</hi> which God then wrought in the outward worship of his Church, there is discovered such an <hi>oneness</hi> and unchangeableness in his love and care, such a <hi>suitableness</hi> Harmony and Consonancy in the effects of his Will, such an Evidence of infinite Wisdom in disposing of them into a subserviency one to another, that they should no where in any thing cross or <hi>enterfere,</hi> and all of them to his own glory in the promotion and furtherance of the light, faith, and obedience of his Church, as sufficiently manifests the Original and fountain whence it doth proceed. For my part, I can truly say, that I know not any portion of <hi>Holy Writt,</hi> that will more effectually raise up the heart of an <hi>understanding Reader,</hi> to an holy Admiration of the Goodness, Love, and Wisdom of God, than this <hi>Epistle</hi> doth. Such, I say, is the <hi>subject matter</hi> of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> so divine, so excellent, so singular. And in the handling here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, have we not the least <hi>occasional mixture,</hi> of any Matter, Words, Sentences, Stories, Arguments or Doctrines so unsuited to the whole, as to argue the <hi>interposure</hi> of a fallible Spirit. Thus we know it hath fallen out in all the Writings of the Christians of the <hi>first Ages</hi> after the sealing of the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Scriptures. Many things in them appear to proceed from an holy and Heavenly Spirit breathing in their Authors, and most of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50110:15"/>
what they contain to be <hi>consonant</hi> unto the mind of God; yet have they <hi>all of them,</hi> evident footsteps that the Authors were subject unto <hi>Errors</hi> and mistakes, even in and about the things written by them. And the continuance of their failings in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings capable of an easie <hi>conviction,</hi> is no small fruit of the Holy Wise Providence of God, and his care over his Church, that it might not in after Ages be imposed upon with the great and weighty pretence of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> to admit them into a competition with <hi>those</hi> which himself gave out to be its <hi>infallible,</hi> and therefore <hi>only</hi> Rule. That nothing of this nature, nothing <hi>humanitùs,</hi> meerly after the manner of men, befell the Writer of this Epistle in his Work, we hope through the assistance of its principal <hi>Author</hi> to manifest in our Exposition of the several parts of it. And this <hi>subject matter</hi> of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> thus handled, further secures us of its <hi>original.</hi>

                     </gap> which the <hi>Ancients</hi> made a <hi>characterism</hi> of Writings given by <hi>divine inspiration,</hi> are consonant unto the <hi>General Argument,</hi> and peculiar sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of it. That the whole Scripture hath an <hi>especial end,</hi> which is peculiar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and wherein <hi>no other writing</hi> hath any share, but only so far as it is taken from thence, and composed in obedience thereunto, is evident unto all that do seriously consider it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>end</hi> supremely and absolutely is the glory of that God who is the Author of it. This is the <hi>center</hi> where all the lines of it do meet, the <hi>scope</hi> and mark towards which all things in it are directed. It is the Revelation of himself that is intended, of his mind and Will, that he may be glorified; wherein also, because he is the principal foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and last end of all, consists the order and perfection of all other things. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the demonstration of this glory of God, in and by Jesus Christ is aimed at. The works of Gods <hi>Power and Providence</hi> do all of them declare his <hi>Glory</hi>; the glory of his eternal Perfections and Excellencies, absolutely and in themselves. But the End of the Scripture, is the glory of God in Christ, as he hath revealed himself and <hi>gathered all things to an head in him,</hi> unto the manifestation of his glory. For <hi>this is life eternal that we know him the only true God, and whom he hath sent, Jesus Christ.</hi> The <hi>means</hi> whereby God is thus glorified in Christ, is by the Salvation of them that do <hi>believe,</hi> which is therefore also an <hi>intermediate End</hi> of the Scripture: <hi>These things are written, that we may believe, that Jesus is the Son of God, and that believing, we may have life through his name, John</hi> 20.31. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. Moreover whereas this <hi>eternal life</hi> unto the glory of God cannot be obtained without faith and obedience according to his will, the Scripture is given for this purpose also, that it may instruct us in the mind of God, and <hi>make us wise unto salvation</hi>: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. These in their mutual subserviency and dependance, compleat the <hi>characteristical</hi> End of the Scripture. I confess <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> makes it the End of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that we may thereby be <hi>made like unto God.</hi> But that <hi>Philosophy</hi> of his, having its rise and spring in <hi>inbred noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of nature, and the contemplation of the works of Gods Providence, could have no other end but conformity unto him, as his <hi>perfections</hi> were revealed <hi>absolutely</hi>; whereunto the Scripture adds this <hi>revelation in Christ Jesus,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.18. which gives them, as I said, their <hi>special</hi> and peculiar end. It makes God known, <hi>as all in all,</hi> and man to be nothing as to goodness or blessedness, but what he is pleased to do for him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto him; and Jesus Christ to be the great and only <hi>way</hi> and means, whereby he will <hi>communicate</hi> of himself, and bring us unto himself. The more clearly any <hi>portion</hi> of Scripture discovers and makes conspicuous this <hi>End,</hi> the more parts of the <hi>series</hi> and order of things whereby the last and utmost End of the glory of God is produced, in their mutual connexion dependance and subserviency it manifesteth, the more fully doth it express this <hi>general End</hi> of the whole, and thereby evince its own interest therein.</p>
                  <p>Now herein doth this <hi>Epistle</hi> come behind no other portion of Scripture whatever. For as the Exaltation of the glory of God, as he is the <hi>first cause,</hi> and last end of all things, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly proposed in it, so the relation of the glory of God, and of our obedience and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness whereby and wherein it is declared, unto the Person, Offices, and Mediation of Jesus Christ is in an eminent manner insisted on and unfolded in it. And whereas some parts of Scripture do <hi>exhibit</hi> unto us, most <hi>clearly</hi> some <hi>one part</hi> of this <hi>general End</hi> of the whole, and other portions or Books of it, some <hi>other parts,</hi> this expresseth the whole, and all the parts of it distinctly, from the very foundation of <hi>calling</hi> men to the knowledge of God and obedience, unto the utmost end of his <hi>glorifying</hi> himself in their salvation by Jesus Christ. Neither is there herewithall the least <hi>alloy</hi> or mixture of any <hi>by, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi>

                  <p>I do confess that though some <hi>Translations</hi> may, and do render the words of the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> more properly, and better represent and insinuate the native <hi>genius,</hi> beauty, life, and power of the <hi>Sacred Style</hi> than some others do, yet none of them can, or do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the whole Excellency, Elegancy, and marvellous Efficacy of it for the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of its senses to the understandings and minds of men. Neither is this any refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the <hi>Translators,</hi> their Abilities, diligence, or faithfulness, but that which the nature of the thing it self produceth. There is in the <hi>Sacred Scripture,</hi> in the words wherein by the Holy Ghost it was given out, a proper peculiar <hi>vertue,</hi> and secret effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy inflaming the minds of the <hi>Readers</hi> and <hi>Hearers,</hi> which no diligence or wisdom of man can fully and absolutely <hi>transferr</hi> into, and impress upon any other Language.

                  <p>Neither doth this defect in <hi>Translations</hi> arise from hence, that the <hi>Original Tongues</hi> may be more copious and <hi>emphatical</hi> than those of the <hi>Translations,</hi> which possibly may be the condition of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> often complains, but it is from the causes before named, and therefore is most evident in the <hi>Translations</hi> of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when yet no man can imagine the <hi>Hebrew</hi> to be more <hi>copious,</hi> (though it be more comprehensive) than the Languages whereinto it hath been translated. But it is of the <hi>Originals</hi> themselves, and the <hi>Style</hi> of the Sacred Penmen therein, concerning which we discourse. And herein the boldness of <hi>Hierom</hi> cannot be excused, (though he be followed by some others of great name in latter Ages) who more than once chargeth S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> with <hi>Solaecisms,</hi> and <hi>Barbarisms</hi> in Expression, and often urgeth, (upon a mistake as we shall see) that he was <hi>imperitus Sermone, unskilfull in speech.</hi> But as neither he, nor any else, are able to give any cogent instance to make good their charge, so it is certain that there is nothing expressed in the whole <hi>Scripture,</hi> but in the <hi>manner</hi> and way, and by the words wherewith it ought to be expressed, unto the ends for which it is used and designed, as might easily be manifested both from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Holy Ghost himself in suggesting those words unto his <hi>Penmen,</hi> and in the care of God over the very <hi>Iota's</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> of the words themselves. And whereever there appears unto us an irregularity from the <hi>Arbitrary Directions,</hi> or Usages of other men in those Languages, it doth much more become us, to suspect our own Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions and Judgement; yea, or to reject those Directions and Usages from the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty</hi> of an absolute Rule; than to reflect the least failure or mistake on them who wrote nothing but by <hi>Divine Inspiration.</hi> The censure of <hi>Hensius</hi> in this matter is <hi>severe,</hi> but true. <hi>Prolegom.

An Earthly <hi>Monarch</hi> that should make use of them in his <hi>Edicts,</hi> Laws, or Proclamations, would but <hi>prostitute</hi> his Authority to contempt, and invite his Subjects to disobedience by so doing.

                  <p>Besides, these things belong not indeed unto <hi>real Eloquence</hi> and Propriety of Speech, but are arbitrarily invented <hi>crutches,</hi> for the relief of our <hi>lameness</hi> and infirmity.

For if the eruption of the poysonous brood of Hereticks, questioning the <hi>Deity</hi> of the Son of God in <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> gave <hi>occasion</hi> to the Writing of the Gospel by St. <hi>John,</hi> and if the <hi>Dissentions</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> deserved <hi>two Epistles</hi> for their composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the lesser Differences between Believers of the Jews and Gentiles, in and about the things treated of in this Epistle had a remedy provided for them in the Epistles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> unto them, is it not at least <hi>probable</hi> that the same Spirit who moved the <hi>Penmen</hi> of those Books to Write, and directed them in their so doing, did also provide for the removal of the Prejudices, and healing of the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which were so great, and of so great importance unto all the Churches of God. And that there is weight in this Consideration, when we come to declare the <hi>Time</hi> when this <hi>Epistle</hi> was written, will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>The most manifest <hi>Eviction</hi> of any Writing pretending unto the priviledge of <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> may be taken from the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of it, or the things taught and declared therein. God himself being the first and only <hi>Essential Truth,</hi> nothing <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>37</label> can proceed from him, but what is absolutely so; and Truth being but <hi>one,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform</hi> and Consonant unto it self, there can be no <hi>discrepancy</hi> in the branches of it, nor <hi>contrariety</hi> in the streams that flow from that one Fountain. God is also <hi>Holy, Glorious in Holiness,</hi> and nothing proceeds immediately from him, but it bears a stamp of his Holiness, as also of his Greatness and Wisdom. If then any thing in the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of any Writing, be <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntrue, Impious, Light,</hi> or any way contradictory to the <hi>Ascertained</hi> Writings of Divine Inspiration, all Pleas and pretences unto that <hi>priviledge</hi> must cease for ever. We need no other Proof, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony or Argument to evince its <hi>Original,</hi> than what its self tenders unto us. And by this means also do the Books commonly called <hi>Apochryphal,</hi> unto which the <hi>Romanists</hi> ascribe <hi>Canonical</hi> Authority, destroy their own pretentions. They have all of them, on this account, long since been cast out of the limits of any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble defence. Now, that no one portion of Scripture, is less obnoxious to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this kind, from the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> treated of, and Doctrines delivered in it, then this <hi>Epistle,</hi> we shall by Gods assistance manifest in our Exposition of the whole, and each particular passage of it. Neither is it needful, that we should here prolong our Discourse by <hi>anticipating</hi> any thing that must necessarily after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in its proper place, be insisted on. The place startled at by some <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. about the <hi>impossibility of the recovery of Apostates,</hi> was touched on before, and shall afterwards be fully cleared. Nor do I know any other use to be made of observing the scruple of some of Old, about the countenance given to the <hi>Novatians</hi> by that place, but only to make a Discovery how <hi>partially</hi> men in all <hi>Ages</hi> have been addicted unto their own apprehensions in things wherein they differed from others; for whereas if the Opinions of the <hi>Novatians</hi> had been confirmed in the place, as it is not, it had been their duty to have relinquished their own <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and gone over unto them, some of them discovered a mind rather to have broken in upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of God himself declared in his Word, than so to have done. And it is greatly to be feared that the same Spirit still working in others, is as effectual in them to reject the <hi>plain sense of the Scripture</hi> in sundry places, as it was ready to have been in them, to reject the <hi>words</hi> of it in this.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Style</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of a Writing may be such, as to lay a <hi>just Prejudice</hi> against its claim of <hi>Canonical Authority.</hi> For although the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of a Writing, may be good and honest in the main of it, and generally suited unto the <hi>Analogie</hi> of faith, <label type="milestone">

Of the <hi>Style</hi> of this Epistle we have spoken before: Its <hi>Gravity,</hi> Simplicity, Majesty, and absolute suitableness unto the High, Holy, and Heavenly Mysteries treated of in it, are as far as I can find, not only very <hi>evident</hi>; but also by all acknowledged, who are able to judge of them.</p>
                  <p>Want of <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> in <hi>all Ages</hi> of the Church, from the first giving forth of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>39</label> any Writing testifying unto its Divine Original, is another impeachment of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence unto <hi>Canonical Authority.</hi> And this Argument ariseth fatally against the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chryphal</hi> Books before mentioned. Some of them are expresly excluded from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> by many of the antient Churches, nor are any of them competently testified unto.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Suffrage</hi> of this kind given unto our Epistle, we have mentioned before. The Doubts and Scruples of some about it, have likewise been acknowledged. That they are of no weight to be laid in the ballance against the <hi>Testimony</hi> given unto it, might easily be demonstrated. But because they were levied all of them, principally against its <hi>Author,</hi> and but by consequence against its <hi>Authority,</hi> I shall consider them in a Disquisition about him, wherein we shall give a further confirmation of the <hi>Divine Original</hi> of the Epistle, by proving it undenyably to be Written by the <hi>Apostle</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that eminent <hi>Penman</hi> of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>clear</hi> stands the <hi>Canonical Authority</hi> of this Epistle. It is <hi>destitute</hi> of no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>40</label> needful for the manifestation of it; nor is it <hi>obnoxious</hi> unto any just exception against its claim of that priviledge. And hence it is come to pass; that what ever have been the <hi>fears</hi> doubts and scruples of some, the <hi>rash,</hi> temerarious Objections, Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Censures of others, the <hi>Care</hi> and Providence of God over it, as a parcel of his most holy Word, working with the prevailing evidence of its <hi>Original</hi> implanted in it, and its Spiritual Efficacy unto all the ends of holy Scripture, hath obtained an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Conquest</hi> over the hearts and minds of all that believe, and setled it in a full pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of <hi>Canonical Authority</hi> in all the Churches of Christ throughout the world.</p>

And this the Holy Ghost hath sufficiently manifested, by shutting up the <hi>Names</hi> of many of them from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Church in all Ages. The Close of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> hath an uncertain <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> unless we shall suppose with some of the <hi>Jews</hi> that it was written by <hi>Moses</hi> after his Death.

For those whose <hi>Authors</hi> are known, they were not esteemed to be given by <hi>Prophesie,</hi> because they were <hi>Prophets</hi>; but they were known to be <hi>Prophets</hi> by the Word which they delivered. For if the Word Delivered or Written by any of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> was to be esteemed Sacred, or Divine, because delivered or Written by such Persons as were known to be <hi>Prophets,</hi> then it must be because they were some other way known so to be, and Divinely Inspired, as by <hi>Working of Miracles,</hi> or that they were in their

dayes received, and testified unto as <hi>such</hi> by the Church. But neither of these can be asserted. For as it is not known that any one <hi>Penman</hi> of the Old Testament, <hi>Moses</hi> only excepted, ever wrought any <hi>miracles,</hi> so it is certain that the most and chiefest of them (as the <hi>Prophets</hi>) were rejected and condemned by the <hi>Church</hi> of the dayes wherein they lived. The only way therefore whereby they were proved to be <hi>Prophets</hi> was by the <hi>Word</hi> it self which they delivered and wrote; and thereon depended the Evidence and Certainty of their being <hi>Divinely</hi> inspired. See <hi>Amos</hi> 7.14, 15, 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. And setting aside that <hi>actual Inspiration</hi> by the Holy Ghost, which they had for the Declaration and Writing of that Word of God which came unto them in particular, and the <hi>Prophets</hi> themselves were subject to <hi>mistakes.</hi> So was <hi>Samuel</hi> when he thought <hi>Eliab</hi> should have been the <hi>Lords Annointed,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6. and <hi>Nathan</hi> when he approved the purpose of <hi>David to build the Temple,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.2. and the great <hi>Elijah,</hi>

It was then , as we said, the Word of <hi>Prophesie,</hi> that gave the <hi>Writers</hi> of it the Reputation and Authority of <hi>Prophets</hi>; and their being <hi>Prophets</hi> gave not Authority to the Word they declared or wrote as a Word of <hi>Prophesie.</hi> Hence an anxious enquiry after the <hi>Penman</hi> of any part of the Scripture is not necessary.</p>
                     <p>But whereas there want not <hi>Evidences</hi> sufficient to discover who was the <hi>Writer</hi> of this Epistle, whereby also the exceptions made unto its <hi>Divine Original</hi> may be finally obviated, they also shall be taken into Consideration.

                     <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> it is by whom we affirm this Epistle to be written. It is acknowledged that <label type="milestone">

It may not then be expected, that now after so long a season, the Truth of our Assertion should be so manifestly evinced, as to give <hi>absolute satisfaction</hi> unto all; (which is a vain thing for any man to aim at in a Subject wherein men sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that they have a liberty of thinking what they please) yet I doubt not but that it will appear not only highly probable, but so full of Evidence in comparison of any other <hi>Opinion</hi> that is, or hath been promoted in competition with it, as that some kind of <hi>blameable pertinaciousness</hi> may be made to appear in its refusal. Now the whole of what I shall offer in the proof of it may be reduced unto these six Heads. (1.) The manifest <hi>failure</hi> of all them who have endeavoured to assign it unto any <hi>other Penman.</hi> (2.) The <hi>insufficiency</hi> of the Arguments insisted on to disprove our Assertion. (3.) <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi> given unto it in other Scriptures. (4.) <hi>Considerations</hi> taken from the <hi>Writing</hi> it self, compared with other acknowledged Writings of the same <hi>Author.</hi> (5.) The general suffrage of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or Ecclesiastical Tradition. (6.) Reasons taken from sundry <hi>Circumstances</hi> relating unto the <hi>Epistle</hi> its self. Now as all these <hi>Evidences</hi> are not of the same nature, nor of equal force, so some of them will be found very <hi>cogent,</hi> and all of them together very sufficient to free our Assertion from just Question or Exception.</p>

Neither is there any <hi>Reason</hi> of this Opinion reported by them, but only that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by <hi>Clemens</hi> of the Agreement of the <hi>Style</hi> with that of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> (which yet is not allowed by <hi>Hierom</hi>) whereon he doth not ascribe the <hi>Writing,</hi> but only the <hi>Translation</hi> of it unto <hi>Luke. Grotius</hi> alone contends for him to be the Author of it, and that with this only Argument, that sundry words are used in the same sense by St. <hi>Luke</hi> and the <hi>Writer</hi> of this Epistle. But that this Observation is of <hi>no</hi> moment shall afterwards be declared.</p>
                     <p>This Opinion then may be well rejected as a groundless <hi>guess</hi> of an obscure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Original, and not <hi>tolerably</hi> confirmed either by Testimony or Circumstances of things. If we will forego a Perswasion established on so many important Considerations, as we shall manifest this of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> being the <hi>Author</hi> of this Epistle to be, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by so many Testimonies, upon every arbitrary ungrounded <hi>Conjeciure,</hi> we may be sure never to find rest in any thing that we are rightly perswaded of. But I shall add one Consideration that will cast this Opinion of <hi>Grotius</hi> quite out of the limits of probability. By general Consent this Epistle was written whilst <hi>James</hi> was yet alive and <hi>presided</hi> in the Church of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; and I shall afterwards prove it so to have been. What was his Authority as an Apostle, what his Reputation in that <hi>Church,</hi> is both known in general from the nature of his <hi>Office,</hi> and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is intimated in the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. These were the <hi>Hebrews</hi> whose instruction in this <hi>Epistle</hi> is principally intended, and by their means, that of their Brethren in the <hi>Eastern Dispersion</hi> of them. Now is it Reason to imagine, that any one who was not an <hi>Apostle,</hi> but only a <hi>Scholar</hi> and Follower of them, should be used to write unto that Church, wherein so great an <hi>Apostle,</hi> a <hi>Pillar</hi> among them, had his especial Residence, and did actually Preside; and that in an Argument of such huge importance, with Reasons against a <hi>practice</hi> wherein they were all ingaged; yea, that <hi>Apostle</hi> himself as appears, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12. Were any one then alive of more <hi>esteem</hi> and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church than others, certainly He was the fittest to be used in this employment; and how well all things of this nature agree unto St. <hi>Paul</hi> we shall see afterwards.</p>

                     <p>Many <hi>circumstances</hi> also concurr to the removal of this conjecture.

The fabulous Author, I confess, of the <hi>Rhapsedy</hi> called the <hi>Recognitions</hi> of <hi>Clemens,</hi> tells us that <hi>Barnabas</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> taking along <hi>Clemens</hi> with him, and returning into <hi>Judaea,</hi> found St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Caesarea.</hi> But St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> gives us another account, both where <hi>Barnabas</hi> was, and how he was employed, at the time intimated by him who knew nothing of those things. For whilst St. <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Caesarea, Acts</hi> 10.1. <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> was at <hi>Hierusalem, Acts</hi> 9.27. being a little while after sent to <hi>Antioch</hi> by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; <hi>chap.</hi> 11.22. Again <hi>Timothy</hi> was the Companion of the Writer of this <hi>Epistle. chap.</hi> 13.23. a Person as far as appears unknown unto <hi>Barnabas,</hi> being taken into St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Society after their <hi>difference</hi> and separation, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.39. <hi>chap.</hi> 16.1. He had also been in <hi>bonds</hi> or imprisonment, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.34. whereof we cannot at that time learn any thing concerning <hi>Barnabas,</hi> those of St. <hi>Paul</hi> being known unto all.

doubt, and <hi>Bishop</hi> of the Church at <hi>Rome.</hi> But none of the Antients of any Learning or Judgement, ever laid weight on this Conjecture. For what had he who was a <hi>Convert</hi> from among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to do with the Churches of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> what Authority had he to <hi>interpose</hi> himself in that which was their peculiar concernment?

Neither doth that <hi>Epistle</hi> of his to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> which is yet extant, though excellent in its kind, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to think that he wrote by Divine Inspiration. Besides the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Epistle</hi> had a desire and purpose to go to the <hi>Hebrews, chap.</hi> 13.22. Yea, he desires to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored</hi> unto them as one that had been with them before. But as it doth not appear that this <hi>Clemens</hi> was ever in <hi>Palestine,</hi> so what Reason he should have to leave his own <hi>charge</hi> now to go thither, no man can imagine. And to end this needless Debate, in that <hi>Epistle</hi> which was truly his own, he makes use of the Words and Authority of this, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> long since observed.</p>

But this <hi>Answer</hi> can by no means be admitted of, nor accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated unto any Writing given by <hi>Divine Inspiration.</hi> For not only the <hi>Matter,</hi> but the very <hi>Words</hi> of their <hi>Writings</hi> were suggested unto his <hi>Penmen</hi> by the Holy Ghost, (that the whole might have no influence from humane frailty or <hi>fallibility</hi>) which alone ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Authority of their Writings <hi>Sacred</hi> and Divine. But this intimation would resolve the <hi>Truth</hi> in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> into the Care and Diligence of him that took the sense of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and thence composed it; wherein he was liable to mistakes, unless we shall vainly suppose, that he also was inspired. Wherefore generally they who admitted of this <hi>Objection,</hi> gave the Answer unto it before intimated; namely, that the Epistle was <hi>Originally</hi> written in <hi>Hebrew</hi> by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

When I well consider the Genius and Character of the Speech and Style of this Apostle, I confess I never found that Grandure in</hi> Plato <hi>himself, as in him, when he thundereth out the Mysteries of God; nor that Gravity and Vehemency in</hi> Demosthenes <hi>as in him, when he intends to terrifie the minds of men, with a dread of the Judgements of God, or would warn them, or draw them to the contemplation of his Goodness, or the performance of the Duties of Piety and Mercy; Nor do I find a more exact Method of Teaching in those great and excellent Masters,</hi> Aristotle, <hi>and</hi> Galen, <hi>than in him.</hi> So it is plainly, so the <hi>Greek Fathers</hi> almost with one consent do testifie, so do most of the <hi>Latines</hi> also, so the best Learned of the later <hi>Criticks,</hi> and so may it be defended against any opposition. And <hi>Hierom</hi> himself, who takes most Liberty to censure his <hi>Style,</hi> doth so far in other places forget his own temerity therein, as to cry out against those, who <hi>dreamed</hi> as he speaks, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not throughly acquainted with all <hi>propriety</hi> of Speech. And he who was the <hi>first</hi> that ever spake word about any defect of this kind, though as able to judge as any one what ever who hath since passed his <hi>Censure</hi> unto the same purpose, was in an <hi>evident mistake</hi> in the very instance which he pitched on to confirm his Observation. This was <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> one of the first and most Learned of the <hi>Greek Fathers</hi>; For affirming that there were many <hi>hyperbata</hi> in the <hi>Style</hi> of this <hi>Apostle,</hi> which render it uneven and difficult, he confirms his Assertion with an instance in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>In whom the God of this World, bath blinded the minds of them which believe not:</hi> For, saith he, the Words should naturally have been thus placed; <hi>In whom God hath blinded the minds of them that in this world believe not.</hi> So to obviate a Foolish <hi>Sophism</hi> in the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> an <hi>Hyperbaton</hi> must be supposed in the Apostles <hi>Style,</hi> when indeed there is not the least colour of it. Upon the whole matter then, I shall confidently assert, that there is no manner of defect in any of his Writings; and that every thing, (consider the matter and nature of it, the <hi>Person</hi> in whose name he spake, and <hi>those</hi> to whom he wrote) is expressed as it <hi>ought</hi> to be for the end proposed, and not otherwise. And hence it is, that because of the <hi>variety</hi> of the Subject Matter trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, and difference among the <hi>persons</hi> to whom he wrote, that there is also <hi>variety</hi> in his way and manner of <hi>expressing</hi> himself in sundry of his Epistles: And in many of them, there is such a discovery and manifestation of <hi>solid Eloquence,</hi> and pure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of Speech, that the Observation of them in any Writing, is far from having any weight to prove it <hi>none</hi> of his.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>13</label> It may then be <hi>granted,</hi> though it be not <hi>proved,</hi> that there is some <hi>dissimilitude</hi> of <hi>Style</hi> between this and the rest of the Epistles of St. <hi>Paul</hi>; and the Reasons of it are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifest. The <hi>Argument</hi> treated of in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> is divers from that of most of the other; many <hi>circumstances</hi> in those to whom he wrote singular, the <hi>spring</hi> of his reasonings, and <hi>way</hi> of his arguings, peculiarly suited unto his Subject Matter, and the condition of those unto whom he wrote. Besides in the Writing of this <hi>Epistle</hi> there was in him an especial Frame and <hi>incitation</hi> of Spirit, occasioned by many Occurrences relating unto it. His intense love, and near <hi>relation</hi> in the flesh, unto them to whom he wrote, affectionately remembred by himself, and expressed in a manner inimitable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. did doubtless exert it self, in his treating about their greatest and nearest concernment. The <hi>prejudices</hi> and enmity of some of them against him, recorded in several places of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and remembred by himself in some other of his Epistles, lay also under his consideration. Much of the <hi>Subject</hi> that he treated about, was matter of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50110:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Controversie, which was to be debated from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and wherein those with whom he dealt, thought they might dissent from him without any prejudice to their Faith or Obedience. Their condition also must needs greatly affect him. They were now not only under present troubles, dangers and feares, but <hi>Positi inter sacrum &amp; saxum,</hi> at the very door of ruine, if not delivered from the snare of obstinate adherence unto <hi>Mosaical Institutions.</hi> Now they who know not what alterations in <hi>Style,</hi> and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Writing, these things will produce, in those who have an ability to express the Conceptions of their minds, and the Affections wherewith they are attended, know nothing of this matter. And other differences from the rest of <hi>Pauls Epistles,</hi> but what may evidently be seen to arise from these and the like Causes, none have yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovered, nor can so do. And notwithstanding the <hi>Elegancy of the Style</hi> pretended, that it is as full of <hi>Hebraisms,</hi> as any other <hi>Epistle</hi> of the same Author, we shall discover in our passage through it; which certainly a Person of that Ability in the <hi>Greek Tongue,</hi> as the Writer of this Epistle discovers himself to be, might have avoided, if he had thought meet so to do.</p>

For the <hi>First,</hi> it is uncertain of what Antiquity the <hi>Titular Superscriptions</hi> of any of the Epistles are: but most certain, that they did not <hi>Originally</hi> belong unto them, and are therefore destitute of all Authority. They are things, the <hi>Transcribers</hi> it may be have at pleasure made bold withal, as with the <hi>Subscription</hi> also of some of them, as to the place from whence they were sent, and the persons by whom. Though this therefore should be wanting unto this <hi>Epistle,</hi> as there is some variety both in antient <hi>Copies</hi> of the <hi>Original,</hi> and <hi>Translations</hi> about it, the most owning and retaining of it; yet it would be of no moment, seeing we know not, whence, or from whom, any of them are. The Objection then is taken from the want of the wonted <hi>Apostolical Salutation</hi>; which should be in, and a part of the Epistle. And this is the substance of what on this account is excepted against our Assertion.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>17</label> Some of the <hi>Antients,</hi> and principally <hi>Theodoret</hi> insist upon the peculiar allotment of his Work unto him among the <hi>Gentiles. Paul</hi> was the Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in an especial manner; and if in Writing unto the <hi>Hebrews</hi> he had prefixed his name unto his Epistle, he might have seemed to transgress the <hi>Line of his Allotment.</hi> And if it be not certain that the <hi>Apostles</hi> by common consent cast their Work into distinct portions, which they peculiarly attended unto; as the <hi>Antients</hi> generally concurr that they did, (and there was not reason wanting why they should do so) yet it is, that there was a special Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and agreement between <hi>James, Peter,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> on the one side, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> on the other, that they should attend the Ministry of the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi> and these of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> finding it necessary for him to write unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> would not prefix his name with an <hi>Apostolical Salutation</hi> unto his <hi>Epistle,</hi> that he might not seem to have invaded the <hi>Province</hi> of others, or transgressed the <hi>Line</hi> of his Allotment. But I must acknowledge that notwithstanding the weight laid upon it by <hi>Theodoret</hi> and some others, this reason seems not unto me <hi>cogent</hi> unto the end for which it is produced. For (1.) The <hi>Commission</hi> given by the Lord Christ unto his Apostles, was <hi>Catholick,</hi> and had no bounds but that of the <hi>whole Creation</hi> of God capable of instruction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. and that Commission which was given unto them all in general, was given unto every one in <hi>particular</hi>: and made him <hi>in solidum</hi> possessor of all the Right and Authority conveyed by it. Neither could any following <hi>arbitrary</hi> agreement pitched on for convenience, and the facilitating of their Work, abridge any of them from exerting their <hi>Authority,</hi> and exercising their <hi>Duty</hi> towards any of the Sons of Men, as occasion did require.</p>
                     <p>And hence it is, that notwithstanding the agreement mentioned, we find St. <hi>Peter</hi> teaching of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> labouring the Conversion of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Secondly, In Writing this Epistle, on this Supposition St. <hi>Paul</hi> did indeed, that which is pretended was not meet for him to do; namely, he entered on that which was the Charge of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man; only he <hi>conceals his Name,</hi> that he might not appear in doing of a thing unwarrantable and unjustifiable. And whether it be meet to ascribe this unto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, is easie to determine. As then it is certain that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Writing of this <hi>Epistle</hi> did nothing, but what in <hi>duty</hi> he ought to do, and what the Authority given him by Christ extended its self unto, so the <hi>concealing of his Name,</hi> lest he should be thought to have done any thing irregularly, is a thing that without much temerity may not be imputed unto him.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>18</label> There is another Answer to this Objection, which <hi>seemeth</hi> to be <hi>solid</hi> and satisfactory, which most of the Antients rest in. And it is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had weighty Reasons not to declare his Name at the entrance of this Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> taken from the <hi>preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi> that many of them had against him.<note place="margin">Euseb. Hist. lib. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>13.</hi>
                        </note> This is insisted on by <hi>Clemens</hi> in <hi>Eusebius, He did Wisely,</hi> saith he, <hi>conceal his Name, because of the prejudicate Opinion that they had against him:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Proaem. in Ep. ad Heb.</note> and this is at large insisted on by <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who is followed therein by <hi>Theophilact, Oecumenius</hi> and others without number. The <hi>persecuting</hi> Party of the Nation, looked on him as an <hi>Apostate,</hi> a <hi>Desertor</hi> of the Cause wherein he was once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and one that taught <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; yea, as they thought, that set the whole World against them and all that they <hi>gloried in, Acts</hi> 21.28. and what enmity is usually stirred up on such occasions, all men know, and his example is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient instance of it. And there was <hi>added</hi> thereunto, which <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and that justly layes great weight upon, that he was no <hi>ordinary Person,</hi> but a man of great and <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> abilities, which mightily increased the provocation. Those among them, who with the profession of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> had a mind, to continue themselves in, and to impose upon others the observance of <hi>Mosaical Institutions,</hi> looked on him as the only person that had <hi>frustrated</hi> their design, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.2. And this also is usually no small cause of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50110:24"/>
wrath and hatred. The Spirit of these men afterwards possessing the <hi>Ebonites,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised St. <hi>Paul</hi> as a <hi>Grecian</hi> and Desertor of the Law, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> testifies. And even the best among them, who either in the use of their liberty, or upon an Indulgence given them, continued in the <hi>Temple Worship,</hi> had a jealous eye over him, lest he had not that esteem for <hi>Moses,</hi> which they imagined became them to retain, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.21. how great a prejudice against his Doctrine and Reasonings, these thoughts and jealousies might have created, had he at the <hi>entrance</hi> of his dealing with them, prefixed his Name and <hi>usi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>al Salutation,</hi> is not hard to conjecture. This being the State and Condition of things in reference unto St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and not any other known <hi>Penman</hi> of the Holy Ghost, or eminent Disciple of Christ in those dayes, this <hi>defect</hi> of <hi>Inscription,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> well observes, proves the Epistle rather to be his, than any other Persons whatever. And though I know that there may be some <hi>Reply</hi> made unto this <hi>Answer,</hi> both from the Discovery which he makes of himself in the end of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> and from the high probability that there is, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> upon the first receipt of it, would diligently examine by whom it was written, yet I judge it very <hi>sufficient</hi> to frustrate the Exception insisted on, though perhaps not containing the <hi>true,</hi> at least the <hi>whole</hi> Cause of the Omission of an <hi>Apostolical Salutation</hi> in the entrance of it.</p>
                     <p>If then we would know the True and Just Cause of the Omission of the Authors <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>19</label> name, and mention of his <hi>Apostolical Authority</hi> in the entrance of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> we must consider what were the <hi>Just Reasons</hi> of prefixing them unto his other Epistles; <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his <hi>Proem</hi> unto the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> gives this as the only Reason of the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the Name of the Writer of any <hi>Epistle,</hi> in the Frontispiece of it, otherwise than was done by <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Evangelists</hi> in their Writings; namely, because they wrote unto them that were <hi>present,</hi> and so had no cause to make mention of their own Names, which were well enough known without the premising of them in their Writings: whereas those who wrote <hi>Epistles,</hi> dealing with them that were <hi>absent,</hi> were necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to <hi>prefix their Names</hi> unto them, that they might know from whom they came. But yet this Reason is not absolutely satisfactory: for as they who <hi>prefixed not their Names</hi> to their Writings, wrote, not only for the use and Benefit of those that were <hi>present</hi> and knew them, but of all <hi>succeeding Ages,</hi> who knew them not; so many of them who did Preach and Write the Word of the Lord unto those that lived with them and knew them, yet <hi>prefixed their Names</hi> unto their Writings, as did the <hi>Prophets</hi> of Old, and some who did write <hi>Epistles</hi> to them who were absent, omitted so to do, as St. <hi>John,</hi> and the Author of this Epistle. The real cause then of prefixing the Names of any of the <hi>Apostles</hi> unto their Writings, was meerly the <hi>Introduction thereby of their Titles, as Apostles of Jesus Christ,</hi> and therein an Intimation of that <hi>Authority, by,</hi> and with which they wrote. This then was the true and only reason why the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> prefixed his Name unto his Epistles; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indeed this is omitted when he wrote unto some Churches where he was well known, and his <hi>Apostolical Power</hi> was sufficiently owned, because he joyned others with himself in his <hi>Salutation</hi> who were not <hi>Apostles,</hi> as the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Philippians, chap.</hi> 1. and the second of the <hi>Thessalonians</hi>: Unto all others, he still prefixeth this <hi>Title,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himself thereby to be one, so <hi>authorized</hi> to reveal the Mysteries of the Gospel, that they to whom he Wrote, were to acquiesce in his Authority, and to resolve their faith into the Revelation of the Will of God, made unto him, and by him, the Church being to be <hi>built on the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles.</hi> And hence it was, that when something he had taught, was called in question, and opposed, Writing in the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, and for their establishment in the Truth, whom before he had instructed, he doth in the <hi>entrance</hi> of his Writings, singularly and <hi>Emphatically</hi> mention this his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Paul an Apostle, neither of man, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father that raised him from the dead:</hi> so intimating the absolute obedience that was due unto the Doctrine by him revealed. By this <hi>Title,</hi> I say, he directs them to whom he wrote, to resolve their assent into the <hi>Authority</hi> of Christ speaking in him, which he tenders unto them as the proof and foundation of the <hi>Mysteries</hi> wherein they were instructed.</p>
                     <p>In his dealing with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> the case was far otherwise; They who believed amongst them, never changed the <hi>old foundation,</hi> or Church-State, grounded on the Scriptures, though they had a new addition of Priviledges by their Faith in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> as the <hi>Messiah</hi> now exhibited. And therefore he deals not with them, as with those whose Faith was built absolutely on <hi>Apostolical</hi> Authority and Revelation, but upon the common Principles of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> on which they still stood, and out of which <hi>Evangelical</hi> Faith was educed. Hence the beginning of the Epistle, wherein he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50110:25"/>
appeals to the <hi>Scripture</hi> as the foundation, that he intended to build upon, and the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> which he would press them withal, supplies the Room of that intimation of his <hi>Apostolical Authority,</hi> which in other places he maketh use of. And it serves to the very same purpose. For as in those <hi>Epistles</hi> he proposeth his <hi>Apostolical Authority</hi> as the immediate reason of their Assent and Obedience; so in this he doth the Scriptures of the Old Testament. And this is the <hi>true and proper cause,</hi> that renders the prefixing of his <hi>Apostolical Authority,</hi> which his Name must necessarily accompany, needless, because useless, it being that which he intended not to ingage in this business. And for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> he sufficiently declares in the <hi>close of his Epistle</hi> who he was; for though some may imagine that he is not so certainly known unto <hi>us,</hi> from what he there sayes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet none can be so fond to doubt whether he were not thereby known to <hi>them to whom he wrote</hi>; so that neither hath this <hi>Objection</hi> in it any thing of real weight or moment.</p>

The remaining Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which by some are insisted on, are taken from some passages in the Epistle it self; that principally of <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and the <hi>Third,</hi> where the <hi>Writer</hi> of it seems to reckon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, among the number, not of the Apostles, but of their <hi>Auditors.</hi> But whereas it is certain and evident, that the Epistle was written before the <hi>Destruction of the Temple,</hi> yea, the beginning of those Wars that ended therein, or the death of <hi>James,</hi> whilest sundry of the <hi>Apostles</hi> were yet alive, it cannot be, that the <hi>Penman</hi> of it should really place himself amongst the generation that succeeded them; so that the Words must of necessity admit of another Interpretation, as shall be manifested in its proper place; for whereas both <hi>this</hi> and other things of the same nature, must be considered and spoken unto, in the <hi>places</hi> where they occurr, I shall not here <hi>anticipate</hi> what of necessity must be insisted on in its due season; especially considering of how small importance the Objections taken from them, are. And this is the summ of what hath as yet by any been objected unto our assignation of this <hi>Epistle</hi> unto St. <hi>Paul</hi>; by the consideration whereof the <hi>Reader</hi> will be directed into the Judgement he is to make on the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Testimonies</hi> that we shall produce, in the Confirmation of our Assertion, and these we now proceed unto under the several Heads proposed in the entrance of our Discourse.</p>

So that if St. <hi>Peters</hi> Testimony may be received, St. <hi>Paul</hi> undoubtedly wrote an <hi>Epistle</hi> unto the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> But this may be, say some, <hi>another Epistle,</hi> and not this we treat on; particularly that to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> which treateth about <hi>Judaical Customs</hi> and Worship. But this Epistle mentioned by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> was written particularly unto the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in distinction from the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> This to the <hi>Galatians</hi> is written peculiarly to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Jewes</hi>; so that a more unhappy instance could not possibly have been fixed upon. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides he treats not in it of the things here mentioned by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which are indeed the main Subject of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, say others, <hi>Paul</hi> indeed might write an <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews,</hi> which may be <hi>lost,</hi> and this that we have, might be written by some other: But whence this <hi>Answer</hi> should proceed, but from a resolution <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, against Light and Conviction, I know not. May we give place to such rash and presumptuous Conjectures, we shall quickly have nothing left entire or stable. For why may not another as well say, it is true, <hi>Moses</hi> wrote Five Books, but they are lost, and these that we have under his Name, were written by another: It is not surely one jot less intolerable for any one, without ground, proof, or Testimony, to affirm that the Church hath lost an Epistle written to the <hi>Hebrews by</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and taken up one in the room thereof, written by no man knoweth whom. This is not to deal with that <hi>Holy Reverence</hi> in the things of God, which becomes us.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> declares that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that Epistle which he wrote unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> had <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>23</label> declared the <hi>Long-suffering of God,</hi> whereof he had minded them, <hi>to be salvation.</hi> We must see what was this <hi>Long-suffering of God,</hi> how it was <hi>Salvation,</hi> and how <hi>Paul</hi> had manifested it so to be. The <hi>Long-sufferance,</hi> Patience, or Forbearance of God, is either <hi>absolute</hi> toward man in general, or <hi>special</hi> in reference unto some sort of Men; or some kind of Sins or Provocations that are amongst them. The first of these is not that which is here intended; Nor was there any reason why St. <hi>Peter</hi> should direct the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Epistles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in particular to learn the <hi>Long-suffering of God in General,</hi> which is so plentifully revealed in the whole Scripture, both of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and only <hi>occasionly</hi> at any time mentioned by St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was therefore an Especial <hi>Long-suffering</hi> of God which at that time he exercised towards the <hi>Jews,</hi> waiting for the Conversion, and the gathering of his <hi>Elect</hi> unto him, before that total and final destruction, which they had deserved, should come upon that Church and State. This he compares to the <hi>Long-suffering of God in the dayes of Noah,</hi> whilest he Preached repentance unto the world, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 3.20. For as those that were <hi>obedient</hi> unto his Preaching which was only his own family, were <hi>saved in the Ark,</hi> from the general destruction that came upon the World by <hi>Water</hi>; so also they that became obedient upon the Preaching of the Gospel, during this new season of Gods special Long-suffering, were to be saved by <hi>Baptism,</hi> or Separation from the unbelieving Jews
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50110:26"/>
by the Profession of the Faith, from that destruction that was to come upon them by <hi>Fire.</hi> This <hi>Long-suffering</hi> of God the unbelieving Jews, not understanding to be <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> scoffed at, and them who threatned them with such an issue or event of it, 2 <hi>Epist. Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4. which causeth the Apostle to declare the <hi>Nature</hi> and End of this Long-suffering which they were ignorant of, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>And thus (Secondly,) was this particular <hi>Long-suffering of God</hi> towards the Jews, whilest the Gospel was Preached unto them before their final D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And (Thirdly,) This is declared by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epistle; not that this is formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in terms the main Doctrine of the Epistle, but that really and effectually he acquaints them with the <hi>intention</hi> of the Lord in his <hi>Long-suffering</hi> towards them, and peculiarly serves that <hi>Long-suffering</hi> of Christ in his Instruction of them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after he hath taught them the true Nature, Use and End of all <hi>Mosaical Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which they were as yet permitted to use in the special patience of God intimated by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and convinced them of the necessity of Faith in Christ, and the Profession of his Gospel, he winds up all his <hi>reasonings,</hi> in minding them of the <hi>End</hi> which shortly was to be put unto that <hi>Long-suffering</hi> of God which was then exercised towards them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26, 27, 28. So that this <hi>Note</hi> also is eminently <hi>Characteristical</hi> of this Epistle.</p>

In the Writing of the <hi>Epistle</hi> mentioned by <hi>Peter,</hi> he seems to ascribe unto <hi>Paul</hi> an <hi>eminency of Wisdom</hi>; it was written <hi>according to the Wisdom given unto him.</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> in all other of his Epistles did exercise that Grace of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> so also in that which he wrote unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> there is no doubt but he exerted and put forth his other Graces of <hi>Knowledge, Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> also; but yet <hi>Peter</hi> here in a way of Eminency marketh his <hi>Wisdom</hi> in that Epistle. It is not <hi>Pauls</hi> Spiritual <hi>Wisdom</hi> in general in the Knowledge of the Will of God, and Mysteries of the Gospel, which <hi>Peter</hi> here refers unto; but that <hi>special Holy Prudence</hi> which he exercised in the composure of this Epistle, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth which he dealt with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> about. And what an eminent <hi>Character</hi> this also is of this Epistle, we shall endeavour, God assisting to evince in our <hi>Exposition</hi> of it. His special <hi>understanding</hi> in all the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Old Testament, <hi>unfolding</hi> things <hi>hidden</hi> from the foundation of the world, his <hi>Application</hi> of them, with various <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> and Arguments that wrapped up the Truth in great Darkness and Obscurity, unto the Mysterie of <hi>God manifested in the Flesh,</hi> his various intertextures of <hi>Reasonings</hi> and <hi>Exhortations</hi> throughout his Epistle, his <hi>Condescention</hi> to the Capacity, Prejudices and Affections of them to whom he wrote, urging them constantly with their <hi>own Principles</hi> and Concessions, do among many other things manifest the <hi>singular Wisdom</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> signifies to have been used in this Work.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It may also be observed, that whereas <hi>Peter</hi> affirms that among the things about which <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, there were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>I have insisted the longer upon this <hi>Testimony,</hi> because in my Judgement it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of its self to determine this Controversie; nothing of any importance being by any that I can meet withall excepted unto it. But because we want not other Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of our Assertion, and those also every <hi>one</hi> of them singly out-ballancing the Conjectures that are advanced against it, we shall subjoyn them also in their Order.</p>

Unto their Judgement therefore alone in it do we appeal. Now the <hi>similitude</hi> between <hi>this</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Epistles of <hi>Paul</hi> is threefold. (1.) In <hi>Words,</hi> Phrases and manner of Expression.

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:50110:26"/>But this I shall not <hi>particularly</hi> insist upon: partly because it hath already been done by <hi>others</hi> at large; and partly because they will all of them be observed in our Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition its self; nor doth it suit our present design to enter into a Debate about particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Words and Expressions. Nor do I assign any more <hi>force</hi> unto this Observation, but only that it is sufficient to manifest the weakness of the <hi>Exceptions</hi> urged by some to prove it none of his, from the use of some few words not elsewhere used by him, or not in that <hi>sense</hi> which here they are applyed unto. For their <hi>Instances</hi> are not in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber comparable with the other; and to evidence the <hi>Vanity</hi> of that part of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which concerns the peculiar use of some Words in this Epistle, it is enough to observe that one word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> being three times used in this one <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> it hath in each place a <hi>peculiar</hi> and divers signification. (2.) There is also a <hi>coincidence of Matter,</hi> or Doctrines delivered in this and other Epistles of <hi>Paul.</hi> Neither shall I much press this Consideration. For neither was he in <hi>any Epistle</hi> restrained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what he had <hi>elsewhere</hi> delivered, nor bound to avoid the mentioning of it, if occasion did require; nor were other Penmen of the Holy Ghost limited not to <hi>treat</hi> of what he had taught, no more than the <hi>Evangelists</hi> were from writing the same story. But yet neither is this Observation <hi>destitute</hi> of all efficacy to contribute strength unto our Assertion, considering that there were some Doctrines which <hi>Paul</hi> did in a peculiar manner insist upon; a vein whereof, a diligent Observer may find running through this, and all his other Epistles. But, (3.) That which under this Head I would press, is the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Spirit, Genius,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <hi>manner of Writing</hi> proceeding from them, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to this <hi>Apostle</hi> in all his Epistles. Many things are required to enable any one to judge aright of this intimation. He must as <hi>Bernard</hi> speaks, <hi>drink of Pauls Spirit,</hi> or be made partaker of the same Spirit with him, in his measure, <hi>who would understand his Writings.</hi> Without this Spirit, and his saving Light, they are all <hi>obscure,</hi> intricate, sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, unsavoury; when unto them in whom it is, they are all <hi>sweet, gracious,</hi> in some measure <hi>open,</hi> plain and powerful. A great and constant <hi>exercise</hi> unto an acquaintance with his frame of Spirit in Writing, is also necessary hereunto. Unless a man have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted as it were a <hi>familiarity,</hi> by a constant conversation with him, no <hi>Critical</hi> skill in Words or Phrases will render him a competent Judge in this matter. This enabled <hi>Caesar</hi> to determine aright concerning any Writings of <hi>Cicero.</hi> And he that is so acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this Apostle, will be able to discern his <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> sayes his Mother <hi>Monica</hi> did divine <hi>Revelations, nescio quo sapore,</hi> by an inexpressable Spiritual savour. Experience also of the power and efficacy of his Writings, is hereunto required. He whose heart is cast into the <hi>Mould of the Doctrine</hi> by him delivered, will receive quick impressions from his Spirit exerting its self in any of his Writings. He that is thus prepared, will <hi>find that Heavenliness</hi> and perspicuity in unfolding the deepest <hi>Evangelical Mysteries,</hi> that peculiar <hi>exaltation</hi> of Jesus Christ in his Person, Office and Work, that Spiritual <hi>persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness,</hi> that transcendent <hi>manner</hi> of Arguing and Reasoning, that wise <hi>insinuation</hi> and pathetical pressing of well grounded Exhortations, that <hi>Love,</hi> Tenderness, and Affection to the Souls of men, that <hi>Zeal</hi> for God, and <hi>Authority</hi> in Teaching, which enliven and adorn all his other Epistles, to shine in this in an eminent manner, from the beginning to the End of it. And this Consideration what ever may be the apprehensions of others concerning it, is that which gives me satisfaction, above all that are pleaded in this Cause in ascribing this Epistle to <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Testimony of the first Churches,</hi> of whose Testimony any record is yet remaining,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>26</label> with a <hi>successive Suffrage</hi> of the most Knowing Persons of following Ages, may also be pleaded in this Cause. Setting aside that <hi>limitation</hi> of this Testimony, which with the grounds and occasions of it as to some in the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> we have already <hi>granted</hi> and declared, and this Witness will be acknowledged to be <hi>Catholick</hi> as to all other Churches in the World. A Learned Man of late hath reckoned up and reported the Words of above <hi>thirty</hi> of the <hi>Greek Fathers,</hi> and <hi>fifty</hi> of the <hi>Latin</hi> reporting this Primitive Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I shall not trouble the Reader with a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of their Names, nor the Repetition of their Words, and that because the <hi>whole</hi> of what in general we assert as to the <hi>Eastern Church</hi> is acknowledged. Amongst them was this Epistle first made <hi>publick,</hi> as they had far more advantages of discovering the Truth in this Matter of Fact, than any in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or that elsewhere followed them in <hi>after Ages</hi> could have. Neither had they any thing, but the Conviction and Evidence of <hi>Truth</hi> its self to induce them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this Perswasion. And he that shall consider the Condition of the <hi>first Churches</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Persecution, and what difficulties they met withal in <hi>Communicating</hi> those Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Writings which were delivered unto any of them, with that special Obstruction

unto the spreading of this unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> of which we have already discoursed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>rationally</hi> otherwise conceive of it, but as an eminent fruit of the Good Providence of God, that it should so soon receive so <hi>publick an Attestation</hi> from the first Churches, as it evidently appears to have done.</p>

                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>27</label> The <hi>Epistle it self</hi> several wayes <hi>discovers</hi> its Author. Some of them we shall briefly recount.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>General Argument</hi> and Scope of it declares it to be <hi>Pauls.</hi> Hereof there are two parts: (1.) The <hi>Exaltation</hi> of the Person, Office, and Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, with the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the Gospel and the Worship therein commanded, revealed by him. (2.) A <hi>Discovery of the Nature, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>se and Expiration</hi> of Mosaical Institutions, their present Unprofitableness, and ceasing of their obligation unto obedience. The <hi>first</hi> part, we may grant to have been <hi>equally</hi> the design of all the Apostles, though we find it in a peculiar way insisted on in the Writings of <hi>Paul.</hi> The <hi>latter</hi> was his special work and business. This partly <hi>ex instituto,</hi> partly <hi>occasionally</hi> from the opposition of the Jews, was he ingaged in the promotion of, all the world over. The <hi>Apostles</hi> of the <hi>Circumcision</hi> according to the Wisdom given them, and suitable to the nature of their work, did more <hi>accommodate</hi> themselves to the prejudicate Opinion of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors; and the <hi>rest</hi> of the Apostles had little occasion to deal with them, or others on this subject. <hi>Paul</hi> in an eminent manner in this work bare the <hi>burthen</hi> of that day. Having well setled <hi>all other Churches,</hi> who were troubled in this Controversie by some of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he at last treats with themselves <hi>directly</hi> in this Epistle, giving an account of what he had elsewhere <hi>Preached</hi> and taught to this purpose, and the grounds that he proceeded upon; and this not without great success, as the burying of the <hi>Judaical</hi> Controversie not long after doth manifest.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>Method</hi> of his proceedure is the same with that of his other Epistles, which also was peculiar unto him. Now this in <hi>most</hi> of them, yea in all of them not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by some <hi>particular occasions,</hi> is first to lay down the <hi>Doctrinal Mysteries</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, vindicating them from Oppositions and Exceptions, and then to descend to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations unto Obedience deduced from them, with an enumeration of such <hi>special Moral Duties,</hi> as those unto whom he wrote, stood in need to be minded of. This is the <hi>general Method</hi> of his Epistles, to the <hi>Romans, Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians,</hi> and the most of the rest. And this also is observed in this Epistle. Only whereas he had a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al respect unto the <hi>Apostacy</hi> of some of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> occasioned by the Persecution which then began to grow high against them, what ever Argument or Testimony in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage gave him advantage to press an <hi>Exhortation</hi> unto constancy, and to deterr them from <hi>back-sliding,</hi> he layes hold upon it, and diverts into <hi>practical</hi> Inferences unto that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, before he comes to his general <hi>Exhortations</hi> towards the end of the Epistle. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting this <hi>occasional</hi> difference, the <hi>Method</hi> of this is the same with that used in the other Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> and which was <hi>peculiarly</hi> his own.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) His <hi>Way of Argument</hi> in this and his other Epistles is the same. Now this as we shall see, is <hi>Sublime</hi> and <hi>Mystical,</hi> accommodated rather to the <hi>Spiritual Reason</hi> of Believers, than the <hi>Artificial Rules</hi> of Philosophers. That he should more abound with <hi>Testimonies</hi> and Quotations out of the Scripture of the Old Testament in this, than other Epistles, as he doth, the <hi>Matter</hi> whereof he treats, and the <hi>Persons</hi> to whom he wrote did necessarily require.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Many things</hi> in this Epistle evidently manifest that he who wrote it, was not only <hi>mighty</hi> in the Scripture, but also exceedingly well <hi>versed</hi> and skillfull in the <hi>Customs,</hi> Practices, Opinions, <hi>Traditions,</hi> Expositions and Applications of Scripture then received in the <hi>Judaical Church,</hi> as we shall fully manifest in our progress: Now who in those dayes among the <hi>Disciples</hi> of Christ could this be but <hi>Paul?</hi> For as <hi>he</hi> was brought up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one of the <hi>Best</hi> and <hi>Most Famous</hi> of their Masters in those dayes, <hi>and profited in the Knowledge of their</hi> then present Religion <hi>above his Equals,</hi> so for want of this kind of Learning, the Jews esteemed the chief of the other Apostles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to be <hi>Ideots and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">(5.) Sundry particulars <hi>towards</hi> and in the <hi>close</hi> of the Epistle, openly proclaim <hi>Paul</hi> to have been the Writer of it. As, 1. The mention that he makes of <hi>his bonds, and the Compassion that the</hi> Hebrews <hi>shewed towards him in his sufferings,</hi> and whilest he was a Prisoner, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.34. Now as the <hi>Bonds of Paul</hi> were afterwards famous at <hi>Rome, Phil.</hi> 1.13. So there was not any thing of greater notoriety in reference to the Church of God in those dayes, than those that he suffered in <hi>Judaea</hi>; which he minds them of in this Expression. With what earnest endeavours, what <hi>rage</hi> and tumult, the <hi>Rulers</hi> and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50110:27"/>
of the People sought his destruction, how <hi>publickly</hi> and with what Solemnity his <hi>Cause</hi> was sundry times heard and debated, with the time of his imprisonment that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, are all declared in the <hi>Acts</hi> at large. Now no man can imagine, but that whilest this <hi>great Champion</hi> of their Profession, was so <hi>publickly pleading</hi> their Cause, and exposed to so much danger and hazzard thereby, but that all the Believers of those parts were exceedingly solicitous about his condition, (as they had been about <hi>Peters</hi> in the like case) and gave him all the Assistance and encouragement that they were able. This <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion</hi> of theirs, and his own <hi>Bonds,</hi> as an evidence of his <hi>Faith,</hi> and their <hi>Mutual Love</hi> in the Gospel he now minds them of. Of no other Person but <hi>Paul</hi> have we any ground to conjecture that this might be spoken: and yet the <hi>suffering and compassion</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, seem not to have been <hi>things done in a corner</hi>; So that this one Circumstance is able of its self, to enervate all the <hi>Exceptions,</hi> that are made use of against his being esteemed the Author of this Epistle. 2. The mention of <hi>Pauls</hi> dear and constant Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Timothy</hi> is of the same importance, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.23. That <hi>Timothy</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Paul</hi> in his Bonds is expresly asserted, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.13, 14.

The exceptions of some, as that <hi>Paul</hi> used to call <hi>Timothy</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> whereas the Writer of this Epistle calls him <hi>Brother,</hi> (when indeed he never terms him Son, when he speaks <hi>of</hi> him, but only when he wrote <hi>unto</hi> him,) or that there might be another <hi>Timothy,</hi> (when he speaks expresly of him, who was so generally known to the Churches of God, as one of the chiefest Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists) deserve not to be insisted on. And surely, it is altogether incredible that this <hi>Timothy,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> as to his begetting of him in the Faith, and continued Paternal Affection, his <hi>known</hi> constant <hi>Associate</hi> in doing and suffering for the Gospel, his <hi>Minister</hi> in attending of him, and constantly <hi>imployed</hi> by him in the Service of Christ and the Churches, <hi>known</hi> unto them by his means, <hi>hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>time</hi> fixed on, was about the death of <hi>Festus,</hi> who dyed in the <hi>Province,</hi> and the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> beginning of the Government of <hi>Albinus</hi> who was sent to succeed him. What was the state of the people at that <hi>time, Josephus</hi> declares at <hi>large</hi> in his <hi>Second Book of their Wars.</hi> In brief, the Governours themselves being great Oppressors, and rather mighty Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers amongst them, than Rulers, the whole Nation was filled with Spoil and Violence. What through the fury and outrage of the <hi>Souldiers</hi> in the pursuit of their insatiable Avarice; what through the Incursions of <hi>Thieves</hi> and Robbers in Troops and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, wherewith the whole Land abounded, and what through the tumults of Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons daily incited and provoked by the cruelty of the <hi>Romans,</hi> there was no peace or safety for any sober honest men, either in the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or any where else throughout the whole Province. That the <hi>Church</hi> had a great share of suffering, in the outrage and misery of those dayes, (as in such dissolutions of Government, and Licence for all wickedness, it commonly falls out) no man can question. And this is that which the <hi>Apostle</hi> mentions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Ye endured a great sight of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>flictions, and partly whilest ye became companions of them that were so used, and took joyfully the spoyling of your goods.</hi> This was the lot and portion of all honest and sober minded men in <hi>those dayes,</hi> as their <hi>Historian</hi> at large declares. For as no doubt the <hi>Christians</hi> had a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal share in all those sufferings, so some others of the <hi>Jews</hi> also, were their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in them; it being not a special <hi>persecution,</hi> but a general <hi>calamity</hi> that the Apostle speaks of.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Joseph</hi> the Son of <hi>Caehias</hi> was in the beginning of those dayes High-Priest, put into <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> that Office by <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who not long before had put him out. On the death of <hi>Festus</hi> he thrust him out again, and placed <hi>Ananus</hi> his Son in his stead. This man, a young rash Fellow, by Sect and Opinion a <hi>Sadduce,</hi> (who of all others were the most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in their hatred of the <hi>Christians,</hi> being especially ingaged therein by the peculiar <hi>Opinion</hi> of their Sect and Party, which was the denyal of the Resurrection) first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a direct Persecution of the Church. Before his advancement to the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> their Afflictions and Calamities were for the most part common unto them, with other peaceable men. Only the <hi>rude and impious multitude,</hi> with other seditious persons, seem to have offered especial violences unto their <hi>Assemblies</hi> and <hi>Meetings,</hi> which some of the more unsteadfast and weak, began to <hi>omit</hi> on that account, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Judicial</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding against them as to their lives, when this <hi>Epistle</hi> was written, there doth not appear to have been any; for the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells them, as we before observed, that as yet they had <hi>not resisted unto blood, Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 4. But this <hi>Ananus</hi> the <hi>Sadduce</hi> presently after being placed in power by <hi>Agrippa,</hi> taking advantage at the death of <hi>Festus,</hi> and the time that passed before <hi>Albinus</hi> his Successor was setled in the <hi>Province,</hi> convents <hi>James</hi> before himself and his Associates. There to make short work he is condemned, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>stoned.</hi> And it is not unlikely but that other private Persons suffered together with him.</p>

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:50110:29"/>But that which seems most especially to have perplexed them, was their relinquishment of that <hi>Worship of God</hi> whereunto they had been so zealously addicted.

For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all the danger of their abode in <hi>Jerusalem and Judaea,</hi> and so of falling in the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>City</hi> and People, all the Fears the Apostle had of their <hi>Apostasie</hi> into <hi>Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism</hi>; all their own disconsolations in reference unto their <hi>flight</hi> and departure, arose from their adherence unto, and zeal for the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> by declaring unto them the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Use, End and Expiration of his Ordinances and Institutions, he utterly removes and takes away the ground and occasion of all the Evils mentioned. This was the season wherein this <hi>Epistle</hi> was written; and these some of the principal occasions (though it had other reasons also, as we shall see afterwards) of its Writing. And I no way doubt, (though particular events of those dayes are buried in Oblivion) but that through his Grace who moved and directed the <hi>Apostle</hi> unto, and in the Writing of it, it was made signally effectual towards the <hi>professing Hebrews,</hi> both to free them from that <hi>yoke of bondage</hi> wherein they had been detained, and to prepare them with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness unto the observation of <hi>Evangelical</hi> Worship, leaving their Countreymen to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in their Sin and Unbelief.</p>

The main Reason which induced them to embrace this perswasion, was a desire to free the <hi>Epistle</hi> from an exception against its being written by <hi>Paul</hi>; taken from the dissimilitude of the <hi>Style</hi> used in it, unto that of his other Epistles. This being once admitted, though <hi>causelesly,</hi> they could think of no better answer, than that this supposed difference of <hi>Style,</hi> arose from the <hi>Translation</hi> of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> which by the Apostle himself was first written in <hi>Hebrew. Clemens Romanus</hi> is the person generally fixed on as the Author of this Translation; though some do faintly intimate that <hi>Luke the Evangelist</hi> might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be the man that did it.

                  </p>
                  <p>For (1.) If this Epistle was written <hi>Originally</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> whence comes it pass, that no Copy of it in that Language, was ever read, seen, or heard of, by the most diligent <hi>Collectors</hi> of all Fragments of Antiquity in the Primitive times? Had ever any such thing been extant, whence came it in particular that <hi>Origen,</hi> that <hi>prodigie</hi> of Industry and Learning, should be able to attain no knowledge or report of it? (2.) If it were incumbent on <hi>Paul</hi> writing unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to <hi>write</hi> in their own <hi>Language,</hi> why did he not also write in <hi>Latin</hi> unto the <hi>Romans?</hi> That he did so indeed <hi>Gratian</hi> affirms, but without pretence of proof or witness, contrary to the Testimony of all <hi>Antiquity,</hi> the evidence of the thing it self, and constant confession of the <hi>Roman Church</hi>: And <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> sayes well on Rom. 1.7. <hi>Coarguendus vel ridendus magis error eorum, qui putant Paulum Romanis linguâ Romanâ scripsisle. The error of them is to be reproved, or rather laughed at, who suppose</hi> Paul <hi>to have written unto the</hi> Romans <hi>in the Latin Tongue.</hi> (3.) It is most unduly supposed that the <hi>Hebrew Tongue</hi> was then the <hi>Vulgar</hi> common <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when it was known only to the <hi>Learned</hi> amongst them, and a corrupt <hi>Syriack</hi> was the common <hi>Dialect</hi> of the people even at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> (4.) It is as unduly averred, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> was the <hi>Mother Tongue</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> himself, or that he was ignorant of the <hi>Greek,</hi> seeing he was born at <hi>Tarsus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where that was the Language that he was brought up in, and unto. (5.) The <hi>Epistle</hi> was written for the Use of all the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in their several dispersions, especially that in the <hi>East,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> witnesseth, they being all alike concerned in the matter of it, though not so immediately as those in <hi>Judaea</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Now unto those the <hi>Greek</hi> Language from the dayes of the <hi>Macedonian Empire,</hi> had been in <hi>vulgar</hi> use, and continued so to be. (6.) The <hi>Greek Tongue</hi> was so well known and so much used in <hi>Judaea</hi> its self, that as a Learned man hath proved by sundry Testimonies out of their most antient writings, it was called the <hi>Vulgar</hi> amongst them.</p>
                  <p>I know among the <hi>Rabbins</hi> there is mention of a prohibition of learning the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; and in the <hi>Jerusalem Talmud</hi> its self, <hi>Tit. Peah. cap.</hi> 1. they add a reason of it; <gap reason="foreign">

none understand them. But as this is contrary unto what themselves teach about the <hi>Knowledge of Tongues,</hi> required in those who were to be chosen into the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> so it is sufficiently disproved by the instances of the <hi>Translators of the Bible, Jesus Syrachides, Philo, Josephus,</hi> and others among themselves. And though <hi>Josephus</hi> affirm, <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. that the Study of the <hi>Elegance of Tongues</hi> was of no great reckoning amongst them, yet he grants that they were studied by all sorts of men.

of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> Very many others there are which he either <hi>alludes</hi> unto, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, that are not of our present consideration. Neither are these here proposed to be <hi>unfolded</hi> as to the sense of them, or as to the removal of the difficulties that the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them by him, is attended withall. This is the proper work of the <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> of the Epistle intended. All at present aimed at, is to present them in one view, with their Agreement, and Differences from the <hi>Original</hi> and Translations, that we may the better judge of his manner of proceeding in the citing of them, and what <hi>Rule</hi> he observed therein. And what in <hi>general</hi> may be concluded from that prospect we have taken of them, I shall offer in the ensuing Observations.</p>
                     <p>First, It is evident that they are exceedingly mistaken, who affirm that the <hi>Apostle cites</hi>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>15</label> all his Testimonies out of the <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>LXX.</hi> as we intimated, that it is by some pleaded, in the close of the preceding Discourse. The words he useth in very few of them agree exactly with that <hi>Greek Version</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> which is now extant; though, apparently since the writing of this <hi>Epistle</hi> it hath grown in its <hi>Verball</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto the <hi>Allegations</hi> as reported in the New. And in most of them he varieth from it, either in the <hi>use</hi> of his own Liberty, or in a more exact rendring of the <hi>Original</hi> Text. This the first <hi>prospect</hi> of the places and words compared will evince. Should he have had any respect unto that <hi>Translation,</hi> it were impossible to give any tolerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, whence he should so much differ from it, almost in every <hi>quotation,</hi> as is plain that he doth.</p>
                     <p>It is also undeniably manifest from this view of his words that the Apostle did not <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>16</label> 
                        <hi>scrupulously</hi> confine himself unto the precise words either of the <hi>Original,</hi> or any <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation</hi> whatever, if any other <hi>Translation</hi> or <hi>Targum</hi> were then extant besides that of the <hi>LXX.</hi> Observing and expressing the sense of the Testimonies which he thought meet to produce and make use of, he used great Liberty, as did other <hi>holy Writers</hi> of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> according to the guidance of the Holy Ghost by whose inspiration he wrote, in expressing them by words of his own And who shall blame him for so doing? Who should bind him to the Rules of <hi>Quotations,</hi> which sometimes Necessity, sometimes Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity, sometimes the Cavils of other men impose upon us in our Writings? Herein the <hi>Apostle</hi> used that Liberty which the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> gave unto him, without the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice unto Truth, or the Faith of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Whereas any of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>17</label> first view to be <hi>applyed</hi> by him unsuitably unto their <hi>Original</hi> importance and intention, we shall manifest, not only the contrary to be true, against those who have made such Exceptions, but also that he makes use of those which were most proper and <hi>cogent,</hi> with respect unto them with whom he had to do. For the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> as shall be fully evidenced, disputes upon the acknowledged Principles and Concessions of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> It was then incumbent on him to make use of such Testimonies, as were granted in their Church to belong unto the ends and purposes, for which by him they were produced. And that these are such, shall be evinced from their own antient <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> and Traditions.</p>
                     <p>The Principal difficulty about these <hi>Citations,</hi> lyes in those wherein the words of the <label type="milestone">

                        </gap>, <hi>but a Body hast thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared me.</hi> That the Apostle doth rightly interpret the meaning of the Holy Ghost in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> and in his <hi>Paraphrase</hi> apply the words unto that very end for which they were intended, shall be cleared afterwards. The present difficulty concerns the <hi>Coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of his words, with those of the <hi>LXX.</hi> where apparently they answer not the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</hi> The next is that of the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, <hi>and I regarded them not,</hi> or despised them. The third is that from <hi>Habak.</hi> 2.4. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning these, and some other places many confidently affirm, that the <hi>Apostle</hi>

with some others proceed farther, and assign the rise of this difference unto some other <hi>Copies</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text used by the <hi>LXX.</hi> varying from those which now remain. Thus in particular, in that place of <hi>Jeremy</hi> before mentioned, he conjectures that for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> they read <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> to the same purpose; for of such conjectures there is no end. But as <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> may well signifie as the Apostle expounds it, and in other places doth so, as we shall see afterwards, so this boldness in correcting the Text, and fancying without proof, Testimony or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of other <hi>antient Copies</hi> of the Scripture of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> differing in many things from <hi>them</hi> which alone remain, and which indeed were ever in the world, may quickly prove pernicious to the Church of God. We must therefore look after another expedient for the removal of this difficulty.</p>

And thus in those Testimonies where there is a real variation from the <hi>Hebrew Original,</hi> the Apostle took not his words from the <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>LXX,</hi> but his words were afterwards inserted into that <hi>Translation.</hi> And this as we have partly made to appear already in sundry <hi>instances,</hi> so it shall now briefly be farther confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

                        <hi>First,</hi> Whereas the Reasons of the <hi>Apostle</hi> for his <hi>Application</hi> of the <hi>Testimonies</hi> used by him in his words and expressions, are evident, as shall in particular be made to appear, so no Reason can be assigned, why the <hi>LXX.</hi> (if any such <hi>LXX.</hi> there were) who translated the Old Testament, or any other Translators of it, should so render the words of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. Neither <hi>Various Lections,</hi> nor ambiguity of signification in the words of the <hi>Original</hi> can in most of them be pleaded. For instance, The Apostle in applying those words of the <hi>Psalmist, Psalm</hi> 40. <gap reason="foreign">

When any man then can give a tolerable conjecture, why the <hi>LXX.</hi> should be inclined thus to translate these words, I shall consider it. In the mean time I judge there is much more ground to suppose, that the Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions which he had weighty cause to use, were by some inserted into the <hi>Greek Text</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> than that a <hi>Translation,</hi> which those that made it, had no cause so to do, evidently forsaking the proper meaning of very obvious words, and their sense, known to themselves, should be taken up and used by the Apostle unto his purpose.</p>

And why may we not think that some <hi>whole sentences</hi> might on the same account be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in some of them, which being of more importance found a more general accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

And may we not as well think, nay is it not more likely, that they would insert his words into the places from whence they knew his Testimonies were taken, with a very little alteration of the <hi>antient Reading,</hi> than that they would wholly <hi>intrude</hi> them into the places from whence they were not taken by him, which yet unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably hath been done, and that with success.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>1</label> THe <hi>Jews</hi> at the Time of writing this <hi>Epistle</hi> (and their posterity in all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generations, follow their Example and Tradition) were not a little confirmed in their obstinacy and unbelief, by a misapprehension of the true sense and nature of the <hi>Promises</hi> of the Old Testament. For whereas they found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny glorious <hi>Promises</hi> made unto the <hi>Church</hi> in the dayes of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> especially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the great access of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> unto it, they looked upon themselves, the posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> on the account of their being his children according to the flesh, as the first, proper, and indeed <hi>only</hi> subject of them, unto whom in their accomplishment others were to be <hi>proselyted</hi> and joyned, the substance and foundation of the <hi>Church</hi> remaining still with them. But the <hi>Event</hi> answered not their expectation. Instead of inheriting all the <hi>Promises</hi> meerly upon their <hi>carnal</hi> interest and priviledge, which they looked for, and continue so to do unto this day, they found that themselves must come in on a <hi>new account,</hi> to be sharers in them in common with others, or be rejected, whilest those others were admitted unto the inheritance. This filled them with wrath and envy, which greatly added to the strengthening of their Unbelief. They could not bear with patience an intimation of letting out the <hi>Vineyard to other Husbandmen.</hi> With this Principle and Prejudice of theirs the <hi>Apostle</hi> dealt directly in his Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Chap.</hi> 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>On the same grounds he proceedeth with them in this <hi>Epistle</hi>; And because his <hi>Answer</hi> to their Objection from the <hi>Promises,</hi> lyes at the foundation of many of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings with them, the nature of it must be here previously explained. Not that I shall here enter into a consideration of the Jews Argument to prove the <hi>Messiah</hi> not yet to be come, because the <hi>Promises</hi> in their sense of them, are not yet accomplished, which shall be fully removed in the <hi>Close of these Discourses,</hi> but only as I said, open the nature in general of that <hi>Answer</hi> which our <hi>Apostle</hi> returns unto them, and builds his Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them upon.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> We shall have occasion afterwards at large to shew, how after the entrance of sin, God founded his Church in the <hi>Promise</hi> of the <hi>Messiah</hi> given unto <hi>Adam.</hi> Now though that <hi>Promise</hi> was the supportment and incouragement of mankind to seek the Lord, a <hi>Promise</hi> absolutely considered proceeding from meer Grace and Mercy, yet as it was the foundation of the Church, it included in it the nature of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> vertually requiring a re-stipulation unto <hi>obedience</hi> in them who by faith come to have an interest therein. And this the nature of the thing its self required; for the <hi>Promise</hi> was given unto this end and purpose, that men might have a new bottom and Foundation of Obedience; that of the first Covenant being disannulled. Hence in the following Explications of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> this condition of <hi>Obedience</hi> is expresly added. So upon its renewall unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> God required that he should <hi>walk before him and be upright.</hi> This <hi>Promise</hi> then, as it hath the nature of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> including the Grace that God would shew unto sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and the Obedience that he required from them, was from the the first giving of it, the foundation of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the whole Worship of God therein.</p>
                  <p>Unto this <hi>Church</hi> so founded and built on this <hi>Covenant,</hi> and by the means thereof the <hi>Redeeming Mediatory Seed</hi> promised therein, were all the following <hi>Promises,</hi> and the <hi>Priviledges</hi> exhibited in them, given and annexed. Neither hath, or ever had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Person, any Spiritual right unto, or interest in any of those <hi>Promises</hi> or <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi> whatever his outward condition were, but only by vertue of his <hi>Membership</hi> in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50110:35"/>
the Church built on the <hi>Covenant,</hi> whereunto as we said, they do all appertain. On this account the <hi>Church</hi> before the dayes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though scattered up and down in the world, and subject unto many changes in its worship by the addition of New <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> was still but one and the same; because founded in the same <hi>Covenant,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted thereby in all the Benefits or Priviledges, that God had given or granted, or would do so at any time unto his Church.</p>
                  <p>In process of time, God was pleased to confine this Church, as unto the <hi>ordinary</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> dispensation of his Grace, unto the Person and Posterity of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Upon this restriction of the Church, Covenant, and Promise, the <hi>Jews</hi> of old mannaged a Plea in their own <hi>Justification</hi> against the Doctrine of the Lord Christ and his Apostles. We are the children, the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was their continual cry; on the account whereof, they presumed that all the Promises belonged unto them, and upon the matter unto them alone. And this their perswasion hath cast them, as we shall see, upon a woful and fatal mistake. Two Priviledges did God grant unto <hi>Abraham</hi> upon his <hi>Separation</hi> to a special interest in the Old <hi>Promise</hi> and Covenant.</p>
                  <p>First, That according to the <hi>flesh,</hi> he should be the Father of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised seed, who was the very Life of the Covenant, the Fountain and Cause of all the Blessings contained in it. That this Priviledge was <hi>temporary,</hi> having a limited season, time and end appointed unto it, the very nature of the thing it self doth demonstrate. For upon this actual Exhibition in the <hi>flesh,</hi> it was to cease. In pursuit hereof, were his posterity separated from the rest of the world, and preserved a peculiar people, that through them the promised seed might be brought forth in the fulness of time, and be of them <hi>according unto the flesh, Rom.</hi> 9.5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Together with this, he had also another <hi>Priviledge</hi> granted unto him, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that his faith whereby he was personally interested in the Covenant should be the <hi>Pattern</hi> of the faith of the Church in all generations, and that none should ever come to be a member of it, or a sharer in its Blessings, but by the same faith that he had fixed on the <hi>seed</hi> that was in the Promise, to be brought forth from him in the world. On the account of this <hi>Priviledge,</hi> he became the <hi>Father</hi> of all them that do believe; For they that are of the faith, the <hi>same are the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. as also <hi>Heirs of the World</hi>; Rom. 4.13. in that all that should believe throughout the world, bring thereby implanted into the Covenant made with him, should become his <hi>spiritual children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Answerable unto this twofold end of the separation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was a double <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> 
                     <hi>seed</hi> allotted unto him. A seed according to the <hi>flesh,</hi> separated to the bringing forth of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> according unto the flesh: and a <hi>seed</hi> according to the Promise, that is, such as by faith should have interest in the Promise, or all the <hi>Elect</hi> of God. Not that these two <hi>seeds</hi> were alwayes <hi>subjectively</hi> divers; so that the seed separated to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the <hi>Messiah</hi> in the <hi>flesh,</hi> should neither in whole or in part be also the seed according to the <hi>promise</hi>; or on the contrary, that the seed according to the <hi>promise,</hi> should none of it, be his seed after the flesh. Our Apostle declares the contrary in the instances of <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> with the <hi>remnant of Israel</hi> that shall be saved, <hi>Romans Chap.</hi> 9, 10, 11. But sometimes the same <hi>seed</hi> came under divers considerations, being the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> both according to the <hi>flesh</hi> and according to the <hi>Promise</hi>; and sometimes the seed it self was divers, those according to the <hi>flesh</hi> being not of the <hi>Promise,</hi> and so on the contrary. Thus <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the flesh, separated unto the bringing forth of the <hi>Messiah</hi> after the flesh, because they were his carnal Posterity, and they were also of the seed of the Promise, because by their own personal faith they were interested in the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father. Multitudes afterwards were of the carnal seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the number of the people separated to bring forth the <hi>Messiah</hi> in the flesh, and yet were not of the seed according to the <hi>Promise,</hi> nor interested in the spiritual blessings of the Covenant, because they did not personally believe, as our <hi>Apostle</hi> declares, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. of this <hi>Epistle.</hi> And many afterwards, who were not of the <hi>carnal seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor interested in the priviledge of bringing forth the <hi>Messiah</hi> in the flesh, were yet designed to be made his spiritual seed by faith, that in them he might become <hi>heir of the world,</hi> and all Nations of the Earth be blessed in him. Now it is evident, that it is the <hi>second Priviledge</hi> and spiritual seed, wherein the Church to whom the Promises are made, is founded, and whereof it doth consist; namely in them, who by Faith are interested in the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whether they be of the carnal seed or no.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> And herein lay the great mistake of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, wherein they are followed by their Posterity unto this day. They thought no more was needfull to interest them in the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but that they were his seed according to the flesh. And they constantly pleaded the latter Priviledge, as the ground and Reason of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. It is true, they were the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the <hi>flesh</hi>; but on that account they can have no other Priviledge than <hi>Abraham</hi> had in the flesh himself. And this was, as we have shewed, that he should be set apart as a speciall channel, through whose loins God would derive the promised seed into the world. In like manner were they separated to be a peculiar People as his Posterity, from amongst whom he should be so brought forth.</p>
                  <p>That this <hi>Separation</hi> and Priviledge were to cease, when the end of it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, and the <hi>Messiah</hi> exhibited, the very nature of the thing declares. For to what purpose should it be continued, when that was fully effected whereunto it was designed? But they would extend this Priviledge, and mix it with the other, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that because they were the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the flesh, the whole Blessing and Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> belonged unto them. But as our Saviour proved that in the latter sense they were not the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> because they did not the works of <hi>Abraham</hi>; so as our Apostle plainly demonstrates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.9.10.11. <hi>Chapters. Gal.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Chap.</hi> that those of them who had not the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> had no interest in his Blessings and Covenant; Seeing therefore that their other <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> was come to an end with all the carnal <hi>Ordinances</hi> that attended it, by the actual coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> whereunto they were subservient, if they did not by faith in the promised seed attain an interest in this of the Spiritual Blessing, it is evident that they could on no account be considered as actuall sharers in the Covenant of God.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>6</label> We have seen then that <hi>Abraham</hi> on the account of his <hi>faith,</hi> and not of his separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the <hi>flesh,</hi> was the Father of all that believe, and Heir of the world. And in the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with him, as to that which concerns, not the bringing forth of the promised seed according to the flesh, but as unto faith therein; and in the work of Redemption to be performed thereby, lyes the foundation of the Church in all Ages. Wheresoever this Covenant is, and with whomsoever it is establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with them is the <hi>Church,</hi> unto whom all the Promises and Priviledges of the <hi>Church</hi> do belong. Hence it was, that at the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> there was not <hi>one Church</hi> taken away, and another set up in the room thereof, but the <hi>Church</hi> continued the same in those that were the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the faith. The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church,</hi> is not <hi>another</hi> Church, but the very <hi>same</hi> that was before the coming of Christ, having the same faith with it, and interested in the same <hi>Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, the former carnal Priviledge of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Posterity expiring on the grounds before mentioned, the <hi>Ordinances of Worship</hi> which were suited thereunto, did necessarily cease also. And this cast the <hi>Jews</hi> into great perplexities, and proved the last tryall that God made of them. For whereas both these, namely the carnal and spiritual Priviledges of <hi>Abrahams Covenant,</hi> had been carried on together in a mixed way for many Generations, coming now to be separated, and a triall to be made (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.) who of the Jews had interest in both, who in one only, those who had only the carnal Priviledge of being Children of <hi>Abraham according to the flesh,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a share on that single account in the other also, that is in all the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses annexed unto the Covenant. But the foundation of their Plea was taken away, and the Church unto which the Promises belong remained with them, that were heirs of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>7</label> It remains then, that the Church founded in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and unto which all the Promises did and do belong, abode at the coming of Christ, and doth abide ever since in and among those who are the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith. The <hi>Old Church</hi> was not taken away, and a <hi>new one</hi> set up, but the same Church was continued, only in those who by <hi>Faith</hi> inherited the Promises. Great alterations indeed were then made in the outward state and condition of the <hi>Church.</hi> As (1:) The carnall Priviledge of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their separation to bring forth the <hi>Messiah</hi> then failed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their claim on that account to be the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> (2.) The <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Worship</hi> suited unto that Priviledge, expired, and came to an end. (3.) New Ordinances of Worship were appointed, suited unto the <hi>New Light</hi> and grace granted then unto the Church. (4.) The <hi>Gentiles</hi> came in to the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Jews</hi> to be fellow-heirs with them in his blessing. But none of these,

nor all of them together made any such Alteration <hi>in</hi> the Church, but that it was still <hi>one</hi> and the same. The <hi>Olive Tree</hi> was the same, only some branches were broken of, and others planted in; the <hi>Jews</hi> fell, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> came in their room.</p>
                  <p>And this must and doth determine the difference between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi>

They are all made unto the <hi>Church.</hi> No individual Person hath any interest in them, but by vertue of his <hi>Membership</hi> therewith. This <hi>Church</hi> is and alwayes was one and the same. With whomsoever it remains, the <hi>Promises</hi> are theirs: and that not by Application or <hi>Analogie,</hi> but directly and properly.

And this distribution of the <hi>Books of the Old Testament</hi> is in general intimated by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.24. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; the <hi>Law,</hi> (so sometimes they call the whole Volume) is divided into three parts, <hi>the Law, the Prophets, and the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi> All comprized generally under the Name of the Law; for so they say in <hi>Midrash Tehillim.

                  <p>This distribution so far as it is intimated in the words of our Saviour, doth evidently arise from the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of the Books themselves. And this was the received division of the Books of the Old Testament, whilest the <hi>Judaical Church</hi> stood and Continued; But the <hi>Postalmudicall Doctors</hi> overlooking or neglecting the true Reason of this Distribution, have fancied others, taken from the different <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of Revelation, by which they were given out unto the Church. Amongst these they make the Revelation to <hi>Moses</hi> the most excellent, and are very vain in coining the Priviledges and Preeminences it had above all others, which are elsewhere examined. In the next degree they place those which proceeded from the <hi>Spirit of Prophesie,</hi> which they distinguish from the <hi>Inspiration of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Yea, in the <hi>eleven</hi> degrees of Divine Revelation assigned by <hi>Maimonides Mor. Nebu: par.</hi> 2. That by <hi>Inspiration</hi> is cast into the last and lowest place. But this distinction is groundless and meerly fancied out of the various wayes, that God was pleased to use in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting things to the minds of the Prophets; when it was in them all, the <hi>Inspiration of the Holy Ghost</hi> alone, that enabled them infallibly to declare the mind of God unto the Church, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.</p>
                  <p>Now the Books thus given by the Spirit of Prophesie they make of two sorts; 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>former Prophets,</hi> which are all the <hi>Historical</hi> Books of the Old Testament written before the Captivity, as <hi>Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings; Ruth</hi> only excepted: 2. <gap reason="foreign">

The collection of their pains and Observations to this purpose is called the <hi>Massora</hi> or <hi>Messara,</hi> consisting in <hi>Criticall</hi> Observations upon the words and letters of the Scripture, begun to be collected of old, even it may be from the dayes

of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and continued untill the time of Composing the <hi>Talmud,</hi> with some additional Observations since annexed unto it.</p>

In this their <hi>Critical</hi> Doctrine, they give us the number of the <hi>Verses</hi> of the Scripture, as also how often every <hi>Word</hi> is used in the whole, and with what variety, as to Letters and Vowels; what is the whole number of all the <hi>Letters</hi> in the Bible, and how often each Letter is severally used, with innumerable other useful Observations; the summ whereof is gathered by <hi>Buxtorfe</hi> in his excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise on that subject. And herein is the knowledge of their Masters bounded; they go not beyond the Letter, but are more blind than Moles in the Spiritual sense of it. And thus they continue an example of the righteous Judgement of God, in giving them up to the Counsells of their own hearts, and an evident instance how unable the Letter of the Scripture is to furnish men with the saving knowledge of the Will of God, who enjoy not the <hi>Spirit</hi> promised in the same <hi>Covenant</hi> to the Church of the Elect, <hi>Isa</hi> 59.21.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> Unto that ignorance of the mind of God in the Scripture which is spread over them, they have added another prejudice against the Truth, in a strange Figment of an <hi>Orall Law,</hi> which they make equall unto, yea in many things prefer before, that which is written. The Scripture becoming a <hi>lifeless Letter</hi> unto them, the true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the mind of God being utterly departed and hid from them, it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that they should rest therein, or content themselves with what is revealed by it. For as the word whilest it is enjoyed and used according to the mind of God, and is accompanied with that Spirit which is promised to lead them that believe, into all Truth, is full of sweetness and life to the souls of men, a perfect Rule of walking before God, and that which satiates them with wisdom and knowledge; so when it is enjoyed meerly on an outward account as such a writing, without any dispensation of suitable Light and Grace, it will yield men no satisfaction, which makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly turn aside to other means and wayes of knowing and serving God. This being so eminent in the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Medium</hi> they have fixed on to supply that want, which they suppose to be in the Scripture, but is indeed in themselves, proving to be the great Engine of their <hi>hardening</hi> and obstinacy in their Infidelity; I shall first declare what it is that they intend by the <hi>Orall Law,</hi> and then briefly shew the absurdity and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their pretensions about it; though it must not be denyed that it is one of the most <hi>Antient Fables</hi> that is credited amongst any of the Sons of men at this day in the world.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>6</label> This <hi>Orall Law</hi> they affirm to be an unwritten Tradition and Exposition of the written <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> given unto him in <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and committed by him to <hi>Joshua</hi> and the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> to be by them delivered over by <hi>Orall Tradition</hi> unto those who should succeed them in the Government of that Church. It doth not appear that in the dayes of Christ or his Apostles, whilest the <hi>Temple</hi> was standing that there was any stated opinion amongst them about this <hi>Orall Law</hi>; though it is evident that not long after it began to be received by the body of the People. Nay it is evident that there was no such Law then acknowledged; For the <hi>Sadduces</hi> who utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all the main Principles of it, were then not only tolerated, but also in chief Rule, one of them being High Priest.</p>
                  <p>That they had multiplyed many superstitious Observances amongst them under the name of <hi>Traditions,</hi> is most clear in the Gospel; and it doth not appear that then they knew whom to assign their original unto, and therefore indefinitely called them the <hi>Traditions of the Elders,</hi> or those that lived of old before them. After the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their Temple, when they had lost the life and spirit of that Worship, which the Scripture revealed, betaking themselves wholly unto their <hi>Traditional</hi> figments, they began to bethink themselves how they might give countenance to their Apostacy from the Perfection and Doctrine of the written Law. For this end they began to fancy that these <hi>Traditions</hi> were no less from God, than the written Law it self. For when <hi>Moses</hi> was forty dayes and forty nights in the Mountain, they say that in the <hi>day time</hi> he wrote the Law from the mouth of God, and in the <hi>night,</hi> God instructed him in the <hi>Orall Law,</hi> or unwritten Exposition of it, which they have received by Tradition from him. For when he came down from the Mount, after he had read unto them the <hi>Written Law,</hi> as they say, he repeated to <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Eleazer</hi> and the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> all that secret instruction which he had received in the <hi>night</hi> from God, which it was not

                     </gap>evation of it, would not preserve them from all manner of wickedness, and what an <hi>hedge</hi> it is to the Written Law, when notwithstanding the obedience yielded unto it, that was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly despised and neglected; if they shall say that Law also was broken by them; I desire to know whence it comes to pass, that whereas God by his Prophets doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them for all their other sins, and in particular for contempt of his <hi>Written Law,</hi> the Statutes, Ordinances and Institutions of it, he no where once mentioneth this their greater guilt of despising the <hi>Orall Law,</hi> but there is as universall a silence concerning its transgression, as there is of its giving and institution. Can we have any greater evidence of its being fictitious than this; that whereas it is pretended that it is the main <hi>Rule</hi> of their Obedience to God, God did never reprove them for the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it, though whilest he owned them as his Church and People, he suffered none of their sins to pass by unreproved, especially not any of that importance, which this is by them pretended to be of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Moses</hi> was commanded to write the <hi>whole Law</hi> that he received from God, and did so accordingly; <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.3, 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.9, 24. Where was this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50110:39"/>
                     <hi>Orall Law</hi> which they say was not to be written, when <hi>Moses</hi> was commanded to write the <hi>whole Law</hi> that he had received of God; and did accordingly. This New Law was not then coyned, being indeed nothing but the product of their Apostacy from the Law which was written.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The sole ground and foundation of this <hi>Orall Law</hi> lyes in the imperfection of the <hi>Written Law.</hi> This is that which they plead, for the necessity of it; The written Law extends not to all necessary cases that occurr in Religion; many things are redundant, many wanting in it, and hereof they gather great heaps of Instances; so that they will grant that if the <hi>Written Law</hi> had been perfect, there had been no need of this Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional one. But whom in this matter shall we believe, a few ignorant Jews, or God himself, bearing witness that his Law is perfect, and requiring no more in his Worship but what is in that Law prescribed? See <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.5, 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.1, 2. And this perfection of the <hi>Written Law,</hi> though it be perfectly destructive to their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not only the <hi>Karaei</hi> among themselves do earnestly contend for, but also sundry of their <hi>Gemarists</hi> do acknowledge, especially when they forget their own concernments out of a desire to oppose the Gospel. And to this head belong all the Arguments that Divines make use of to prove the perfection of the Scripture, against the <hi>New Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dists</hi> in Christianity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

If there be such an <hi>Orall Law</hi> it is one that God would not have any man to observe; which he calls none to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of, nor did ever reprove any man for its Transgression.</p>
                  <p>And many more Arguments of the <hi>like nature</hi> may be added to prove the vanity of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>14</label> this pretence. And yet this Figment is the bottom of the present <hi>Judaical Religion</hi> and obstinacy. When the Apostle wrote this Epistle, their Apostacy was not yet arrived at this rock of offence; since their falling on it, they have increased their blindness, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ruine. Then they were contented to try their cause by what God spake to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>in the Prophets,</hi> which kept open a door of hope, and gave some advantages for their Conversion, which are now shut up and removed, untill God shall take this <hi>vail away</hi> from their faces, that they may see to the end of the things that were to be done away.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>this means</hi> principally have they for many generations both <hi>shut out</hi> the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>15</label> Truth, and <hi>secured</hi> themselves from Conviction. For what ever is taught and revealed in the <hi>Scripture</hi> concerning the Person, Office, and Work of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> seeing they have <hi>that</hi> which they esteem a <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>equall Authority</hi> herewithall, teaching them a <hi>Doctrine</hi> quite of another nature, and more suited unto their carnal <hi>Principles</hi> and Expectations, they will rather rest in any evasions, than give way to the Testimony thereof. And whilest they have a firm perswasion, as they have, received by the <hi>Tradition</hi> of many Generations, that the written Word is <hi>imperfect,</hi> but an <hi>half Revelation</hi> of the mind of God, in its self <hi>unintelligible,</hi> and not to be received or understood but according to the sense of their <hi>Orall Law</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in their <hi>Talmuds,</hi> what can the most plain and <hi>cogent Testimonies</hi> of it avail un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Conviction? And this hath been the fatall way and means of the <hi>grand Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy</hi> of both Churches, <hi>Judaical</hi> and <hi>Christian.</hi> How far that of the <hi>Jews</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with it, in the dayes of our <hi>Lords Conversation</hi> on the Earth, the <hi>Gospel</hi> doth abundantly declare; and how they have brought it unto its <hi>height,</hi> we have given now some brief account. That of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> hath been the very same, and hath at length arrived unto almost the <hi>same</hi> issue, by the <hi>same</hi> degrees. This some of them perceiving, do not only defend the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Opinion among the <hi>Jews,</hi> about the <hi>Orall Law</hi> and <hi>Succession</hi> of their Traditions, as consonant to the <hi>pretensions</hi> of their own Church, but also openly avow that a very great number of their <hi>several respective Traditions</hi> are either the same, or that they nearly resemble one another; as doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly <hi>Josephus de Voysin</hi> in his <hi>Proaemium</hi> to the <hi>Pugio fidei</hi> of <hi>Raimundus Martini.</hi> And because it is evident, that the same have been the way and means, whereby both the <hi>Judaical</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Church have <hi>apostatized</hi> and departed from the Truth, and that they are the same also whereby they maintain and defend themselves in their <hi>Apostacy</hi> and refusal to return unto the <hi>Truth,</hi> I shall <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, manifest their Consent and Agreement in this Principle, about their <hi>Traditions</hi> and Authority of them, which have been the Ruine of them both.</p>
                  <p>First, The <hi>Jews</hi> expresly contend that their <hi>Orall Law,</hi> their <hi>Mass</hi> of <hi>Traditions</hi> was <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>16</label>
from God himself. Partly they say it was delivered unto <hi>Moses</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50110:40"/>
partly added by him from <hi>Divine Revelations</hi> which he afterwards received. Hence the <hi>Authority</hi> of it with them is <hi>no less</hi> than that of the <hi>Written Word,</hi> (which hath all its Authority from its Divine Original) and the <hi>usefulness</hi> of it is much <hi>more.</hi> For although they cannot deny but that this and that particular <hi>Tradition,</hi> that is Practice, Custom, or Exposition of any place of Scripture was first introduced, expressed, and declared, at such or such seasons, by such <hi>Masters</hi> or <hi>Schools</hi> amongst them, yet they will not grant that they were then first invented or found out, but only that they were then first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared out of the <hi>Cabalistical Abyss,</hi> wherein they were preserved from their first Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; as all of them agree who have written any thing about the nature, propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and continuance of their <hi>Orall Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is the perswasion of the <hi>Romanists</hi> about their <hi>Cabal</hi> of <hi>Traditions.</hi> They plead them to be all of a <hi>Divine Original</hi>; partly from Christ, and partly from his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. What ever they have added unto the written Word, yea, though it be never so contrary thereunto, still they pretend that it is part of the <hi>Orall Law</hi> which they have received from them by living Tradition; Let one <hi>Convention</hi> of their <hi>Doctors</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that <hi>Images</hi> are to be adored, another that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is to be believed, a third add a <hi>New Creed</hi> with an equall number of <hi>Articles</hi> unto the old, let one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor advance the Opinion of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> another of <hi>Justification by Works</hi>; all is one, these things are not then first <hi>invented,</hi> but only declared out of that unsearchable <hi>Treasure of Traditions,</hi> which they have in their Custody. Had they not <hi>inlaid</hi> this Perswasion in the minds of men, they know that their whole Fabrick would of its own accord have long since sunk into Confusion. But they highly contend at this day, that they need no other Argument to prove any thing to be of an <hi>Heavenly Extract</hi> and <hi>Divine Originall,</hi> but that themselves think so, and practise accordingly.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Orall Law</hi> being thus given, the <hi>Preservation</hi> of it, seeing <hi>Moses is dead</hi> long ago, must be enquired after. Now the <hi>Jews</hi> assign a threefold <hi>Depository</hi> of it. <hi>First,</hi> The whole Congregation; <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The High Priest. To this End they affirm, that it was <hi>three times</hi> repeated upon the descent of <hi>Moses</hi> from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> as to what of it, he had then received, and his after addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had the same promulgation. First, It was repeated by himself unto <hi>Aaron</hi>; Secondly, By them both unto the <hi>Elders</hi>: and Thirdly, By the <hi>Elders</hi> unto the whole <hi>Congregation</hi>; or as <hi>Maimonides</hi> in <hi>Jad Chazakah, Moses</hi> delivered it unto <hi>Eleazar, Phineas</hi> and <hi>Joshuah</hi> after the Death of <hi>Aaron,</hi> by whom the <hi>Consistory</hi> was instructed therein, who taught the People as occasion did require. What the <hi>People</hi> knew of it is uncertain, but what they did so, was quickly lost; The Consistory or great <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi>

                        </gap>story</hi> continued, but also the <hi>Atheistical</hi> Sect of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> rose unto that height and interest, as to obtain the <hi>Presidentship</hi> in the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> its self. But the <hi>High Priests</hi> are those whom they fix upon as the principal Conservators of this <hi>Orall Law.</hi> To this End they give us <hi>Catalogues</hi> of them from first to last, that by their uninterrupted Succession, we we may be secured of the incorrupt preservation of their <hi>Original Traditions.</hi> Only it may here be added by the way; that <hi>they bind not</hi> themselves precisely in all their Religious Observances unto this <hi>Oral Law</hi> whereunto they assign a <hi>Divine</hi> Original; but ascribe an Authority unto the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> and the High Priest, to constitute things of themselves in the Worship of God besides and beyond the word. For whatever they pretend of their <hi>Orall Law,</hi> when they come unto particular Instances they would fain <hi>educe</hi> the Constitutions of it, from some Word, or Letter or manner of <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Scripture its self. But those Constitutions of the <hi>Consistory</hi> and <hi>Wisemen</hi> they ascribe unto their own Authority.</p>
                  <p>Some of these are recounted by <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> unto <hi>Jad Chazaka</hi>; as the <hi>Reading of the Book or Roll of</hi> Esther <hi>with Fasting; lights on the Feast of Dedication; The
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50110:40"/>
Fast on the seventh of</hi> Ab. <hi>or</hi> July; <hi>various Mixtures, and Washings of hands</hi>; things plainly of that nature which our <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> condemned amongst them. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable how he frees them from transgressing that Precept, Deut. 12.32. <hi>Thou shalt not add unto this word,</hi> by this Constitution. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>they say not that the holy blessed God hath commanded these things, that there should be such Mixtures, that the Book of</hi> Esther <hi>should be read with fasting; for if they should say so, they should add to the Law; but thus we speak, such and such a Prophet or the Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, commanded and appointed, that the Book of</hi> Esther <hi>should be read with fasting to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Glory of the Holy Blessed God in our Deliverance,</hi> and so of the rest. It seems then they may <hi>add</hi> what they will of their own, so they entitle not the Name of God to their <hi>Inventions</hi>; by which means they have set themselves at liberty to multiply <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious</hi> Observations at their pleasure, which they had actually done in the dayes of our Saviour, and thereby made the <hi>Law of God of none effect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all these things are they followed and imitated by the <hi>Romanists.</hi> In the same manner do they lay up the <hi>stock</hi> of their Traditions. In general they make the <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>repository</hi> of them, although they do not so distinctly explain the way and means whereby they were committed thereunto as the <hi>Jews</hi> do. Unto the <hi>Sanhedrim, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> are succeeded in the same Office. But their Nature, Work, Authority, Assistance, and Use, are so <hi>variously disputed</hi> amongst them, that nothing of <hi>certainty</hi> from them, or by them singly considered is to be obtained. It is the <hi>High Priest,</hi> or <hi>Pope</hi> that is the Principal Conservator of this <hi>Sacred Treasury</hi> of Traditions; Upon their Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth the <hi>certainty</hi> of them depend. And whilest there is a <hi>Pope at Rome,</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the new <hi>Orall Law</hi> will not fail, as the <hi>Old</hi> one did not whilest the Jews had an <hi>High Priest,</hi> though in the pursuit of it they <hi>Crucified the Messiah,</hi> and continue to reject him unto this day. Besides, like the <hi>Jews,</hi> they content not themselves with what they pretend to be of antient <hi>Tradition,</hi> but assume a Power of making new <hi>Constitutions</hi> in the things of God; whereby they would have us to think they do not violate the <hi>prohibitions</hi> of <hi>adding,</hi> because they ascribe them not unto the <hi>Word of God,</hi> but to the Authority of the <hi>present Church.</hi> Thus far therefore they are fully agreed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> in favour and unto the Honour of these <hi>Traditions,</hi> affirm that the <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>By this being the <hi>Foundation of the Written Law,</hi> they intend that the sense of it, is so enwrapped and contained therein, that without the Explications thereof it cannot be understood. And to this End <hi>Manasse</hi> one of their late Masters, expresly disputes that in many things it is <hi>defective,</hi> and in some things <hi>redundant,</hi> so that it is not able to give us a full and clear direction in the things of God, without their <hi>Traditional Explications</hi>; and in the confirmation of his opinion, he instanceth in sundry <hi>Precepts and Prohibitions,</hi> that he would prove so obscure, as that no Obedience can be yielded unto them in a due manner without the help of the <hi>Cabala</hi>; which because for the most part his Exceptions from them are <hi>Childish Cavils,</hi> and have been answered by others, shall be here passed over. This they are arrived unto; this is the common perswasion of them all, and we shall yet hear, what farther Progress they have made. And herein are they imitated by their <hi>Successors.</hi> Their <hi>Orall Law</hi> also is made by them the foundation of the <hi>Written.</hi>

                  <p>Thus for the most part the first Question of a <hi>Romanist</hi> is, <hi>How do you know the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures

to be the Word of God?</hi> and then the next word is, the <hi>Cabala,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Orall Law, Tradition,</hi> these are the Foundation of it; And in their progress they fail not to assert <hi>two Principles</hi> both borrowed from the <hi>Jews. First,</hi> That the Scripture is <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> and doth not give us a full and compleat account of all things that are to be believed or practised, that God may be glorified, and our own souls saved. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That what is delivered therein can no way be rightly and truly understood, but by the help of those <hi>Traditions</hi> which they have in their custody. But although these are good usefull Inventions, and they are men that want not Ability to find out what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing unto their own advantage, yet they cannot be allowed the Credit of being their first Authors, seeing they are expresly borrowed of the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When these two Laws, the Law of God, and their own, do come in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Jews</hi> many of them do expresly prefer that of their own <hi>invention</hi> before the other, and that both as to certainty, and use.

                  <p>It seems these things were left them in secret Tradition, because God was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that any besides themselves, should know his Mind and Will; but they have at last shewed themselves more full of benignity towards mankind, than they would allow God to be, in as much as they have committed this Secret Law to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And to this purpose is their Confession in <gap reason="foreign">

The principal design of <hi>all the Books</hi> which have been lately published by the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and they have not been a few; hath been to prove the Certainty and Sufficiency of their <hi>Traditions</hi> in matters of their Faith and Worship, above that of the <hi>Written Word.</hi>

                     <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and endeavour to prove them guilty <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> of <hi>Heresie</hi> in the highest degree. Some of them would have them to be the <hi>Offspring</hi> of the old <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees,</hi> to deny the Resurrection, and the World to come, as men care not much usually what they impute unto those whom they esteem <hi>Hereticks.</hi> But the falsity hereof is notorious, and so acknowledged by others, and confuted by the Writings of the <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeans</hi> themselves. Yea the Author of <hi>Cosri</hi> affirms that they are more <hi>studious in the Law</hi> than the <hi>Rabbins</hi>; and that their <hi>Reasons were more weighty</hi> than theirs, and <hi>lead more towards the naked sense of the Scripture.</hi> But this is that which they charge upon them, namely that rejecting the sure Rule of their <hi>Traditions,</hi> they run into <hi>singular, Expositions</hi> of the Law, and so divided it, and made <hi>many Laws</hi> of it, having no certain
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50110:41"/>
means of Agreement among themselves. So saith <hi>Rabbi Jehuda Levita</hi> the Author of the fore-mentioned <hi>Cosri,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>The Karaeans mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply Laws according to their own Opinion,</hi> which he inveighs against them for, after he had commended them. And the same is objected against them by <hi>Maimonides</hi> on <hi>Pirke Aboth.</hi> As though it were not known, that the greatest part of their <hi>Talmud,</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Treasury of their <hi>Orall Law,</hi> is taken up with differences and Disputes of their Masters among themselves, with a multitude of various Opinions, and <hi>contradictory conceptions</hi> about their <hi>Traditions.</hi> Thus deal the <hi>Romanists</hi> also which their Adversaries, this they charge them withall; They are <hi>Hereticks, Biblists,</hi> and by adhering to the <hi>Scripture alone,</hi> have no certainty among themselves, but run into diversities of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as having deserted the unerring Rule of their <hi>Cabala</hi>; when the world is filled with the noise of their own conflicts, notwithstanding the pretended relief which they have thereby.</p>
                  <p>It remains that we consider how these Traditions come to be communicated unto others, out of the secret <hi>Store-house</hi> wherein Originally they were deposited. This as I have elsewhere, and partly before declared, was by their being committed unto wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by <hi>Rabbi Juda Hakkadosh,</hi> whose collections, with their Expositions in their <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> do give us a perfect account, if we may believe them, of that secret Law which came down unto them by <hi>Orall Tradition</hi> from <hi>Moses.</hi> And something like hereunto is by the <hi>Romanists</hi> pretended. Many of their <hi>Traditions</hi> they say, are recorded in the <hi>Rescripts</hi> of <hi>Popes, Decrees</hi> of Councils, and <hi>Constitutions of the Canon Law,</hi> and the like sacred means of the declaration of the <hi>Orall Instructions</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostles.</p>
                  <p>But herein the <hi>Jews</hi> deal with us far more ingeniously than they. They tell us plainly, that now their whole <hi>Orall Law</hi> is written, and that they have no reserve of <hi>authentick</hi> Traditions not yet declared.<note place="margin">

But here the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> fail us; for although they have given us <hi>heaps upon heaps</hi> of their <hi>Traditions,</hi> by the means afore mentioned, yet they plead that they have still an inexhaustible Treasure of them, laid up in their Church stores, and Breast of their Holy Father, to be drawn forth at all times as occasion shall require.</p>
                  <p>And thus have we taken a brief Prospect of the Consent of both the <hi>Apostatical</hi> Churches, in that <hi>Principle</hi> which hath been the means of their <hi>Apostasie,</hi> and is the great Engine whereby they are rendered incurable therein.</p>

                  <p>WEE proceed now unto our Principal intendment in all these Discourses; which is the Consideration and Discussion of those <hi>great Principles,</hi> as of all Religion in general, so of the <hi>Christian</hi> in particular, which the <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>1</label> are the <hi>Basis</hi> that he stands upon, in the management of his whole Design. For in all Discourses that are <hi>Paraenetical,</hi> as this Epistle for the most part is, there are alwayes some Principles taken for granted, which give Life and Efficacy unto the <hi>Exhortations</hi> in them, and whereinto they are resolved. For as to <hi>perswade</hi> men unto <hi>particul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rs</hi> in Faith, Opinion or Practice, without a previous conviction of such <hi>general Principles of Truth,</hi> as from which the Perswasions used do naturally flow and arise, is a thing <hi>weak</hi> and inefficacious; so to be exercised in the Demonstration of the Principles themselves, when the especial End aimed, is to <hi>perswade,</hi> would bring confusion into all Discourse.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore although our Apostle do assert and confirm those <hi>dogmata</hi> and Articles of Truth, which he dealt with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in a way of Perswasion to embrace; yet he supposeth and takes for granted those more general <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or first <hi>Maxims,</hi> which are the Foundation both of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Exhortations</hi> insisted on; as all skill in teaching doth require. And these are those which now we aim to draw forth and consider; being these that follow.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That there was a Messiah, or Saviour of mankind from Sin and Punishment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised upon and from the first entrance of Sin into the World, in whom all acceptable Worship of God was founded, and in whom all the Religion of the Sons of men was to center.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That this Messiah long before Promised, was now actually exhibited in the world, and had finished the work committed unto him, when the Apostle wrote this Epistle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That Jesus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>was this Messiah, and that what he had done and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was the work and duty promised of old concerning him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is not a <hi>Line</hi> in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that doth not <hi>virtually</hi> begin and end in these Principles; not an Assertion, not a Doctrine, not an Exhortation, that is not built on this <hi>Triple</hi> Foundation. They are also the great Verities <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of the <hi>Christian Profession</hi> or Religion. A sincere endeavour therefore in their Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50110:42"/>
and Vindication, especially in these dayes, wherein as on the <hi>one hand,</hi> there are various thoughts of heart, about the Jews, their present condition and expectation, so <hi>on the other,</hi> there are many who are ready with a presumptuous boldness <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and to call in question the <hi>fundamentals of all Religion,</hi> may not be unacceptable. Now the <hi>first</hi> of these <hi>Principles,</hi> is at this day by several vain imaginations obscured by the <hi>Jews,</hi> to their utter loss of all benefit by it, and hath been so for many Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, although it were the <hi>Life and Soul</hi> of the Religion of their fore-fathers, as shall be demonstrated; and the <hi>two latter</hi> are by them expresly <hi>denyed,</hi> and maliciously <hi>contended</hi> against. Here then we shall fix; and confirm these Principles in the order wherein we have laid them down; declaring on every one of them, the Conceptions and <hi>Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Jews</hi> concerning the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> removing in the Close their Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions against the Faith of Christians in this matter, in a peculiar Exercitation to that Purpose. And the <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Vindication</hi> of the first of these Principles, is that which our present Discourse is designed unto.</p>
                  <p>Besides the Testimony of God himself in his Word, we have a concurrent suffrage <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> from the <hi>whole Creation,</hi> that man in the Beginning was formed, as in the <hi>Image,</hi> so in the Favour of God, and unto his Glory. And as he was not <hi>liable</hi> unto any evil which is the effect of Gods displeasure, nor <hi>defective</hi> in any Good, necessary to preserve him in the condition wherein he was made, so he was <hi>destitute</hi> of nothing that was any way requisite to carry him on unto that farther enjoyment of God whereunto he was designed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 26, 31. <hi>Ecclesiast.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 29. For God being infinitely <hi>Good, Wise, Righteous,</hi> and <hi>Powerfull,</hi> creating man to know, love, honour, and enjoy him, and thereby to <hi>glorifie</hi> those Holy Properties of his nature, which exerted themselves in his creation, (which that he did, the nature of those <hi>intellectual Perfections</hi> wherewith He endowed him, doth undeniably evince) it was utterly impossible that either He should not delight in the work of his own hands, the effect of his own Wisdom and Power, or not furnish him with those <hi>Faculties and Abilities</hi> by which he might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Ends of his Creation. To suppose a Failure in any of these, is contrary to the prime <hi>Dictates</hi> of Reason. For <hi>Infinite Wisdom</hi> can do nothing <hi>in vain,</hi> nothing not perfectly suited unto the End whereunto it is designed; Neither can Infinite Goodness allow of any defect in ought that proceedeth from it. Gen. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>God saw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very Good.</hi> Hence many <hi>Philosophers</hi> saw and granted, that the <hi>First Cause</hi> in the Production of all things, did <gap reason="foreign">

And these <hi>uncontroulable Notions</hi> of Nature or Reason, cast men of old into their entanglements about the <hi>Original of Evil.</hi> For this they plainly saw, that it must be accidental and <hi>occasional,</hi> but where to fix that <hi>Occasion</hi> they knew not.

This the <hi>Philosophers</hi> knew not, and therefore knew nothing clearly of the Condition of Mankind in relation unto God.

                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>moral corruption</hi> of the Nature of man, the Spring of all <hi>sin,</hi> the other head of Evil proceeded <hi>Hence</hi> also.

                     </gap> promised and exhibited for a Relief in the Wisdom, Grace, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God against this sin and misery of mankind, as our Apostle also expresly proveth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. of his Epistle unto them, this being denyed by them, as that which would overthrow all their fond imaginations about his Person and Office, we must consider what is their Sense and Apprehension about these things, with what may be thence educed for their own Conviction, and then confirm the Truth of our Assertion from those Testimonies of Scripture which themselves own and receive.</p>
                  <p>The first effect and consequent of the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> was the punishment wherewith it <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>6</label> was attended. What is written hereof <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in the Scripture, the <hi>Jews</hi> neither can, nor do deny. Death was in the commination given to deter him from his Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <gap reason="foreign">

The Event sufficiently evinceth the contrary. What ever is, or might be <hi>Evil</hi> unto himself and his whole Posterity, with the residue of the Creation, so far as he, or they might be any way concerned therein, hath grown out of this commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this is sufficiently manifested in the first Execution of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 19. The <hi>Malediction</hi> was but the Execution of the <hi>Commination.</hi> It was not consistent with the Justice of God to increase the Penalty, after the sin was committed. The <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> therefore was the Rule and measure of the <hi>Curse.</hi> But this is here extended by God himself, not only to all the miseries of Man, (<hi>Adam</hi> and his whole Posterity) in this Life, in labour, disappointment, sweat and sorrow, with <hi>Death</hi> under, and by vertue of the Curse, but to the whole <hi>Earth</hi> also, and consequently unto those <hi>superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Regions</hi> and Orbs of Heaven, by whose influence, the <hi>Earth</hi> is as it were governed and disposed unto the Use of Man. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. It may be yet farther enquired, what was to be the <hi>duration</hi> and continuance of the Punishment to be inflicted in the pursuit of this Commination and Malediction. Now there is not any thing in the least to intimate that it should have a term prefixed unto it, wherein it should expire; or that it should not be commensurate unto the existence or being of the sinner. God layes the <hi>Curse</hi> on man, and there he leaves him, and that for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A miserable life he was to spend, and then to <hi>dye</hi> under the Curse of God, without hopes of emerging into a better condition. About his subsistence after this Life, we have no controversie with the Jews. They all acknowledge the <hi>immortality</hi> of the Soul; for the Sect of the Sadducees is long since extinct; neither are they followed by the <hi>Karaeans</hi> in their <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical</hi> Opinions, as hath been declared. Some of them indeed encline unto the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean Metempsuchosis,</hi> but all acknowledge the Souls Perpetuity.</p>
                  <p>Supposing then <hi>Adam</hi> to dye <hi>poenally</hi> under the Curse of God, as without extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Relief he must have done, the Righteousness and Truth of God being engaged for the Execution of the Threatning against him, I desire to know what should have been the State and condition of his Soul? Doth either Revelation or Reason intimate that he should not have continued for ever under the same Penalty and Curse, in a state of Death, or Separation from God? And if he should have done so, then was <hi>Death eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> in the Commination. This is that which with respect unto the present effects in this life, and the punishment due to sin, is termed by our Apostle, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Nor will the Jews themselves contend that the guilt of any sin respects only <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> punishment. The Event of Sin unto themselves they take to be that only, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining their Observation of the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> such as it is, to be a sufficient Expiation of Punishment eternal. But unto all strangers from the Law, all that have not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief provided, they make every sin mortal; and <hi>Adam,</hi> as I suppose had not the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Present <hi>Jews</hi> to observe <hi>Moses</hi> Law. Wherefore they all agree, that by his Repentance he delivered himself from Death eternal, which if it were not due unto

That we aim at, is to evidence their Conviction of that manifold misery which came upon mankind, on the <hi>Entrance of Sin</hi> into the world. And two things we have produced their Suffrage and Consent unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The Change of the Primitive Condition of Man, by his Defection from the <hi>Law of his Creation.</hi> This made him obnoxious in his whole Person and all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments to the displeasure and Curse of God, to all the <hi>Evil</hi> which in this world he feels, or fears in another; to Death Temporal and Eternal. And hence did all the disorder which is in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverse</hi> arise. All this we have found them freely te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying unto. And this must be acknowledged by all men, who will not brutishly deny what their own Consciences dictate unto them, and which the condition of the whole lower world proclaims, or irrationally ascribe such things unto God, as are utterly inconsistent with his Wisdom, Goodness, Righteousness, and Holiness. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have manifested their acknowledgement, that a Principle of Sin, or Moral Evil, hath invaded the nature of man; or that from the sin of our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, there is an Evil Concupiscence in the heart of every man, continually and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly inclining the Soul unto Operations <hi>suitable</hi> unto it; that is unto all Moral Evil whatever. From both these it unavoidably follows, on the first Notions of the Righteousness, Holiness, Veracity, and Faithfulness of God, that mankind in this estate and condition, can justly expect nothing, but a <hi>confluence of Evil</hi> in this world, and at the close of their Pilgrimage, to perish with a Ruine Commensurate unto their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence. For God having in Wisdom and Righteousness, as the Soveraign Lord of his Creature, given them a <hi>Law,</hi> good, just, and equal, and having appointed the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty</hi> of Death and his everlasting displeasure therein unto the <hi>Transgression</hi> thereof; and withall having sufficiently promulgated both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Penalty,</hi> (all which things we have before demonstrated) the Transgression prohibited actually ensuing, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being Judge, it remains that all this Constitution of a Law, and threatning of a penalty was vain and ludricous, as <hi>Satan</hi> in the <hi>Serpent</hi> pretended, or that mankind is rendered absolutely miserable and cursed, and that for ever. Now which of these is to be concluded, Divine Revelation in the Scripture, Reason, and the Event of things, will readily determine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>13</label> That God without the least impeachment of his Righteousness or Goodness might have left all mankind <hi>remediless</hi> in this Condition, is manifest, both from what hath been discoursed concerning the means whereby they were brought into it, and his dealing with <hi>Angels</hi> on the like occasion. The <hi>condition</hi> wherein man was created, was <hi>morally</hi> good and upright; the <hi>state</hi> wherein he was placed outwardly happy and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; the <hi>Law</hi> given unto him, just and equall, the <hi>Reward</hi> proposed unto him, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and sure, and his <hi>Defection</hi> from this condition voluntary. What shall we say then, is God unjust who inflicteth Vengeance? God forbid. The Execution of a Righteous Sentence, upon the <hi>voluntary</hi> Transgression of a Law <hi>just and equal,</hi> hath no unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in it. And this was the summ of what God did in this matter, as to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery that came on mankind. And who should judge Him, if he left him for ever to <hi>eat of the fruit of his own wayes, and to be filled with his own devices?</hi> He had before, as expressed his Power and Wisdom, so satisfied his Goodness and Bounty in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with his endowments, and enjoyments according unto the Law thereof; and what could man look for farther at his hands?</p>
                  <p>Hence <hi>Adam</hi> when his <hi>eyes were opened</hi> to see the nature of <hi>Evil</hi> in that actual sense which he had in his Conscience of the guilt that he had contracted, had not the least Expectation of Relief or Mercy. And the <hi>folly</hi> of the course which he took in <hi>hiding</hi> himself, argues sufficiently both his present Amazement, and that he knew of nothing better to betake himself unto. Therefore doth he give that account of the <hi>Result</hi> of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50110:46"/>
his thoughts, as unto the Relation that was between God and him, and what only he now looked for from him, <hi>I heard thy voice, and was afraid.</hi> Neither would any <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> that God had then made of himself, either by the <hi>Works</hi> of his Power and Wisdom, or by any inbred impressions on the souls of men <hi>concreated</hi> with them, give encouragement unto them that had sinned against him to expect Relief. Besides He had dealt thus with <hi>Angels.</hi> Upon their first Sin, <hi>he spared them not,</hi> but at once with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of Recovery cast them under the <hi>Chains of Darkness to be kept unto the</hi> final <hi>Judgement of the last day.</hi> This our <hi>Apostle</hi> discourseth unto the <hi>Hebrews; chap.</hi> 2. Now God dealt not unsuitably unto any of the Excellencies of his Nature, when he left the <hi>Apostatizing Angels</hi> to perish without Remedy unto Eternity. Had he dealt so also with <hi>Apostatizing Mankind,</hi> who were drawn into a conspiracy against him by the <hi>Head of the Defection,</hi> his wayes had been Holy and Righteous.</p>
                  <p>Yet doth not this great Instance of Gods dealing with Angels absolutely conclude his <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>14</label> leaving of mankind remediless in his misery also. He might <hi>justly</hi> do so, but thence it doth not follow that <hi>necessarily</hi> he must so do. And although the chief, and indeed only Reason of his extending Grace and Mercy unto <hi>Men,</hi> and not unto <hi>Angels,</hi> was his own Soveraign Will and Pleasure, concerning which who can say unto him, <hi>What doest thou?</hi> yet there was such a difference between these two sorts of Original Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, as may manifest a <hi>Condecency</hi> or suitableness unto his Righteousness and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in his various proceeding with them. For there are sundry things that put an Aggravation on the Rebellion of <hi>Angels</hi> above that of man; and some that render their ruine less destructive unto the Glory of the Universe, than that of mankind would have been. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The Angels were created in an <hi>estate and condition,</hi> much <hi>superiour</hi> unto, and more excellent than that of Man; and so likewise were their present or actual <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> far above his, though they also were admirable and blessed. The place of their <hi>first Habitation</hi> which they left, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. was the Highest <hi>Heavens,</hi> the most glorious recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of created Beings; in opposition whereunto they are said to be cast into the <hi>lowest Hell,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. Whereas <hi>Man</hi> was placed in the <hi>Earth,</hi> which although then beautifull and excellently suited to his condition; yet was every way inferiour unto the glory and lustre of the other, which God so had <hi>Garnished by his Spirit, Job</hi> 26.13. and which for its curious Excellency is called the <hi>Work of his Fingers, Psalm</hi> 8.3. And in these different places of their Habitation,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their several Employments also did greatly differ; The work of Angels was immediately to attend the <hi>Throne of God,</hi> to minister before him, and to give glory unto him, and to execute the Commands of his Providence in the Government of the works of his hands; <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.11. the highest pitch of Honour that a meer <hi>creature</hi> can be exalted unto. Man during his natural life was to be employed in <hi>tilling and dressing of the Ground, Gen.</hi> 2.16. a labour that would have been easie, usefull, and suitable unto his condition, but yet in honour, advantage, and satisfaction, unspeakably beneath the Duty of the Others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Their <hi>Enjoyments</hi> also greatly differed. For the <hi>Angels</hi> enjoyed the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate glorious Presence of God, without any external <hi>created resemblances</hi> of it; when man was kept at a greater Distance, and not admitted unto such immediate commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, or enjoyment of his Glorious Presence. Now all these, and the like Considerations, although on the one side they do not in the <hi>least extenuate</hi> or excuse the sin and crime of <hi>Man</hi> in his <hi>Apostasie,</hi> yet they <hi>greatly aggravate</hi> the Wickedness, Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Pride of the <hi>Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, they differed in their <hi>Intellectual Perfections,</hi> whereby they were enabled to discern the Excellencies, and to know the mind of God. For although man had all that Light, Knowledge and Wisdom <hi>concreated</hi> with him, and so <hi>naturall</hi> unto him, which were any way needfull to enable him unto a right and due performance of the <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> required of him, in the Observance whereof he should have been brought unto the Enjoyment of God; yet it came far short of that <hi>Excellency</hi> of Understanding, and that piercing Wisdom which was in those <hi>Spiritual Beings,</hi> which they were endowed withall to fit them for that <hi>near</hi> contemplation of the glory of God whereunto they were admitted, and that ready Apprehension of his mind which they were to observe. And as these were in themselves, and ought to have been improved by themselves, as <hi>blessed means</hi> of preserving them in their Obedience, so being despised and neglected they were a great Aggravation of the Wickedness of their <hi>Apostasy.</hi>

                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:50110:47"/>There was likewise (Fifthly) a difference in the <hi>manner of their Defection.</hi> Man was <hi>circumvented</hi> by the Craft and Policy of the <hi>Angels,</hi> who were made before him, and sinned before him. And this, although He was furnished with an Ability and Power to have rejected and overcome, yet it had that influence into his Sin and Fall, that the Holy Ghost affirms that our <hi>first Parents</hi> were SEDUCED, or deceived, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. and therefore calls <hi>Sathan</hi> their <hi>Murderer, John</hi> 8.34. But the Angels had nothing without them to excite, provoke, or <hi>lay snares</hi> for them; but of their own <hi>Voluntary Choice,</hi> and meer motion of their own mind, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of that <hi>Freedom of their Wills</hi> which was bestowed on them for their own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and advantage in their Obedience, left their stations, and set up themselves in a way of Opposition unto their <hi>Creator,</hi> who had exalted them above their companions, newly brought out of the same <hi>Nothing</hi> with themselves, into a condition of the highest created Glory imaginable.</p>
                  <p>Again (Sixthly) although the condition of mankind being to be propagated by <hi>naturall Generation</hi> from one common Stock, made it necessary that our <hi>First Parents</hi> should have a greater Trust reposed in them, by Reason of their <hi>Representation</hi> of their whole Posterity in that Covenant wherein they stood before God, than any <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> could have, seeing they stood every one, only in his <hi>own name,</hi> and for himself; yet they were but <hi>two persons</hi> that actually sinned at first, and those one after another, one seduced by another; whereas the <hi>Angels</hi> in multitudes <hi>inconceivable,</hi> by a joint conspiracy at the same instant combined together against the Authority and Law of their Creator; and as it should seem appointed one among themselves for the Head of their Apostasie. Now although, as was said, none of those things can, or do in the least <hi>extenuate</hi> the sin of <hi>man,</hi> which was the product of inconceivable infidelity and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, yet they contain such <hi>Aggravations</hi> of the Sin of <hi>Angels,</hi> as may evidence a condecency unto Divine Wisdom and Goodness, in passing them by in their sin and misery unto Eternity, and yet giving Relief unto mankind.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, We may add unto what hath been spoken the concernment of the glory of God in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverse.</hi> For if <hi>man</hi> had been left for ever without Relief, the whole <hi>race</hi> or kind of Creatures, partakers of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> had been utterly lost; nothing of that kind could ever have come unto the Enjoyment of God, nor could God have ever been glorified by them in a way of Thankfulness and Praise, which yet was the End why he made that sort of Creatures. For the whole race of them as to the <hi>Event</hi> would have been meer Objects of Wrath and Displeasure. But in the Fall of Angels, they were only a certain number of <hi>individuals,</hi> that sinned, the whole kind was not lost as to the first End of their Creation. <hi>Angelical Nature</hi> was preserved in its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly dependance on God, in those millions that kept their Obedience, and Primitive condition thereon, which is continued unto them with a <hi>superaddition</hi> of Glory and Honour, as shall be elsewhere declared. God then having made himself <hi>two Families</hi> unto his Praise, amongst whom he would dwell, that above of <hi>Angels,</hi> and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of <hi>mankind,</hi> had <hi>sinning Man,</hi> which was the whole Creation participating in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature,</hi> been utterly cast off, one <hi>Family</hi> had been lost for ever, though so great a Remnant of the other was preserved. Wherefore, as we shall afterwards see, it seemed good unto his Infinite Wisdom, as to <hi>preserve</hi> that Portion of his <hi>Superiour Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> which sinned not, so to recover a portion of that <hi>below,</hi> and to make them up into <hi>one Family</hi> in one New Head, his Son <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> in whom he hath now actually gathered into <hi>One,</hi> all things that are in Heaven and Earth unto his <hi>Praise and Glory, Ephes.</hi> 1.10. It appears then that no certain conclusion can hence be drawn, that <hi>man</hi> is left remediless in his Sin and Misery, because Angels are so; seeing that although the <hi>whole Cause</hi> of the difference made is to be referred unto the Soveraign Will, Wisdom and Pleasure of God, yet there is that appearing unto Reason, which manifests a suitableness unto his Excellencies in the distinction to be put between them.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>15</label> There is then no <hi>Necessary Reason</hi> inducing us to believe, that God hath left all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to perish in their sin and misery under the <hi>Curse</hi> without any provision of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi>; yea, there are on the other side Evidences many and certain, that there is a <hi>Way</hi> provided for their Recovery. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The Glorious Properties of the Nature of God whose Manifestation and Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in all the works that outwardly are of him, he designeth, do require that there should be <hi>Salvation</hi> for <hi>Sinners.</hi> Even this matter of the <hi>Salvation of Sinners</hi> conduceth, yea is necessary unto the manifestation of some of those Divine Excellencies, wherein no small part of the glory of God doth consist. God had in the <hi>Creation</hi> of all things
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50110:47"/>
glorified his Greatness, Power, Wisdom and Goodness. His Soveraignty, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and Holiness, he had in like manner revealed in that <hi>Holy Law</hi> which he had prescribed unto Angels and Men for the Rule of their Obedience, and in the Assignation of their Reward. Upon the <hi>Sin</hi> of Angels and Men, he had made known his Severity and <hi>Vindictive Justice,</hi> in the Curse and Punishment inflicted on them. But there were yet remaining undiscovered in the <hi>Abysse</hi> of his Eternal Essence, <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Pardoning Mercy,</hi> which in none of his Works had as yet exerted themselves, or manifested their Glory. And in case no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi> be provided for mankind under the Evils mentioned, and their utter ruine, as they must have perished accordingly, so those glorious Properties of the nature of God, all wayes of exerting their proper and peculiar Acts being <hi>secluded,</hi> all objects of them removed, could not have been equally glorified with his other Holy Attributes. The creatures know nothing in God, but as it manifested in its <hi>Effects.</hi> His <hi>Essence</hi> in its self dwells in Light inaccessible. Had never any stood in need of <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Mercy,</hi> or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, had never been made partakers of them, it could not have been known that there was that kind of <hi>Goodness</hi> in his Nature, which yet it is his design principally to glorifie himself in. The <hi>necessity</hi> therefore of the Manifestation of these Properties of God, his Goodness, Grace, Mercy, and Readiness to Forgive, which can only be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised about <hi>sinners,</hi> and that in their Relief and Salvation from Sin and Misery do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that the Deliverance enquired after be admitted and justly expected. And this <hi>Expectation</hi> is so much the more <hi>just</hi> and firmly grounded in that there is nothing in himself which the Lord more requireth our <hi>Conformity</hi> unto himself in, than in this Condescension, Goodness, Grace, and Readiness to forgive, which manifests how <hi>dear</hi> the glory of them is unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To what End shall we conceive the Providence and <hi>Patience</hi> of God to be exercised towards the Race of Mankind, for so long a season in the Earth? We see what is the general Issue and Event of the <hi>continuance</hi> of Mankind in the world; God saw it and complained of it long ago, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. Shall we now think that God hath no other Design in his <hi>Patience</hi> towards mankind for so many Generations, but meerly to suffer them <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>Every one</hi> without exception, to sin against him, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him, provoke him, that so He may at length everlastingly destroy them? That this indeed is the <hi>Event</hi> with many, with the most, through their own perverse wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, blindness, and love of the pleasures of sin, cannot be denyed. But to suppose that God hath no other <hi>design</hi> at all, but meerly by his Patience to forbear them awhile in their <hi>folly,</hi> and then to avenge himself upon them, is unsuitable unto his Wisdom and Goodness. It cannot be then, but that he would long since have cut off the whole Race, if there were <hi>no way</hi> for them to be delivered out of this perishing condition. And although this way what ever it be, is not <hi>Effectual</hi> towards All, yet for their sakes towards whom, through the grace of God it is, and shall be so, is the <hi>Patience</hi> of God exercised towards the whole Race of Mankind, and their Being is continued in this world. Other Reason of this <hi>Dispensation</hi> of Divine Wisdom and Goodness can none be assigned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there is a <hi>way of Diliverance</hi> for Mankind, the <hi>Event</hi> hath manifested in two remarkable and undeniable <hi>Instances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, In that <hi>sundry Persons</hi> who were as others by <hi>nature children of Wrath,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curse, have obtained an undoubted and <hi>infallible</hi> interest in the love and favour of God, and this <hi>Testimony</hi> that they pleased him. What were the <hi>Assurances</hi> they had hereof, I shall not now debate. But I take it now for granted, which may be farther confirmed as occasion shall require, that some Persons in all Generations, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the <hi>Friendship,</hi> Love and Favour of God; which they could never have done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there had been some way for their Deliverance out of the state of Sin and <hi>Misery</hi> before described. For therein every man upon a just account will find himself in the state of <hi>Adam,</hi> who when <hi>he heard the voice of God was afraid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> God hath been pleased to require from men a <hi>Revenue of Glory</hi> by a way of Worship prescribed unto them after the Entrance of sin. This he hath not done unto the <hi>Angels</hi> that sinned; nor could it have been done in a consistency with <hi>Righteousness</hi> unto <hi>men</hi> without a Supposition of a <hi>Possibility</hi> of Deliverance from under his Wrath. For in every Prescription of Duty, God proposeth himself as a <hi>Rewarder,</hi> which he is only unto them that please him; and to please God without the <hi>Deliverance</hi> enquired after is impossible. Besides that God is actually glorified in the world, by the <hi>Way of Worship</hi> required on this supposition, shall be elsewhere declared, and <hi>Arguments</hi> added in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50110:48"/>
full measure to confirm our Assertion. <hi>Deliverance</hi> then from this condition may on just grounds be expected; and how it might be effected, is our next Enquiry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>16</label> The great Relief enquired after, must be brought about by <hi>men</hi> themselves, or by some <hi>other</hi> for them. What they can do themselves herein we may be quickly satisfied about. The nature of the <hi>Evils</hi> under which they suffer, and the <hi>Event</hi> of things in the world sufficiently discover the disability of men to be their own <hi>Deliverers.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, who should contrive the <hi>way</hi> of it, for them? One Single Person, More, or All? How easily the <hi>impossibility</hi> of it might be demonstrated on any of these suppositions, is too manifest to be insisted on. The <hi>Evils</hi> suffered under, are of two sorts, both <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi> and Eternal. The first is that of <hi>Punishment,</hi> inflicted from the Righteousness of God.</p>
                  <p>There are but two wayes possible (setting aside the Consideration of what shall be afterwards fixed on) whereby mankind, or any individual Person amongst them, may obtain deliverance from this Evil: And the first is, that God without any further consideration should remit it, and exempt the <hi>Creation</hi> from under it. But although this way may seem <hi>possible</hi> unto some, it is indeed utterly otherwise. Did not the sentence of it proceed from his <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and the Essential Rectitude of his Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Did he not engage his <hi>Truth</hi> and faithfulness, that it should be inflicted? and doth not his <hi>Holiness</hi> and Justice require that so it should be? What should become o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. How also can it be supposed that any of his future <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mminations</hi> should have a just weight upon the souls of men; if that first great and fundamental one sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uld be frustrated and evacuated? or what <hi>Authority</hi> would be left unto his <hi>Law,</hi> when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self should dissolve the Sanction of it? Besides if God should do thus, which Reason, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and the Event of things do manifest that he neither would nor <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d,</hi> (for he cannot deny himself) this would have been his work, and not an acquisition of men themselves, which we are now enquiring, after. So that this way of <hi>deliverance,</hi> as it is but <hi>imaginary,</hi> so it is here of no consideration.</p>
                  <p>There is <hi>no other way</hi> then for man, if he will not perish eternally under the <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> due unto his Apostasie and Rebellion, but secondly to find out some way of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation,</hi> or making a <hi>Recompence</hi> for the Evil of sin unto the Law and Righteousness of God. But herein his utter insufficiency quickly manifests it self. What ever he is, or hath, or can pretend any Interest in, lyes no less under the <hi>Curse</hi> than he doth himself. And that which is under the <hi>Curse</hi> can <hi>contribute</hi> nothing unto its removall. That which is in its whole <hi>Being</hi> obnoxious unto the greatest Punishment, can have nothing wherewithall to make <hi>Commutation</hi> for it. For that must first be accepted in, and for its self, which can either make <hi>Attonement,</hi> or be received for any other in Exchange. And this is the condition of man, and of every <hi>individuall</hi> of mankind, and will be so to Eternity, unless <hi>Relief</hi> arise from another place. It is farther also evident, that all the endeavours of men must needs be unspeakably disproportionate unto the Effect and End aimed at, from the concernment of the other parts of the Creation in the <hi>Curse</hi> against sin. What can they do to restore the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverse</hi> unto its first Glory and Beauty? How can they reduce the Creation unto its <hi>Original Harmony?</hi> Wherewith shall they <hi>recompence</hi> the Great God for the defacing of so great a portion of that <hi>impress</hi> of his Glory and Goodness that he had enstamped on it? In a word, they who from their first <hi>date</hi> unto their utmost <hi>Period</hi> are alwayes under the <hi>Punishment,</hi> can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the <hi>total</hi> removall of it. The Experience also of <hi>five thousand years</hi> hath <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently</hi> evinced, how <hi>insufficient man</hi> is to be a Saviour unto himself. All the various and uncertain motions of <hi>Adam's</hi> Posterity in Religion, from the Extremity of <hi>Atheism</hi> unto that of <hi>Sacrificing</hi> themselves and one another have been destined in vain, towards this End. Neither can any of them to this day, find out a better, or more likely way for them to <hi>thrive</hi> in, than those wherewith their Progenitors deluded themselves. And in the Issue of all we see, that as to what man hath been able of himself to do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own <hi>Deliverance,</hi> both himself and the whole world, are continued in the same state wherein they were upon the first Entrance of Sin <hi>cumulated</hi> as it were with another world of Confusion, Disorder, Mischief and Misery. There is also another head of the Misery of man, and that is the corrupt spring of <hi>Moral Evil</hi> that is in his nature. This also is <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niversal</hi> and Endless. It mixeth its self with all, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50110:48"/>
every thing, that man doth, or can do, as a <hi>Moral</hi> Agent, and that alwayes, and for ever, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 5. It is then impossible that it should have an end, unless it do either <hi>destroy,</hi> or spend its self. But seeing it will do neither of these, <hi>ever sinning</hi>; which man cannot but be, is not the way to <hi>disentangle</hi> himself from sin.</p>
                  <p>If then any Deliverance be ever obtained for mankind, it must be by some other <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>17</label> not <hi>involved</hi> in the same misery with themselves. This must either be God himself or good Angels. Other <hi>Rational Agents</hi> there are none. If we look to the <hi>latter,</hi> we must suppose them to undertake this work either by the <hi>Appointment</hi> of God, or upon their own <hi>Accord,</hi> without his previous Command or Direction. The latter cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. They knew too much of the Majesty, Holiness, and Terror of the great God to venture on an <hi>interposition</hi> of themselves upon his Counsels and Wayes, uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. To do so would have been a sinfull <hi>dissolution</hi> of the Law of their Creation. So much also they might discern of the work its self, as to stifle unto <hi>Eternity,</hi> every thought of engaging themselves into it. Besides they knew the Will of God, by what they saw come to pass. They saw his Justice and Holiness <hi>glorified</hi> in the Evils which he had brought upon the world. That He would not for ever satisfie himself in that Glory, they knew not. And what was <hi>man</hi> unto them, that they should busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to retrive him from that condition whereinto he had cast himself by sin, finding Him glorified therein, in conformity unto whose will their Happiness and Perfection doth consist? As remote as men are from thoughts of recovering <hi>Fallen Angells,</hi> so far were they contriving the Recovery of Man.</p>
                  <p>But it may be said, the God himself might <hi>design</hi> them to work out the Salvation and deliverance enquired after, as was before supposed. But this makes God, and not them to be the Saviour, and them only the <hi>Instruments</hi> in the Accomplishment of his work. Neither yet hath he done so, nor were they <hi>meet</hi> so to be employed. What ever is <hi>purely poenall</hi> in the misery of man is an Effect of the Righteous Judgement of God. This, as we have manifested could be no otherwise diverted from him, but by the <hi>undergoing</hi> of it, by some other in his stead. And two things are required in him, or them that should so <hi>undergoe</hi> it. First, That they were not themselves <hi>obnoxious</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, either <hi>Personally,</hi> or upon the first <hi>common account:</hi> Should they be so, they ought to look to their own <hi>concernment</hi> in the first place. Secondly, that they were such, as that the Benefit of their <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndergoing</hi> that Penalty, might according to the Rules of Justice redound unto them, for whom, and in whose stead they underwent it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they would suffer in vain. Now although the Angels might answer the first of these in their <hi>Personal immunity</hi> from obnoxiousness unto the Curse, yet the latter they were unsuited for. They had no Relation unto mankind, but only that they were the <hi>Workmanship</hi> of the same Creator. But this is not sufficient to warrant such a substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Had <hi>Angels</hi> been to be delivered, their Redemption must have been wrought in the <hi>Angelical Nature,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> declares, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 16. But what Justice is it that <hi>Man</hi> should sin, and <hi>Angels</hi> suffer? or from whence should it arise that from <hi>their</hi> suffering it should be Righteous, that <hi>he</hi> should go free? By what notions of God could we have been instructed in the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and Righteousness of such a Proceeding? Add hereunto, that this God <hi>hath not done,</hi> and we may safely conclude, that it <hi>became him</hi> not so to do.</p>
                  <p>But what need all this Enquiry? The <hi>Jews</hi> with whom we principally have to do <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>18</label> in this matter, plead constantly, that God hath appointed unto men, at least unto themselves, a way and means of <hi>Delivery</hi> out of this condition. And this is, by the observation of <hi>Moses's Law.</hi> By this they say, they are <hi>justified</hi> in the sight of God, and have <hi>Deliverance</hi> from all wrath due unto sin. This they <hi>trusted</hi> in of old; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 32. this they continue to make their <hi>Refuge</hi> at this day. <hi>Spiritualis liberatio solum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo dependet ab Observatione legis quam Deus in monte Sinai promulgavit. Spiritual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance dependeth solely on the Observation of the Law which God promulgated on Mount Sinai,</hi> saith the Author of the Answers unto certain Questions proposed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Quest. 5. published by <hi>Brenius,</hi> who in his reply hath betrayed unto them the most important Doctrines of the Christian Religion. But this is their Perswasion. The giving of <hi>this Law</hi> unto them, they suppose to have freed them utterly from every thing in the condition before described, so far as they will acknowledge it to concern any of the Posterity of <hi>Adam.</hi> And whereas they cannot deny but that they sometimes sin against the Moral Precepts of this Law, and so stand in need of Help against their <hi>Helper,</hi> they fix in this case upon a double relief. The first is of their own <hi>Personal Repentance</hi>; and the other the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> that are appointed in the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:50110:49"/>But whereas they now are, and have been for many Generations, deprived of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> as they esteem it of offering Sacrifices according to the Law, they hope that their <hi>own Repentance</hi> with their death, which they pray that it may be <hi>expiatory,</hi> will be sufficient to obtain for them the <hi>forgiveness of sin.</hi> Only they say this might better and more easie be effected, if they might enjoy the Benefit of Sacrifices. So saith the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Jew,</hi> whose Discourse is published by <hi>Brenius. Quamvis jam nulla sint Sacrificia, quae media erant ad tanto facilius impetrandam remissionem peccatorum, eadem tamen per poenitentiam &amp; resipiscentiam impetratur:</hi> And again, <hi>Hodie victimas offere non possumus destituti mediis ad hoc necessariis, quae quando obtinebimus, tum remissio illa tanto facilior reddetur. Respon. ad Quaest. Septim.</hi> If they cannot obtain the use of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> yet the matter may be effected by their <hi>Repentance</hi>; only it were much easier to do it by <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> And they seem to long for them principally on this account, that by them they may free themselves from somewhat of <hi>Discipline</hi> and Penance which now their consciences enforce them unto: But this, as all other Articles of their Creed which are properly <hi>Judaical,</hi> is feigned by them to suit their present condition and Interest. For where do they find that their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> especially that which they most trust in, namely, that on the <hi>Feast of Expiation, Lev.</hi> 16. was ever designed for this End, to enable them the <hi>more easily</hi> to obtain the Remission of sins by another means which they use? For it is said directly, that the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> on that day did expiate their sin, and make <hi>Attonement</hi> for it, that they might not dye; and not that it did help them in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pardon another way. But this is now taken from them, and what shall they do? Why rather than they will look or come to him, who was <hi>represented</hi> in that Sacrifice, and on whose account alone it had all its efficacy, they will find out a <hi>new way</hi> of doing that which their Sacrifices were appointed unto; and this they must do, or openly acknowledge that they all <hi>perish</hi> eternally. I shall not insist long on the casting down of this <hi>Imagination,</hi> all the Foundations of it being long ago demolished by our <hi>Apostle</hi> in his <hi>Epistles,</hi> especially those to the <hi>Romans, Galatians,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themselves. And this he hath not done meerly by a <hi>new Revelation</hi> of the Mind and Will of God, but upon the Principles, and by the Testimonies of the Old Testament its self; as will afterwards more fully appear. Only because it is here set up in <hi>competition</hi> with that blessed and <hi>All-sufficient Remedy</hi> against Sin and the Curse, which God indeed hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: I shall briefly remove it out of our Way, and that by manifesting that it is neither in its self suited unto that End, nor was ever of God designed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>19</label> That all <hi>mankind</hi> was cast into the condition we have described by and upon the the sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> we have before sufficiently confirmed. Other just <hi>Reason,</hi> or Occasion of it, no man can assign. It hath been also evinced that God <hi>would,</hi> and consequently <hi>did</hi> prepare a <hi>Remedy</hi> for them, or a Way of Deliverance to be proposed unto them. If this were only the <hi>Law of Moses</hi> and the Observance thereof, as the <hi>Jews pretend,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know what became of them, what was their Estate and Condition who <hi>lived and dyed</hi> before the giving of that Law? Not only the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> who some of them had this Testimony, that they pleased God, and one of whom was taken <hi>alive into Heaven,</hi> but <hi>Abraham</hi> also himself who received the <hi>Promises,</hi> must on this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position be excluded from a participation in the Deliverance enquired after. For they observed not the <hi>Law of Moses.</hi> What they dream about the making of their Law before the Foundation of the World, and the <hi>study of God</hi> therein, and that night and day, by day in the <hi>Written Law,</hi> and by night in the <hi>Oral Cabal,</hi> is not to be mentioned where matters of importance unto the souls of men are under conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>But yet I may add by the way, that neither this, nor the like <hi>monstrous figments</hi> are invented or broached by them, without some especial design, In the <hi>Eighth Chapter of the Proverbs,</hi> there is mention of the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, and such a description given of it, as allows not an <hi>Essential Property</hi> of his nature to be thereby intended. This is there said to be with God before the foundation of the world his delight and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Whence it appears that nothing but the <hi>Eternal Word, Wisdom</hi> and Son of God can possibly be intended thereby. To avoid this Testimony given unto his Eternal subsistence, the <hi>Jews</hi> first invented this <hi>Fable,</hi> that the Law was <hi>created before the world,</hi> and that the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of it, was that which God conversed with, and delighted in. And I have often wondered at the Censure of a learned <hi>Christian Annotator</hi> upon the place; <hi>Haec,</hi> saith he, <hi>de ea sapientia quae in Lege apparet exponunt Hebraei; &amp; sane ei, si non soli at praecipue haec attributa conveniunt,</hi> contrary to the Faith of the Church in all Ages.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50110:49"/>
It is true on <hi>v.</hi> 22. and those that follow, He affirms they may be expounded by that of <hi>Philo de Coloniis.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. But whether this <hi>Platonical</hi> Declaration of the Nature, and Work of the Word of God, employed by him as an <hi>Instrument</hi> in the <hi>Making</hi> and Government of the World, would have been accepted in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> when this Place was vexed by the <hi>Arians,</hi> and studiously vindicated by the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Fathers,</hi> I much question. But to return; If the <hi>Law</hi> and the observance of it, be the only Remedy provided of God against the sin and misery of man, the only means of Reconciliation with him, all that <hi>dyed</hi> before the giving of it, must perish, and that eternally. But the contrary appears from this very consideration, and is undeniably proved by our <hi>Apostle</hi> in the Instance of <hi>Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 17. For he received the <hi>Promise,</hi> and was taken into <hi>Covenant</hi> with God four hundred and thirty years before the giving of the Law. And that <hi>Covenant</hi> conveyed unto him the Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, with <hi>Deliverance</hi> from Sin and the Curse, as themselves will not deny.</p>
                  <p>There was therefore a <hi>Remedy</hi> in this case provided long before the giving of the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>; and therefore the Law was not given unto that purpose, but for other Ends at large declared by our <hi>Apostle.</hi> Either then they must grant that all the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and he in especiall of whom they boast perished eternally, or else that there was a means of <hi>Deliverance</hi> provided before the giving of the Law, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the Law was not given for that End. The <hi>first</hi> they will not do, nor can without an absolute Renunciation of their own <hi>Sacred Writings,</hi> wherein none have obtained a larger Testimony that they pleased God than they. The <hi>latter</hi> therefore followeth undeniably. If they shall say they had a way of <hi>Deliverance,</hi> but God provided another afterwards, as this would be spoken without Warrant or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> from the Scripture, so I desire to know both <hi>what</hi> that way was, and <hi>why</hi> it was rejected. Of Gods appointment it was, and effectual it was unto them that embraced it, and why it should be laid aside who can declare?</p>
                  <p>Again, as was before observed, there are two parts of the Law; The <hi>Moral Precepts</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>20</label> of it, and the instituted <hi>Worship</hi> appointed in it. Unto this latter part do the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of it belong. But neither of these are sufficient unto the <hi>End</hi> proposed, nor jointly can they attain it. Two things are evidently necessary from what hath been discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unto the <hi>Deliverance</hi> enquired after. <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Man</hi> be <hi>reconciled</hi> unto God, by the removal of the Curse, and the Wrath due unto him for his Apostacy. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That his Nature be freed from that Principle of Sin and enmity against God, <hi>(the evil fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)</hi> that it is tainted, yea, possessed withall. And neither of these can be effected by the <hi>Law,</hi> or either part of it. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Moral Precepts</hi> of it are the same with those that were written in the heart of man by Nature, or the <hi>Law of his Creation</hi> which he transgressed in his first Rebellion. And he must be delivered from that <hi>guilt</hi> before any new Obedience can be accepted of him. His <hi>old debt</hi> must be satisfied for, before he can treat for a <hi>new Reward,</hi> which inseparably follows all acceptable Obedience. But this the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Law take no notice of, nor direct unto any way for its removal; only supposing the doing of it by some other means, it requires exact Obedience in them that come to God thereby. Hence our Apostle concludes, that it could <hi>not give life,</hi> but was <hi>weak and insufficient</hi> in its self unto any such purpose.</p>
                  <p>Besides secondly, it could not absolutely preserve men in its own Observation; for it required that Obedience which never any <hi>sinner</hi> did or could in all things perform; as the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> abundantly manifest. For they tell us, <hi>there is is no man that sinneth not,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 46. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 36. That, if the Lord <hi>should mark iniquity no man could stand, Psal.</hi> 130. <hi>v.</hi> 3. And that, <hi>if he enter into Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (according to the Law) <hi>no man living can be justified in his sight, Psal.</hi> 143. <hi>v.</hi> 2. To this Purpose see the excellent Discourse, and invincible Reasonings of our Apostle, <hi>Rom. chap.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. This the Holy Men of Old <hi>confessed,</hi> this the Scripture bears testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unto, and this Experience confirmes, seeing <hi>every sin,</hi> and transgression of that Law was put under <hi>a Curse, Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 26. Where then, there is no man that <hi>sinneth not,</hi> and every sin is put under the curse, the Law in the <hi>Preceptive part</hi> of it can be no means of delivery from the one or other, but is rather a certain means of increasing and aggravating of them both. Neither is there any Testimony given concerning any one under the Old Testament that he was any other way justified before God, but by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50110:50"/>
                     <hi>Faith and the Pardon of Sins,</hi> which are not of the Works of the Law. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. Of <hi>Noah</hi> indeed it is said, that he was <hi>upright,</hi> and <hi>perfect in his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; that is sincere in his Obedience, and free from the open wickedness of the <hi>Age</hi> wherein he lived. But as this was before the giving of the Law by <hi>Moses,</hi> so the Ground of his Freedom and Deliverance is added to be the <hi>Gracious Love and Favour</hi> of God. This the Jews themselves confess in <hi>Bereshith Rabba: Sect.</hi> 29. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Even</hi> Noah <hi>himself who was left of them was not every way as he should be, but that he found Grace or Favour in the eyes of the Lord.</hi> And to the same purpose they speak concerning <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himself elsewhere. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Thou findest that</hi> Abraham <hi>our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inherited not this world and the world to come any otherwise than by Faith; as it is said he believed God.</hi> This part therefore of the Law, is plainly convinced to be insufficient to deliver sinners from an Antecedent guilt, and Curse due there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>21</label> It remains then that the <hi>Sacrifices of the Law</hi> must yield the Relief enquired after, or we are still at a loss in this matter. And these the <hi>Jews</hi> would willingly place their chief confidence in; they did so of old. Since indeed they have been driven from their Observation; they have betaken themselves unto other <hi>Helps,</hi> that they might not appear to be utterly hopeless.

The Rites of that <hi>Diabolical</hi> Solemnity are declared at large by <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torfius</hi> in his <hi>Synagog. Judaic. cap.</hi> 20. But yet as this <hi>folly</hi> manifests that they can find no rest in their consciences without their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> so it gives them not at all what they seek after. And therefore being driven from all other hopes they trust at length unto their own <hi>Death,</hi> for in Life they have no hope; making this one of their constant Prayers, <hi>Let my Death be the Expiation of all Sins.</hi> But this is the <hi>curse,</hi> and so no means to avoid it. Omitting therefore these horrid follies of men under <hi>despair,</hi> an effect of that wrath which is come upon them unto the uttermost, the thing its self may be considered.</p>
                  <p>That the Sacrifices of <hi>Moses's</hi> Law in and by themselves, should be a means to deliver men from the guilt of sin, and to reconcile them unto God, is contrary to the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> their own <hi>proper use,</hi> and express Testimonies of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> For <hi>First,</hi> Can any man think it reasonable that the blood of <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> should of its self make an <hi>Expiation</hi> of the sin of the souls of men, <hi>reconcile</hi> them to God the Judge of all, and impart unto them an Everlasting Righteousness? Our Apostle declares the manifest impossibility hereof, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 4. They must have very mean and low thoughts of God, his Holiness, Justice, Truth, of the Demerit of Sin, of Heaven and Hell, who think them all to depend on the blood of a <hi>Calf or a Goat.</hi> The Sacrifices of them indeed might by Gods appointment represent <hi>that</hi> to the minds of men which is effectuall unto the whole End of appeasing Gods Justice, and of obtaining his Favour; but that they should themselves effect it, is unsuitable unto all the Apprehensions which are imbred in the heart of man, either concerning the nature of God, or the Guilt of Sin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their Primitive and proper use, doth manifest the same. For they were to be frequently <hi>repeated,</hi> and in all the Repetitions of them, there was still new mention made of sin. They <hi>could</hi> not therefore by themselves take it away; for if they could, they would not have been reiterated. It is apparent therefore that their use was to <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> and bring to remembrance that which did perfectly take away sin. For a <hi>perfect work</hi> may be often remembred, but it need not, it cannot be often done. For being done for such an End, and that End being obtained it cannot be done again. The Sacrifices therefore were never appointed, never used <hi>to take away sin,</hi> which they did not, but to represent that which did so effectually.</p>
                  <p>Besides, there were <hi>some sins</hi> that men may be guilty of whom God will not utterly reject, for which there was no Sacrifice appointed in the <hi>Law of Moses:</hi> as was the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50110:50"/>
case with <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>v.</hi> 16. which makes it undeniable that there was some other way of Attonement besides them and beyond them, as our <hi>Apostle</hi> declares, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 38, 39. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Scripture expresly <hi>rejects</hi> all the Sacrifices of the Law, when they are trusted in for any such End and Purpose, which sufficiently demonstrates that they were never appointed thereunto. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 40 <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 66. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Amos.</hi> 5.21, 22. <hi>Micha</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. and other places innumerable.</p>
                  <p>Add unto what hath been spoken, that during the Observation of the whole Law <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>22</label> of <hi>Moses,</hi> whilest it was in force by the Appointment of God himself, He still directed those who sought for Acceptance with him, unto a <hi>New Covenant</hi> of Grace, whole <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi> by faith they were then made partakers of, and whole <hi>nature</hi> was afterwards more fully to be declared. See <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32, 33, 34. with the inferences of our Apostle thereon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12, 13. And this plainly everts the whole Foundation of the <hi>Jews</hi> Expectation of Justification before God on the account of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> given on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> For to what purpose should God call them from resting on the <hi>Covenant</hi> thereof, to look for Mercy and Grace in and by another, if that had been able to give them the help desired?</p>
                  <p>In brief then, the <hi>Jews</hi> fixing on the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> as the only means of delivery from sin and death, as they do thereby exclude all mankind besides themselves from any interest in the Love, Favour, or Grace of God, which they greatly <hi>design</hi> and desire, so they cast themselves also into a miserable restless self-condemned condition in this world, by trusting to that which will not relieve them, and into Endless misery here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by refusing that which effectually would make them <hi>Heirs of Salvation.</hi> For whilest they perish in their sin, another, better, more glorious and sure Remedy against all the Evils that are come upon mankind, or are justly feared to be coming by any of them, is provided in the Grace, Wisdom, and Love of God, as shall now farther be demonstrated.</p>
                  <p>The first intimation that God gave of this work of his Grace in Redeeming mankind <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>23</label> from sin and misery, is contained in the <hi>Promise</hi> subjoyned unto the Curse denounced against our first Parents, and their Posterity in them, Gen. 3. <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>The seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shall bruise the Heaa of the Serpent, and the Serpent shall bruise his Heel.</hi> Two things there are contained in these words, <hi>A Promise of Relief</hi> from the misery brought on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by the Temptation of Satan; and an intimation of the Means or <hi>Way,</hi> whereby it should be brought about. That the <hi>first</hi> is included in these words is evident; For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> If there be not a Promise of Deliverance expressed in these words, whence is it, that the execution of the sentence of Death against sin, is suspended? Unless we will allow an <hi>Intervention</hi> satisfactory to the Righteousness and Truth of God to be expressed in these words, there would have been a truth in the <hi>suggestion of the Serpent,</hi> namely, that whatever God had said, yet indeed they were not to dye. The <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>Midrash Tehillim,</hi> as <hi>Kimchi</hi> informs us on <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. whose Title is, <hi>a Psalm for the Sabbath Day,</hi> which they generally assign unto <hi>Adam,</hi> say that <hi>Adam</hi> was cast out of the <hi>Garden of Eden,</hi> on the Evening of the <hi>sixth day</hi>; after which God came to execute the <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> upon him; but the <hi>Sabbath</hi> being come on, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment was deferred, whereon <hi>Adam</hi> made that <hi>Psalm</hi> for the <hi>Sabbath Day.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an interposition of some external Cause and Reason they acknowledge that Death ought immediately to have been inflicted; and other besides what is mentioned in these words, there was none.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The whole Evil of sin and Curse that mankind then did, or was to suffer under, proceeded from the <hi>friendship</hi> contracted between the <hi>Woman</hi> and the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and her fixing faith in him. God here declares that he will break that <hi>League,</hi> and put <hi>Enmity</hi> between them. Being now both of them under the same condition of sin and Curse, this could not be without a change of Condition in one of them. Satan is not divided from himself; nor is at Enmity with them that are left wholly in his Estate. A change of Condition therefore on the part of the <hi>Woman and her Seed,</hi> is plainly promised; that is, by a <hi>Deliverance</hi> from the state of sin and misery wherein they were. Without this the <hi>Enmity mentioned</hi> could not have ensued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In pursuit of this Enmity the seed of the woman was to <hi>bruise the Head of the Serpent.</hi> The <hi>Head</hi> is the seat of his Power and Craft. Without the destruction of the Evil and pernicious effects which by his Counsel he had brought about, his <hi>Head</hi> cannot be <hi>bruised.</hi> By his <hi>Head</hi> he had contrived the <hi>Ruine</hi> of mankind; and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50110:51"/>
without the Destruction of his Works, and a Recovery from that Ruine, he is not conquered, nor his <hi>Head</hi> bruised. And as these things though they may now seem somewhat obscurely expressed in these words, are yet made plain unto us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; so the importance of them was evident unto our first Parents of old, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by all the <hi>Circumstances</hi> wherewith the matter of fact was attended.</p>
                  <p>Again, there is an intimation of the <hi>manner</hi> how this work shall be performed. This <hi>First,</hi> God takes upon himself; I will do it; I will put <hi>Enmity</hi>: It is an issue of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign <hi>Wisdom</hi> and Grace. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> He will do it <hi>in</hi> and by the <hi>nature</hi> of man; the <hi>seed of the Woman.</hi> And two things must concur to the effecting of it. <hi>First,</hi> That this <hi>seed of the Woman</hi> must conquer Satan; bruise his Head, destroy his Works, and procure Deliverance for mankind thereby. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he must suffer from, and by the means of Satan in his so doing; the <hi>Serpent</hi> must <hi>bruise his Heel.</hi> This is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and Relief,</hi> that God hath provided for mankind. And this is the MESSIAH; or God joyning with the Nature of man, to Deliver mankind from sin and Eternal misery.</p>

I know some of the later <hi>Masters</hi> have other thoughts of these things, because they discover what use may be made of the Truth, and the Faith of their fore-fathers in this matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> in his <hi>Commentary</hi> on this place disputes the Opinions of their Doctors;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50110:51"/>
and although he acknowledge that <hi>Rabbi Saadias Haggaon,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Samuel Ben Hophni,</hi> with others, (that is indeed their <hi>Targums,</hi> and <hi>Talmuds,</hi> and all their antient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) affirm <hi>Satan</hi> to be intended, yet he contends for the Serpent only, on the weak pretences that Satan <hi>goeth not on his Belly, nor eateth Dust,</hi> which things in the letter are confessed to belong unto the Instrument that he used. And hereon they would have it that the <hi>Serpent</hi> was deprived of <hi>voice and understanding</hi> which before he had, so making him a <hi>rational subsistence,</hi> who is expresly reckoned amongst the Beasts of the Field.</p>
                  <p>The Root of all Evil also they would have to lye in the <hi>matter whereof we were originally made</hi>; an impossible figment, invented to reflect the guilt of all sin on Him that made us. Thus every thing seems <hi>right</hi> to men that will serve the present turns, whilest they shut their Eyes against the Truth. But we have the consent of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientest, Best, and Wisest of them in this matter; as also unto the <hi>Deliverance</hi> here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. The two <hi>Targums,</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzielides</hi> and that called <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> both agree, that these words contain a Remedy of the Effects of Satans Temptation, and that to be wrought by the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or as they speak in his dayes. And hence they have a common saying, that in the <hi>last dayes,</hi> (which is the Old Testament <hi>Periphrasis</hi> of the Dayes of the <hi>Messiah</hi>) <hi>all things shall be healed but the Serpent and the Gibeonites</hi>; by whom they understand all <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and Unbelievers. <hi>Satan</hi> therefore is to be conquered by the <hi>bruising of his Head</hi>; and conquered he is not, nor can be, unless his <hi>work</hi> be destroyed. In the destruction of his work, consists the Delivery of mankind from the twofold evil mentioned. And this is to be effected by the <hi>seed of the Woman,</hi> to be brought forth into the world unto that end and purpose. For when the Production of this <hi>Seed</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained unto the Family and Posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> it is said expresly, that in, or by it, all the Kindreds of the earth should be <hi>blessed,</hi> which they could not be, without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval and taking away of the <hi>Curse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may now therefore take the summ of this Discourse, and of the whole matter <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>26</label> that we have insisted on, about the <hi>Entrance</hi> of sin into the world, and the <hi>Remedy</hi> provided in the Grace and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God against it. It appears upon our Enquiry; <hi>First,</hi> That the Sin of our First Parents, was the Occasion and Cause of all that <hi>Evil</hi> which is in the world, of all that is felt or justly feared by mankind. For as those who knew not, or received not the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Truth in these things made unto us in the Scripture, could never assign any other <hi>cause</hi> of it, that might be satisfactory unto an ordinary <hi>rational Enquiry,</hi> so the Testimonies of the <hi>Scripture</hi> make it most evident, and especially that insisted on. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It hath been evinced, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>mankind</hi> could not recover, or deliver themselves from under the power of their own innate corruption and disorder, nor from the effects of the <hi>Curse</hi> and Wrath of God that came upon them. Neither is there any ground of Expectation of <hi>Relief</hi> from any other part of Gods Creation. But yet that God for the praise of the glory of his Grace, Mercy and Goodness, would effect it and bring it about. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this Relief and Deliverance is first intimated and declared, in those words of God unto the Serpent; <hi>I will put Enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</hi> Which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Because in and with the Serpent, <hi>Satan</hi> who was the Head of all Apostasie from God, and by whom our first <hi>Parents were beguiled,</hi> is intended in these words. This we have made evident from the Confession of the <hi>Jews</hi> with whom in this matter principally we have to do. And to what hath been already observed unto that purpose, we may add the Testimonies of some other of them to the same Purpose, <hi>Rabbi Bechai,</hi> he whom they call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Bechai the Elder,</hi> in his <hi>Comment on the Law</hi> unto these words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 15. speaks to this purpose. <hi>We have no more enmity with the Serpent than with other creeping things. Wherefore the Scripture Mystically signifies him who was hid in the Serpent. For the body of the crafty Serpent was a fit instrument for that force, or vertue, that joyned its self therewithall. That was it which made</hi> Eve <hi>to sin, whence death came on all her Posterity. And this is the Enmity between the Serpent and the seed of the Woman. And this is the Mysterie of the Holy Tongue, that the Serpent is sometimes called</hi> Saraph, <hi>according to the name of an Angel, who is also called</hi> Saraph. <hi>And now thou knowest that the Serpent is Satan, and the evil Figment, and the Angel of Death.</hi> And <hi>Rabbi Judah</hi>; in <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Many Interpreters say, that the Evil Figment hath all its force from the Old Serpent; or Satan.</hi> To the same purpose, the Author of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Caphtor Vapaerach; The Devil and the Serpent are called by one name.</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:50110:52"/>
And many other Testimonies of the like importance might be collected out of them.</p>
                  <p>We have also asurer word for our own satisfaction, in the Application of this place unto <hi>Satan</hi> in the Divine Writings of the <hi>New Testament</hi>: as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13, 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.9. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. but we forbear to press them on the Jews.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it is most evident from the thing it self. For (1.) Who can be so sottish as to imagine, that this great Alteration which ensued on the works of God, that which caused him to pronounce them accursed, and to inflict so sore a Punishment on <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Posterity, should arise from the Actings of a <hi>Brute Creature.</hi> Where is the glory of this dispensation? How can we attribute it unto the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God? What is there in it suitable unto his Righteousness and Holiness? Whereas supposing this to be the work of him who was in himself the beginning of all <hi>Apostasie,</hi> and who first brake the Law of his Creation, all things answer the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Divine Perfections. Moreover is it imaginable that the <hi>nature</hi> of man then flourishing in the vigour of all its intellectual Abilities, Reason, Wisdom, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; in that Order and Rectitude of them which was his <hi>Grace,</hi> should be surprized, seduced and brought into subjection, unto the Craft and Machinations of an inferiour Creature, a Beast of the Field, and that unto its own Ruine Temporal and Eternal? The <hi>whole nature</hi> of the inferiour creatures, <hi>James tells us, is tamed by the nature of Man, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 7. and that now in his lessened and depraved condition; and shall we think that this Excellent Nature, in the blossom of its strength, and right unto Rule over all, should be <hi>tamed,</hi> corrupted, subdued, by the nature of a Beast or a <hi>Serpent.</hi> And yet again, whereas in the whole <hi>action of the Serpent,</hi> there is an open design against the glory and honour of God, with the welfare and happiness of mankind, and that managed with Craft, Subtilty, and Forecast, how can we imagine that such a contrivance should befall a <hi>brute Worm,</hi> uncapable of Moral Evil, and newly framed out of the <hi>dust</hi> by the power of its Creator? Hitherto it had continued under the Law and Order of its Creation; and shall we now think that suddenly on an instant, it should <hi>engage thus desperately</hi> against God and man? And further the actings of the <hi>Serpent</hi> were by Reason and with Speech. And doth not a supposal that he was endowed with them plainly exempt him from that <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>kind of Creatures</hi> whereof he was, and place him among the number of the <hi>intellectual and rationall</hi> parts of the Creation? And is not this contrary to the <hi>Analogie</hi> of the Scripture, and the open truth of the thing its self, he being cursed among the <hi>Beasts of the Field</hi>? To say, as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> seems to do, that God gave him <hi>Reason and Speech</hi> for that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, is blasphemously to make God the sole-Author of that <hi>Temptation</hi> which he so much abhorred. Lastly, Considering the Punishment denounced against mankind, of Death Temporall and Eternall, that which is threatned unto the <hi>Serpent</hi> bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion unto it, if it concern only the Serpent its self. And what Rule of Justice will admit, that the Accessory should be punished with greater Sufferings than the Principal? Neither doth this Punishment as to the Principal part of it, the <hi>bruising of the Head,</hi> befall all Serpents, yea, but <hi>few</hi> of them in comparison, doubtless not <hi>one</hi> of a <hi>Million,</hi> whereas <hi>all mankind</hi> none excepted were liable unto the Penalty denounced against them. Were no more men intended herein than are <hi>bitten on the heel</hi> by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, the matter were otherwise; but <hi>death</hi> is passed upon <hi>all,</hi> in as much as <hi>all</hi> have sinned. <hi>Satan</hi> then it was, who was the <hi>Principal</hi> in this Seduction, the Author of all <hi>Apostasie</hi> from God, who using the <hi>Serpent its instrument,</hi> involved that also so far in the <hi>Curse,</hi> as to render it of all Creatures the most abhorred of mankind.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>27</label> Against this <hi>Seducer</hi> it is denounced, that his <hi>Head should be bruised.</hi> The Head of Satan, is his Craft and Power.

of the <hi>Enmity mentioned,</hi> so in the <hi>latter</hi> some <hi>single person,</hi> some <hi>one</hi> of her Posterity or seed, that should obtain the Victory, is expresly denoted. For as all her seed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, do never go about this work, the greatest part of them continuing in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Subjection unto <hi>Satan</hi>; so if all of them should combine to <hi>attempt</hi> it, they would never be able to accomplish it, as we have before proved at large. Some <hi>one</hi> therefore to come of <hi>Her,</hi> with whom God would be present in an especiall and extraordinary manner, is here expresly promised. And this is the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God having in infinite Wisdom and Grace, provided this way of <hi>Relief,</hi> and given <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>28</label> this intimation of it, That <hi>Revelation</hi> became the Foundation and Center of all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> that ensued in the world.

                  <p>Some suppose that our great Mother <hi>Eve</hi> in those words, <hi>Genes.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

Some he destroyed with the sword, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.15. and was not in any thing signally a <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> unto any of them. So his Posterity extirpated sundry <hi>Nations</hi> from the face of the Earth, were a scourge unto others, and occasioned the <hi>Ruine</hi> of many more. He must needs then be made a Blessing unto the world on some other Account. And this can be nothing, but that he was <hi>separated</hi> to be the peculiar channel, by which the promised blessing Seed, should be brought forth into the world.</p>
                  <p>

                     </gap>, in <hi>Hithpael,</hi> so blessed in the Seed when exhibited, as that they shall come for the blessing by faith, and so in him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, bless themselves. And this is spoken of all Nations, all Families, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of <hi>Adam</hi> in general. They were all cursed in <hi>Adam</hi> as hath been declared; and God here promiseth, that they shall be blessed in the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>; and by him, the <hi>seed of the Woman.</hi> And this blessing must enwrap in it all the good things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the Curse they were deprived, or it will be of no use or benefit unto them; a <hi>Blessing</hi> indeed, it will not be. For a while he intended to <hi>leave</hi> mankind to <hi>walk in their own wayes</hi>; partly, that he might shew his Severity against sin; partly, that he might evidence the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and undeserved Freedom of that Grace wherein he had provided a Deliverer; and partly, that they might try and experiment their own Wisdom and Strength in searching after a way of Deliverance. But in this Promise was the <hi>Ore</hi> laid up, which after many Generations was brought forth and stamped with the Image of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Curse unto <hi>Satan</hi> is here again renewed, <hi>I will bless them that bless thee, and I will Curse HIM that curseth thee.</hi> The Blessing is to <hi>many</hi>; but the Curse respecteth <hi>one</hi> principally, that is <hi>Satan,</hi> as the Scripture generally expresseth the opposite <hi>Apostate</hi> Power under that name. Neither is there any just cause of the variation of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, unless we look on the words as a pursuit of the first Promise, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an especial Malediction on <hi>Satan,</hi> and who acts his enmity in all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie, and cursing against the blessed Seed, and those that are blessed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And this change of the number in these words is observed by <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>; <gap reason="foreign">

That this could not be <hi>Joshua,</hi> nor any of the Prophets that ensued, is evident from that Testimony of the Holy Ghost, Deut. 34. v. 10. <hi>There arose not since a Prophet in</hi> Israel <hi>like unto Moses.</hi> This must therefore be referred unto some <hi>singular Prophet</hi> who was then to come, or there is an express contradiction in the Text. And this is none other but the <hi>Messiah,</hi> concerning whom they acknowledge that he shall be a Prophet above <hi>Moses.</hi> Secondly, the extermination threatned unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, upon their disobedience unto this <hi>Prophet,</hi> here promised, <hi>v.</hi> 19. never befell them, untill they had rejected the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> the true and only <hi>Messiah.</hi> Wherefore this place is rightly applyed unto him in the <hi>New Testament, Acts</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.37.

Priesthood, and the work of Redemption, wrought by him. But whereas sundry things in this <hi>Psalm,</hi> are interpreted and applied unto the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> by <hi>our Apostle</hi> in his Epistle unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where they fall directly under our consideration, I shall here only briefly reflect on some of their own <hi>confessions,</hi> although it be a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal declaration of the faith of the Church of old, scarcely to be <hi>parallel'd</hi> in any other place. The <hi>later Masters</hi> indeed observing how directly and openly this <hi>Psalm</hi> is applied unto the Lord Christ in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and how plainly all the Passages of it are accommodated unto the Faith of <hi>Christians</hi> concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> his Office and Work, do endeavour their utmost to wrest it unto any other, as shall elsewhere be manifested. Yea, the <hi>Targum</hi> its self is here silent of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> for the very same Reason, and perverts the whole <hi>Psalm</hi> to apply it unto <hi>David</hi>; and yet is forced on <hi>v.</hi> 4. to refer the things spoken of unto the <hi>World to come,</hi> or Dayes of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And the most of their <hi>Masters</hi> when they mention this <hi>Psalm</hi> occasionally, and mind not the Controversie they have about it with <hi>Christians,</hi> do apply it unto him. So doth the <hi>Midrash Tehillim</hi> on <hi>Psalm</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7. and also on this <hi>Psalm, v.</hi> 1. though there be an endeavour therein foolishly to wrest it unto <hi>Abraham. Ra.

Obediah,</hi> on the place; All whose words it would be tedious here to report. It is sufficiently manifest that they have an open conviction, that this <hi>Psalm</hi> contains a Prophecy concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi>; and what excellent things are revealed therein touching his Person, and Offices, we shall have occasion to declare in the Exposition of the <hi>Epistle</hi> its self, wherein the most material passages of it, are applied unto our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The same Prophesie is given out by <hi>Micah,</hi> in the same words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. And by the common consent of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> is here intended, although he be not mentioned in the <hi>Targum.</hi> The <hi>Talmudical Fable</hi> also of the lifting up of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> three Leagues high, and the setting of Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> on the top of <hi>Sinai, Carmel,</hi> and <hi>Tabor</hi> which shall be brought together unto that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, mentioned in <hi>Midrash Tehellim,</hi> and in <hi>Baba Bathra; distinc.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Abarbinel</hi> seems to have been aware of this entanglement, and therefore as he wrests the Prophesie, (by his own confession contrary to the sense of all other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors) unto the times of the building of the <hi>Second Temple</hi>; so because he could not avoid the conviction of <hi>one</hi> that should judge among the Nations, he makes it to be the <hi>House it self,</hi> wherein as he sayes, <hi>Thrones for Judgement were to be erected</hi>; the vanity of which figment secures it from any further confutation. We have then evidently in these words <hi>three Articles</hi> of the Faith of the Antient Church concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi>; as <hi>First,</hi> That as to his <hi>Person,</hi> he should be God and man; the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who should in a <hi>bodily presence</hi> judge the People, and send forth the Law among the Nations, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should be called unto faith in him, and the Obedience of his Law, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the <hi>Worship</hi> of the Lord in the dayes of the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be far more glorious than at any time whilest the first Temple was standing, for so it is foretold, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and so our <hi>Apostle</hi> proves it to be, in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And this whole Prophesie is not a little perverted by them, who apply it to the defeat of <hi>Resin</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> when they came against <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and who in their <hi>Annotations</hi> on the Scripture, whereby they have won to themselves a great Reputation in the world, seldom depart from the sense of the <hi>Jews,</hi> unless it be where they are in the Right.</p>

not what to say, nor believe; But let us see how they acquit themselves at last in this matter.</p>
                  <p>Four things are here promised concerning this <hi>Child,</hi> or Son that should be <hi>given</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>33</label> unto the Church. (1.) That the <hi>Government</hi> should be on his shoulder. (2.) That his <hi>name</hi> should be call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the Everlasting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Prince of Peace. (3.) That of the <hi>increase</hi> of his Government there should be no end. (4.) That he should <hi>sit on the Throne of David</hi> to order it for ever. And we may see how well they accommodate these things unto <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> their endeavours being evidently against the <hi>Faith</hi> of the antient Church, the <hi>Traditions</hi> of their Fathers, and it may be doubted their own light and conviction.</p>
                  <p>First, The Government shall be on his shoulder, saith <hi>Sol. Jarchi; Because the Rule and yoke of God shall be upon him in the study of the Law</hi>; This pleaseth not <hi>Kimchi</hi> (as it is indeed ridiculous) and therefore he observeth that mention is not made of the <hi>Shoulder,</hi> but with reference unto <hi>Burden</hi> and weight; whence he gives this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the words. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>Because</hi> Ahaz <hi>served the King of</hi> Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, <hi>and his burden was on his shoulder, he sayes of this Child, he shall not be a servant with his shoulder, but the Government shall be on him.</hi> And this it seems is all that is here promised; and this is all the concernment of the Church in this Promise; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> shall not serve the King of <hi>Assyria.</hi> Neither is it true, that <hi>Ahaz</hi> served the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> under tribute; and it may seem rather that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did so for a season, seeing it is expresly said, that he <hi>rebelled against him, and served him no more:</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 7. Yea, plainly he did so, and paid him by way of tribute, <hi>three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Talents of Silver, and thirty talents of Gold,</hi> 2 Kings 18. v. 14. So He. <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> passeth over this expression without taking notice of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to the <hi>name</hi> ascribed unto him, they are for the most part agreed, and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>34</label> unless that <hi>one evasion</hi> which they have fixed on, will relieve them, they are utterly silent; Now this is, as was before declared, that the words are to be read, <hi>The Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, Counsellor, the mighty God, the Everlasting Father, shall call his Name the Prince of Peace</hi>; so that the <hi>Prince of Peace</hi> only is the name of the promised Child, all the rest are the Name of God. But (1.) If words may be so <hi>transposed,</hi> and shufled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they are to produce this sense, there will nothing be left certain in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; nor can they give any one instance of such a <hi>disposal</hi> of words, as they fancy in this place. (2.) The very reading of the words rejects this <hi>Gloss, He shall call his Name Wonderfull</hi>; (3.) It is the name of the Child, and not of God that gives him, which is expressed for the comfort of the Church: (4.) What tolerable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be given for such an <hi>accumulation</hi> of Names unto God in this place? (5.) There is nothing in the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Besides, on what account should <hi>Hezekiah</hi> so eminently be called <hi>The Prince of Peace?</hi>

It is true, a <hi>Trinity</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Deity cannot be proved from this place, seeing <hi>one</hi> of them is expresly called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and the other two in distinction from him are said to be Angels; so, and no more; <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.1.

an invention to evade the Appearances of the Son of God under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contrary to the sense of all <hi>Antiquity</hi>; nor is any reason or instance produced to make it good. The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed say, that they were <hi>three Angels,</hi> because of the <hi>threefold work</hi> they were employed in, for they say, <hi>no more than one Angel is at any time sent about the same work.</hi> So <hi>one</hi> of these was to renew the Promise unto <hi>Abraham; another</hi> to deliver <hi>Lot</hi>; and the <hi>third</hi> to destroy <hi>Sodom.</hi> But besides that this is a <hi>rule</hi> of their own making, and evidently false, as may be seen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 17. so in the story its self, it is manifest that they were all employed in the same work; <hi>one</hi> as <hi>Lord</hi> and Prince, the other two as his ministring servants.</p>

For in the first place, <hi>Jacob</hi> prayes solemnly unto him for his blessing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.26. and refuseth to let him go, or to cease his supplications untill he had blessed him. 2. He doth so, he blesseth him, and giveth him a double pledge or token of it in the <hi>touch of his thigh,</hi> and <hi>change of his name</hi>; giving him a name to denote his prevalency with God, that is with himself. 3.

Besides that he <hi>invocates this Angel</hi> for his Presence with, and blessing on the children of <hi>Joseph,</hi> which cannot regard any but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self without gross Idolatry, it is evident that the <hi>Angel who redeemed him,</hi> v. 16. is the same with the <hi>God who fed him,</hi> that is the God of his Fathers.</p>
                  <p>And this is yet more evident in the Prophet. For with regard unto this story of his power over the Angel, he sayes, <hi>he had power with God</hi>; and proves it, because he had <hi>power over the Angel and prevailed.</hi> And he shews whereby he thus prevailed, it was by <hi>weeping and making supplications unto him,</hi> which he neither did, nor lawfully might do unto a created Angel; and therefore some of the <hi>Jews</hi> apply those words, <hi>he wept and made supplications</hi> unto the Angels desire to <hi>Jacob</hi> to let him go; foolishly enough; and yet are they therein followed by some late <hi>Criticks,</hi> who too often please themselves in their curiosities. Again this Angel was he whom he found, or <hi>who found him in</hi> Bethel, an account whereof we have <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21, 22. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 35. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Now this was no other but he unto whom <hi>Jacob made his Vow,</hi> and entered into solemn Covenant withal that he should be his God. And therefore the Prophet adds expresly in the last place, <hi>v.</hi> 5. that it was <hi>the Lord God of Hosts,</hi> whom he intended.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>13</label> From what hath been spoken, it is evident, that he who appeared unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> with whom he earnestly wrestled by Tears and Supplications was <hi>God,</hi> and because he was sent as the <hi>Angel</hi> of God, it must be some distinct Person in the <hi>Deity,</hi> condescending unto that Office; and appearing in the form of a <hi>man,</hi> he represented his future As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of our humane nature.

For he not only grants, but contends and proves that the Angel spoken of, was <hi>God,</hi> and being sent of God as his Angel, he must be a <hi>distinct Person</hi> in the Deity, as we have proved. The Reason indeed he fixeth on why he is called an Angel, namely, because he governeth the world, although the thing its self be true, is not so proper. For he is so called because of his eternal designati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and actual delegation by the Father, unto the work of saving the Church in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions from first to last. And as he acknowledgeth that his being called the <hi>Face of God,</hi> proves him to be God, so it doth no less evidently evince his Personal distinction from him whose <hi>Face</hi> he is; that is, <hi>the Brightness of his Glory, and the express image of his Person.</hi> And what he adds of the Mercy and Benignity which by the appointment of God he exerciseth towards his People, is signally suitable unto the tenderness and mercy which the great Captain of our Salvation exerciseth by Gods appointment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all those whom he leads and conducts unto Glory.</p>

time of his coming drew nigh, this <hi>expectation</hi> was encreased and heightned, so that they continually looked out after him, as if he were to enter amongst them every moment.

To look for <hi>eternal life,</hi> and yet to confine the Promise of the <hi>Seed</hi> to the things of this life only, there was neither ground nor Reason. So that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> laid down the Principle, which the <hi>Sadducees</hi> naturally drew their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from. Some in the mean time among them, Gods secret ones, as <hi>Simeon, Anna, Joseph, Zechary and Elizabeth,</hi> but especially the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> with many more, retained no doubt the antient Faith of their Fore-fathers. But the Body of the People with their Leaders, being either <hi>flagitiously</hi> wicked, or <hi>superstitiously</hi> proud fancied a <hi>Messiah</hi> suited unto their own lusts and desires, such an <hi>one</hi> as we shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards describe. And this <hi>prejudicate opinion</hi> of a terrene outward glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in and of this world, was that which working in them a neglect of those spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and <hi>eternal</hi> purposes for which he was promised, hardened them to an utter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the <hi>True Messiah</hi> when he came unto them.</p>
                  <p>That this was the Ground on which they rejected the <hi>Promised Messiah,</hi> is evident <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> from the Story of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and we shall farther prove it upon them in our ensuing Discourses. How they did that, and what was the End thereof, is well known. But after they had done this, and <hi>murdered the Prince of Life,</hi> to justifie themselves in their wickedness and unbelief, they still with all earnestness looked after <hi>such a Messiah</hi> as they had framed in their own imagination. And herein they grew more earnest and <hi>furious</hi> than ever. For they had not only their own false pre-conceived Opinion, strengthened by their carnal Interests and desires of earthly things to act and <hi>provoke</hi> them, but also their <hi>Reputation</hi> and pretence unto the Love and favour of God, to heighten them in their Presumptions; because they could not retain the least sense of them, if it might be supposed, that they had <hi>rejected the true Messiah,</hi> because in his way and work he answered not their Expectation. For this is the course of <hi>Pride</hi> and carnal Wisdom, to pursue those miscarriages with violence wherein they have been wickedly engaged; and to lay hold on any <hi>pretence</hi> that they may seem to justifie them in what they have done. And on this account they exposed themselves as a <hi>prey</hi> unto every <hi>Seducer,</hi> who made the least appearance of being <hi>such a Messiah</hi> as they thought meet for them to receive. This at last cast them on a <hi>second shipwrack,</hi> in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Barchocheba</hi> who pretending himself to be their <hi>Messiah</hi> sent to deliver them from the <hi>Roman Yoke,</hi> and to set up a Kingdom amongst them, drew them all the world over, into that Sedition, Outrage and War, which ended in an almost universal extirpation of the whole Nation from the face of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Now because in the business of this <hi>Barchosba</hi> they met with a sore <hi>disappointment</hi>

Two things were eminent in <hi>Babylon</hi>; First, that it was its self the beginning of all false Worship and Idolatry in the World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Mother of Harlots</hi>; the other, that God made use of it to punish the Idolatries of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Hence they say that <hi>Rome</hi> this <hi>New Babylon</hi> had its foundation when <hi>Solomon</hi> married <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter; and that it began to be built when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> set up his Calves: which they look upon as the two first fatal instances of the declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Israel</hi> into false Worship and Idolatry. And hereby they intimate, partly that <hi>Rome</hi> should set up Idolatry, as <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did, and partly that God had then provided a <hi>New Babylon</hi> to punish and destroy them. The <hi>Abba Kolon</hi> is a <hi>Monster,</hi> whom no man hath as yet set upon. But it is no other but <hi>Capitolium,</hi> as they will easily grant, who know how usual it is with them strangely to <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phise</hi> things and words; instances whereof I shall elsewhere give. Thence is the <hi>Proverb</hi> they speak of; no <hi>Abba Kolon,</hi> no <hi>Capitol,</hi> or Temple of Idolatry, no City; the <hi>Capitol</hi> answering the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> which was a Temple of <hi>Belus.</hi> Neither is that Proverb any thing but an allusion to that in the <hi>Roman History; Capitolium est ubi quondam Capite humano invento, responsum est eo loco caput rerum, summamque im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii sore: Tit. Liv. lib.</hi> 5. And the tempering of the clay of <hi>Rome</hi> with the water of <hi>Euphrates</hi> by the help of <hi>Abba Kolon,</hi> is nothing but an expression of the succession of <hi>Rome</hi> into the stead of <hi>Babylon</hi> whic was built on that <hi>River,</hi> by the means of the <hi>Capitol</hi> that great Seat of Idolatry. Nor do they at all distinguish between the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> Idolatry of <hi>Rome</hi> and that of <hi>old.</hi> So that although all things are confounded by them with <hi>monstrous</hi> Fictions and Expressions, which it may be they invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on purpose to obscure their intention, yet their aim in the whole is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</p>

His <hi>Office,</hi> when he comes, is to be a <hi>King,</hi> which he shall be annointed unto by them, when they are gathered together. And the work he is to do, is in <hi>War,</hi> to fight with <hi>Armillus, Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> to conquer the <hi>Edomites</hi> and <hi>Ishmaelites,</hi> that is the <hi>Romish Christians,</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Saracens,</hi> and in so doing to erect a glorious Kingdom at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> in <hi>Peace,</hi> he is to Rule righteously, not only over <hi>Israel,</hi> but also all the Nations of the world if they have any difference amongst them, shall refer all unto his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and <hi>Vmpirage.</hi> In <hi>Religion,</hi> he shall build the <hi>Third Temple</hi> mentioned by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> restore the Sacrifices, and cause the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to be most strictly observed. But that which is the head of all, he shall free the <hi>Jews</hi> from their Captivity, restore them to their own Land, make <hi>Princes</hi> and Lords of them all, giving them the wealth of all Nations, either conquered by him, or brought voluntarily unto him; feast them on <hi>Behemoth, Zis,</hi> and the Wine of Paradise, so that they shall see want and poverty no more.</p>
                  <p>This is the substance of their perswasion, concerning his <hi>Coming,</hi> Person, Office and Work. <hi>When</hi> he shall come, whether he shall <hi>live alwayes,</hi> or dye at an hundred years old, whether he shall have <hi>Children,</hi> and if he have, whether they shall <hi>succeed</hi> him in his Throne, whether all the <hi>Jews</hi> that are dead shall rise at his coming, and their <hi>Galgal,</hi> or <hi>rolling</hi> in the earth from all parts of the world into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> shall then happen or no, whether the <hi>general Resurrection</hi> shall not succeed immediately upon his Reign, or at least within <hi>forty years after,</hi> or how long it will be to the end of the world, they are not at all agreed. But this, as hath been declared, is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of their perswasion and expectation; that he shall be a <hi>meer man,</hi> and that the Deliverance which he shall effect, shall be by <hi>mighty Wars,</hi> wherein the <hi>Jews</hi> shall be alwayes victorious, and that in the Dominion and Rule which they shall have over all Nations, the <hi>Third Temple</hi> shall be built, the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> be observed by him and them, and the <hi>Noachichal Precepts</hi> be imposed on all others. As for any <hi>Spiritual Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> from sin and the curse of the Law, of Justification and Righteousness by him, or the procurement of <hi>Grace and Glory,</hi> they utterly reject all thoughts about them.</p>
                  <p>With these Opinions, many of them have mixed <hi>prodigious fancies,</hi> rendering their <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>19</label> estate under their <hi>Messiah</hi> in this world, not much inferiour unto that which <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> hath promised unto his followers in another. And some of them on the other hand endeavour to <hi>pare</hi> off what superfluities they can spare, and to render their folly as plausible as they are able. Wherefore that it may appear what is the <hi>utmost height</hi> of their conceptions in this matter, and that which the most contemplative persons amongst them fix upon, I shall subjoyn a description of <hi>him</hi> and his Kingdom, in the words of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> one of the wisest and soberest persons that hath been amongst them since their last fatal dispersion. This man therefore in his Exposition of the <hi>tenth Chapter of Tractat. Saned.</hi> observing the fond and frivolous imaginations of their
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50110:75"/>
                     <hi>Talmudical</hi> Masters about the Messiah, gives many rules and instructions about the right understanding of their sayings, to free them from open impieties and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. And hereunto he subjoyns, as he supposeth the true Notion of the <hi>Messiah</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the ensuing words. <hi>As to the dayes of the Messiah, they are the time when the Kingdom shall be restored unto</hi> Israel, <hi>and they shall return unto</hi> Palestine. <hi>And this King shall be Potent, the Metropolis of whose Kingdom shall be</hi> Sion; <hi>and his Name shall be famous unto the uttermost parts of the Earth. He shall be greater and richer then</hi> Solomon, <hi>and with him the Nations shall make peace and yield him obedience, because of his Justice, and the Miracles that he shall perform. If any one shall rise against him God shall give him up into his hand to be destroyed. All the Scripture declares his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the Happiness we shall have by him. Howbeit nothing in the nature of things shall be changed, only</hi> Israel <hi>shall have the Kingdom; for so our Wise men say expresly, there is no difference between these dayes, and the dayes of the Messiah, but only the subduing of the Nations under us.</hi> So indeed sayes <hi>Rab. Samuel,</hi> and others of them; <gap reason="foreign">

But the dayes of the Messiah are not so much to be desired, that we may have store of Corn and Wealth, ride on Horses, and drink Wine with Musick, but for the society and conversation of good men, the Knowledge and Righteousness of the King, and that then without wearisomness, trouble, or constraint, the whole Law of</hi> Moses <hi>shall be observed.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>22</label> In things therefore of this kind, <hi>Ignorance</hi> of their miserable condition by nature, both as to sin and wrath, justly claims the first place. For although, as was by instances before manifested, the Evidence of <hi>Truth,</hi> and Power of <hi>Traditions</hi> amongst them, have prevailed with some, to avow the notion of the <hi>Sin of Adam</hi> and the corruption of our nature thereby, yet indeed there is not any of them, that have a true sense and conviction of their <hi>Natural Condition,</hi> and the misery that doth attend it. The <hi>Messiah,</hi> as we have proved at large, was first promised to relieve mankind from that state whereinto they were cast by the <hi>Apostasie of Adam</hi> the Common Root and Parent of them all. Such as are mens apprehensions of that <hi>condition,</hi> such also will be their thoughts concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> who was promised to be a Deliverer from it. They who know themselves cast out of the favour of God thereby, made <hi>obnoxious</hi> unto his eternal displeasure, and disenabled to do any thing that shall please him, as being cast into a state of <hi>universal Enmity</hi> against him, must needs look on the <hi>Messiah</hi> promised in the Grace, Goodness and Wisdom of God for a Saviour and Deliverer, to be <hi>One</hi> that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50110:75"/>
must by suitable wayes and means free them from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wrath,</hi> procure for them the favour of God, enable them to serve him again unto Acceptation, and so bring them at length unto their <hi>chief End,</hi> the everlasting enjoyment of him. As these things answer one another, and are on both sides fully revealed in the Scripture, so the <hi>Church</hi> of old who had a due Apprehension of their own condition, looked for such a <hi>Messiah</hi> as God had promised. <hi>Ignorance</hi> therefore of this condition, is no small cause of the present <hi>Judaical</hi> misbelief. What ever may be the estate of other men, about which they do not much trouble themselves, for <hi>their parts</hi> they are <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> exempted from the common condition of mankind by the Priviledge of their Nativity; or at least they are relieved by their <hi>circumcision,</hi> by the pain whereof, they make sufficient satisfaction for any ill they bring with them into this world. That they are <hi>dead in Trespasses and Sins,</hi> standing in need to be <hi>born again</hi>; that they are by <hi>nature children of wrath,</hi> obnoxious unto the curse of God; that the sin of our first Parents is imputed unto them, or that if it be, that it was of any such demerit as <hi>Christians</hi> teach, they believe not. Upon the matter they know no misery but what consists in <hi>Poverty,</hi> Captivity and want of Rule and Dominion. And what should a <hi>spiritual Redeemer</hi> do unto these men? What <hi>beauty</hi> or comeliness can he have in him, for which of them he should be desired? What Reason can they see, why they should understand the <hi>Promises</hi> concerning him in such a way and sense, as that they should not be concerned in them? And this blindness had in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure possessed their minds at the first promulgation of the Gospel. See <hi>John</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 33, 34. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 40, 41. And therefore our <hi>Apostle</hi> in his <hi>Epistle</hi> unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> wherein he deals both with <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> before he declares the Propitiation that was made, with the Justification that was to be obtained by the blood of Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth them all of their miserable lost condition, on the account of sin, <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Actual, Chap.</hi> 1, 2, 3. Untill therefore this Pride, self-fulness, and <hi>Ignorance</hi> of themselves be taken from them, and rooted out of their hearts, all Promises of a <hi>spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> must needs be unsavoury unto them. They stand in no need of him, and why should they desire him. An <hi>Earthly King</hi> that would give them Liberty, Wealth, Ease and Dominion, they would gladly embrace, and have long in vain looked for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the Righteousness of God, both as to what he requireth <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>23</label> that a man may be <hi>justified</hi> before him, and of his <hi>Judgement</hi> concerning the desert of sin, hath the same effect upon them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. The great End for which the <hi>Messiah</hi> was promised, as we have in part declared, and shall afterwards farther evince, was to make <hi>Attonement for sin,</hi> and to bring in <hi>Everlasting Righteousness, Dan.</hi> 9.24. A Righteousness was to be brought in, that might answer the <hi>Justice</hi> of God, and abide its trial. Of what nature this Righteousness must be, the Scripture declares; and that as well in the Revelation it makes of the <hi>Holiness of God, Psal.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>Joshua</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 13. as of the purity and severity of his Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 26. and the absolute Perfection of his <hi>Justice</hi> in the Execution of it, <hi>Psalm</hi> 50. <hi>v.</hi> 21. An Universal spotless <hi>innocency,</hi> with a constant unerring <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> in all things, and that in the highest degree of Perfection, are required to find Acceptation with this Holy and Righteous God. Of the Nature and necessity of this <hi>Righteousness</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> are ignorant and regardless; They and their Masters were so of old, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 20. An outside, partial, <hi>hypocritical</hi> Observance of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> they suppose will serve their Turns. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 31. And indeed there is not any thing that more openly discovers the miserable blindness of the present <hi>Jews,</hi> then the consideration of what they insist upon, as their <hi>Righteousness</hi> before God. The Faith and Obedience of their Fore-fathers, the Priviledge of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> some outward Observances of <hi>Mosaical</hi> Precepts, with anxious scrupulous abstinencies, self macerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in fasts, with prayers by <hi>tale and number, Sabbath</hi> rests from outward labour with the like bodily exercises, are the summ of what they plead for themselves.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50110:76"/>
prospered amongst them, Faith in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as to the true Ends for which He was promised, decayed every day more and more, untill at length it was utterly lost. For as our <hi>Apostle</hi> tells them, if <hi>Righteousness</hi> were by the Law, the Promise of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to no purpose; and if the Law made things <hi>Perfect,</hi> the bringing in of another Priesthood and Sacrifice was altogether needless.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>24</label> So is it also with them as to their Apprehension of the <hi>Judgement of God concerning the Desert of sin.</hi> The natural notion hereof the vilest <hi>Hypocrites</hi> amongst them were sometimes perplexed withall. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Micah</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 8. But the generality of them have long endeavoured by prejudicate Imaginations, to cast out the true and real sense of it. That God is angry at sin, that in some cases an <hi>Attonement</hi> is needfull they will not deny. But so low and carnal are their thoughts of his severity, that they think any thing may serve the turn to appease his Wrath, or to satisfie his Justice, especially towards them whom alone he loves. Their Afflictions and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, the Death of their Children, and their own Death, especially if it be of a <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful distemper,</hi> they suppose to make a sufficient Propitiation for all their sins. Such mean and unworthy thoughts have they of the Majesty, Holiness, and Terror of the Lord. Of late also, lest there should be a failure on any account, they have found out an invention to give their sins unto the Devil by the <hi>Sacrifice of a Cock,</hi> the manner whereof is at large described by <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> in his <hi>Synagoga Judaica.</hi> And this also hath no small influence on their minds to pervert them from the Faith of their Fore-Fathers. Let the Messiah provide well for them in this world, and they will look well enough unto themselves, as to that which is to come.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>25</label> And hence ariseth also their <hi>Ignorance of the whole Nature, Vse and End of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical Law,</hi> which also contributes much to the producing of the same Effect upon them. To what End the Law was given, whereunto it served, what was the nature and proper use of its Institutions shall be declared as occasion is offered in the Exposition of the Epistle its self. For the present it may suffice unto our purpose, to consider their Apprehensions of it, and what influence they have into their misbelief. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral they look on the <hi>Law</hi> and their observance of it, as the only means of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteousness, and making an Attonement with God. So they did of old, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 32, 33, 34. In the observation of its Precepts they place all their <hi>Righteousness</hi> before God, and by its Sacrifices they look for <hi>Attonement</hi> of all their sins. That the Law was not given, that the Sacrifices were not appointed for these Ends, that the Fathers of old never attended unto them <hi>absolutely</hi> with any such Intention, shall be afterwards declared. In the mean time it is evident that this Perswasion corrupts their minds as to their thoughts about the Messiah. For if Righteousness may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and Attonement made without him, to what End serves the Promise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him? But having thus taken from him the whole Office and Work whereunto of God he was designed, that he might not be thought altogether useless, they have cut out for him the work and employment before mentioned. For looking on Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Attonement with the consequent of them Eternal Salvation, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Effects of the <hi>Law,</hi> they thought meet to leave unto their <hi>Messiah</hi> the work of procuring unto them Liberty, Wealth, and Dominion, which they found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the <hi>Law</hi> was not able to do. But had indeed their Eyes been opened in the knowledge of God and themselves, they would have found the Law no less insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to procure by its self an Heavenly than an Earthly Kingdom for them. And against their Prejudicate obstinacy in this matter, doth the <hi>Apostle</hi> principally oppose himself in his <hi>Epistle</hi> unto them.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>26</label> But here by the way, some may possibly enquire, how the <hi>Jews,</hi> if they look for Attonement and the Remission of sins by the Sacrifices of the Law, can now expect to have their sins pardoned, without which they cannot be eternally saved, seeing they are confessedly destitute of all <hi>Legal</hi> Sacrifices whatever? Have they found out some other way, or do they utterly give over seeking after Salvation? This very <hi>Question</hi> being put unto one of them, he answers; that they now obtain the pardon of their Sins, <hi>by Repentance and Amendment of Life</hi>; according to the Promises made in the Prophets unto that Purpose; as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. v. 20. And concludes, <hi>Quamvis jam nulla sint sacrificia quae media erant ad tanto facilius impetrandam remissionem peccatorum, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem tamen per poenitentiam, ac resipiscentiam declinando a viis malis impetratur. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there are now no Sacrifices which were a means the more easily to obtain the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of sins, yet it may be obtained by Repentance, and a departure from wayes of evil.</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:50110:76"/>
This is their Hope which like that of the Hypocrite is as the giving up of the Ghost. For (1.) It is true, <hi>Repentance and Amendment of Life,</hi> are required in them who seek after the forgiveness of their sins, and many Promises are made unto them; But is this all that God required, that sin might be forgiven? They are sufficient indeed in their own way and place, but are they so <hi>absolutely also?</hi> Did not God moreover appoint and require, that they should make use of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to make at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for sins, without which they should not be done away? See <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. And (2.) What is the meaning of that Plea, that by Sacrifices indeed Remission of sins might more <hi>easily be obtained,</hi> but obtained it may be without them? Doth this <hi>more easily</hi> respect God or man? if they say it respects God; I desire to know, if he can pardon sin without Sacrifice, why he cannot do it as <hi>easily</hi> as with them? or what is he <hi>eased</hi> of by Sacrifices? If it respect themselves, as indeed it doth, then it may be enquired what it is that they shall be eased of in the obtaining of the Pardon of sins, by the use of Sacrifices; when that is again restored unto them? this can be of nothing but of that which they are now forced to make use of, for that end and purpose, and what is that? Why <hi>Repentance and Amendment of Life.</hi> If then they had their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> these might be spared, or at least much in them abated which at present is necessary. This then it seems was the End why God instituted <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> namely that these <hi>Jews</hi> might obtain pardon of sin, without either Repentance or Amendment. And this is that which they love as their souls; namely that they may live in their sins, and be acquitted of all Danger by Sacrifices and outward services. (3.) Attonement for sin is expresly necessary, or all the Institutions of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> for that End of old were vain and ludicrous. At the same time when <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> were in use, Repentance was also required, and therefore not to be a cause or means for the same End, in the same kind with them. And therefore notwithstanding their Pretence of <hi>Repentance,</hi> no <hi>Jew</hi> upon his own Principles, can now in the total Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> obtain either Pardon of sin here, or Salvation hereafter. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>Their corrupt <hi>carnal Affections</hi> have moreover greatly contributed, and yet do so <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>27</label> unto their Obstinacy in their Unbelief. Hence have they coyned their self-pleasing imaginations about the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and the work that he hath to do, That He should be a King, and reign gloriously, that his Dominion should be over all the world, and endure throughout all Generations, was promised concerning him from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. They think much therefore what <hi>Advantage</hi> this Kingdom may afford unto them, comparing it in their minds with those other Empires which they see in the world. Wealth, Ease, Liberty, Dominion, or a share in Power and Rule are the things that please their <hi>carnal minds,</hi> and evidently fill them with Envy and Wrath against them by whom they are possessed. These things they look after and hope for; as the only things that are desirable, the only Pledges indeed of the favour of God. No Persons on the Earth have their thoughts more fixed on them then they. As their <hi>Oppressions</hi> increase, so do their Desires after Liberty and Rule; and they have learned nothing by their <hi>Poverty,</hi> but to grow in a greedy fierceness after Riches. And when they would at any time set out the care of God towards their Nation, they declare that <hi>such a one in such a place was worth so many thousand Crowns, or drove such a Trade, or was in such favour as that he rode in a Coach or Charriot</hi>; as may be seen in the Address of <hi>Manasseh</hi> unto the <hi>English.</hi> This Covetousness, and Ambition with Revengefull thoughts against their Oppressors possessing their minds, makes them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, hope and believe that the Kingdom of their <hi>Messiah</hi> shall be of this world, and that therein their Enjoyments shall be as large, as what ever now their Fancy can reach unto. And so perfectly are they under the Power of these lusts and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desires in this matter, that take away their Hopes of satisfying of them in the good things of this world, that they will on very easie terms bid adieu unto their <hi>Messiah,</hi> or grant that he is already come. But whilest they are obstinately fixed in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, to tell them of a <hi>Spiritual and Heavenly Kingdom,</hi> wherein the poorest and most persecuted Person on the Earth may have as good an Interest, and enjoy as much Benefit by it, as the greatest Monarch in the world, and you do but cast away your words into the wind.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Since the Propagation of the Gospel and its success in the world, <hi>Envy,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>28</label> another corrupt Lust, against the <hi>Gentile Believers,</hi> hath exceedingly perverted their
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50110:77"/>
minds, in their Notions about the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And this they are filled withall upon a twofold account.</p>
                  <p>First, Upon that of the <hi>Spiritual Priviledges</hi> which they saw claimed by them. That the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or Nations of the Earth distinct from <hi>Israel,</hi> should be Fellow-Heirs in the Promise with the Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> according unto the flesh, was declared by all the Prophets of old. But yet, as we have shewed, this was done by them in that obscure manner, in comparison of the Revelation made of it in the Gospel, that the Grace and Counsel of God therein is called a <hi>Mysterie hid from the Ages that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> Wherefore when this Design of the Love and Wisdom of God was brought to Light, it filled the <hi>Jews</hi> who had lost the faith of it with <hi>Envy</hi> and Wrath. See <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 45, 46, 47, 50. <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22, 23. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. The Stories of all Ages from thence unto this Day testifie the same, nor do they yet stick to express these <hi>corrupt Affections,</hi> as occasion is offered. And this <hi>Envy</hi> being greatly predominant in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m hardens them in their imagination of such a <hi>Messiah,</hi> as by whom the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may receive no Benefit, but what may accrue unto them by becoming their Servants. They cannot endure to hear unto this Day that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should be equal sharers with themselves in the Promise of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> They would have him unto themselves alone, or not at all. And this keeps up their Desires and Expectations of such an one as they have fancied for their own Ends and Purposes.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>29</label> Again, Their <hi>Envy</hi> against the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is greatly increased and excited by the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> from them which they undergoe. This adds hatred and desire of <hi>Revenge</hi> unto it, which render it impotent and unruly. I speak not now of their present and past sufferings from <hi>Christians,</hi> which in many places have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and inhumane, and so undoubtedly a great occasion of hardning them in their obstinacy, but of their <hi>long continued oppressions</hi> under the Power of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> in general. Having been greatly harrased and wasted by them in most Ages, and having a <hi>Deliverer</hi> promised unto them, they are strongly enclined to fancy such a Deliverance as being peculiarly th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Was this the Expectation of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of old? Is this that which they desired, prayed for, longed for, esteeming all the Glory of their present Enjoyments as nothing in comparison of it? What is in this <hi>Messiah</hi> that he should be the Hope and <hi>Desire of all Nations?</hi> Did God set him forth as the great Effect of his Love, Grace, Goodness and Faithfulness towards them, and then bring forth a <hi>Military King,</hi> in whose exploits they were not all to be concerned? Was the Church in <hi>travail</hi> for so many Generations to bring forth this Fighter? Had they no Eye of old unto Spiritual and Eternal things in the Promise of the <hi>Messiah</hi>?

                  <p>What all this while is become of the <hi>work</hi> every where in the Scripture assigned <label type="milestone">

Who shall be a Priest after the Order of <hi>Melchizedeck?</hi> Who shall have a <hi>Body prepared him</hi> to offer in stead of the Sacrifices of the Law?

Who shall make <hi>Attonement</hi> for Transgressors and bring in everlasting Righteousness? Who shall for ever make <hi>Intercession</hi> for Transgressors? And who shall sit at the <hi>Right Hand of God</hi> in his Rule over the whole world? All these things and sundry others of the like kind, are openly and frequently promised concerning the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> whereof not any of them is to be accomplished in or by him whom they look for. But these men indeed take a way to destroy all Religion, and to turn the <hi>whole Bible</hi> into a story of earthly things, without either Life, Spirit, or Heavenly My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery in it.</p>
                  <p>It is acknowledged that there are many Promises of Mercy and Glory unto the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>33</label> Church in the Dayes of the <hi>Messiah</hi> expressed in Words, whose first literal sense represents things outward and temporall. And there is a threefold Interpretation of them contended for. The first is that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who would have them all understood according unto their <hi>literall importance,</hi> without the allowance of any Figure or <hi>Allegory</hi> in them. But no thing can be more vain then this imagination; nor do they make use of it, but where they suppose that it will serve their present design. For whereas the <hi>Wisest</hi> of them do grant, that in the dayes of the Messiah the <hi>Nature of things</hi> shall not be changed, but only their use, many of these Promises in their first literall sense, import a full and direct alteration in the <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> and all things contained in them. So Isa. 11. v. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Lions, Bears, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards, Cockatrices, Aspes, Calves,</hi> and <hi>young Children</hi> are said all to live, feed, and play together. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 60. <hi>v.</hi> 7. That the <hi>Flocks of Kedar,</hi> and the <hi>Rams of Nebaioth</hi> should minister unto the Church; <hi>ver.</hi> 16. that they sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Kings</hi>; and <hi>ver.</hi> 19. that the <hi>Sun</hi> should no more give light by day; and yet <hi>ver.</hi> 20. that it should no more <hi>go down. Chap.</hi> 65. <hi>v.</hi> 17. That new Heavens, and a new Earth shall be created, and that the old shall be remembered no more; that <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Fields</hi> shall rejoyce and clap their hands for gladness; with other things innumerable in the same kind. Now if they grant, as they must, unless they intend to expose all Sacred Truth to the scorn and contempt of Atheists, that these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions are figurative and <hi>Allegorical,</hi> they must do the same in all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of earthly things, as of Peace, Plenty, Victory, long Life, Dominion, Wealth and the like, being set out in the same kind of <hi>Allegorial</hi> Expressions. At least they cannot make them in the <hi>strict literal sense</hi> of the words the object of their Faith and Expectation, unless they can by some infallible rule declare, what is <hi>figuratively</hi> to be understood in them, what <hi>properly,</hi> or which Promises are expressed <hi>Allegorically,</hi> which not. And this they can never do. The <hi>Event</hi> therefore is the only infallible Interpreter of the meaning of such Prophetical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; what ever precedes that, is but conjecture. Wherefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some interpret all these <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Prophesies Spiritually,</hi> without the least respect unto those outward terrene things, which are made use of in figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Expressions only to shaddow out those spiritual, heavenly, and eternal things which are intended in them. And indeed this way of Interpretation which <hi>Calvin</hi> follows in all his Commentaries, is attended with great probability of Truth. For the main Ends and work for which the <hi>Messiah</hi> was promised, being as we have proved Spiritual and eternall, and whereas it is evident, that many promises of things relating unto him, and the condition of them that believe in him are <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorically</hi> expressed (it being the constant way of the Old Testament to shaddow out spiritual and heavenly things, by things earthly and carnall,) this way of <hi>interpreting</hi> the Promises, seems to have great countenance given unto it, both from the nature of the things themselves, and the constant tenour of the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Style.</hi> According unto this Rule of Interpretation, all that is foretold in the <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> of the Deliverance, Rest, Peace, Glory, Rule and Dominion of the Church, of the subjection and subserviency of Nations, Kingdoms, Rulers, Kings and Queens thereunto, intends only either the <hi>Kingdom of Grace,</hi> consisting in Faith, Love, Holiness, Righteousness and Peace in the Holy Ghost, with that spirituall Beauty and Glory which is in the Worship of the Gospel; or the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> its self where lyes our Happiness and Reward. And indeed this Interpretation of the Promises, as in respect of many of them it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain, true, and <hi>proper,</hi> they being so expounded in the Gospel it self; so in respect of them all, it is safe, and satisfactory to the souls of Believers. For they who are really made partakers of the spiritual good things of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and are subjects of his spiritual Kingdom, do find and acknowledge, that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Rest, Peace and Glory, those durable Riches therein, as they are abundantly content withall, what ever their outward condition in this World may be. And unto this <hi>Exposition,</hi> as to the main and prime intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Promises, the whole Doctrine of the Gospell gives counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Some acknowledging the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah</hi> to be Heavenly and Spiritual, and the Promises generally to intend spiritual and heavenly Glory and Riches, that is, Grace and Peace in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> do yet suppose moreover that there is in many of them an intimation given of a <hi>blessed,</hi> quiet, peaceable, flourishing estate of the Church through the power of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> to be in this world. But this they do with these limitations. (1.) That these Promises were not made unto the <hi>Jews</hi> as they were the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according unto the flesh, primarily and absolutely, but unto the Church, that is the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according unto the Promise, Heirs of his Faith and Blessing. That is, they are made unto all them who receive and believe in the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> Jews and Gentiles, with whom as we have proved, the Priviledge of the Church, and interest in the Promises was to remain. (2.) That the Accomplishment of these Promises is reserved unto an <hi>appointed time</hi> when God shall have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished his work of severity on the <hi>Apostate Jews,</hi> and of Tryal and Patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the called Gentiles. (3.) That upon the coming of that season, the Lord
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50110:78"/>
will by one means or other, take off the <hi>Veyl</hi> from the eyes of the Remnant of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and turn them from ungodliness unto the Grace of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> being made one Fold under the great <hi>Shepheard</hi> of our souls, shall enjoy Rest and Peace in this world. This they think to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in many of the Promises of the Old Testament, which are brought over unto the use of the Church as yet unaccomplished, in the Book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And herein lyes all the Glory which the <hi>Jews</hi> can or may expect, and that only on such terms, as yet they will not admit of. But these things must all of them be spoken unto at large, when we come to answer the Objections which they take from them, unto our Faith in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

                  <p>And this was necessary upon a double account: (1.) That those who were to live before his <hi>Advent,</hi> or appearance in the flesh, might not only by faith, see his Person <hi>afar off,</hi>

Accordingly it came to pass, for from hence it was, that at that season when he was to be exhibited, <hi>all men were in expectation</hi> of him, and prepared thereby to enquire after him, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.15.</p>
                  <p>Now this determination of time enquired after, was first made by <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49.8,<label type="milestone">

And this I mention by the way, to prevent any difficulties about his <hi>Genealogie.</hi> For as in the very first instance of the Regal Succession in the house of <hi>David</hi> there was no respect had to the <hi>Primogeniture,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.22. So there was no necessity that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should spring from the <hi>reigning Family,</hi> although he did so; but only that he should be of the Seed of <hi>David.</hi> For as after the Promise given unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> might have sprung from any Family whatever of his posterity by <hi>Isaac,</hi> untill the limitation made by <hi>Jacob</hi> unto the person of <hi>Judah</hi>; and after that limitation, might have done so from any Family of his Tribe or Posterity, untill the confienment of that priviledge to the person of <hi>David</hi>; so no restriction or limitation being afterwards added, his production by <hi>any person</hi> of his Posterity, whether in a nearer or further alliance, to, or from the <hi>Reigning Line,</hi> was all that was included in the Promise. To return, the words of the place above quoted are, Judah <hi>thou art be whom thy Brethren shall praise; thine hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; Thy Fathers children shall bow down before thee.</hi> Judah <hi>is a Lyons whelp from the prey, my Son, thou art gone up, he stooped down, he couched as a Lion, and as an old Lion who shall rouse him up,</hi>

First, By <hi>Shebet,</hi> he grants <hi>Rule</hi> to be intended, or preheminence above others, being then somewhat more modest then their latter Masters. This saith he, shall not depart from <hi>Judah,</hi>

                     <hi>for he was the beginning of the Kingdom of</hi> Judah. So that it seems the meaning of the words is, that the <hi>Scepter shall not depart, untill the Scepter come</hi>; that is, they should have rule, untill they had rule, For as himself well observes, the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> began in <hi>David.</hi> But what <hi>Scepter</hi> had the House of <hi>Judah</hi> before? Four hundred years the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ruled under <hi>Judges,</hi> of which but <hi>one</hi> was of that Tribe.

So that we have here no small instance, how the <hi>Wisest</hi> of their Masters do befool themselves, in seeking evasions from this Testimony. Of the sense of the following words, abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting from the design of the whole, he gives a tolerable account, <hi>Nor a Law-giver from between his feet.</hi>

But this catching at relief from a word, no way suited to contribute the least assistance in the case in hand, is as strong an Argument of a desperate sinking cause, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than men will foregoe, they will reach after helps from the shaddow of the least twigg that seems to be nigh unto them. I shall not contend with him about what he nextly asserts, namely that this <hi>untill</hi>; doth not prove the ceasing of <hi>Rule</hi> and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when the <hi>Shilo</hi> comes. Its enough for us, that it was not to cease before it came, as shall further be manifested in our ensuing Explication and Vindication of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie. I have only by the way more particularly considered the Evasions of this man, who is called amongst the <hi>Masters</hi> of the present <hi>Judaical</hi> Profession, the <hi>Wise,</hi> that the Reader may know what thoughts to entertain concerning the Expositions and Objections of others of them, who have not attained that reputation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>subject</hi> here spoken of is <hi>Judah</hi>; and that not as meerly declaring the person of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>8</label> the fourth Son of <hi>Jacob</hi>; but the Tribe and Family that sprang, and was to spring from him. So are the whole Tribes every where called in Scripture by the name of him from whom they sprang; and that principally from the Prophesie and Blessing in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> wherein the common stream of <hi>Patriarchal</hi> blessing, hitherto running in one channell, is divided into <hi>twelve branches</hi>; each Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Jacob</hi> being constituted a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct spring of <hi>Benediction</hi> unto his posterity.</p>
                  <p>Now that the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> and not his person, but only as from him the whole received its denomination, and as he is included therein is intended in this Prophesie, is evident. For (1.) The things mentioned in this great <hi>Patriarchal Benediction</hi> were such, as should befall the Posterity of his Children, to whom he spake <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the <hi>latter dayes</hi>; or in the <hi>end of the dayes,</hi> as were all the <hi>blessings</hi> of them that went before <hi>Jacob</hi> also. Now that expression in general signally denotes the times of <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssiah,</hi> as we shall afterwards declare, and as hath in part already been made manifest. And as it relates in <hi>particular</hi> unto any of the Tribes, it denotes the whole continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their times untill that season should be accomplished. So that it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained unto the <hi>persons</hi> of any of them. (2.) Nothing that is spoken of any of the rest of the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> belonged unto them <hi>personally,</hi> no though it had its founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their persons, or in an allusion unto their <hi>personal</hi> Actings. Thus the dividing of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the <hi>scattering of them in Israel,</hi> belonged not unto their persons, though what befell their posterity of that nature, had a special eye unto their <hi>personal miscarriage, v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. Neither was any thing here spoken of <hi>Judah</hi> in any measure fulfilled in his person, who spent his dayes in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> without any pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence among his Brethren, or Rule with Conquest, and terror like a <hi>Lion</hi> over others. It is then the Family, Tribe, or Posterity of <hi>Judah</hi> that by that name is here intended.</p>
                  <p>Now this Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> may be considered either <hi>absolutely</hi> in its self, as it was in <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>9</label> its separated stations and condition in the Wilderness, without the mixture of any not of his posterity, or with respect unto that <hi>accession</hi> which was afterwards made unto it occasionally from the other Tribes. And this was fourfold: First, From the <hi>Lot of Simeon</hi> falling within its lot in the first inheritance of the Land, <hi>Josh.</hi> 19.1. whence that Tribe, though still keeping its distinct <hi>Genealogie,</hi> was reckoned unto <hi>Judah,</hi> and became one people with them. Secondly, By the cleaving of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> whose lot lay next unto it, and mixed with it in the very City of the Kingdom, to the reigning house of <hi>David</hi> in the fatal division of the people, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.20, 21, 27. upon which both those Tribes were after called by the name of <hi>Judah, v.</hi> 20. and the people of both <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Judaei</hi> or <hi>Jews.</hi> Thirdly, By the falling off of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Levi,</hi> with multitudes of other good men unto it out of all the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> upon the Idolatries and persecution of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>verses,</hi> by which means that one <hi>Tribe</hi> quickly became more numerous and potent then all the rest. Fourthly, By the mixture and addition of those great numbers which out of all the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> joyned themselves unto them upon their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the restitution of the Worship of God amongst them in its proper place. Now it is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50110:81"/>
                     <hi>Judah</hi> with all these <hi>accessions</hi> that is intended in this Prophesie and <hi>Benediction,</hi> yet so, as that in many things, as namely, in the <hi>production of the Messiah,</hi> the natural Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Off-spring of <hi>Judah</hi> was still to have the pre-eminence.</p>

What time this should come to pass, is not limited, only after it did so; it was not to cease untill the <hi>Shilo</hi> came. The foundation of the execution then of this Promise, in the erection of <hi>Polity</hi> and Government in that Tribe, was not laid untill about six hundred and twenty years after this time. So certain is that which we before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that this <hi>Patriarchal Benediction</hi> concerned not the persons of his Sons, and their then present condition, but that of their posterity in the latter dayes. And this was done, when the Kingdom was given to <hi>David</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> Neither is the <hi>kind of Government</hi> or Rule, which should be erected in that Tribe, expressed in the words; only a Rule and Polity is promised unto it; or that they should be a people having the Principle of Rule or Government in and among themselves. Whilest they continued such, the <hi>Scepter</hi> and <hi>Scribe</hi> departed not from them; and this they did as with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in the outward form of Goverment, though the Law and Polity amongst them were still the same: so not without some intercision of Rule untill the time specified was accomplished. And where the Law and Polity are still the same; Accidental alterations in the <hi>Modes</hi> and manner of Governing, make no Essential Change in the State of the people, or nature of the Government. Thus the first Constitution of Rule in that Tribe, was in a way of Government absolutely <hi>Monarchical</hi>; This being imprudently managed by <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> lost the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> who would never afterwards sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto the Regal Family of <hi>Judah.</hi> Its <hi>retrival</hi> after an intercision made of it in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity was <hi>Ducal,</hi> or by an honorary President, with a mixture both of <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> and of the power of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Neither did his Usurpation make any Essential Change in the Rule or <hi>Polity</hi> of the Nation; Although in his own person he were a Forreigner: for even during the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent Government of the <hi>Herodians,</hi> with the interposition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms, the Nation with that which constitutes a people, its <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Polity,</hi> was still continued though the Administration of <hi>Superiour Rule</hi> was not alwayes in the hands of <hi>Jews.</hi> In this state things continued amongst them untill the destruction of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and of the City and Temple by <hi>Titus</hi>; only as a <hi>presage</hi> of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of <hi>Scepter</hi> and <hi>Scribe,</hi> the power of Judgement as to the lives of men was some years before taken from the <hi>Sanhedrin, John</hi> 18.31.</p>

And indeed if any thing be more intended in this prediction, but only that the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> should continue in a National <hi>Political</hi> State, with Government in its self, it will be utterly impossible to determine exactly and precisely upon the accomplishment of this Prophesie.

                  <p>But granting <hi>Herod</hi> to have been an <hi>Idumaean,</hi> as he was undoubtedly by Extract, and that Nation not to have been incorporated into <hi>Judah</hi> upon the Conquest made of it by <hi>Hircanus,</hi> only that he was in his own person a <hi>Proselyte,</hi> why the <hi>Scepter</hi> should any more depart from <hi>Judah,</hi> because of his reign, then it did in the dayes of the <hi>Hasmonaeans</hi>

before him, who were of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> I see no reason. The Government and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Nation was that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ever Usurped and enjoyed the place of Supream Rule.

One would salve the difficulty of the <hi>Hasmonaeans</hi> and <hi>Herodians</hi> by affirming that the supream power of the Nation in their dayes was in the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi>; the greatest number of the persons whereof it was constituted, being alwayes of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as the <hi>Talmudists</hi> constantly affirm. But neither are we concerned herein. The Government as hath been manifested was still in and of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> with the fore-mentioned <hi>accessions</hi> denominated from it, until the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Country, City and Temple by <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> which is all that in the prediction is intended.

ever since the destruction of the Nation, City and Temple by <hi>Titus.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Messiah</hi> is long since come, which was proposed unto confirmation.

Secondly, That the promised <hi>Shilo</hi> is the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Thirdly, That all <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>National Polity</hi> was utterly long since taken away from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> even in the destruction of the City and Temple. Now the Proof of the two former, we shall take First, From the Text and Context. Secondly, From the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Antient Jews</hi> themselves. The last being matter of fact, must be evinced from Story; and the state of things in the world from those dayes, whereon there will be no rising up against this Testimony by any thing but that pertinacious obstinacy which the <hi>Jews</hi> are Judicially given up unto.</p>

                  <p>The latter Masters of the <hi>Jews</hi> to avoid the force of this Testimony, have coined <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>27</label> a new signification for these words: <hi>Shebet,</hi> they say is only a <hi>rod of Correction,</hi> and <hi>Mechokek</hi> any <hi>Scribe</hi> or Teacher which they would refer to the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> they have had in every Generation. Some of them by <hi>Shebet</hi> understand a <hi>staff of supportment,</hi> which they were to enjoy in the middest of their troubles; so I remember <hi>Manasse Ben Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> not long since made it one of his reasons for their admission into <hi>England,</hi> that therein this Prophesie might receive somewhat of accomplishment, by this counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and encouragement in this Land.

                     </gap>; the <hi>rod of Judah.</hi> But this evasion is plainly and fully obviated in the former opening of the words, and confirmation of their genuine importance: For, (1.) It is openly contrary to the whole <hi>Context</hi> and Scope of the Place. (2.) To the meaning and constant use of the words themselves, especially as conjoined. (3.) To the <hi>Targums,</hi> and all old Translations. (4.) To the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and all their own <hi>Antient</hi> masters. (5.) To the truth of the Story; <hi>Judah</hi> having been long in a most flourishing and prosperous condition, without any such signal calamity as that, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would intimate to be intended in the words; namely such as for sixteen hundred years they have now undergone. (6.) The <hi>supportment</hi> they have had, hath not been <hi>National,</hi> nor afforded to <hi>Judah</hi> as a Tribe, or People, but hath consisted meerly in the greatness and wealth of a few <hi>individual persons</hi> scattered up and down the world, neither themselves, nor any else, knowing unto what <hi>Tribe</hi> they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. And (7.) This hath been in things no way relating to the Worship of God, or their Church-state, or their spiritual good. (8.) Their <hi>Scribes</hi> were not formerly of the <hi>Tribe of Judah,</hi> and their latter <hi>Rabbins</hi> wholly of an uncertain extraction; so that this pretence proves nothing, but the misery of their present State and condition, wherein they seek a refuge for their infidelity, in vanity and falshood.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Benjamin</hi> was a <hi>Jew,</hi> who about 500. years ago passed out of <hi>Europe</hi> into the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50110:85"/>
Eastern parts of the world in a disquisition of his Countrey-men, and their state and condition whereof he hath given an account in his <hi>Itinerary,</hi> after the manner of <hi>vulgar</hi> Travellers. Among other things which he relates, <hi>fide Rabbinica,</hi> he tells us of a <hi>Jew</hi> that hath, or then had, a principality at <hi>Bagdat,</hi> whom his Countreymen called the <hi>Son of David,</hi> there being a thousand of them living there all in subjection unto him. This honour was allowed him by the <hi>Caliph,</hi> who in those dayes ruled there; so that when he passeth in the streets they cry before him, make way for the <hi>Son of David. Fagius</hi> long since returned a proper Answer to this Story in a <hi>Proverb</hi> of their own; <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>He that hath a mind to lye, let him place his Witnesses at distance enough.</hi> When <hi>Benjamin</hi> passed over those <hi>Eastern</hi> parts of the world, they were greatly unknown to <hi>Europaeans,</hi> and he had thence advantage to feign what he pleased for the reputation of his Nation, which he was not wanting to the improvement of. Time hath now brought truth to light. The people of <hi>Europe,</hi> especially the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> have some while since discovered the state of things in those parts, and can hear no tidings of <hi>Benjamins</hi> principality, nor his <hi>Son of David</hi>; nor could the Jews ever since get any one to confirm his relation. Besides, if all that he averrs should be granted to be true, as in the main, it is undoubtedly false, what would it amount unto as to the matter in hand: Is this the <hi>Scepter</hi> and <hi>Law-giver</hi> promised unto <hi>Judah</hi> as the great priviledge above his Brethren? It seems an obscure unknown person in <hi>Bagdat</hi> in Captivity, by the permission of a <hi>Tyrant</hi> whose Slave and Vassal he is, hath a pre-eminence among a <hi>thousand Jews,</hi> all slaves to the same <hi>Tyrant.</hi>

The end of calling and separating the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the rest of the world, the forming of them into a Nation, and the setting up of a <hi>Political</hi> State and Rule amongst them, being solely, as we have declared, to bring forth the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> by them, and to shaddow out his Spiritual Kingdom: It was necessary that he should come before their utter deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and final rejection from that state and condition, which also he did according to the promise and prediction before insisted on and explained. The same was the end of their <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> or Church-State, with all the Religious Worship that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted therein. Whilest that also therefore continued and was accepted of God in the place of his own appointment, he was to be brought forth and to accomplish his work in the world. This also in sundry places of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> is foretold, one or two of the most eminent of them we shall consider, and manifest from them, that the true <hi>Messiah</hi> is long since come, and exhibited unto the world, according to the Promise given of old to that purpose. The first we shall fix upon, is that of <hi>Haggai, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. whereunto we shall add <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. The words of the former place are, <hi>Who is left among you, that saw this house in her first Glory, and how do you see it now? Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Yet once it is a little while, and I will shake the Heavens and the Earth, and the Sea; and the dry Land, and I will shake all Nations, and the desire of all Nations shall come: And I will fill this House with Glory, saith the Lord of Hosts. The Silver is mine, and the Gold is mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, and the Glory of this latter House, shall be greater then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, saith the Lord of Hosts: And in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Those of the latter are, <hi>Behold, I will send my Messenger, and he shall prepare the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and the Lord whom I seek shall suddenly come to his Temple, even the Messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in, Behold he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Both to the same purpose.</p>
                  <p>The occasion of the former words must be enquired after, from the story of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> those times in <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the whole Discourse of the Prophet in that place. The people returning from their Captivity with <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Cyrus</hi> had laid the foundation of the Temple; but having begun their work, great opposition was made against it, and great discouragements they met withall, as it will fall out with all men that engage in the work of God in any Generation. The Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> who first encouraged them unto this work, and countenanced them in it, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. being possessed with false reports and slanders, as is usual also in such cases; at first began to withdraw their assistance, as it should seem in the dayes of <hi>Cyrus</hi> himself, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.5. And at length expresly forbad their proceedings, causing the whole work to cease
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50110:86"/>
by force and power. <hi>v.</hi> 23. Besides this outward opposition, they were moreover greatly discouraged by their own poverty and disability for the carrying on their designed work in any measure, so as to answer the beauty and glory of their former House builded by <hi>Solomon.</hi> Hence the Elders of the people who had seen the <hi>former House</hi> in its glory, wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundations of this laid, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.12, 13. As fore-seeing how much the splendor and beauty of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship would be ecclipsed and impaired: for as the measures of the Fabrick it self as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed unto it by <hi>Cyrus, Ezra.</hi> 6.3. did no way answer <hi>Solomons</hi> Structure, so for the Ornaments of it wherein its magnificence did principally consist; they had no means or ability to make any provision of them. Being therefore thus hindered, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, the work ceased wholly from the end of <hi>Cyrus</hi> Reign, unto the second year of <hi>Darius Hystiages.</hi> For there is no reason to suppose that this intercision of the work continued unto the Reign of <hi>Darius Nothus</hi>: Between the first year of the whole Empire of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the second of <hi>Darius Nothus</hi>; there were no less then a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years as we shall afterwards declare. Now it is evident in <hi>Ezra,</hi> that <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> and <hi>Joshuah,</hi> who began the work in the Reign of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> were alive, and carried it on in the dayes of <hi>Darius.</hi> And it is scarcely credible, that they who it may be were none of the youngest men, when they first returned unto <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> should live there an <hi>hundred years,</hi> and then return unto the work again. Outward force and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition then they were delivered from, in the second year of <hi>Darius Hystiages.</hi> But their discouragements from their poverty and disability still continued. This the Prophet intimates, v. 4. <hi>Who is there left among you, who saw this House in its first glory, and what do you now see it? Is it not as nothing in your eyes?</hi> There is no necessity of reading the words with a supposition; As <hi>Scaliger</hi> contends, <hi>if there were any amongst you who had seen.</hi> For it is much more likely, that some who had seen the <hi>former House of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and wept at the laying of the foundation of this in the dayes of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> should now see the carrying of it on in the second year of <hi>Darius Hystiages,</hi> that is about ten or twelve years after, then that those who began the work in the Reign of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> should live to perfect it in the second year of <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> an hundred years after. However it is evident that the old discouragement was still pressing upon them. The <hi>former House</hi> was Glorious and Magnificent, Famous and Renowned in the world: and full of comfort unto them, from the visible pledges of the presence of God that were therein. To remove this discouragement, and to support them under it, the Lord by this Prophet makes them a Promise, that whatever the streightness and poverty of the house were which they undertook to build: however short it came of the glory of that of <hi>old,</hi> yet from what he himself would do, he would render that House far more glorious then the former; namely, by doing that in it, for which both it and the former were instituted and erected. Saith he, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>The glory of this latter house, shall be great above that of the former.</hi> To clear our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment intended from these words we must consider (1.)

It is true, this Temple was three hundred years after re-edified by <hi>Herod</hi> in the eighteenth year of his Reign; which yet hindered not, but that it was still the <hi>same Temple.</hi> For this first Structure was never destroyed, nor the materials of it at once taken down. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reparation of it by <hi>Herod,</hi> it still continued the one and the same House, though much enlarged and beautified by him. And therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> in the dayes of our Saviour, overlooked as it were the re-edification of the Temple by <hi>Herod,</hi> and affirm, that that House which then stood, was <hi>forty six years in building, John</hi> 2.20. as they supposed it to have been upon the first return from Captivity; when the whole work and building of <hi>Herod</hi> was finished within the space of eight years. The <hi>Targum</hi> also of <hi>Jonathan, Aben Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Kimchi</hi> and others interpret the words of <hi>that House</hi> which was then building by <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> nor do any of the Antient Jews dissent.</p>

But we need not insist long in the removall of this fond imagination. For (1.) It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to express re-doubled affirmations in the <hi>Text</hi> before insisted on. (2.) To the whole design of the <hi>Context</hi> and Prophecy, which is expresly to encourage the <hi>Jews</hi> unto the building of <hi>that House,</hi> which seemed so contemptible in the eyes of some of them. (3.) To the repetition of this Prophecy, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. where the <hi>second Temple</hi> is evidently expressed. (4.) To the Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> wherein a Spiritual and not a material Temple is delineated, as we shall elsewhere demonstrate. (5.) To the time assigned to the glorifying of the House spoken of; <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>yet a little while,</hi> which in no sense can be applyed unto a Temple to be built longer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards then that Nation had been a people. From the Call of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the giving of this Promise, there had passed about fourteen hundred and ten years; and it is now above two thousand years since this Prophecy; which in what sense it can be called, a <hi>little while</hi> is hard to imagine.</p>
                  <p>This then is the sense that <hi>Abarbinel</hi> would put on these words, <hi>It is yet a little while, and I will fill this House with Glory</hi>; that is, a <hi>very great while hence,</hi> longer hence then you have been a people in the world; I will cause another House to be built. (6.) To the <hi>Targum,</hi> and all the antient Masters among the Jews themselves. (7.) To its self, for it is by his own confession promised, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should come to the Temple, that is promised to be filled with Glory: but the other Third Temple that he fancies, is as he said, to be built by himself; so as he cannot be said to come unto it. So that this evasion will not yield the least relief to their obstinacy and unbelief. It is evidently the second Temple built by <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> whose Glory is here fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Glory</hi> promised unto this house, is nextly to be considered. This is expressed <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> absolutely, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>I will fill this House with Glory</hi>: and comparatively, with reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Temple of Solomon,</hi> which some of them had seen, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>The Glory of this latter House, shall be greater then of the former.</hi> To understand aright this Promise, we must reflect a little upon the Glory of the first House, which the glory of this second was to excell. It would not answer our present design, to digress unto a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple: It is also done by others with great Judgement, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and Accuracy. I shall therefore only give a brief account of some of the heads of its excellency, which our present Argument doth require.</p>
                  <p>First then, It was very <hi>Glorious</hi> its principal <hi>Architect,</hi> which was God himself.<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>6</label> He contrived the whole Fabrick, and disposed of all the parts of it, in their order. For when <hi>David</hi> delivered unto <hi>Solomon</hi> the pattern of the House, and the whole Worship of it, he tells him, <hi>All these things the Lord made me understand in writing, by his hand upon me, even all the Work of this pattern,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron. Chap.</hi> 25.19. God gave him the whole in <hi>writing</hi>; That is, divinely and immediately inspired him by his holy Spirit to set down the frame of the House, and all the concernments of it, according to his own appointment and disposal. This rendered the <hi>House Glorious,</hi> as answering the Wisdom of him by whom it was contrived. And herein it had the advantage above all the Fabricks that ever was on the Earth; and in particular, the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple,</hi> whose Builders had no such <hi>Idea</hi> of their Work given them by inspiration.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It was <hi>Glorious</hi> in the Greatness, State, and Magnificence of the Fabrick <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>7</label> it self. Such a Building it was as was never paralelled in the world; which sundry Considerations will make evident unto us; as,</p>
                  <p>First, The design of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Wisest and Richest King that ever was in this world, in the building of it. When he undertook the work, and sent to <hi>Hyram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre</hi> for his assistance, he tells him, that <hi>the House which he was to build was to be great, because their God was great above all Gods,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.5. Nay, saith he, <hi>The House which I am about to build, shall be wonderfull and great.</hi> No doubt, but he designed the Structure Magnificent to the utmost, that his Wisdom and Wealth would extend unto.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50110:87"/>
And what shall he do that comes after the King? What shall any of the sons of men think to contrive and erect, to enlarge that in <hi>Glory,</hi> wherein <hi>Solomon</hi> laid out his utmost. There can doubtless be no greater fondness, then to imagine that it could in any measure be equalled by what was done afterwards by <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> or <hi>Herod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>8</label> Secondly, The vast and unspeakable summs of <hi>Treasure</hi> which were expended in the building and adorning of it. I know there is some difference among Learned Men, about reducing the <hi>Hebrew Signatures</hi> of moneys unto our pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt account. But let the estimate be as low, as by any can reasonably be imagined, setting aside what <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> expended of his own Rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nue and getting; the provision left by <hi>David</hi> towards the work, of <hi>an hundred thousand Talents of Gold,</hi> and a <hi>thousand thousand Talents of Silver</hi>; Besides <hi>Brass and Iron</hi> without weight, with Timber and Stone, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.14. doth far exceed all the Treasures that the greatest part, if not all the Kings of the Earth, are at this day possessed of. For on the ordinary computation and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Coyns, the Gold amounted to 450000000. l. and the Silver unto 3750000000. l. besides what was dedicated by his Princes, and out of his peculiar Treasure. He that would be satisfied, what immense summs of his own <hi>Solomon</hi> added to all this, may consult <hi>Villalpandus</hi> on this subject. And what might be the product of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense, Wisely managed, is not easie to be conceived. It seems to me, that the whole Revenue of <hi>Herod</hi> was scarce able to find Bread for <hi>Solomons</hi> Workmen; so unlikely is it, that his Fabrick should be equal unto that other. It was surely a <hi>Glorious House</hi> that all this charge was expended about.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>9</label> Thirdly, It appears farther from the <hi>number of Workmen</hi> employed in the Structure. We need not greaten this number out of conjectures with <hi>Villalpandus,</hi> who reckons above four hundred thousand; seeing there is evident mention in the Scripture of an <hi>hundred and fourscoure and three thousand and six hundred.</hi> Besides the <hi>Tyrians</hi> that were hired, who by their Wages seem also to have been a great number, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.10. That is, there was an <hi>hundred and fifty three thousand and six hundred strangers</hi> of the posterity of the <hi>Canaanites</hi>; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.17, 18. and thirty thousand <hi>Israelites,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.13. Neither was all this multitude engaged in this work for a few dayes or moneths, but full <hi>seven years,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.38. And therein, as <hi>Josephus</hi> observes, the speed of the work was almost as admirable as its magnificence. And what a glorious Structure might be raised by such numbers of men, in such a space of time, when nothing was wanting unto them, which by the immense Treasures before mentioned, could be procured, may easily be conceived. It doth not appear that the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the people, rich and poor, who were gathered together under <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> after the return from the Captivity, did equal the numbers of <hi>Solomons</hi> Builders; so that they were not like to erect a Fabrick, answerable unto what he effected: nor can it be imagined, that <hi>Herod</hi> employed so many in the whole work, as <hi>Solomon</hi> had to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see his Labourers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>10</label> We may add hereunto, what is recorded concerning the adorning of this House: Not to mention the <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Brass</hi> with their <hi>Chapiters,</hi> whose Magnificence was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and Workmanship inimitable; the <hi>Molten Sea,</hi> with the <hi>Oxen,</hi> and the like Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments innumerable. If we do but consider, that the whole House, upon the vault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <hi>Coiling</hi> with Cedar, was overlaid with <hi>pure beaten Gold,</hi> how glorious must it need be rendred to the thoughts of every man, who remembers the greatness of the structure. In especiall those <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tensils</hi> of the Sanctuary, the <hi>Ark, Oracle, Mercy-Seat,</hi> and <hi>Cherubims</hi> that represented the presence of God, what tongue can represent their beauty and glory? In the <hi>second House</hi> there was little of all these; and for the things of most cost and charge nothing at all. Nor did the riches of this House consist only in the solid parts of the Fabrick, but in those vast treasures of <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> with other precious things, which being dedicated to the service of God, were laid up therein; for besides what was consecrated by himself and his Princes, <hi>Solomon</hi> brought in all the things which <hi>David</hi> his Father had dedicated, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 7. And put them them among the treasures of the House of God. And although I do not think with some, that the whole summs of money before mentioned, were herein included, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was dedicated by <hi>David</hi>; for so also was his Brass and Iron and Timber: It is all to be expended about, or used in the building of the House it self; yet I cannot but judge, that those treasures were exceeding great, and such as the poverty and confusion of the people, under the <hi>second Temple,</hi> never allowed them to do any thing that was answerable unto it.</p>

                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:50110:87"/>Lastly, The glory of the Worship of this Temple consummated its beauty. Now <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>11</label> this was principally founded in the glorious entrance of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or <hi>Divine Presence</hi> into it, upon its Consecration by the Prayer of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Hereof God gave a double pledge. First, The <hi>fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this the Jews expresly confess to have been wanting in the <hi>Second Temple.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.1. Secondly, The <hi>Glory of the Lord,</hi> as a Cloud filling the whole House, and resting upon it, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. This foundation being laid, and attended with a Sacrifice of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Cattle, the whole Worship was gloriously carried on, according to the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution revealed unto <hi>David</hi> by the Spirit of God. And the better to enable them to a right performance hereof, some of the chief Ministers, as <hi>Heman, Ethan</hi> and <hi>Jedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> were themselves inspired with the Spirit of Prophecy. So that plainly here we had the utmost Glory, that a Worldly Sanctuary and Carnal Ordinances could extend unto.</p>
                  <p>Having taken this brief view of the Glory of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, we may now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>12</label> after what that <hi>Glory</hi> was, which was promised to this <hi>second House,</hi> concerning which the Prophet affirms expresly, that it <hi>shall excell all the Glory</hi> which on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count belonged unto the first. And first we shall consider the apprehension of the <hi>Jews</hi> in this matter: First, Some of them plainly insinuate, that this whole Promise was <hi>conditional,</hi> and depended upon the obedience of the people, wherein they sailing, it is no wonder if the Promise was never accomplished. Thus <hi>Abarbinel</hi> would have the Prophet speak to them, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But this wresting of the Text is evident. There is no condition intimated in the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>13</label> words, but rather the contrary; God promising to be with them, as he was in the days of their coming out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> wherein the work that he wrought for them, depended not on their Obedience, but was a meer effect of his own faithfulness, as he often declares. And those words <gap reason="foreign">

They know well enough, that the <hi>latter</hi> Temple was in nothing to be compared unto the <hi>former.</hi> And this <hi>Abarbinel</hi> acknowledgeth in the entrance of his Exposition of this Prophecy, affirming that the people were troubled at the remembrance of the House built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> which was great and high, filled with multitudes of Vessels of pure Gold and pretious Stones: whereas that which they were building, was <hi>small,</hi> according to the Command of the King of <hi>Persia</hi>; and without <hi>treasure,</hi> because of the poverty of the people: and though this House was built <hi>higher by Herod</hi>; yet it was not at all enlarged by him but erected precisely on the old foundation. But not to enter at present into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>measures</hi> of the <hi>former</hi> Structure: Let the latter Temple be thought as <hi>wide</hi> and <hi>long</hi> as the former, and some <hi>Cubits</hi> higher, doth this presently give it a greater glory then the other? a Glory <hi>so much greater,</hi> as to be thus eminently promised and intimated to be brought in with the shaking of Heaven, and Earth, Sea, and dry land? Can any thing more fondly be imagined? It were endless to reckon up the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular instances wherein it came short of the Glory of the first House. Let but the heads of the Beauty and Magnificence thereof above recounted be run over, and this will quickly appear. In a word, notwithstanding the imaginary greatness pretended, it had not the hundredth part of the <hi>Glory of Solomons House,</hi> which also these Masters on all occasions acknowledge: for besides all the <hi>Golden Glorious Vessels</hi> and Ornaments of it, Besides all the treasures disposed in it, besides sundry of the most magnificent parts of the building it self, they generally acknowledge that there were <hi>five things</hi> wanting in the last, wherein the principal glory of the <hi>first</hi> House consisted.

And there are <hi>three</hi> circumstances of this glory expressed in the Text. (1.) The way whereby it should be brought in: <hi>I will shake the Heavens, and the Earth, and the Sea, and the dry Land: and I will shake all Nations.</hi> Secondly, The season wherein this was to be done: <hi>Yet once it is a little while.</hi> Thirdly, The Event of it: <hi>and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of Hosts</hi>: all which are severally to be considered, and the intendment of the Holy Ghost in them vindicated from the objections of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first thing we are to enquire after, is the <hi>Glory</hi> it self that is promised in these <label type="milestone">

These, they say, the Nations being shaken, did bring unto the <hi>Temple,</hi> and therein the glory of it did consist.

                  <p>But First, It is directly contrary unto the <hi>Context</hi>: for it is the plain design of the Holy Ghost to take of the thoughts of the people from that kind of glory, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in coacervation of ornaments of Silver and Gold, which being all of them alwayes in his power, he could at that time have furnish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, It is perfectly <hi>false</hi> as to the event; for when was there such an outward <hi>shaking</hi> of all Nations under the second Temple, as that thereon they brought their Silver and Gold unto it, and that in such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as to render it more rich and glorious, then the House of <hi>Solomon</hi>: So to wrest the words, is plainly to averr, that the Promise was never fulfilled. For nothing can be more ridiculous, then to make a comparison between the Riches and Treasures of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, and those which at any time, were laid up in the second Temple. Besides, what was so, It was but Gifts and Oblations of the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which the Nations sometimes took away, but never brought any thing unto it. And therefore themselves which use this evasion, dare not place the excelling glory of this House herein, though the Text do plainly affirm, that it doth consist in what these words intend, but turn to other imaginations of <hi>largness</hi> and <hi>duration.</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Yet it cannot be denyed, that a great concussion and shaking of the World, and all the Nations of it, is intended in them; otherwise nothing is signified by them. And this must be with reference unto that <hi>house,</hi> and the Worship there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that in a tendency unto its glory. Now I desire to know what work among the Nations in the whole World it is, that was wrought with respect unto the Temple which is here intended. The <hi>Nations</hi> indeed under <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and almost ruined it; under <hi>Crassus,</hi> and robbed it; under <hi>Pompey,</hi> and prophaned it; under <hi>Titus</hi> and destroyed it.

At his Birth, a <hi>New Star</hi> appeared in the <hi>Heavens; Angels</hi> celebrated his Nativity; <hi>Wise men</hi> came from the <hi>East,</hi> to enquire after him; <hi>Herod</hi> and all <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was <hi>shaken</hi> at the tidings of him; and upon his undertaking of his work, he wrought <hi>Miracles</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Earth, Sea,</hi> and <hi>dry Land,</hi> upon the whole Creation of God. Take them <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> as they are rather to be understood, for the mighty change which God would work in his Worship, and the stirring up of the Nations of the world to receive him, and his Doctrine, and the event is yet more evident. All Nations under Heaven were quickly shaken and moved by his coming. Some were stirred up to enquire after him; some to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him; untill the world, as to the greatest and the most noble parts of it, was made subject unto him. Evident it is, that since the creation of all things, never was there such an <hi>Alteration</hi> and Concussion in the world, as that wherewith the <hi>Messiah</hi> and his Doctrine was brought into it; and which is therefore so expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Prophet.</p>

But unto their Church and Faith, all <hi>Nations</hi> were converted.

But it is evident from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, that the Prophet had no respect unto <hi>Rule</hi> or Dominion in these words. For what ever is intended in this Expression, it hath a direct and immediate influence into the bringing in of the desire of all Nations, and the glory promised, which the Rule of the <hi>Hasmonaeans</hi> reached not unto.

Such a concussion of all things had been before; and this as is evident from <hi>v.</hi> 5. was the work that he wrought at the <hi>giving of the Law,</hi> and the erection of the <hi>Judaical Church,</hi> State and Ordinances. In answer hereunto, he would bring in the <hi>everlasting Kingdom of the Messiah,</hi> and the spiritual Worship to be celebrated therein, the Old Church-State of the <hi>Jews</hi> in this shaking of all things being removed and taken away.</p>
                  <p>And this plainly is evinced from the comparison that God makes between the work here promised, and that which he wrought when he covenanted with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon their coming up out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Concerning the work which God will thus do; <hi>once more,</hi> it is said to be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>a little while,</hi> that is, ere it be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished: It is not the nature, or <hi>quality</hi> of the work; but the <hi>season</hi> or time wherein it shall be wrought, that is denoted in these words: In that sense is <gap reason="foreign">

But this season is not called <hi>a little while</hi> absolutely, but with respect unto the former duration of the people, or Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> either from the calling of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the giving of the Law by <hi>Moses.</hi> And this space of four hundred years is <hi>but a little</hi> in comparison thereof; and is so termed, to stir up Believers unto a continual expectation of it, and desire after it; It being now nearer unto them, then unto their Fore-fathers, who beheld the time of its performance, <hi>a very great way off.</hi> And this also serves for the conviction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for whereas their fore-fathers of old did confess, and themselves at present cannot with any modesty deny, but that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is here intended, whom they suppose not yet to be come, how can this space of time from the days of <hi>Haggai</hi> in any sense be called a <hi>little while,</hi> seeing it far exceeds all the space of time that went before, from the Call of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is the first <hi>Epocha</hi> of their priviledge and claim.</p>

dayes of the <hi>Hasmonaeans,</hi> the whole people was in perfect bondage and slavery: First, To the <hi>Persians,</hi> then to the <hi>Graecians</hi>; and bondage is not, especially peace in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Dialect,</hi> wherein, that word denotes an affluence of all good things. The Rule of the <hi>Hasmonaeans</hi> was wholly spent in <hi>bloody Wars,</hi> and intestine Divisions. Their power issued in the Dominion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and their <hi>Vassals</hi> the <hi>Herodians?</hi> What signal peace they had in those dayes, they may learn from their own <hi>Joseph Ben Gorion.</hi> To say then, that this was the peace intended, is to say directly, that that God promised what he never performed, which is fit only for these men to do.</p>
                  <p>Besides, though God promised to give this peace at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that is amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet he promised not to give it only to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> but to all Nations also, whom he would shake and stir up, to bring in this Glory. Now what pretence of peace had the <hi>Jews</hi> under the second Temple wherein all Nations were concerned? I suppose they will not say they had any. Moreover, the peace promised, was that which was to be brought in by the <hi>Messiah.</hi> This <hi>Abarbinel</hi> grants; and thence seeks to strengthen his Objection: for saith he, <hi>Then we shall have Peace, Rule and Dominion according to the manifold Promises given us unto that purpose.</hi> I answer, those Promises are of two sorts; Some express Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, <hi>Allegorically</hi> by words literally signifying things outward; And they are all of them fulfilled in and unto them that do believe. Others of them, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intend outward Peace and Glory, are made concerning them to be fulfilled, not when the <hi>Messiah</hi> came to them, but when they shall come to the <hi>Messiah</hi>: At his <hi>Coming unto them,</hi> they rejected him, and he rejected them; but when their blindness shall be taken away, and they shall return unto the Lord, all these Promises shall have a blessed accomplishment amongst them. But we have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved that the principal work of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to make peace between <hi>God and man</hi> by taking away <hi>sin</hi> that was the cause of their separation, distance and Enmity. This then is the <hi>peace</hi> here promised. This God gave at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whilest the second Temple was standing: <hi>For he is our peace who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh, the Enmity, even the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances for to make in himself of twain, one new man, so making peace. And that he might reconcile both unto God, in one body by the Cross, having slain the Enmity thereby, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ame and preached peace to them that were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</hi> Thus did God give peace at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> both to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by him that was the desire of all Nations; and so by this Circumstance of the Context also, is our interpretation fully confirmed.</p>
                  <p>Although we have sufficiently confirm'd our Argument, and vindicated it from <label type="milestone">

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50110:92"/>
A Reverend and Learned Person in a late <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Visions</hi> and Prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> endeavouring to refer them all unto the state of the Churches of Christ in these <hi>later dayes</hi> of the world, with their sufferings under, and deliverance from the power of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> amongst the rest contends expresly, that this <hi>Prophecy, Prediction,</hi> and <hi>Computation</hi> doth not relate unto the coming and suffering of the Messiah, but only unto the state of the Churches before mentioned. Hence he who published those Discourses, declareth in the <hi>Title of the Book,</hi> that <hi>a New way is propounded in it, for the finding out of the determinate time signified unto</hi> Daniel <hi>in his seventy Weeks, when it did begin, and when we are to expect the end thereof.</hi> And a NEW WAY it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, not only diverse from, but upon the matter, contrary unto the Catholick Faith of the Church of God, both <hi>Judaical</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> ever since the first giving out of the Prophecie. And such a way it is, as is not only groundless, as we shall discover in the examination and trial of it, but also dangerous unto the Christian Faith if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Yet because the <hi>Author</hi> of it, (if he be yet alive) is a Person Holy, Modest and Learned, and proposeth <hi>his conjectures with submission unto the Judgement of others, not peremptorily determining what he sayes, pag.</hi> 51. His discourse deserves our Consideration, and a Return unto it, with a sobriety answerable unto that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is proposed. And herein we shall attend unto the <hi>Method</hi> chosen by himself, which is first to give Reasons and Arguments to prove, that this <hi>Prophecy</hi> cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and then those which countenance, as he supposeth, the application of it, unto these <hi>latter dayes,</hi> both which shall be examined in their Order.</p>
                  <p>That which in general he first insisteth on as a Reason to abjudicate this Prediction <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> from the times of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is the difference that is among <hi>Learned men</hi> about the <hi>Chronological Computation</hi> of the time here limited and determined. The variety of opinions in this matter he terms <hi>monstrous,</hi> and the difficulties that attend the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Calculations <hi>inextricable.</hi> But whether this Reason be <hi>cogent</hi> or no unto his purpose, is easie to determine; yea, it seems to have strength on the other side. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the difficulties of the <hi>exact Computation</hi> pretended, not one of them whom he mentions, nor scarce any other Person, Antient or Modern before himself, or a very few besides, did ever doubt, or call in question, whether the time designed, did concern the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> or no. And it seems to be a great evidence of the Truth thereof, that no difficulty in the computation did ever move them to question the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple its self.</p>
                  <p>Besides that, this is indeed no tolerable Argument, namely, that Learned Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree in the <hi>exact computation</hi> of any time appointed unto such an end, to prove that it was not designed unto that end, is evident from other instances in the Scripture to the same purpose. Thus God tells <hi>Abraham, that his seed should sojourn in a strange Land four hundred years, Gen.</hi> 15.13. which <hi>Stephen</hi> repeats, <hi>Acts.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 6. After this, <hi>Moses</hi> with some difference in the years themselves, affirms, that their <hi>sojourning in</hi> Egypt, <hi>was four hundred and thirty years, Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 40. which St. <hi>Paul</hi> repeats, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 17. Now learned men greatly differ about the right stating of this Account, as from what time precisely, the <hi>Computation</hi> is to be dated: and that on the very same Reason which divides their Judgements in the stating of these <hi>Weeks in Daniel.</hi> For as in this place of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Angel fixing the Beginning of the time limited unto the <hi>going forth of the Decree to build Jerusalem,</hi> there being several Decrees, at several seasons, made as it should seem to that purpose, they are not agreed from which of them precisely to begin the Account; So <hi>Paul</hi> affirming, that the <hi>four hundred and thirty years</hi> began with the giving of the Promise unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> it having been several times, and at several seasons solemnly given unto him, there is great question from which of them the Computation is to take its <hi>date</hi> and Beginning. And yet as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this difficulty never any man doubted, but that the years mentioned contained the time of <hi>Abraham's</hi> and his Posterities being in <hi>Aegypt</hi>; no more notwithstanding the difficulties and difference pleaded about the computation of these <hi>Weeks of Daniel,</hi> did ever any doubt but that the time limited in them, was that allotted unto the Judaical Church and State, untill the coming of the Messiah. The like difference there is amongst <hi>Learned men</hi> about the Beginning and Ending of the seventy years in <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> allotted unto the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity; and that because the people were carried Captive at three different times by the <hi>Babylonians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is therefore indeed no weight in this exception, which is taken meerly from the weakness and imbecility of the minds of men, not able to make a perfect Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50110:93"/>
concerning some particulars in this <hi>divine account,</hi> which, as we shall afterwards manifest, is of no great importance as to the principal, yea only End of the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it self, whether we can do so or no. But yet that this difficulty is not so <hi>inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable</hi> as is pretended, but as capable of a fair Solution, as any computation of time so far past and gone, we shall I hope sufficiently evidence in the account that shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned unto our Exposition and Vindication of the Prophecy its self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> From this general Consideration, the <hi>Learned Author</hi> proceeds to give five particular Reasons to prove his intention, which we shall examine in their order. And the first is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Because,</hi> saith he, <hi>in no place of the New Testament this Prophecy is used against the Jews to prove the Messiah already come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Might this Reason be allowed as cogent, it would disarm the Christian Church of the principal Testimonies which in the Old Testament it hath alwayes rested in, to prove that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is long since come, and that <hi>Jesus of Nazareth</hi> is he. For as any of that nature are sparingly recorded in the Writings of the Gospel, so of the most evident and illustrious unto that purpose, there is no mention at all therein. And it is most evident, that as well in dealing with the <hi>Jews,</hi> as in his instruction of his own Disciples, the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> made use of innumerable other Testimonies, then what are recorded in the Books of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> So also did his Apostles, and other Primitive Teachers of the Gospel. Hence are <hi>they</hi> said to prove <hi>Jesus</hi> to be the Christ out of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> to have instructed his Disciples out of <hi>Moses</hi> and all the Prophets in the things concerning himself; and yet the particular places, whereby the one and other was performed, are not recorded.</p>
                  <p>Besides, this Reason laboureth under another unhappiness, which is, that it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a mistake. For indeed this Prophecy is expresly made use of in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, to denote the time by us allotted unto it; and that by our Lord Jesus Christ himself. For <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 15. speaking of the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto this Prediction, was immediately to succeed upon his coming and suffering, he sayes unto his Disciples, <hi>When ye shall see the Abomination of Desolation spoken of by</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel <hi>the Prophet standing in the Holy Place, (who so readeth, let him understand) then let them which be in</hi> Judaea <hi>flee into the Mountains.</hi> That which here is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the words of the <hi>Evangelist</hi> are inserted into the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of the <hi>LXX.</hi> in this place, is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>Desolater,</hi> or <hi>Waster over a Wing of abominations</hi>; that is, as <hi>Luke</hi> interpreteth the words, <hi>an Army compassing</hi> Jerusalem <hi>unto the desolation thereof, Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 20. Wherefore our Saviour expresly applying this Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> to the Destruction of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which was the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of his Passion, he plainly declares, that in his Suffering, and the Desolation that ensued on the <hi>Jews,</hi> this whole Prediction and limitation of time is fulfilled, and ought not to be sought after in any other season of the Church. And this is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly sufficient, not only to render the foregoing Reason utterly useless; but also to <hi>supersede</hi> all the following Considerations and Arguments, as those which contend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against the Interpretation of this Prophecy given us by the Lord Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But yet having made this entrance, we shall examine also the ensuing Reasons in their Order.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> It is added therefore Secondly, <hi>If the restauration of the City,</hi> v. 25. <hi>is of the material</hi> Jerusalem <hi>after</hi> Nebuchadnezzars <hi>Captivity, it must begin in the first year of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>from which time seventy weeks of years, will fully expire long before the Birth of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> There are sundry Learned Men who despair not to make good the compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the first of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whose Arguments it will not be so easie to overthrow, as to make their failure in <hi>Chronologie,</hi> to be the foundation of so great an inference, as that here proposed, namely, that the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> is not intended in this Prophecy. But we shall afterwards prove, that there is not only no necessity, that the Decree mentioned for the Restauration of <hi>Jerusalem, v.</hi> 25. should be thought to be that made in the first year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that indeed it is impossible that any such Decree should be intended: seeing no such was made by him, but only <hi>one</hi> about the re-edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Temple, which here is no respect unto. Another Decree therefore express to what the <hi>Angel</hi> here affirmeth, we shall discover, from whence unto the sufferings of Christ, the <hi>seventy Weeks</hi> are an exact measure of time.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>6</label> He adds Thirdly, <hi>The first division of the seventy Weeks, is seven Weeks of years,</hi> v. 25. <hi>The end whereof it expresly characterized by the setting up of a Messiah Governour, which cannot be verified in the setting up of the first Governour of the Jews after the Captivity,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50110:93"/>
much less of Christ. For</hi> Zerubbabel <hi>was set up in the Beginning, and Christ long after the End of all. No other Governour can be meant after the first; because the setting up of one, pointeth at the first. Therefore if the seven Weeks end not in the setting up of</hi> Zerubbabel, <hi>or Christ, as they cannot, then they cannot be verified in the material state of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>after the Captivity of</hi> Babylon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> This exception fixeth on one of the greatest difficulties in the Text, which yet is not such as to bear the weight of the Inference that is here made from it. For the Argument from the Division of the time in the Text, is of this importance: Because it is said, <hi>That from the going forth of the Decree to build</hi> Jerusalem <hi>unto Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two Weeks the Street shall be built again, and the Wall in troublous times</hi>; Therefore if the seven Weeks end not in the setting up of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> they cannot be verified in the material State of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> after the Captivity. Now I see not the force of this Argument. For the words may have another Interpretation, and the separating of the seven Weeks from the LXII, as all of them from the <hi>LXX.</hi> before mentioned, excluding one out of the Distribution, may be to another end, then to denote, either the setting up of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> which assuredly they did not, or the coming of Christ, which they extend not unto. In brief, they do not precisely assert, that at the End of the <hi>Seven Weeks Messiah</hi> the Prince should be; for although they are distinguished from the other for some certain Purpose not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as to the Determination of the time of the coming of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now not to prevent my self in what is more largely afterwards to be insisted on, in the Exposition of the several passages of this Prophecy, after a full consideration of what sundry learned men have offered for the solving of this Difficulty, I shall here briefly propose my apprehensions concerning it, which I hope the Candid and <hi>Judicious Reader</hi> will find to answer the Conduct of the Context, and Design of the place.</p>
                  <p>First, I fix it here as unquestionable, that the whole space of <hi>Seventy Weeks</hi> doth <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>7</label> precisely contain the time, between the going forth of the Decree, and <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction of the Most Holy,</hi> with his Passion that ensued, some few years of the last <hi>Week</hi> remaining, not reckoned on to keep the Computation entire by weeks of years. This is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly affirmed, v. 24. that the Interpretation of all that ensues is to be regulated thereby. And this, as we shall afterwards prove, so here we take it for granted, as the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> on which the present difficulty is to be <hi>solved.</hi> There is then a Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of these LXX. <hi>Weeks</hi> into VII, LXII. and One; upon the account of some remarkable events, happening at the distinct expiration of those several parcels of the whole season, <hi>v.</hi> 25. We have two portions of this time expressed; namely VII. Weeks, and LXII Weeks, and two Events attending them, <hi>Messiah the Prince,</hi> and the building of the Street and Wall. <hi>From the going forth of the Decree to restore and to build</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>unto Messiah the Prince shall be seven Weeks, and threescore and two Weeks the Street shall be built again, and the Wall in troublous times.</hi> The two Events here mentioned did ensue the two distinct parcels of time limited, but not in the Order which the words at first view seem to represent, as is evident from the Context. For as the <hi>Messiah</hi> did not come at the Expiration of the <hi>VII. Weeks,</hi> so the <hi>LXII. Weeks</hi> were not expired before the <hi>building of the City</hi>; nor is that mentioned as the Event designed by the whole space of <hi>LXIX. Weeks,</hi> but as that which should fall out in some interval of it; for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy issues not in the Restauration, but Desolation of the City.</p>
                  <p>The Angel therefore, expresseth the distinct divisions of time, and the principal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct events of them, but not the <hi>Order</hi> of their accomplishment. For the natural Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of these things, is, that in VII. Weeks, the building of the City, <hi>Wall and Street,</hi> should be finished, and in LXII. Weeks after the Messiah should be cut off. And this is evident from the <hi>Text</hi>; for as the <hi>building of the City</hi> can no way be said to be after the <hi>LXII. Weeks,</hi> but in and after the seven, which was the season wherein the Decree was executed; so the <hi>cutting off the Messiah,</hi> is expresly said in the <hi>next verse,</hi> to be after those <hi>LXII. Weeks,</hi> which succeeded unto the <hi>VII. Weeks</hi> wherein the Restauration of the City was finished. And to suppose the <hi>Messiah</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 25. not to be the same with the <hi>Messiah v.</hi> 26. and the Most Holy, <hi>v.</hi> 24. is to confound the whole order of the Words, and to leave no certain sense in them. For the single remaining <hi>Weeks,</hi> the use of it shall be afterwards declared. This distinction therefore of the several portions of the whole time limited, doth rather confirm our Application of this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> then any way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the Truth or Evidence of it.</p>
                  <p>It is added Fourthly, That <hi>the cutting off the Messiah here spoken of, is expresly joyned</hi>

                     <hi>with the destruction of the City in one Week, to be accomplished the last seven years; whereas Christ sufferred above thirty years before the destruction of the Materiall</hi> Jerusalem, v. 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> There appears no such thing in the Text. The destruction of the City and People is only mentioned as a consequent of the cutting off, and rejection of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> without any limitation of time wherein it should be performed; and <hi>de facto</hi> it succeeded immediately in the causes of it, and direct tendency thereunto.</p>

                     </gap>, translated, to <hi>purge iniquity</hi>; whereas it rather signifies, <hi>to make At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement or Reconciliation for iniquity?</hi> Is it not because it would be very difficult to make any tolerable application of these things unto the season, which is called <hi>the time of the End?</hi> In brief, these things are so proper, so peculiar unto the Lord Christ, and the work of his Mediation; that in their first, direct and proper sense, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ascribed unto any other things or Persons, without some impiety.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>10</label> I shall not here insist on those Reasons and Arguments whereby we prove the true and only <hi>Messiah</hi> to be intended in this Prophecy: For as they are needless unto <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> who are universally satisfied with the truth hereof, so we shall from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text and other Evidences, immediately confirm them against the Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Masters.

                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>11</label> First, saith he, <hi>Because the effects Characterizing the end of those years, the consuming of transgression, and the bringing in of everlasting righteousness, are effects to be accomplished in the Christian Church at the fall of Antichrist.</hi> Isa. 1.25, 26, 27, 28. and 27.19.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> These are but some of the effects mentioned, and one of them not rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; there are others in the Prophecy, <hi>as the Annointing of the most Holy, and cutting off the Messiah,</hi> that can with no colour of probability be applyed unto that season. (2.) However something <hi>analogous</hi> unto what is here spoken of as an effect and product of it, may be wrought at another time in the conformity of the <hi>Church</hi> unto its <hi>Head,</hi> yet properly and directly as here intended, they are the immediate effects of the annointing, death and sufferings of Jesus Christ. (3.) The places quoted out of <hi>Isaiah</hi> have no respect unto the Churches of the latter dayes, other then all Scripture hath which is written for their Instruction. (4.) The things mentioned, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 27. are effects of this work of Christ in and towards his Church, not the work its self here expressed, as the first view of the place will manifest.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>12</label> He adds, <hi>In the other Prophets, the Restauration of the Christian Church from the</hi> Babylon <hi>of Antichrist, is in like Types proportionably represented.</hi> Isa. 10. &amp; 11. &amp; 13, 14.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I know not what is understood by, <hi>represented in the like Types</hi>; Here are no <hi>Types</hi> in this Prophecy, but a naked Prediction of the State and continuance of the <hi>Judaical Church</hi> untill the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and of the Work that he should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish at his coming, with the effects and consequences thereof. To allow Types in these things, is to enervate all the Prophecies which we have of him in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. (2.) The places directed unto in <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> intend not the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> unless it be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and that in expressions no way coincident with, or suited unto this Prophecy. (3.) Where any thing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in <hi>a Type,</hi> there must be an accomplishment of somewhat answerable unto it in the <hi>Type</hi> its self; and such was the deliverance of the <hi>Israelites</hi> from <hi>Babylon</hi> of old insisted on by those Prophets. But here our Author allows no such <hi>Type,</hi> but refers the whole Prophecy, firstly and only unto the Christian Churches. (4.) In the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> indeed the deliverance of the Churches of Christ from <hi>Antichristian</hi> Persecution is foretold, which hinders not but that the coming and suffering of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> may be immediately intended, as undoubtedly it is, in this place.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This is <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> and hath no foundation, but the arbitrary <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of our Author; and it seems strange that there should be so many Prophecies of the Churches of Christ, and none amongst them of Christ himself: For this is far from the <hi>Genius</hi> and strain of the Old Testament, all the principal Prophecies whereof firstly and directly intend him, and the Church only as built on him. (2.) Grant therefore, (for we will not needlesly contend) that some of those Prophecies may concern these latter times, it doth not at all follow that this also must so do; considering the great variety of <hi>Daniels Visions,</hi> and there are Arguments unanswerable that it doth not do so, as will afterwards appear.</p>
                  <p>It is added fourthly, That <hi>the parallel proportion of phrase argueth the annointed Prince,</hi>

And indeed this is, if not the only, yet far the most signal place in the whole Old Testament wherein the promised Redeemer is directly called the MESSIAH, whence his usual Appellation in both Churches, <hi>Judaical</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> is taken. For there is not above one place more where he is immediately and directly so called, and not in his <hi>Types</hi>; neither is that place without Controversie. To interpret this expression there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this place otherwise, is to take away the foundation of that <hi>Name</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, by which the Holy Ghost in the <hi>New Testament</hi> doth principally propose him unto our Faith and Obedience; which certainly would be <hi>in prejudicium fidei Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anae.</hi> (2.) The <hi>Prince of the Covenant, Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 22. in those wars of <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> or Persecutions of Antichrist, (I determine not whether) may be another from <hi>Messiah the Prince</hi> here promised.</p>

                  <p>It is further urged, <hi>The effects of the last weeks, are parallel with the Antichristian <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> (1.) The <hi>likeness</hi> of Phrases and Expressions in setting out different Events agreeing only in some generalls, especially in the Predictions that concern Christ and his Church, which is <hi>predestinated</hi> to be conformed unto him, is so frequent in the Prophecies of the Old Testament, that nothing unto the purpose of this Learned Author, can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from such an Observation concerning these places. (2.) The <hi>Christian Church</hi> is not intended by the <hi>Holy City, Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 26. but expresly that City, which was to be built upon the <hi>Decree of the King of Persia,</hi> whose condition was revealed unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> upon his prayer for it, and about it. (3.) It is no wonder that there should be <hi>Streights</hi> before Desolations, at all seasons of them whatever. (4.) The <hi>half week cut off from the rest of the weeks,</hi> is not to be three years and an half of Persecution, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Triumph; but on the contrary, it is designed for the <hi>Confirmation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> by the Preaching of the Gospel; so that here is nothing of the <hi>parallelism</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the places compared.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I have shewed before that the <hi>similitude of Phrases</hi> in different places, is no ground to conclude a <hi>coincidence</hi> of the same things intended. (2.) The Phrases are not the same, nor alike in the places compared. Concerning him who is spoken of

                  <p>Secondly, The especial sense of the words in the several passages of it, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Prophecies contained in them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Chronological</hi> computation of the time designed, in an exact account of the space of time limited from the beginning unto the end.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>First</hi> of these is that wherein principally we have to do with the <hi>Jews</hi>; namely to prove from hence, that there was a time limited and determined for the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> which is long since expired. And all things herein we shall find clear and evident. Both the space of time limited, and the several <hi>coincidencies</hi> of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration are sufficiently manifest.

In reference therefore hereunto, I shall do these two
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50110:95"/>
things; First, Manifest that our Argument from this place, is not at all concerned in the exact <hi>Chronological Computation</hi> of the times, whereunto the accomplishment of this Prophecy relates. And Secondly, Shall demonstrate that this difficulty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable, by giving a clear and satisfactory account of the time specified and limited, such as is not liable unto any Material Objection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irst, It is evident in general that here is given out by the Holy Ghost himself, a <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>22</label> computation of the Time wherein the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to come, and to perform the work allotted unto him. And this gives warrant unto the kind and nature of Argument which we now insist upon. No small part this was of the Churches Treasure of old, and a blessed Guide it would have been unto the Faith and Obedience of them concerned therein, had it been diligently attended unto. But having sinfully negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it in its season, they have ever since wickedly opposed it. To <hi>Daniel</hi> it was granted as a great favour, relief and priviledge, upon his deep humiliation and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent supplications, as himself records. <hi>Whilest,</hi> saith he, <hi>I was speaking and praying</hi>; (<hi>with fasting, sackloth, and ashes,</hi> v. 3.) <hi>and confessing my sins, and the sins of my people</hi> Israel, <hi>and presenting my supplications before the Lord my God, for the holy Mountain of my God; yea, whilest I was speaking in prayer, the man</hi> Gabriel <hi>whom I had seen in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening Oblation: and he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O</hi> Daniel <hi>I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding. At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee, for thou art greatly beloved; therefore understand the matter, and consider the Vision, seventy weeks, &amp;c.</hi> v. 20, 21, 22, 23. This was the Answer that God gave him upon his great and fervent prayer for the Church, and that for his relief, comfort and supportment; whence it is evidently manifest, that the great <hi>blessing of the Church</hi> was enwrapped in it. And the computation of time mentioned, was granted as a light to guide the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they might not shipwrack their souls at the appointed season. But when the time of its accomplishment drew nigh, they being generally grown dark and carnal, and filled with prejudices against the proper work of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> wholly disregarded it. And since the misery that is come upon them for not <hi>discerning this time and Judgement,</hi> most of them do cry out against all computations of time about the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> although they are plainly called and directed thereunto by God himself. Neither can they conceal the vexation which from hence they receive, by finding the design of the Prophecy so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against them. Hence this place of <hi>Daniel,</hi> as to the time of the coming of the Messiah, as the <hi>fifty third Chapter of Isaiah,</hi> for his Office and Work, are justly esteemed the racks and tortures of the <hi>Rabbins.</hi> It may not therefore be amiss in our way to take a little prospect of their perplexity in this matter.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Talmud. Tractat. Sanedrin,</hi> they have laid down this general Rule, <hi>Male pereant</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>23</label> 
                     <hi>qui temporum articulos suppetunt quibus venturus est Messiah.</hi> Or as they express it by a solemn Curse in the name of <hi>Rabbi Jonathan,</hi> a great man among them. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>let their bones rot who compute the times of the end.</hi> And in <hi>Shebet. Jehuda,</hi> (wherein they follow <hi>Maimonides</hi> in <hi>Jad. Chazekah, Tractat. de Regib. cap.</hi> 12.) they give a particular account of that solemn Malediction against the Computers of times. <hi>It was invented,</hi> they say, <hi>because upon the mistakes of their reckonings, or failings of their calculations, the people are apt to despond, and begin to suspect that he is already come.</hi> So openly do they own it to be an invention to shelter their unbelief against their convictions. Yet this hath not hindered some of their chiefest <hi>Doctors,</hi> when they hoped to make some advantage of it, (as when they saw their Disciples under any distress enclinable unto Christianity) to give out their conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures without any respect unto the <hi>Talmudical</hi> Curse. So the Author of <hi>Shalscheleth Hakkabala</hi> assigns the year for the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> to be the 5335th from the Creation; which according to their computation fell out about the year of the Lord by our account 1575. Another would have it to be in the year 5358, that is, twenty three years after, in the year 1598. <hi>Abarbinel</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> on <hi>Isaiah</hi> comes short of these; assigning it to the year 5263. or 5294. at the farthest; for he had great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from the issue of the Wars between the <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> that were in his dayes. Their utmost conjecture in <hi>Zohar</hi> is upon the year 5408. which with their wonted success, fell out in the year of our Lord 1648. or thereabouts. And all these <hi>Calculations</hi> were invented and set on foot to serve some present exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Talmudical</hi> Curse and Censure is pointed directly against them that would
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50110:96"/>
conclude any thing from the account of <hi>Gabriel</hi> given unto <hi>Daniel</hi> in this place. This they plainly acknowledge in a Disputation which they had with a converted <hi>Jew</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> recorded in their <hi>Shebet Jehuda.</hi> Only they would except <hi>Daniel</hi> himself, affirming that he was not <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>a Computer of the time,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>a Seer</hi>; as though the Question were about the way and means whereby we attain a just computation of the time, and not about the thing it self. <hi>Daniel</hi> received the knowledge of this time by Revelation, as he did the time of the accomplishment of the Captivity, though he made use of the computation of time limited in the Prophecy of <hi>Jeremiah</hi>; but in both he gives us a perfect Calculation of the time, and so cannot be exempted from the Talmudical Malediction. And I mention these things in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of our Considerations of this Prophecy, to manifest how far the Jews despair of any tolerable defence of their cause, if the things recorded in it be duly weighed. This then we see in general, that the Holy Ghost directed the Church to compute the time of its spiritual deliverance by the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> no less evidently then he did that of their temporal deliverance from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity. Neither are there more differences among <hi>Christians,</hi> about the precise beginning and ending of <hi>Daniels</hi> LXX. weeks, then were and are about the beginning and ending of the LXX. years of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews.</hi> This Rule was given them by God himself, to direct and guide them, if they would have attended unto it, in that darkness, and under those prejudices, which the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was attended withall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>24</label> And it is observable, that although it was not the will of God, that they should exactly know the year and day of the accomplishment of this Promise, or that they could not attain unto it, or had lost the Tradition of the sense of it, yet about the end of the time pointed unto in this <hi>computation,</hi> they were all of them raised up to a great expectation of the coming of the Messiah. And this is not only evident from the <hi>Gospel,</hi> wherein we find that upon the first preaching of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> they sent unto him to know whether he were the <hi>Messiah</hi> or no, and were all of them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and suspense about it, untill he publickly disavowed any such pretence, and directed them to him who was so indeed; but also from sundry other Testimonies which themselves can put in no exception unto. Their own Historian tells us, that what principally moved and instigated them to undertake an unequal War with the <hi>Romans,</hi> was the <hi>ambiguity</hi> (as he thought) <hi>of the Oracle, that about that time one of their Nation should obtain the Monarchy of the world; Joseph. de Bell. Judaic. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. which he to play his own Cards, wrested unto <hi>Vespasian,</hi> who was far enough from being one of their Nation. Now <hi>Divine Oracle</hi> about the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> at that season they had none but this of <hi>Daniel.</hi> And so renowned was this <hi>Oracle</hi> in the world, that it is taken notice of by both the Famous <hi>Roman</hi> Historians, who wrote the occurrences of those dayes. <hi>Pluribus persuasio inerat antiquis Sacerdotum literis contineri, eo ipso tempore ut valesceret Oriens, praesectique Judaea, rerum potirentur;</hi> saith <hi>Tacitus, Histor. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Many had a persuasion, that there was a Prophecy in the antient sacred Books, that at that time the East should prevail, and that the Governours of</hi> Judaea <hi>should have the Empire of the world.</hi> And <hi>Suetonius,</hi> in the life of <hi>Vespasian; percrebuerat toto Oriente vetus &amp; constans opinio, ut eo tempore Judaea praesecti rerum potirentur. An an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and constant persuasion was famous all over the East, that at that time Governours of Judaea should have the Empire</hi>: and this, as he adds, drew the <hi>Jews</hi> into their Rebellion and War against the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Oracle</hi> was no other but this Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> whose accomplishment at that time the <hi>Jews</hi> all over the <hi>East</hi> expected. And they acknowledge in their <hi>Talmud,</hi> that they were made prodigiously obstinate in the War they had undertaken against the <hi>Romans,</hi> by their continual expectation every day and moment, that their Messiah who was to come about that time, would appear for their relief: For because of some expressions in this Prophecy, they alwayes looked for his coming in some time of great distress. But this through their lusts and blindness was hid from them, that their distress indeed arose from their rej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d them unto that Repentance, which alone would have prevented it. And this perswasion that the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ssiah</hi> was to come at, or about the end of <hi>Daniels Weeks,</hi> and that those <hi>weeks</hi> were now come to an end, was so fixed in their minds, that when they found, that he came not, as they thought, according unto their expectation, they attempted to make a <hi>Messiah</hi> themselves, even the famous <hi>Barcoshi,</hi> which proved the means and cause of their utter extirpation out of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as hath been declared. Thus was it with them of old, whose posterity through obstinacy in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50110:96"/>
their unbelief, do now <hi>curse</hi> all that compute the time of his coming, and confounding it with his second appearance at the end of the world, cast it off to the last day, or a small proportion of time immediately preceding it.</p>
                  <p>The Prophecy its self, (that we may return to its consideration) contains a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>25</label> of things good and desirable with those that are terrible and dreadful. That there is a prediction of things terrible and <hi>poenal</hi> in destructions and desolations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or after the close of the LXX. weeks, is both plain in the <hi>Text,</hi> and acknowledged by the <hi>Jews.</hi> That there is any thing of Mercy, Love and Grace contained in the words, some of them deny. This course takes <hi>Abarbinel</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Springs</hi> or <hi>Fountains of Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this figment is directly contrary to the whole Prophecy, the context, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words of the Text. The <hi>Vision</hi> its self was granted unto <hi>Daniel</hi> in answer unto his prayer. That the design of his solemn supplication, was to obtain Mercy and Grace for <hi>Israel</hi> is also plainly set down. The Answer is given him in a way of Mercy and Love, and for his Consolation in his great distress: And is it not strange that the Spirit of God should direct him to pray solemnly for Grace and Mercy, and give him a blessed Answer for his comfort and supportment, which should contain nothing at all of the Mercy prayed for, but only terrifie him with Wars, Desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Destructions? As such an Apprehension hath nothing in the Scripture to warrant it; so it is altogether dissonant from Reason. Besides the things mentioned and summed up, <hi>v.</hi> 24. contain the very extract of all the good things that ever were promised unto the Church from the foundation of the world; and which it had for many Ages been nourished with the expectation of. But these things will be more particularly evinced in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For the Computation its self, the <hi>Jews</hi> universally acknowledge, that the <hi>Sevens</hi>

                        </gap>adias Hagaon, Jarchi,</hi> and <hi>Kimchi</hi> on the place. Here we have no difference with them, nor others. For it were lost labour to divert unto tho consideration of the fancy of <hi>Origen,</hi> who <hi>Homil.</hi> 29. <hi>in Matthew</hi> would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But these fancies are exploded by all; both Jews and Christians are generally agreed, that the precise duration of the time determined, is four hundred and ninety years; and not to extend farther then the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Titus</hi>; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it reach so far or no, shall afterwards be discussed. That which we have to prove and establish from this Prophecy against the <hi>Jews,</hi> is, First, That the true and only <hi>Messiah</hi> promised unto the Fathers, is here spoken of; and the time of his coming limited. Secondly, That he was to come, and to discharge his work before the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>LXX weeks,</hi> or four hundred and ninety years from their proper date, that is, before the <hi>Sacrifice and Oblation</hi> were caused to cease, in the destruction of the City and Temple. These things, if we clearly evince from the <hi>Text,</hi> we have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our Argument, and confirmed that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is long since come.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> limited, which we shall afterwards enquire into. The first thing incumbent on us, is to prove, that it is the true and only <hi>Messiah,</hi> and his coming that is here spoken of. And this we shall do, (1.) From the <hi>Context</hi> and scope of the Prophecy. (2.) The <hi>Name</hi> whereby he is called. (3.) The <hi>Work</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed unto him. (4.) The <hi>general confession</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old. (5.) The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and open mistakes of the <hi>latter Jews,</hi> in substituting any other thing or Person in his stead.</p>
                  <p>First, The <hi>Context</hi> and scope of the place, evidence him to be intended. This in <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>27</label> general was before declared. It was about the greatest concernm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt of that people, that <hi>Daniel</hi> had newly made his supplications. The Answer given, him is as the Angel declar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s, suited unto his desires and requests; and it contained an account of their state and condition, untill the consummation of all things that concerned them. The <hi>End</hi> of that people, or that for whose sake they were a Church and people, was as we have demonstrated, the bringing forth of him, in whom <hi>all the Nations of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50110:97"/>
earth should blessed,</hi> Untill this was accomplished, it was impossible from the Decree and Promise of God, that they should fall under an utter rejection, or final desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this is plainly foretold, as that which should come to pass at the end of the time here determined, or instantly upon it. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>He shall cause the Oblation and Sacrifice to cease</hi>: that is utterly and everlastingly, putting thereby a period and final end unto their Church State and Worship. But what th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n shall become of the people? <hi>By a Wing of abominations he shall make them desolate</hi>; or cause them to be wasted and laid desolate, by overspreading Armies, either in themselves abominable, or abhorred by them. And in both these senses were the <hi>Roman Armies,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a Wing of Abominations.</hi> Neither was this to endure for a season only, but unto a consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole, <hi>v.</hi> 27. Now it was inconsistent with all the Promises of God, and the sole end of his wisdom, in all that he had to do with that people, that this desolation should happen before the production of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> It being therefore expresly said in the Text, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should come before all this were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, who can be intended thereby, but he who was promised unto the Fathers from the foundation of the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This whole Revelation was granted unto <hi>Daniel</hi> for his relief in the prospect that he had of the ensuing calamities of the Church; and recorded by him for the supportment thereof in those distresses, as were also those Prophecies of <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Malachi</hi> before insisted on. Now the only general Promise, which God for the consolation of his Church of old renewed unto them in all Ages, was this concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> wherein all their blessedness was enwrapped. This we have already ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested from <hi>Moses</hi> and all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who ensued in their several Generations. And he is therefore here no less intended.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What ever Benefit, Priviledge or Advantage the Church had any ground or Reason to expect from the Promises of God at the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> they are all here expressed, as we shall immediately declare. And we may truly say, that if the things mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 24. were to be wrought by any other then the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Church had much more reason to desire him, then the <hi>Messiah</hi> himself, as for any other work which remained for him to do.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Unless the <hi>Messiah</hi> and his blessed work be here intended, there is not one word of comfort or relief unto the Church in this whole Prophecy. For those who deny his coming here to be foretold, are forced violently to wrest the expressions in <hi>v.</hi> 24. unto things utterly alien and forreign from the plain and only signification of the words. And how inconsistent this is with the design of this <hi>Angelical</hi> message, we have before manifested. The <hi>context</hi> therefore evidently bespeaks the true <hi>Messiah</hi> to be here intended.</p>

                     <hi>Carcer,</hi> a Prison wherein men are put under restraint. From the similitude of Letters and Sound in Pronuntiation, some suppose it to have an affinity in signification with <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate,</hi> to end, to finish. But there is no pregnant instance of this coincidence. For although <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> do sometimes signifie to <hi>restrain or shut up,</hi> as <hi>Psalm</hi> 74. <hi>v.</hi> 11. yet <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> no where signifies to <hi>consummate, finish,</hi> or compleat. The first thing therefore promised with the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which he was to do at his coming, was to <hi>coerce</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain</hi> Transgression, to <hi>shut it up</hi> from overflowing the world so universally as it had done formerly. <hi>Trangression</hi> from the day of its first entrance into the world, had passed over the whole lower Creation like a flood. God would now set bounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, <hi>coerce and restrain it,</hi> that it should not for the future overflow mankind as it had done. This was the work of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> By his Doctrine, by his Spirit, by his Grace, and the Power of his Gospel, he set bounds to the rage of wickedness, rooted out the old Idolatry of the world, and turned millions of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> unto Righteousness. And the <hi>Jews</hi> who deny his coming, can give no instance of any other restraint laid upon the prevalency of <hi>Transgression</hi> within the time limited by the Angel, and so directly deny the Truth of the Prophecy, because they will not apply it unto him unto whom alone it doth belong.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> thing to be done at the season determined, is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; to <hi>seal,</hi> or to <hi>seal up.</hi> The expression is <hi>Metaphorical.</hi> To <hi>seal,</hi> is either to keep safe, or to hide, cover and conceal. The former can have no place here, though the word seem once to be used in that sense, with reference unto sin. <hi>Job</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 14. But this sense hath a perfect inconsistency with what is spoken imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before, and what follows directly after in the Text. And the most proper

sense of the word is to <hi>cover or conceal,</hi> and thence to seal, because thereby a thing is hidden, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 12. Now to hide sin, or transgression in the Old Testament is to <hi>pardon</hi> it, to forgive it. As then the former expression respecteth the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in this way of expression, is God said to <hi>cast our sins behind his back,</hi> to <hi>cover them,</hi> and <hi>to cast them into the bottom of the sea.</hi> That this was no way to be done but by the Messiah we have before evinced. Neither can the <hi>Jews</hi> assign any other way of the accomplishment of this part of the prediction, within the time limited.

How this was to be done by the <hi>Messiah</hi> hath been already evinced. This was that work for which he was promised unto our first Parents from the foundation of the world. That he was to do it, we are taught in the Old Testament, <hi>how</hi> he did it in the Gospel. To expect this work of making attonement for sin, from any other, or to be wrought by any other wayes or means, is fully to renounce the first promise, and the Faith of the Fathers from the foundation of the world.</p>

They had all of them respect unto the coming of the Just One, the promised seed. God had spoken of him by the mouths of his Holy Prophets from the foundation of the world. In the bringing of him forth, he <hi>sealed</hi> the Truth of their Predictions by their actual accomplishment. The <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> were untill <hi>John,</hi> and then they were to be fulfilled. This was the season wherein all <hi>Vision</hi> and <hi>Prophecy</hi> centred; this the Person who was the principal subject and End of them; He therefore and his coming is here foretold. (2.) To <hi>seal,</hi> is to finish, conclude, and put an end unto any thing: <hi>Isai.</hi> 29. <hi>v.</hi> 11. Thus also were <hi>Vision</hi> and <hi>Prophecy</hi> then <hi>sealed</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi> They were shut up and finished. The Priviledge, Use, and Benefit of them, were no more to be continued in their Church. And this also fell out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. By their own confession, from that day to this, they have not enjoyed either <hi>Vision or Prophet.</hi> That work, as unto them came wholly to an end in the coming of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> (3.) By <hi>sealing</hi> the confirmation of the Doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Messiah,</hi> his Person, and Office by <hi>Vision</hi> and <hi>Prophecy</hi> may be intended. The <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> and <hi>Prophecies</hi> that went before by reason of their darkness and obscurity, left the people in sundry particulars at great uncertainty. Now all things were cleared and confirmed. The Spirit of Prophecy accompanying the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and by him given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>Disciples</hi> foretold by <hi>Joel, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. was in his Revelations express, clear and evident, directing unto and confirming every thing belonging unto his Person and Doctrine.

It is then foretold, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> shall be <hi>cut off</hi> poenally for sin; which he was when he was made a curse for sin, all our iniquities meeting upon him.</p>
                  <p>And this also is intimated in the ensuing <hi>particles,</hi>

For, say they, he shall not be <hi>poenally cut off.</hi> But who told them so? Shall we believe the <hi>Angel</hi> or them? Will they not suffer God to send his Messiah in his own way, but they must tell him, that it must not be so? To cast off <hi>Prophecies,</hi> when and because they suit not mens carnal lusts, is to reject all Authority of God and his Word. This is that which hath proved their ruine temporal and eternal: they will not receive a <hi>Messiah</hi> that shall suffer, and be cut off for sin, though God foretold them expresly that it must be so.</p>
                  <p>It is added <hi>Seventhly,</hi> concerning the person here spoken of, and whose coming is <label type="milestone">

The great Promise whereof was the foundation of the Covenant with <hi>Abraham.</hi> And hence God sayes, that he will <hi>give him for a Covenant unto the people, Isa.</hi> 42. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 49. <hi>v.</hi> 8. And the Salvation which they looked for through him, God promiseth <hi>through the blood of the Covenant,</hi> Zech. 9. v. 11.

This everlasting Covenant was ratified in his blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 15. and after he had declared it in his own <hi>Ministry,</hi> he caused it to be proclaimed in and by his Gospel. At the time here determined, the especial <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> was broken, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 10. and they were thereon cast off from

being a Church or people. Nor was there at that season any other <hi>ratification of the Covenant,</hi> but only what was made in the death of the <hi>Messiah.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>37</label> Then also, <hi>Eighthly,</hi> did he <hi>cause to cease the Sacrifice, and Gift,</hi> or Offering. First, He caused it to <hi>cease,</hi> as unto force and efficacy, or any <hi>use in the Worship of God,</hi> by his own accomplishment of all that was prefigured by it, or intended in it. Hereby it became as a dead thing, useless, unprofitable, and made ready to <hi>disappear, Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 13. And then shortly after he caused it utterly to be taken away, by a perpetual <hi>desolation</hi> brought upon the place where alone Sacrifices and Offerings were acceptable unto God according unto the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And this is the third evidence that this Prophecy affords unto our Assertion; namely, that it is the true promised <hi>Messiah</hi> and none other, whose coming and cutting off is here foretold. The great things here mentioned were fulfilled in him alone; nor had they ever the least respect unto any other. And the <hi>Jews</hi> do not in any thing more evidently manifest the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperateness of their cause, then when they endeavour to wrest these words unto any other sense or purpose.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>38</label> Moreover, besides the confession of the <hi>Antient Jews,</hi> consenting unto the Truth contended for, we have for our confirmation therein, the wofull perplexities of their <hi>later Masters</hi> in their attempts to evade the force of this Testimony. For some Ages they have abhorred nothing more, then that the true <hi>Messiah</hi> should be thought to be here intended. For if that be once granted, they know that it brings an instant ruine unto the pretences of their Infidelity; and that not meerly upon the account of his coming, which they have invented a sorry relief against, but on that of his being <hi>poenally cut off,</hi> which can no way be reconciled unto their presumptions and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But if he be not here intended, it is incumbent on them to declare who is. For the utmost extent of the time limited in the Prediction being long since expired, the Prophecy hath certainly had accomplishment in some one or other; and it is known or may be known who; or otherwise the whole <hi>Angelical</hi> Message, never was, nor ever will be of any use to the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>But here <hi>our Masters</hi> are by no means agreed amongst themselves; nor do they know what to answer unto this enquiry. And if they do guess at any one; it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they think it possible he should be designed, but because they think it impossible for them to keep life in their cause, and not to speak when the sword of truth lyes at the heart of it. Some of them therefore affirm the <hi>Messiah</hi> spoken of to be <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom God calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>his Annointed, Isa.</hi> 45. <hi>v.</hi> 1. But what the <hi>cutting off,</hi> or death of <hi>Cyrus</hi> should make in this Prediction they know not. Nor do they endeavour to shew that any thing here mentioned to fall out with the <hi>cutting</hi> off the <hi>Messiah,</hi> hath the least Relation unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> or his death. And if because <hi>Cyrus</hi> is once called the <hi>Annointed</hi> of the Lord, he must be supposed to be intended in that place, where no one word or circumstance is applicable unto him, they may as well say, that it is <hi>Saul</hi> the first King of <hi>Israel</hi> who is spoken of, seeing he also is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 6. as was <hi>Zedekiah</hi> also, <hi>Lament.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 20. But it must needs be altogether incredible unto any, unless they are <hi>Jews</hi> who can believe what they please that serves their ends, that because the Lord calleth <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Annointed, in reference unto the especial work of destroying the <hi>Babylonian Empire,</hi> in which sense the term of <hi>annointing,</hi> namely for a designation unto any employment, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and familiar in the Old Testament, should therefore be esteemed the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> of the people of God, who is here evidently described. But that which casts this fancy beneath all consideration is the time allotted to the <hi>cutting off</hi> of the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves who begin the Account of the <hi>Weeks</hi> from the most early date imaginable, fix their <hi>Epocha</hi> in the giving of the Promise unto <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> concerning their return from captivity, which was in the dayes of <hi>Jehojakim.</hi> Now from thence unto the Death of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> no computation will allow above LXXX years; which comes short somewhat above four hundred years of the season here allotted for the <hi>cutting off</hi> the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And the same is the case with <hi>Joshua, Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> whom some of them would have to be designed. For neither were any of them <hi>poenally cut off,</hi> nor did they cause in any sense the <hi>Sacrifices to cease,</hi> but endeavoured to continue them in a due manner, nor did they live within some <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years</hi> of the time determined, nor was any thing besides here forefold, wrought, or accomplished in their days.</p>

the last King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, as they say with his son <hi>Monabasius</hi> was <hi>cut off</hi> or slaine at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Vespasian.</hi> A learned man in his <hi>Apparatus ad Origines Ecclesiasticas,</hi> mistakes this <hi>Agrippa</hi> for <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> who was <gap reason="foreign">

But he who dyed long before the destruction of the City is not intended by them, but the younger <hi>Agrippa</hi> the Brother and Husband of <hi>Berenice.</hi> Neither is there any colour of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in this Fancy. For neither was that <hi>Agrippa</hi> properly ever King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> having only <hi>Galilee</hi> under his Jurisdiction, nor was he ever <hi>annointed</hi> to be their King, nor designed of God unto any work on the account whereof he might be called his <hi>Annointed,</hi> nor was he of the posterity of <hi>Israel,</hi> nor did by any thing deserve an illustrious mention in this Prophecy. Besides in the last fatal War, he was still of the <hi>Roman</hi> side and party, nor was he cut off or slain by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> but after the War lived at <hi>Rome</hi> in honour, and dyed in peace. Yea, he did not only out-live <hi>Vespasian,</hi> but <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> his Sons also, and continued unto the third year of <hi>Trajan,</hi> as <hi>Justus</hi> the <hi>Tiberian</hi> assures us in his <hi>History,</hi> whose words are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Photius</hi> in his <hi>Bibliotheca.</hi> So that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, there is nothing of Truth, no colour of probability in this desperate figment.</p>
                  <p>Their last evasion is, that by <hi>Messiah the Prince,</hi> the Office of <hi>Magistracy</hi> and <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>40</label> and in them all <hi>annointed</hi> unto Authority are intended. These they say were to be <hi>cut off</hi> in the destruction of the City. And herein they have the consent of <hi>Africanus, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> among the Antients, who are also fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by some later Writers. But this evasion also is of the same nature with the former, yea, more vain then they, if any thing may be allowed so to be. The <hi>Angel</hi> twice mentioneth the <hi>Messiah</hi> in his message. First, His coming and <hi>annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> v. 25. and then his <hi>cutting off,</hi> v. 26. If the same person or thing be not intended in both places, the whole Discourse is <hi>aequivocal</hi> and unintelligible, no circumstance being added to difference between them, who are called by the same Name in the same place. And to suppose that the Holy Ghost by one and the <hi>same Name,</hi> within a few words, continuing his speech of the same matter without any note of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or distinction, should signifie things diverse from one another, is to leave no place for the understanding of any thing that is spoken by him. The Messiah therefore who was to come, and be <hi>annointed</hi> and <hi>cut off,</hi> is one and the same individual person. Now it is expresly said, that there shall be <hi>seven Weeks,</hi> and <hi>sixty two Weeks,</hi> that is four hundred eighty three years <hi>from the going forth of the Decree unto Messiah the Prince.</hi> I desire therefore to know whether that space of time was passed before they had any such <hi>Magistrates</hi> or <hi>Priests,</hi> as they pretend af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards were <hi>cut off</hi>: This is so far from Truth, that before that time, the Rule of the <hi>Hasmonaeans,</hi> the last Supream Magistrates of their own Nation, was put to an end. This pretence therefore may pass with the former. And this perplexity of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> Jews in their attempts to apply this Prophecy unto any other thing or person besides the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> confirms our Exposition and Application of it. There is no other person that they can imagine, unto whom any one thing here mentioned, may seem to belong; much less can they think of any, in whom they should all center and agree. It is then the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> the hope and expectation of the Fathers, whose <hi>coming</hi> and <hi>cutting off,</hi> is here foretold.</p>
                  <p>That which remains for the full confirmation of our Argument from this place,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>41</label> is, that according unto this Prophecy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After <hi>VII. Weeks,</hi> and <hi>LXXII Weeks,</hi> that is, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or middle of the <hi>last Week,</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be cut off. When this was past, and the <hi>Covenant confirmed</hi> with many, unto the expiration of the whole time limited, the <hi>daily Sacrifice</hi> was to cease, and an <hi>overflowing desolation</hi> was to come upon the City and Temple. This the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves acknowledge to be the destruction brought upon them by the <hi>Romans</hi>; nor do any of them extend the four hundred and ninety years, any farther. It remains therefore that the <hi>Messiah</hi> came before that Desolation, which is that we undertook to <hi>demonstrate</hi> from this place.</p>
                  <p>There are yet some Arguments to the same purpose with those foregoing that <label type="milestone">

remain. But before we proceed unto them, it will be necessary to consider the <hi>Computation of the times,</hi> which we are here directed unto by the <hi>Angel.</hi> I have already manifested that <hi>our Argument</hi> from this place is not concerned in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act <hi>Chronological Computation</hi> of the time here limited, as to its precise Beginning and Ending, with the <hi>commensuration</hi> of it, unto the times, seasons, and accounts of the Nations of the world. For when ever the time mentioned <hi>began,</hi> all men agree that it is long since expired, namely, at or before the desolation of the City and Temple. Now all that we undertook to prove, which also is sufficient unto our present purpose, is, that before that season the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to come, and to be <hi>cut off,</hi> which we have done, and cleared our <hi>Argument</hi> from all further concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this account. But yet that it may appear, that there is no entanglement cast upon this <hi>Testimony,</hi> by the <hi>Chronological</hi> difficulties which are pretended in the computation of the time here determined, as also that there are no such difficulties therein, but what are fairly reconcileable unto all that is affirmed in the Text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed to the consideration of our remaining <hi>Arguments,</hi> they also shall be considered and stated in the ensuing <hi>Exercitation.</hi>

The first is by the <hi>Syrian,</hi> or <hi>Aera</hi> of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> which takes its date from the tenth year after the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> when after some bloody contests, <hi>Seleucus</hi> setled his Kingdom in <hi>Syria,</hi> and reigned thirty years. After him reigned <hi>Antiochus Soter</hi> twenty one years, <hi>Antiochus Theos</hi> fifteen, <hi>Seleucus Callinicus</hi> twenty, <hi>Seleucus Ceraunus</hi> two, <hi>Antiochus Magnus</hi> thirty seven, <hi>Seleucus Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopater</hi> twelve, <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> twelve, <hi>Eupator</hi> two, <hi>Dementrius Soter</hi> ten. In the second year of this <hi>Demetrius,</hi> which was the 153d. of the account of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> was <hi>Judas Macchabaeus</hi> slain, being the one hundred sixty ninth year after the death of <hi>Darius Codomanus,</hi> or end of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, allowing six years to the reign of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ten more to the beginning of the Kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae.

For <hi>Jonathan</hi> began his Rule in the second year of the one hundred fifty seventh <hi>Olympiad,</hi> as may be seen, by adding the <hi>Seleucian Aera</hi> to the one hundred and fourteenth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> wherein <hi>Alexander</hi> dyed; and our Lord Christ was born in the second year of the one hundred ninety fourth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> in the last year, or the last save one of <hi>Herod</hi> the great. This summ of one hundred forty eight years, being added to the fore-mentioned, from the beginning of the Empire of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which is three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty one years, makes up in all five hundred twenty nine years. From the Birth of our Lord Christ in the second year of the one hundred ninety fourth <hi>Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad,</hi> to the destruction of the City and Temple, in the third year of the two hundred and eleventh <hi>Olympiad,</hi> are seventy years; which makes up the whole summ before mentioned of five hundred ninety nine years, from the first of the Empire of <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:50110:102"/>
unto the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem. Petavius</hi> and our <hi>Mountacue</hi> reckon from the first of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> unto the eighteenth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> wherein our Lord Christ suffered five hundred ninety four years, which differs very little from the account we have insisted on: For take from them twenty seven years of the reign of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> before the first of his Empire, and add unto them thirty seven for the continuance of the City and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after the death of Christ, and the summ remaining will exceed our account only four years, or five at the most.</p>
                  <p>But the computation we have fixed on, being every way consistent with it self, and the stated <hi>Aeras</hi> of the Nations, and abridging the time to the shortest size that will endure the tryall, we shall abide by it.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>10</label> We shall first consider the <hi>End</hi> of them, which being clear in the Prophecy will regulate, fix, and state the beginning. Two things in general are insisted on in this Prophecy. (1.) The coming of <hi>Messiah</hi> the Prince, his annointing unto the work which he had to do, and his cutting off, as we before declared. (2.) The Ceasing of the <hi>daily Sacrifice,</hi> with the destruction of the City and Temple by War and a flood of desolations. Now these things happened not at the same time; for the City and Sanctuary were destroyed thirty seven years after the cutting off, or death of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> We are to enquire therefore, which of these it was that the time menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned was determined for, and was to expire withall. Now it is the coming, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing and cutting off of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that is the thing chiefly intended in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. This we have proved undeniably before; manifesting that the <hi>Vision</hi> was granted unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> and given out by him for the consolation of himself and the Church, as was the way of the Holy Ghost in all his dealings with the Fathers of old: Hereunto the desolation and destruction of the City and Temple was only a consequent, a thing that should follow and ensue on what was principally foretold and promised. And it is doubtless unreasonable to extend the duration of the time, beyond the principal subject matter treated of, and on the account whereof alone the computation is granted, unto that which is only <hi>occasionally</hi> mentioned as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of the accomplishment of the Prophecy it self. Besides the computation it self is pointed directly by the Angel unto the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and his cutting off. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, Know therefore, that from the going forth of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unto Messiah the Prince shall be,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And after sixty two weeks shall Messiah be cut off.</hi> But there is no guidance or direction of the time limited unto the desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the City and <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> which is only said to ensue thereon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is expresly said, that the time limited extends it self only unto the death of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or a very few years farther. For he was to come after seven weeks and sixty two weeks, which are the whole time limited within one week or seven of years. Now his coming here intended, is not his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> but the time of his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> in his <hi>Baptism,</hi> which fell out at the end of sixty nine weeks. After these sixty nine weeks, or seven, and sixty two, he is to be cut off; that is in the middle or towards the end of the last week; when he had confirmed the Covenant by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three years and an half of that seven years which remained. And if we shall say that his Unction being to be after the seven weeks, and sixty two, we must grant it to be in the first or second year of the last week, whereunto add the three years and an half of his Preaching, and the remnant Fraction of one year or two can no way disturb the account, there being nothing more frequent, then the casting in of such parcels of time to compleat and fill up an entire and round number. Here then must we fix the end of four hundred and ninety years, in the death of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and so wholly lay aside the account of them, who would extend the time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined unto the desolation of the City and Temple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>11</label> We must therefore in the first place; abate from the whole account of five hundred ninety nine <hi>years</hi> before stated, the summ of thirty seven <hi>years,</hi> which ensued after the death of our Saviour, untill the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; and the remnant is five
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50110:102"/>
hundred sixty two years. Now five hundred sixty two years exceeds the number of four hundred ninety stated in <hi>Daniels</hi> Vision, seventy two years. It appears then, that the beginning and ending of the seventy Weeks, cannot be the Decree of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the death of our Saviour; there being seventy two years between them, more then the Weeks contain, or can be extended unto. The end we have already fixed from the Text, and therefore it doth not appear that their <hi>date</hi> and rise can be taken from the Decree of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Sundry things are offered to disintangle us from this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                  <p>The most learned <hi>Reynolds</hi> in his <hi>Praelaections</hi> on the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, allowing our account above-mentioned, as to the substance of it, especially that which concerneth the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, about which alone there is any considerable difference, resolves yet at length, that the number of <hi>seventy Weeks,</hi> which is a round compleat number, is put for an uncertain number, thereabouts, more or less, over or under, not much vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it. And on this supposition, he dates the beginning of the Weeks in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> To confirm his opinion, he giveth sundry instances of this kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the Scripture, and contends that the particular reason of limiting the whole time unto <hi>seventy Weeks,</hi> was to make it answer unto the <hi>seventy years</hi> captivity that immediately preceded it. The time to follow being declared to be just seven times as much.</p>
                  <p>This Interpretation of words, might it be admitted, would, I confess, solve all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>12</label> and entirely preserve the sacred and <hi>prophane</hi> accounts from all appearance of enterfering. But there are two reasons, upon the account whereof I cannot assent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. The first is, because indeed there is no other instance in the Scripture to give countenance unto it; namely, wherein a number of years coming so far short of the true and exact account, as this doth, is yet put for the whole; especially considering this number is given out for this very purpose, that men might aright compute it, and so come to know the time of its expiration. But to name 490, for 562, seems rather to be a conjecture, then a Prophecy. This may then be the condition of some few <hi>odd</hi> years, that may be cast in unto a full round number, but of so considerable a part of the whole as 72 is, there is no reason to suppose it so disposed of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The word used by the <hi>Angel</hi> to express the limitation of this time <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> plainly proves that a <hi>precise duration</hi> of time, and number of years is signified. The <hi>Vulgar Latine</hi> renders that word <hi>abbreviate,</hi> shortned, or cut short. And a learned man of our own approves of that interpretation of it, in opposition unto our own Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that of <hi>Junius. De annis</hi> (saith he) <hi>porro loquitur signanter Propheta quod sint, non decisi,</hi> (as <hi>Junius</hi>) <hi>non determinati</hi> (as ours) <hi>apud Deum statuti,</hi> (<hi>quod tamen verum erat</hi>) <hi>sed quod erant abbreviati quemadmodum transtulit doctissimus interpres vetus. Mon. App. ad Orig. Eccl.</hi> And thereon disputes at large, how the years are said to be <hi>shortned</hi>; and yet concludes, <hi>dicuntur autem abbreviatae hebdomadae, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o quod erant decisae &amp; determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natae</hi>; as though <hi>shortned</hi> or abbreviated was the proper sense of the word, only it might be interpreted <hi>determined</hi>; or that the daies are said to <hi>be shortned,</hi> because they were <hi>determined.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the truth is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
doth not signifie to <hi>abbreviate</hi> or make short; and all the reason given to shew why the times here are said to be <hi>shortned,</hi> are perfectly cast away. It is in <hi>this place only</hi> used in the Scripture, and that in the <hi>singular</hi> number joyned with a Noun of the <hi>plural,</hi> to intimate that <hi>every week</hi> of the whole number was <hi>limited</hi> and determined, and cut out, as is usual in the Hebrews.

A portion of time <hi>cut out,</hi> limited and apportioned unto the end, for the accomplishment of the work fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told. Now there is nothing more contrary unto a precise determination of time, then that a <hi>certain</hi> number of years should be named to signifie an <hi>uncertain,</hi> and that so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding distant from the exact account, as 490 years are from 562. So that here is no place for the conjecture of that <hi>most learned</hi> and renowned person.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> take another course to solve this difficulty, as also to give some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>13</label> unto their computation, in dating the weeks from the destruction of the Temple by the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> and ending them in the desolation of the second house, by the <hi>Romans</hi>; for they will allow no more Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> then are mentioned in the Scripture, nor that they reigned any longer then they find mention therein of the years of their Reign: As though whether they did good or evil towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> it was
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50110:103"/>
fatal unto them; so that they must needs die immediately upon it. Thus they allow not above four or five Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> at most, and thereby take in the duration of that Empire from two hundred years and upwards, unto fifty years at the most. But this supposition stands in open contradiction to all generally allowed computation of time in the world: And not only so, but it excludes all considerations of things done, as notorious to mankind, as that ever there was such a thing as the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire. Of this nature are the transactions and wars with other Nations, especially the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> which fell not out in the daies of any of the Kings mentioned in the Scripture; especially that famous expedition of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> which the whole world looked on, and waited for its event. And yet I acknowledge that this imagination might deserve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, could it pretend that the Books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did intentionally give us an account and History of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, and the Reign of the Kings thereof, as some Books do of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> But whereas it is evident, that their design being quite otherwise, and that they only occasionally mention <hi>some</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> and <hi>some years</hi> of their Reign, as they related unto the state and actions of the people of the <hi>Jews</hi>: It is no less madness and folly to contend from thence, that there were no more Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> then are mentioned in them, and that they reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no longer then is in them expressed, then it would be to say that there were never above three or four Kings of the <hi>Assyrian Empire,</hi> because there are no more mentioned in the Scripture, and so many of them are spoken of: This <gap reason="foreign">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>14</label> Others there are, men learned and pious, who resolving to date these Weeks from the first of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and to make 490 years the exact measure of the time from thence unto the death of <hi>Messiah,</hi> and not being able to disprove the computation from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> unto that time, fall also upon the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, and cut it short above <hi>fifty years</hi> of the true account of its duration, to fit it unto the place and measure provided for it. To this end, they reject the accounts of the <hi>Chaldaeans, Graecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time of its continuance, as fabulous, and give us a new arbitrary account of the Reign of these Kings whom they will allow.</p>
                  <p>This course steers <hi>Beroaldus, Broughton, Genebrard,</hi> and <hi>Willet,</hi> with sundry others. And the truth is, were the supposition once cleared, that the Decree or Commandment mentioned by <hi>Gabriel,</hi> must needs be given out by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> there were some colour for offering of this violence, unto all <hi>consent of time,</hi> with account of things done, written by men prudent and sober in their own daies. But this is so far from being a basis or foundation sufficient to warrant such a procedure, that take it nakedly of it self without the burden upon it, and it is destitute of all probability. The <hi>word,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or Commandment mentioned unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> is that for the building of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>; that is the <hi>restoring</hi> of it into a condition of rule and government; that is the building of a City, and not only the setting up of houses. Consequent unto this, there <hi>building of the walls</hi> also for the defence of the people is mentioned. Of this it is said, that it should fall out in a <hi>troublesome time,</hi> or a time of streights, as accordingly it did fall out in the daies of <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> In the whole there is not the least mention of <hi>building the Temple,</hi> which had it been intended, could not I suppose have been omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But in the <hi>Decree of Cyrus,</hi> the principal thing mentioned and aimed at, is the re-edification of the Temple, the <hi>Citie</hi> and the <hi>Walls</hi> thereof being not spoken of in it, as may be seen in the first of <hi>Ezra</hi> at large.</p>
                  <p>It seems then evident, that the Decree mentioned by <hi>Daniel</hi> for the building of the <hi>Citie</hi> and <hi>Walls,</hi> not the Temple, and that given out by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for the building of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and not the Citie and Walls, were divers. Besides this Decree of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though foretold long before, and made famous because it was the <hi>entrance</hi> into the peoples return and settlement, yet it took effect for so short a space of time, being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed within less then three years, and utterly frustrated within four or five, that it is not likely to be the date of this Prophecy, which seems to take place from some good settlement of the people. That alone which is pleaded with any colour for this Decree of <hi>Cyrus</hi> is the praediction recorded, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.28. It is prophesied of him, that he should <hi>say</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem, thou shalt be built, and to the Temple, thy foundations shall be laid:</hi> But yet neither is it here foretold that <hi>Cyrus</hi> should make any Decree for the building of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; or that it should be done in his daies, as indeed it was not until an <hi>hundred years</hi> after, as it is evident from the story in <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> The whole intention of this Prophecy, is only that he should cause the people to be set at liberty from their captivity, and give them leave to return to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which he did accordingly,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50110:103"/>
and thereupon both the building of the City and Temple ensued, though not without the intervention of other <hi>Decrees</hi>; of which afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The only Argument wherewith this opinion of the duration of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>15</label> not above one hundred and fifty years at the most, maintains it self, is taken from the life and age of <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> In <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 2. he is reckoned among them that came up with <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> unto <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the first year of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Then he may rationally be supposed to have been at least twenty or twenty five years of age. And it seems from the last Chapter of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that he lived unto the reign of <hi>Darius Codomanus</hi>: for <hi>Sanballat</hi> the <hi>Hornoite</hi> assisted <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Wars. And <hi>Jaddua</hi> whom he mentions <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.11. was High Priest, when <hi>Alexander</hi> came to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as appears from <hi>Josephus.</hi> Now if the <hi>Persian Empire</hi> continued for the space of two hundred years, which we have allotted unto it, then he who went to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the first year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and continued unto the reign of <hi>Codomanus,</hi> must needs live two hundred and twenty years at the least, which is not credible, that any one should do in those dayes. And therefore the space of time must needs be shorter then is pretended, at least fifty or sixty years. But indeed there is no force in this exception. For First, There is no necessity why we should conclude that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> wrote that <hi>Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, Chap.</hi> 12. where mention is made of <hi>Jaddua,</hi> who was afterwards High Priest, <hi>v.</hi> 11. for he ends his story in the High Priesthood of <hi>Eliashib, Chap.</hi> 13.28. who was Great Grand-father unto <hi>Jaddua,</hi> as appears, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.10, 11. Or however if he did, <hi>Jaddua</hi> might then be a Child, and it may be not come unto the <hi>High-Priesthood</hi> untill fifty or sixty years after; after the death of <hi>Eliashib, Joiada,</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> his Great Grand-Father, Grand-Father, and Father. So that no evidence can be taken from hence for the continuance of his life unto the end of the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="2">(2.) There is no reason to think that the <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> mentioned <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 2. who came up with <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> was that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> who was afterwards Governour of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and whose actions we have written probably the most part by himself, no more then there is to think that the <hi>Seraiah</hi> there mentioned, was the <hi>Seraiah</hi> that was slain at the taking of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> The <hi>Daniel</hi> mentioned, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.2. was not <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet, nor <hi>Baruch,</hi> Nehem. 10.6. that <hi>Baruch</hi> who was the Scribe of <hi>Jeremiah</hi>: nor that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> mentioned, <hi>Neh.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Ezra</hi> is said to come up with <hi>Zerubbabel, Nehem.</hi> 12.1. which either must not be that <hi>Ezra</hi> the great Scribe, or he must be said to come up with <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> because he followed him on the same errand and account. It cannot be denyed, but that there were sundry men at the same time of the same name; as the same person had sundry names, much more might several men have the same name in successive generations. Thus after <hi>Joshua</hi> was High Priest, there was another <hi>Joshua</hi> chief of the Levites, <hi>Neh.</hi> 12.7, 8. And that about this time there were two <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> one of the house of <hi>Nathan,</hi> the other of the posterity of <hi>Solomon,</hi> we shall make it appear in the consideration of the <hi>Genealogies</hi> of <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi> (3.) That this was not the <hi>Nehemiah</hi> that went up with <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> the sacred story it self gives us sufficient evidence. For (1.) He was ignorant of the state and condition of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> when he lived in the Court of <hi>Persia, Chap.</hi> 1. had he been there before, and seen their condition, and but newly returned unto <hi>Shushan,</hi> he could not have been so surprized as he was <hi>ver.</hi> 4. upon the account then given him thereof. (2.) <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. He speaks of it as a great matter, that he should find a <hi>Roll</hi> or <hi>Register</hi> of them that came first up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> amongst whom that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was one. Now if this had been himself, what reason had he to mention it as a great discovery, which he could not but by his own knowledge be full well acquainted withall. Unto what time soever then the <hi>period</hi> of his life was extended, there is no colour to surmise, that he was amongst them who returned from captivity in the dayes of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>

opinion that <hi>Xerxes</hi> was the Husband of <hi>Hester,</hi> about fifty years before the Reign of <hi>Nothus.</hi> When it is not likely but the <hi>Jews</hi> would have attempted, and not have been denied their liberty of going on with their work.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it consistent with the Prophecy of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that the Temple should lye waste so long a space, that is about a hundred and seventy years. Again, <hi>Haggai</hi> doth plainly declare, that when the work of the Temple was carrying on in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year of <hi>Darius,</hi> that many were yet alive, who had seen the first Temple, <hi>cap.</hi> 2.3. As multitudes were upon the laying of its foundation in the dayes of <hi>Cyrus, Ezra</hi> 3.12. And this was impossible, had it been in the dayes of <hi>Nothus,</hi> an hundred and sixty, or an hundred and seventy years after it was destroyed. And <hi>Scaliger</hi> doth plainly wrest the words of the Text, when he would have them pronounced by way of <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; if any were then alive who saw the first house in its glory</hi>: for <hi>Haggai</hi> doth plainly relate unto the <hi>distemper</hi> of the people upon the laying of the foundation of the house mentioned in the forenamed place of <hi>Ezra</hi>; and the words themselves will bear no other sense; <gap reason="foreign">

Moreover that <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> in whose daies <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> went up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was <hi>Longimanus,</hi> who reigned before <hi>Nothus,</hi> and not <hi>Memor,</hi> who succeeded him, as will afterwards appear: Now this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was long after that <hi>Darius,</hi> upon whose warranty the building of the Temple was finished, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.1. Which certainly could not be <hi>Nothus</hi> who was his successor.</p>
                  <p>It appears then that <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> was not the Author of the Decree mentioned, as <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>19</label> also that the times of the Weeks cannot be dated from the second year of <hi>Darius Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staspes,</hi> who was the Author of it.</p>
                  <p>After this, there is mention made of two other Commands or Decrees relating to the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>20</label> Temple and People, both granted by the same <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> one in the seventh year of his Reign unto <hi>Ezra,</hi> chap. 7.7. The other in the twentieth year of his Reign, unto <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> chap. 2.1. And from one of these must the account enquired after be dated. Now, supposing that one of these Decrees must be intended, it is evident that it was <hi>Longimanus,</hi> and not <hi>Memor,</hi> who was the Author of them: For from the seventh year of <hi>Memor,</hi> which was the second of the <hi>ninety fifth Olympiad,</hi> unto the eighteenth year of <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> wherein our Saviour suffered, being the third year of the two hundred and second <hi>Olympiad,</hi> are only four hundred twenty eight years, sixty two years short of the whole, or four hundred and ninety. Now these sixty two years added to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the account, from the seventh of <hi>Memor,</hi> fall in exactly on the seventh of <hi>Longimanus</hi>; from the seventh of <hi>Longimanus</hi> then to the seventh of <hi>Memor</hi> are sixty two years, and from the seventh of <hi>Memor</hi> to the eighteenth of <hi>Tiberius</hi> are four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred twenty eight years, in the whole, four hundred and ninety. The whole number enquired after.</p>
                  <p>It was then this Decree of <hi>Longimanus,</hi> that was intended by the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi>: for <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>21</label> from the seventh year, wherein he sent <hi>Ezra</hi> unto <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and unto that work which he afterwards commissionated <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to carry on and perfect, unto the cutting off of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> are exactly <hi>seventy Weeks,</hi> or four hundred and ninety years, as may appear from the accounts formerly insisted on and declared: From the first of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> supposing him to reign but three years over the whole Empire, unto the death of Christ, there was, as we have proved, five hundred sixty two years: From the first of the same <hi>Cyrus,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the seventh of <hi>Longimanus,</hi> were seventy two years, which being deducted from the whole of five hundred sixty two years, the remainder is four hundred and ninety; which space of time, how it was apportioned between the <hi>Persian, Graecian, Hasmonaean, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodian,</hi> and <hi>Roman Rule,</hi> we have before declared.</p>
                  <p>And there wants not reason to induce us to fix on this <hi>Decree,</hi> rather than any other,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>22</label> being indeed the most famous, and most useful to the people of all the rest. By what means it was obtained, is not recorded. Evident it is that <hi>Ezra</hi> had great favour with the King, and that he had convinced him of the greatness and power of that God whom he served, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.22. Besides, it was not a meer <hi>proclamation of liberty,</hi> like that of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which was renewed by <hi>Darius</hi>; but a Decree, a Law made by the <hi>King and his seven Counsellors, chap.</hi> 7.14. The highest and most irrefragable <hi>Legislative</hi> Power amongst the <hi>Medes and Persians.</hi> Moreover, with the Decree he had a formal <hi>Commission,</hi> where he is said not only to have <hi>leave</hi> to go, but to be <hi>sent</hi> by the <hi>King and his Council.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the former Decrees barely respected the <hi>Temple</hi>; and it seems that in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of them, the people had done little more then built the <hi>bare fabrick,</hi> all things as to the true order of the Worship of God remaining in great confusion, and the civil state utterly neglected. But now in this <hi>Commission</hi> of <hi>Ezra,</hi> he is not only directed to set the whole Worship of God in order, at the charge of the King, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. But also that he should appoint and erect a <hi>Civil Government</hi> and Magistracy with supreme power over the <hi>lives,</hi> liberties, and estate of men, to be exercised as occasion required, <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. Which alone, and no other, was the <hi>building of the City</hi> mentioned by <hi>Gabriel</hi>; for it is not walls and houses, but <hi>Policy,</hi> Rule and Government, that makes and constitutes a City.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>23</label> And it is very considerable what a conviction of the <hi>necessity</hi> of this work, was then put upon the spirits of the Governours of the <hi>Persian Empire</hi>; for the King himself he calls <hi>Ezra</hi> the <hi>Scribe of the Law of the God of Heaven,</hi> owning him therein for the <hi>true God</hi>; for he who is the God of Heaven, is God alone, all others are but the <hi>dunghill</hi> gods of the Earth, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Again, he declares that he was perswaded, that if this work was not done, <hi>there would be wrath from Heaven upon himself, his Kingdom, and his Son,</hi> v. 23, The <hi>seven Counsellors</hi> they joyn in that Law, <hi>v.</hi> 14. And the <hi>mighty Princes</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom assisted <hi>Ezra</hi> in his work, <hi>v.</hi> 28.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>1</label> considerations taken from the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves, that are both suitable unto their conviction, and of use to strengthen the faith of them who do believe. And the first thing that offers its self unto us, is their miserable <hi>fluctuation</hi> and uncertainty in the whole Doctrine about the <hi>Messiah</hi> ever since the time of his coming and their rejection of him.</p>
                  <p>That the great <hi>fundamentall</hi> of their profession from the dayes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> which all their Worship was founded in, and had respect unto, was the promise of the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> we have before sufficiently proved. Untill the time of his coming, this they were unanimous in, as also in their desires and expectations of his Advent. Since that time, as they have utterly lost all faith in him, as to the great end for which he was promised, so all truth as to the Doctrine concerning his Person, Office and Work plentifully delivered in the Old Testament.</p>
                  <p>In their <hi>Talmud. Tractat. Sanedr.</hi> they do nothing but wrangle, conjecture and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about him, and that under such notions and apprehensions of him as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture giveth no countenance unto. When he shall come, and how, where he shall be born, and what he shall do, they wrangle much about, but are not able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any thing at all; at which uncertaintie, the Holy Ghost never left the Church in things of so great importance. Hence some of them adhered to <hi>Barcosby</hi> for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> a bloody Rebel; and some of them in after ages to <hi>David el David</hi> a wandring Jugler, and <hi>Moses Cretensis,</hi> and sundry other pretenders have they given up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be deluded by (as of late unto the foolish Apostate <hi>Sabadia</hi> with his false Prophets, <hi>R.

(1.) For the <hi>Countrey</hi> given unto them by <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the place of Gods Worship therein, the whole world knows, and themselves continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that strangers possess it, they being utterly extirpated and cast out of it.

Their daily Sacrifice is ceased, and whatever they substitute in the room of it, is an open abomination unto the Lord. We need not insist on these things. The Stories of their ruine, exile, vain attempts to recover their Land, of their Fore-fathers, of the utter pollution of the places of their <hi>Worship</hi> are known to themselves, and all men that take care to know ought of these things. Where is now the Covenant of the Land of <hi>Canaan?</hi> Was it to be absolutely everlasting? Whence comes it to pass, that the great promise

What period can be assigned unto its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but only that of the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> and the establishment of a New Covenant in him?

There is not a known Nation in the world, wherein they live not, either openly or privately, in Exile and Banishment from their own Land. About their oppressions, and against their Oppressors they have cryed out, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after their manner for many Generations. Where is the protection, the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance promised? if the time be not yet expired for the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> why are they not delivered? What word is there in the Law, or the Prophets, that they shall not be delivered out of Temporal distresses any other way but by the <hi>Messiah?</hi> hath it not been otherwise with them? Were they not delivered from former Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Captivities, by other means? Could not God of old have dispossessed the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and afterwards the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and can he not now the <hi>Turks,</hi> as easily as he did the <hi>Babylonians, Persians</hi> and <hi>Graecians?</hi> If the Covenant of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises be not expired in the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> what account can they give of these things?</p>
                  <p>Further, where are the <hi>Prophets,</hi> promised unto them? can they name one since the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>7</label> daies of a <hi>John Baptist,</hi> whom they owned for a Prophet? hath any one amongst them pretended to any such thing, whom the event, and themselves thereon have not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be an Impostor? Such was <hi>Theudas,</hi> and <hi>Moses Cretensis,</hi> with some few others. Is it not strange, that they who never long wanted a <hi>Prophet</hi> in their streights and difficulties, and sometimes had many of them together, should now in their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most misery, wandrings and darkness, be left utterly destitute of any one for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand six hundred years, and upwards? It is the general confession of all their Masters, that they have left the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or Spirit of Prophecy. After the finishing of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple, they say, and they say truly, that Prophecy ceased. <gap reason="foreign">

Is not all pretence of Revelations utterly departed? what then is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of that <hi>Covenant</hi> wherein it was promised unto them? yea we know that they have not only left the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as a spirit of <hi>Prophecy</hi>; but also as a spirit of <hi>grace</hi> and supplications; so that besides a few <hi>superstitious forms</hi> repeated by number and tale; there is no such thing as prayer amongst them; as some of their late Masters have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</p>
                  <p>What reason now can be assigned of this state and condition of things, but only <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>8</label> that the <hi>Covenant</hi> wherein the good things mentioned were promised unto them, had a time limited unto it, when it was to give place unto a <hi>new</hi> one of another nature. And this the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledge is to take date from the coming of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> God is faithful, unchangeable, able to make good his promises and his word to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most. The present <hi>Jews</hi> are no less <hi>Jews</hi> of the carnal seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then their forefathers were. It cannot be then but that the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with them, until the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is long since expired. And therefore also, that he is long since come.</p>
                  <p>Two things in general, the <hi>Jews</hi> reply unto these considerations, the one, as they <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>9</label> have occasion and advantage, the other, openly and constantly: The first which they only mention, as they have occasion, is the <hi>prosperity</hi> of some of their Nation in this or that Country, with the honour and riches, that some of them have attained unto. Unto this purpose, they tell us stories of their number and wealth in the <hi>East,</hi> out of <hi>Benjamin Tudulensis</hi> and others, with the riches of some of them in the <hi>Western</hi> parts of the world also. But themselves know that none of these things, not one of them, was promised unto them in the Covenant that God made with them upon Mount <hi>Horeb.</hi> All the promises of it respected the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with their preservation there, or return thither. What they get abroad in the world, elsewhere under the power and dominion of other Nations, befalls them in a way of common providence, as the like things do the vilest wretches of the earth, and not in a way of any especial promise. And therefore when <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> with others, were exalted unto
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50110:107"/>
glory and riches among the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> yet they rested not therein, but pleaded the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God for their restauration unto the Land promised unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> And to suppose that the wealth of a few <hi>Jews</hi> up and down the world, gotten by <hi>Physick,</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sury,</hi> or <hi>farming of Customs,</hi> is an accomplishment of the promises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore insisted on, is openly to despise the promises, and the Author of them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>10</label> But it is pleaded, <hi>secondly,</hi> by them, That it is for their sins that the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> is thus retarded and prolonged. But it is not about the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> directly and immediately, that they are pressed withall in these considerations; that which we enquire about, is their present state, and their long continuance therein, with the reason of it; only aiming to find out and discover the true cause thereof: This, they say, is <hi>because of their sins</hi>; and this also in general we grant, But yet must further enquire, what they intend thereby: I ask therefore whether it be for the <hi>sins of their forefathers,</hi> who lived before the last final dispersion, or for <hi>their sins,</hi> who have since lived in their several Generations, that they are thus utterly forsaken. If they shall say, it is for the sins of their forefathers, as <hi>Manasseh</hi> plainly doth, <hi>Quest.</hi> 43. in <hi>Gen. p.</hi> 65. And sundry others of them do the same, then I desire to know whether they think God to be <hi>changed</hi> from what he was of old, or whether he be not still every way the same as to all the promises of the Covenant; supposing they will say that he is still the same, I desire to know whether he did not in former times, in the daies of their Judges and Kings, especially in the <hi>Babylonian Captivity</hi> punish them for their sins, with that contemperation of Justice and mercy, which was agreeable unto the Tenor of the Covenant? This I suppose they will not deny, the Scripture speaking so fully unto it, and the Righteousness of God requiring it. I desire then to know what were the <hi>sins of their forefathers,</hi> before the destruction of the second Temple, and your final dispersion, which so much, according to the Rules of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> exceeded the sins of them who lived before the desolation of the first Temple, and the captivity that ensued; for we know that the sins of those former were punished only with a dispersion, which some of them saw the beginning and ending of; the duration of the whole of it not exceeding seventy years, after which they were returned again to their own Land.</p>
                  <p>But the captivity and dispersion which hath befallen them upon the sins of those who lived before the destruction of the second Temple, as they were in their manner and entrance much more terrible, dreadful and tremendious then the former; so they have now continued in them above <hi>twenty times seventy years</hi> without any promise of a recovery. God being still the same that he was, if the Old <hi>Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Jews</hi> be still in force. The difference between this dispensation must arise from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the sins of the one sort of persons, and the other. Now of all the sins, which on the general account of the Law of God, the sons of men can make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves guilty of, <hi>Idolatry</hi> doubtless is the greatest: The choosing of <hi>other Gods</hi> is a compleat renunciation of the true one. And therefore comprised in it all other sins what ever, for casting off the yoke of God, and our dependance on him as the first cause, and last end of all, it doth that in gross, and by whole-sale, which other sins do only by retail; and therefore is this sin forbidden in the head of the Law, as intimating, that if the command of owning the true God, and him alone, be not adhered unto, it is to no purpose to apply our selves unto them that follow. Now it is known to all that this sin of <hi>Idolatry</hi> abounded amongst them under the <hi>first Temple,</hi> and that also for a long continuance, attended with <hi>Violence, Adulteries, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution</hi> and Oppression, but that those under the second Temple had contracted the guilt of <hi>this sin,</hi> the present <hi>Jews</hi> do not pretend; and we know that they hated all appearance of it. Nor are they able to assign any other sins what ever, wherein they went higher in their provocations, then their <hi>Progenitors</hi> under the first Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. What then is the cause of the different event and success between them before insisted on? It cannot be, but that either they have contracted the guilt of some sin, wherewith God was more displeased, then with the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of their fore-fathers, or that the Covenant made with them is expired, or that there hath been a coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of both these; and that indeed is the condition of things with them. The <hi>Messiah</hi> came, in whom the carnal Covenant was to expire, and they rejected and slew him, justly deserving their perpetuall rejection from it, and disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>11</label> Sometimes they will plead, that it is for their <hi>own sins</hi> and the sins of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that succeeded the destruction of the second Temple, that they are kept thus
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50110:107"/>
long in misery and captivity. But we know, that they use this plea only as a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for their obstinate blindness and infidelity. Take them from this dispute, and they are continually boasting of their Righteousness and Holiness, for they do not only assure us that they are better then all the world besides, but also much better then their fore-fathers, as <hi>Manasse</hi> plainly affirms in the place before cited, and that on the <hi>day of Expiation,</hi> that is, once a year; they are as holy as the Angels in Heaven: There are therefore one or two things which I would desire to know of them, as to this pretence of their own sins, which on another account must also be afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First</hi> Then, whereas it is a principle of their faith, That <hi>all Jews</hi> excepting <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi> are so holy and righteous, that they shall all be saved, have all a portion in the blessed world to come, whence is it that none of them, are so Righteous as to be returned into the Land of <hi>Canaan?</hi> Is it not strange, that that Righteousness which serves the turn to bring them all to Heaven, will not serve to bring any one of them to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> This latter being more openly and frequently promised unto them then the former. I know not how to solve this difficulty; <hi>ipsi viderint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Repentance</hi> from their sins is a thing wholly in their own power, or it is not; if they shall say, it is in their own power, as generally they do; I desire to know why they defer it? The brave imaginations that they have of the <hi>levelling of Mountains,</hi> the <hi>dividing</hi> of Rivers, the <hi>singing</hi> of Woods, and <hi>dancing</hi> of Trees, of the <hi>Coaches</hi> and Chariots of Kings to carry them, as also their riding upon the shoulders of their rich neighbours into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Conquest of the world, the eating of <hi>Behemoth,</hi> and drinking the Wine of <hi>Paradice,</hi> the Riches, Wives, and long Life that they shall have in the dayes of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> do make them as they pretend, patiently endure all their long exile, and calamitie. And can this not prevail with them for a <hi>little Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> which they may perform when they please, with a wet finger, and so obtain them all in a trice? If they are so evidently blind, foolish and mad, in and about that which they look upon as their only great concernment in this world, have they not great cause to be jealous, lest they are also equally blind in other things, and particularly in that wherein we charge them with blindness? This it seems is the State of these things. Unless they <hi>repent,</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> will not come; unless he come, they cannot be delivered out of their calamitie nor enjoy the promises. To <hi>repent</hi> is a thing in their own power, which yet they had rather endure all miseries, and foregoe all the promises of God then take in hand, or go through with it. And what shall we say to such a perverse generation of men, who openly proclaim, that they will live in their sins, though they have never more to do with God unto eternity. If they shall say, that <hi>Repentance</hi> is the gift of <hi>God,</hi> and that without his powring forth his Spirit upon them, they cannot attain unto it, then I desire to know whence it is that God doth not give them Repentance, as he did to their fore-fathers, if the <hi>Covenant</hi> continue established with them, as in former dayes? From what hath been discoursed, It doth sufficiently appear that the state and condition of the Jews hath been such in the world, for these <hi>sixteen hundred years,</hi> as manifests the end of their special Covenant to be long since come, and consequently the Messiah, in whom it was to expire.</p>
                  <p>There is one of them, a nameless person, not unlearned, who hath written some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>12</label> lately in the <hi>Portugal</hi> Language, which is translated into Latin by <hi>Brenius</hi> the <hi>Socinian,</hi> who gives so satisfactory an Answer in his own conceit, unto this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that he concludes, that every one who is not obstinate, or blinded with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections, must needs acquiesce therein. His confidence, if not his reasons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves our consideration, especially considering that he offers somewhat new unto us, which their former Masters did not insist upon.</p>
                  <p>That then which he returns as an Answer, unto the enquiry of the <hi>Causes and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> of their present long captivities and miserie, is the <hi>sins of their fore-fathers</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the first Temple. The greatness of these sins, he saith, is expressed by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 16.48. <hi>As I live, saith the Lord God,</hi> Sodom <hi>thy Sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as though hast done, thou and thy daughters.</hi> To which he adds, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.9. where mention is made again of <hi>Sodom.</hi> So that this Captivity is to them, in the room of such a destruction, as <hi>Sodom</hi> was overthrown withall.</p>
                  <p>But it may be said, that these sins what ever they were, were expiated in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish Captivity,</hi> and pardoned unto them upon their return. So that now they must suffer, on the account of their sins committed under the second Temple; to which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50110:108"/>
he replyes, that this exception is of no force. <hi>Nam liberatio e Babilone nihil aliud suit, quam exploratio, qua Deus experiri voluit, an cum restitutione Regni &amp; Templi pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sint abbreviari, &amp; expiari enormia ista, quae commiscerant, adulterii, homicidii, &amp; Idolatriae peccata; sed pro antecedentium debitorum solutione, quam prestare debuerunt, nova insuper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita accumulaverunt. For the deliverance from Babylon was nothing but a tryal, whereby God would make an experiment, whether with the restitution of their Kingdom and Temple, these enormous sins of Adultery, Murder and Idolatry which they had committed, might have been cut off and expiated, but instead of a discharge of their former arrears, which they were obliged unto, they heaped up new debts by their sins.</hi> Thus he. At their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon</hi> the people had no discharge of their former sins by the pardon of them; but were only tryed how they would afresh acquit themselves, with a resolution in God, that if they made not satisfaction, then for those sins, to charge the guilt of them again upon themselves and all their posterity, for all the generations that are passed, untill this day. But First, This is plainly a fiction of this mans own devising. Let him produce any one word, from the Scripture where it treats of these things, in the least giving countenance thereunto; or let him shew, how this procedure is suitable unto the Justice of God, either unto the general notion that we have of it, or as unto any other instance recorded of it in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But if these men may fain what they please, there is no doubt but they will justifie themselves and maintain their own cause.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Why did none of the latter Prophets whom God granted unto the people, after their return from Captivity; as <hi>Haggai, Zechariah,</hi> and <hi>Malachi</hi> let the people know, that this was the condition of their return into their Land, but only require of them to walk answerable unto the mercies they had then received.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As the very nature of the dispensation did declare, that God having purged out the Rebels of the people, and destroyed them with his sore judgements, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given their sins, and was returned unto them, in a way of mercy and grace never to call over their forepast iniquities any more, so the Prophets that treated concerning that dispensation of God, do in places innumerable assert the same, and plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this imagination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God punisheth not the sins of the Fathers upon their children, unless the Children continue in the sins of their Fathers. This he declareth at large, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. Now what were the sins of this people under the first Temple before their captivity? our Author reckons <hi>Adultery, Murder</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi>: It is no doubt but many of them were Adulterers, and that sin among others was charged on them by the Prophets; but it is evident that their principal ruining sins were their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and persecution or killing of the Prophets. And God by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> declares, that in and by their Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he would punish and take away all their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and Adulteries ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n from the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or their beginning to be his people, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23.11, 27. Now were the Jews, that is, the body of the people guilty of these sins under the second House? it is known that from all <hi>Idolatry</hi> they preserved themselves, which was that sin, that in an especial manner was their ruine before; and for <hi>killing</hi> the Pophets, they acknowledge that after <hi>Malachi</hi> they had none, so that none could be persecuted by them, but those whom they will not own to be Prophets: But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Suppose that all those under the second House continued in the sins of their fore-fathers, which yet is false, and denyed by themselves as occasion requires, yet what have the <hi>Jews</hi> done, for sixteen hundred years since the destruction of that House? they plead themselves to be holy, and in application of the Prophecy, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, proclaim themselves innocent and righteous; at least they would not have us to think that the generality of them, are <hi>Adulterers, Murderers</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi>: whence is it then that the punishment of their Fathers sins lyes so long on them? What Rule of Justice is observed herein? What instance of the like dispensation can they produce? for our parts we affirm, that they continue unto this day in the same sin, for which their fore-fathers under the second House were rejected and destroyed, and so know the righteousness of God in their present captivities and miseries. Besides,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> They say they abhor the sins of their fore-fathers, repent of them, and do obtain Remission of sins through their observation of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; Wherein then is the faithfulness of God in his prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ses unto them? Why are they not delivered out of captivity? Why not restored to their Land according to express Testimonies of the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with them unto that purpose? There is no colour of truth nor
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50110:108"/>
reason therefore in this evasion, which they invented to countenance themselves in their obstinate blindness and unbelief.</p>
                  <p>But our Author yet adds an Instance, whereby he hopes to reinforce and confirm <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>13</label> his former answer: saith he, <hi>Deus per manus Salamanassani decem tribus in captivitatem passus est abduci in regiones nobis incognitas sexcentis fere annis ante destructionem Templi secundi, hoc <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

(5.) The remant of that people dispersed amongst strange Nations, seems voluntarily to have embraced their manners and customs, and utterly to have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their own Land, whereas those with whom we have to do, daily expect, desire, and endeavour a return thereunto: so that neither doth this evasion, yield our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Jews</hi> any relief, and we may return to the notions of their more antient Masters.</p>
                  <p>For a Close then of these considerations, I shall add some of the confessions of the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves, which the evidence of the Truth contended for hath at several seasons extorted from them. And this I shall not do, as though they were of great importance in themselves, or unto us, but only to discover their entanglements in contending against the light: for the present Masters of their unbelief, are more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with the convictions of their Predecessors then with the plainest testimonies of the Scripture. The Authority of their Predecessors being equal with them unto, if not more sacred then that of the word of God its self.</p>
                  <p>First then, Being pressed with the Testimonies before insisted on out of <hi>Haggai</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>glory</hi> of the second Temple, and the coming of the <hi>desire of all Nations</hi> thereunto, they have a Tradition that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was born the same day that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple was destroyed. The story indeed which they make it up with, is weak, fabulous and ridiculous, and he who is offended with the citation of such things out of their <hi>Talmudical Doctors,</hi> is desired only to exercise patience until he shall be able him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to report from them things more serious and of greater importance; and yet from them must we learn the perswasions and convictions of the Antient Jews, or be utterly ignorant of them.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>15</label> Again, They have a Tradition out of the School of one <hi>Elias,</hi> a famous Master amongst them of the <hi>Tannarei</hi> or <hi>Antetalmudical Doctors</hi> which they have recorded in the <hi>Talmud Tractat.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>It is a Tradition of</hi> Elias <hi>that the world shall continue six thousand years, two thousand void</hi> (which the gloss of <hi>Rabbi Solomon Jarchi</hi> reckons from the Creation of the world, unto the Call of <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>two thousand to the Law</hi> (from thence to the destruction of the second Temple) <hi>and two thousand to the dayes of the Messiah.</hi> It is incredible how the latter <hi>Rabbins</hi> are perplexed with this Tradition of their Masters, which is recorded in the <hi>Talmud</hi> as sacred. In the account they give in <hi>Shebet Sehuda</hi> of a Disputation they had with one <hi>Hierom</hi> a converted <hi>Jew</hi> before the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> they know not how to disintangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Authority of it. The summ of their answer is, that the next words in the Tradition are, <hi>that that time is elapsed, because of their sins</hi>; but as others have already manifested that that <hi>gloss</hi> is no part of the <hi>Tradition,</hi> but an addition of the <hi>Talmudists,</hi> so we shall immediately manifest the vanity of that pretence. Others of them say, that it sufficeth to maintain the truth and credit of the Tradition, if the <hi>Messiah</hi> come at any time within the last two thousand years. But besides, that even they also are now drawing towards their period, not a fifth part in their computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that space of time remaining, so this gloss is directly contrary to the very words of the Tradition. For as two thousand years are assigned to the world before the Law, and two thousand to the Law, which they reckon from the Call of <hi>Abraham</hi> to the ruine of the second Temple, so the two thousand years allotted to the time of the <hi>Messiah</hi> must begin with his coming, as the other portions do one of them with the Creation, the other with the Call of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or else the space of time above sixteen hundred years between the expiration of the second two thousand years, and the third, must be left out of the computation. And the time limited for the durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world extended above sixteen hundred years, beyond what is allotted unto it in their Tradition.</p>

wrested from sundry of them, which having been collected by others we shall not trouble the Reader with their recital: these that have been insisted on, may and do suffice to make good the Argument in hand. And so we have fully demonstrated the second thing proposed unto confirmation; Namely, that the true <hi>Messiah</hi> is long since come, and hath finished the work allotted unto him. Now whereas we have in our passage vindicated the Testimonies insisted on from the particular excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Jews; It remaineth for the closing of this Discourse, that we consider the general Answer which they give unto the whole Argument taken from them all.</p>
                  <p>That which they principally insist on is, a concession with an exception, rendring <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>17</label> as they suppose the whole useless to our purpose. They grant therefore that the time fixed on, was determined for the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; But add withall, It is prolonged beyond the limited season, because of their sins; that is, that the promise of his coming at that season was not <hi>absolute,</hi> but <hi>conditional,</hi> namely on supposition that the <hi>Jews</hi> were righteous, holy and worthy to receive him. Thus unto the Tradition of <hi>Elias</hi> before mentioned, determining the coming of the Messiah upon the end of the second two thousand years of the worlds duration; they add in the <hi>Talmud.

                     </gap>, <hi>Rab. said, all times appointed are finished, and this matter is not suspended, but upon account of repentance and good works.</hi> And nothing is more common with them then this condition, <hi>if they deserve it, if they repent,</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> will come, <hi>the time is already past, but because of our sins he is not come.</hi> If all <hi>Israel</hi> could repent but one day he would come. This is the summ of their Answer. There was a time limited and determined, for the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; This time is signified in general in the Scripture to be before the destruction of the <hi>Second Temple,</hi> and the utter departure of <hi>Scribe</hi> and <hi>Law-giver</hi> from <hi>Judah</hi>; but all this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation of the time was but conditional, and the accomplishment of it had respect unto their righteousness, repentance, good works, and merits, which they failing in, their <hi>Messiah</hi> is not yet come. To this issue is their infidelity at length arrived. But there are reasons innumerable, that make naked the vanity of this pretence. Some of them I shall briefly insist upon at present, and more fully afterwards.</p>
                  <p>First, We have before proved, that not the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> also, even <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>18</label> the whole world was concerned in the coming of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> The first promise of him concerned mankind in general, without the least particular respect, unto any one peculiar people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. The next solemn renovation of it unto <hi>Abraham</hi> extends the blessing wherewith it was to be attended unto <hi>all the kindreds of the earth, Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.18. The whole restriction of the promise unto him and to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity; consisted only in the designation of them to be the means of bringing forth that <hi>Messiah,</hi> who was to be a <hi>blessing unto all Nations</hi>; And when <hi>Jacob</hi> foretells his coming of <hi>Judah, Gen.</hi> 49.10. he declares who were to have an equall share in the blessing of it, together with his posterity; <hi>to him,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall be the gathering of the people.</hi> The same course do all the succeeding Prophets proceed in. They every where declare, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; the Nations of the world, were equally concerned with the <hi>Jews</hi> in the promise of the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> if not principally intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because of their greatness and number. In mercy, love, compassion, and <hi>philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throphy</hi> did God provide this blessed remedy for the recovery of mankind, (both Jews and Gentiles) out of that misery whereunto they had cast themselves by sin and Apostacy from him. The time of exhibiting this remedy unto them, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised also, and limited, stirring them up unto an expectation of its accomplishment, as that whereon all their happiness did depend. Shall we now suppose, that all this love, grace and mercy of God towards mankind, that his faithfulness in his promises, were all suspended on the goodness, righteousness, merits and repentance of the <hi>Jews?</hi> that God who so often testifies concerning them, that they were a people, wicked, obstinate, stubborn and rebellious, should make them keepers of the everlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the whole world? that he hath given the fountain of his grace and love, which he intended and promised should overflow the whole earth, and make all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Goodness and Compassion towards you, O ye poor miserable Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> to send you a Saviour and a Deliverer, who at such a time shall come and declare unto you the way of life eternal, shall open the door of Heaven, and save you from the wrath that you have deserved, but I will do it on this condition, that the <hi>Jews</hi> an obstinate and rebellious people, be good, holy, righteous and penitent; for unless they be so, the Saviour shall not come, nor is it possible he should, untill they be so, This of themselves they will never be, nor do I intend to make them so. If they can perswade us, that God hath thus placed them in his Throne, and given his Grace and truth into their hands to make effectuall, or frustrate at their pleasure, and suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his good will towards the residue of mankind on their obedience, <hi>whom</hi> he testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to have been alwayes stubborn and disobedient, they may also hope to prevail with us to believe, that they only are men, and all other beasts, as some of their <hi>Talmudical</hi> Masters have affirmed. At present we find it by blessed experience, that their wickedness hath not made the Truth of God of no effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>19</label> Secondly, When God limited and foretold the time of the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> he either foresaw what would be the State and condition of the <hi>Jews</hi> as to their Repentance and Good Works, or he did not? If they say he did not, then besides that they deny him to be God, by denying those <hi>Essential Attributes</hi> of his nature, which the very Heathen acknowledged in their Deities, They also utterly overthrow all the Prophecies and predictions of the Old Testament: for there is not any of them but depend on a supposition of the prescience of God; and this is nothing but to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance their unbelief with perfect Atheism. If they say he did foresee, that their conditions and manners, would be such as the event hath proved them, whence he must also know that it was impossible, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should come at the time limited and determined; I ask to what end and purpose he doth so often, and at so great a distance of time, promise and foretell, that he should come at such a time and season, seeing he knew perfectly that he should not so do, and so, that not one word of his predictions should be fulfilled? why I say, did he fix on a time and season, foretell it often, limit it by signs infallible, give out an exact computation of the years, from the time of his predictions, and call all men unto an expectation of his coming accordingly, when by his foresight of the <hi>Jews</hi> want of merit and repentance, no such thing could possibly fall out? God who is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, doth not deal thus with the sons of men. This were not to promise and foretell in infinite veracity, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to deceive. The condition then pretended, cannot be put upon the promise of the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> without a <hi>direct</hi> denyal of <hi>some,</hi> and by just consequence of all the <hi>essential properties</hi> of the nature of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>20</label> Thirdly, there is not in the whole Scripture, the least intimation of any such <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> as that which they pretend the promise insisted on, to be clogged withall. It is no where said, no where intimated, that if the <hi>Jews</hi> repented, and merited well, the <hi>Messiah</hi> should come, at the time mentioned; no where threatned, that if they did not so, his coming should be put off unto an uncertain day. We know not, nor are they able to inform us whence they had this condition, unless they will acknowledge, that they have forged it in their own brains, to give countenance unto their infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Before the time allotted, was elapsed, and they had obstinately refused him, who was sent, and came according unto promise: There was not the least rumour of any such thing amongst them. Some of their Predecessors invented it to palliate their impiety, which so they may do, they are not solicitous what reflection it may cast upon the honour of God. Besides as the Scripture is silent, as to any thing that may give the least colour unto this pretence, so it delivers that which is contrary unto it, and destructive of it; for it informs us, that the season of the coming of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ssiah</hi> shall be a time of great sin, darkness and misery which also their own Masters, in other places, and on other occasions acknowledges. So <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. <hi>&amp;</hi> 53. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32, 33. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.4. He was to come to turn men from ungodliness, and not because they were turned so before his coming. There can be no place then for this Condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>21</label> Fourthly, The suggestion of this condition, overthrows the rise of the promise, and the whole nature of the thing promised. We have before manifested, that the rise and spring of this promise, was <hi>meer love</hi> and soveraign Grace: There was not any thing in man, <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Gentile,</hi> that should move the Lord to provide a remedy and relief for them who had destroyed themselves. Now to suspend the promise of this Love and Grace, on the righteousness and repentance of them unto whom it was
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50110:110"/>
made, is perfectly to destroy it, and to place the merit of it in man, whereas it arose, purely from the Grace of God. Again, it utterly takes away and destroyes the nature of the thing promised. We have proved, that it is a <hi>Relief,</hi> a Recovery, a Salvation from sin and misery that is the subject matter of this promise. To suppose that this shall not be granted, unless men as a condition of it, deliver themselves from their sins, is to assert a plain contradiction, so wholly to destroy the promise. He was not promised unto men, because they were penitent and just, but to make them so. And to make the righteousness of <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> the condition of his coming, is to take his work out of his hand, and to render both him and his coming useless. But this fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeds from the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the <hi>Jews</hi>; namely, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is not promised to free them from their <hi>own sins,</hi> but to make them possessors of <hi>other mens goods</hi>; not to save their <hi>souls,</hi> but their bodies and <hi>estates,</hi> not to make men <hi>heirs</hi> of Heaven, but <hi>Lords</hi> of the earth; which folly hath been before discovered and disproved.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The <hi>Jews</hi> on several accounts are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>self-condemned,</hi> in <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>22</label> the use of this plea or pretence. Their great sins, they say, are the cause, why the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> is retarded. But <hi>First,</hi> what those sins are they cannot declare. We readily grant them to be <hi>wicked</hi> enough, but withal we know their great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to consist, in that which they will not acknowledge; namely, not in being unfit for his coming, but in refusing him when he came. They instance sometimes in their <hi>hatred</hi> one of another, their mutual <hi>animosities,</hi> and frequent <hi>adulteries,</hi> and want of observing the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> according to the rules of their present superstitious scrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. But what is all this unto the Abominations, which God passed over formerly in their Nation, and also fulfilled his promises unto them, though really conditionall. (2.) Take them from the rack of our Arguments, and you hear no more of their confessions, no more of their sins and wickedness, but they are immediately all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy, all beloved of God, and better then their fore-fathers; yea, (3.) On the day of expiation, they are all as holy, if we may believe them, as the <hi>Angels</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. There is not one sin amongst them, so that it is strange the <hi>Messiah</hi> should not at one time or another come to them on that day. (4.) They have a Tradition among themselves, that the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> may be hastened, but not retarded. So they speak in their gloss on Isa. 60.22. <hi>I the Lord will hasten it in its time. Tractat. Saned.</hi>

                     </gap> Rabbi Alexander <hi>said, and</hi> Rabbi Joshua <hi>the Son of</hi> Levi, <hi>it is written in his time, and it is written, I will hasten it, I will hasten it if they deserve it, and if they deserve it not, yet in its own time</hi>; and this they apply to the coming of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> (5.) They assert many of them, that it is themselves who are spoken of in the fifty third of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and their being causelesly afflicted by the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; now he whom the Prophet there speaks of, is <hi>one</hi> perfectly innocent and righteous, and so they must needs be in their own esteem, supposing themselves there intended. So that this <hi>pretence</hi> is known to themselves to be no more.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, This plea is directly contrary to the nature of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>23</label> to make at the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or that which he came to ratifie and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish, and the reason which God gives, for the making of that Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31, 31, 32, 33. The foundation of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> lyes in this, that the people had <hi>disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled and broken the former made with them.</hi> Now surely they do not disannul that Covenant, if they are righteous according to the tenor of it, and unless they are so, they say the <hi>Messiah</hi> will not come, that is, the <hi>New Covenant</hi> shall not be made, unless by them it be first made needless. Again, the nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant lyes in this, that God in it makes men righteous and holy, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 11.19. So that righteousness and holiness, cannot be the <hi>Condition</hi> of making it, unless it be of making it useless. This then is the contest between God and the <hi>Jews,</hi> he takes it upon himself, to give men righteousness by the Covenant of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> they take it upon themselves, to be righteous, that he may make that <hi>Covenant</hi> with them.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, If the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> depend on the Righteousness and repentance <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>24</label> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it is not only possible, but very probable that he may never come. Themselves conceive that the world shall not continue above six thousand years. Of this space, they do not suppose, that there is any more then five hundred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining; the time past since the expiration of the dayes determined for the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50110:111"/>
coming of the Messiah, is at least sixteen hundred years; seeing that they have not repented all this while, what assurance have we, nay what hope may we entertain, within the four or five hundred years that are behind. Greater <hi>Calls</hi> to Repentance from God, greater motives from themselves and others they are not like to meet withall. And what ground have we to expect, that they who have withstood all these <hi>Calls</hi> without any good fruit by their own confessions, will ever be any better. Upon this supposition then, it would be very probable, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should never come. Nothing can be replyed hereunto, but that God will either at length effectually by his Grace, give them that Repentance, which they make necessary for his coming, or that he will send him at last, whether they repent or no: But if either of these may be expected, what reason can be imagined, why God should so deal at any season concerning which he had made no promise, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should come therein, and not do so at the time concerning which he had so often promised and foretold, that he should come therein.</p>

                  <p>THe third branch of that great supposition and fundamental Article of faith,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>1</label> whereon the Apostle builds his Arguments and Reasonings, wherewith he deals with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is, that <hi>Jesus</hi> whom he preached was the true and only promised <hi>Messiah</hi> who came forth from God for the accomplishment of his work; according to the time determined and foretold. The confirmation of this foundation of our faith, and profession, is that which now in the <hi>third place</hi> we must engage in.

in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> and therefore must contract (as much as may be) the Arguments that we have to plead in this case. And yet neither can this be so done, but that some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of discourse will be unavoidably necessary. And the course we shall proceed in, is the same we have passed through in our foregoing demonstrations of the promise of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and of his coming. Our Arguments are first to be produced, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated from the particular exceptions of the <hi>Jews</hi>; and then their opposition to our <hi>Thesis</hi> in general, is to be removed, referring an Answer unto their special Objections unto another Dissertation.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> That we may the more orderly annex our present Discourse unto that foregoing: our first <hi>Argument</hi> shall be taken from that which is proved, and confirmed therein; namely, the <hi>time</hi> limited and determined for the coming of the Messiah. Two wayes there are, whereby the time fore-appointed of God for the coming of the Messiah, is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and made known. First, By certain <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>evident tokens,</hi> taken from the <hi>Judaical Church,</hi> with the state and condition of the whole people of the <hi>Jews.</hi> This we have insisted on from <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1, 2. Secondly, By a compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the time its self as to its duration, from a certain <hi>fixed date</hi> unto its expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This way we have unfolded and vindicated at large, from <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24, 25, 26, 27. And although herein we have evidenced the truth and exactness of the computation insisted on by us, as far as any <hi>Chronological</hi> accounts of times past are capable of being demonstrated. Yet we have also manifested, that our Argument depends not on the precise bounding of the time limited; But lying <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is of equal force, however the computation be calculated, the whole time limited being undeniably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired before, or at the destruction of the City and Temple. Hence is the foundation of our first Argument. <hi>Before or at the expiration of that time the promised Messiah was to come. Before, or at that time, as denoted and described by the general <gap reason="foreign">

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an apprehension of this design and faith therein, neither can a letter of it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, nor can a rational man discover any important Excellency in it. <hi>Him</hi> it promiseth; <hi>Him</hi> it typifieth; <hi>Him</hi> it teacheth, and prophesieth about: <hi>Him</hi> it calls all men to desire and expect. When it hath done thus, in several places it expresly limits, foretells, and declares, the time wherein He shall be sent and exhibited. If there be a failure herein, seeing it is done to give evidence to all other things that are spoken concerning him, by which they are to be tryed, and to stand or fall, as they receive approbation or discountenance from thence. To what end should any man trouble himself, about that which is cast, as a fancy and empty imagination, by its own ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict? If then the <hi>Messiah</hi> came not within the time limited, all Expectation from the Scripture of the Old Testament, must come to nought; which these, with whom at present we contend, will not grant.</p>
                  <p>Nor can the <hi>Jews</hi> on such a supposition, in any measure defend the truth of it against an <hi>Infidel.</hi> For unto his enquiry where is the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> if they shall plead their usual pretences. It is easie for him to reply, that these things b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And indeed, the ridiculous figment of his being born at the time appointed, but <hi>kept hid to this day,</hi> they know not where, is not to be pleaded, when they deal with men not bereft of their senses, or Judicially blinded by God. For besides, that the whole of it, is a childish, toyish fiction, inconsistant with the nature and being of their <hi>Messiah,</hi> whom th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y make to be a meer man subject to mortality, in his whole person, like all the other sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> it suits not at all unto the difficulty intended, to be assoyled by it. For it is not his being <hi>born</hi> only, but also his accomplishment of his <hi>Work</hi> and Office, at the time determined which is foretold. Nor is there any one jot more of probability in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50110:112"/>
their other pretence, about their <hi>own sins</hi> and unworthiness. For, as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, this is nothing but in plain terms to assert, that God hath violated his faith and promise; and that in a matter, wherein the great Concernments of his own Glory, and the welfare of all mankind doth consist, upon the account of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, which as they either cannot, or will not remedy, so he himself hath not, (though he might have so done) provided any relief against. This then stands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equal evidence with the whole Authority of the Old Testament, namely, that the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> was to come within the time prefixed for his coming, and foretold.</p>
                  <p>We ask them then, <hi>If Jesus of Nazareth</hi> be not the <hi>Messiah,</hi> where is he? or who is he that came in answer to the Prophecies insisted on? Two things then remain to be proved. First, That our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ</hi> came, lived, and dyed within the time limited for the coming of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Secondly, That no other came within that season, that either pretended with any colour of probability unto that dignity, or was ever as such, owned or esteemed by the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves.</p>
                  <p>First then, that Jesus came and lived in the time limited unto the coming of the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> 
                     <hi>Messiah,</hi> some short space of time before the departure of <hi>Scepter and Scribe</hi> from <hi>Judah,</hi> the ceasing of the daily Sacrifice, and final desolation of, the second Temple, we have all the evidence, that a matter of fact so long passed, is capable of as good, as that the world was of old by God created. The Stories of the <hi>Church</hi> are express, that he was born during the Empire of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> in the latter end of the Reign of <hi>Herod</hi> over <hi>Judaea,</hi> when <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Governour over <hi>Syria</hi>; that he lived unto the time, wherein <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was Governour of <hi>Judaea</hi> under <hi>Tiberius,</hi> about thirty six or thirty seven years before the destruction of the Nation, City and Temple by <hi>Titus.</hi> This the stories written by <hi>Divine inspiration,</hi> and committed unto the care of the Church, expresly affirm; neither have the Jews any thing to object against the truth of the relation, what ever thoughts they have of his Person, who he was, or what he did: That he lived and dyed then, and there, is left testified on Records beyond controll. And if they should deny it, what is the <hi>bare negation</hi> of a few interested, blinded persons, without Testimonies or evidence from any one circumstance of Times, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or Actions to be laid in the ballance against the <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> of all the world, whether believing in Jesus, or rejecting of him. For they all alwayes consented in this, that he lived, and died at the time mentioned in the sacred stories.</p>
                  <p>And this was still one part of the charge managed against his followers, in the very next <hi>Age</hi> after, that they believed in a person whom they knew to live at such a season, and in a mean condition. Neither did the most malicious and fierce impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Religion taught by him, such as <hi>Celsus, Porphyrie,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> ever once attempt to attacque the Truth of the story, as to his real existence, and the time of it. So that herein we have as concurrent a suffrage as the whole world in any case is able to afford.</p>
                  <p>The best of the <hi>Historians</hi> of the Nations, who lived near those times, give their <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> Testimony unto what is recorded in our Gospel. The words of one of them, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of unquestionable credit, in things that he could attain the knowledge of, and as it will appear by them, far enough from any compliance with the followers of <hi>Jesus,</hi> may suffice for an instance. This is <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> in the fifteenth of his <hi>Annals: Abolendo</hi> (saith he) <hi>rumori</hi> (he speaks of <hi>Nero</hi> and his firing of <hi>Rome,</hi>) <hi>subdidit reos, &amp; quaesitissimis poenis affecit, quos per flagitia invisos vulgus Christianos appellebat. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ejus nominis Christus qui Tiberio imperitante per procuratorem Pontium Pilatum sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicio affectus erat.</hi> He expresly assignes the time of the death of Christ unto the reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and government of <hi>Pilate.</hi> The same also is confirmed by the <hi>Jews</hi> own <hi>Historian Flavius Josephus,</hi> in the fourth <hi>Chapter</hi> of the eighteenth <hi>Book</hi> of their <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; unto which season also he assigns the death of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> who was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, according to the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Story.</p>
                  <p>Further, We have that Testimony in this matter, which though in its self, it be of little <label type="milestone">

But yet also there were sundry things which they ascribe unto this <hi>Jesus</hi> the Son of <hi>Pandira</hi> and <hi>Stada</hi> which make very apparent who it was whom they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for first, they say that he learned <hi>Magick</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which upon his being carried thither in his infancy, they ascribe unto him: Again, they say he was a <hi>Seducer</hi> of the people; which we know was the accusation that they mannaged against the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, They tell us a story concerning <hi>two men</hi> placed in a room near him, to over-hear his seducing, that so they might accuse him; this they say was their course to intrap Seducers, and thereof they give this instance. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>ll out not long after his death; whereas he sayes, it is apparent from the</hi> Mishna <hi>and</hi> Talmud, <hi>that he was crucified in the dayes of the</hi> Maccabes, <hi>an hundred years before.</hi> And here we have unawares the sore discovered, and the true reason laid open, why the <hi>Talmudists</hi> attempted, to transferr the time of his death, from the dayes of <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch,</hi> to the Rule of <hi>Aristobulus</hi> the <hi>Hasmonaean</hi>; namely, lest they should be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to acknowledge their utter ruine to have so suddenly ensued upon their rejection of him, as indeed it did. However, as to our present purpose, we have in general this confession of our Adversaries themselves, that the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> came before the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the City and Temple, which was that we undertook to confirm.</p>
                  <p>We, Secondly, In the pursuit of our Argument, affirmed that no other person came,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>7</label> at, or within the time limited, that could pretend to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi> This the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves confess, nor can they think otherwise, without destroying themselves. For if any such person came, seeing they received him not, nor do own him unto this day. Their guilt would be the same, that we charge upon them, for the refusing of our Lord Jesus. There is no need then, that we should go over the <hi>Tragical</hi> Stories of <hi>Barchocheba, Moses Cretensis, David el David,</hi> and such other <hi>Imposters.</hi> For whereas none of them came or lived within the time determined, so they are all disclaimed by themselves, as <hi>Seducers</hi> and Causers of great misery unto their people and Nation. Herein then we have the consent of all parties concerned, which renders all further evidence unnecessary.</p>
                  <p>From what therefore hath been spoken, and disputed; It remaineth, that either <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>8</label> our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> was, and is the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> as coming from God in the season limited for that purpose, or that the whole promise concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi> is a meer figment, the whole Old Testament a Fable, and so both the old and present Religion of the <hi>Jews</hi> a delusion. At that season the <hi>Messiah</hi> must come, or there is an end of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. If any came then, whom they had rather embrace for their <hi>Messiah</hi> then our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi>: let them do so, and own him, that we may know who he was, and what he hath done for them. If none such there were, that can be so esteemed, as in truth, and as themselves universally acknowledge there was not, their obstinacy and blindness in refusing the only promised <hi>Messiah</hi> is such, as no reasonable man can give an account of, who doth not call to mind the righteous Judgement of God in giving them up to blindness and obstinacy, as a just punishment for their rejection and murthering his only Son. And this Argument is of such importance, as that with the consideration of the Doctrine of Christ, and his success in the world, it may well be allowed to stand alone in this contest.</p>
                  <p>Our second Argument is taken from those <hi>Characteristical</hi> notes that are given in <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>9</label> the Scripture of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Now these are such, as by which the Church might know him, and upon which they were bound to receive him. All these we shall find to agree and center in the person of our Lord Jesus. Some of the principal of them we shall therefore insist upon, and vindicate from the exceptions of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>stock</hi> whereof he came, the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of his Birth, the course of his life and death, what he taught, and what he suffered, are the principal of those <hi>signs</hi> and <hi>notes</hi> that God gave out to discover the <hi>Messiah</hi> in his appointed time; and as they were very sufficient for that purpose. So upon the matter they comprise all the <hi>signs</hi> and <hi>tokens</hi> whereby any person may be predesigned and signified.</p>
                  <p>First, For the <hi>Family, Stock,</hi> or lineage whereof he was to come; There was a threefold <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>10</label> restitution of it, after the promise had for a long time run in general, that he should be of the seed of the Woman, or take his nature from among mankind. The first was unto the <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15.17. and under that alone, there was no more required, but that he should spring from among his posterity, untill God added that peculiar limitation unto it, <hi>in</hi> Isaac <hi>shall thy seed be called,</hi> Gen. 21.12. After this in the Family of <hi>Isaac, Jacob</hi> peculiarly inherited the promise; and his posterity being branched into <hi>twelve Tribes</hi> or Families, the rise or nativity of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was confined unto the Tribe of <hi>Judah, Gen.</hi> 49.10. This made it further necessary that from him, by some one of the numerous families that sprang of him he should proceed. Out of that <hi>Tribe</hi> God afterwards raised the Kingly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>David</hi> to be a <hi>Type</hi> and representation of the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he restrained the promise unto that <hi>familie,</hi> though not unto any particular branch of it. Hereunto no other restriction was ever afterwards added.</p>
                  <p>It was not then at any time made necessary by promise that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should proceed from the <hi>Royal</hi> branch, or familie of the House of <hi>David,</hi> but only that he
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50110:114"/>
should be born of some of his posterity, by what family soever, poor or rich, in power or subjection, he derived his Genealogie from him. His Kingdom was to be quite of anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>reunto from the right of the <hi>Davidical</hi> House to the Kingdom of <hi>Judah.</hi> Thus far then it pleased God to design this Stock and Family of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> He was to be of the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> of the family of <hi>David.</hi> And although this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in its latitude will conclude only thus far, that no one can be pretended to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> whose <hi>Genealogie</hi> is not so derived by <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> unto <hi>Abraham</hi>; yet by the addition of this circumstance in the Providence of God, that no one since the destruction of the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> can plead or demonstrate that original; seeing this was given out for a note, and sign to know him by, it proves undeniably, that he whom we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert was the true <hi>Messiah.</hi> For to what end should this <hi>token</hi> of him be given forth to know him by, when all <hi>Genealogies</hi> of the people being utterly lost; it is impossible it should be of any use in the discovery of him.</p>

It remains, that we prove him to have been of the Family of <hi>David</hi> by some one signal branch of it.

It was written and published unto all the world, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of unquestionable integrity, who had as much advantage to know the truth of the matter about which they wrote, as any men ever had, or can have in a matter of that nature. And this they did not upon rumours, or Traditions of former dayes, but in that very Age wherein he lived, and that unto the faces of them, whose great interest it was to except against what they wrote; and who would undoubtedly have so done, had they not been overpowred with the conviction of the truth of it: had they had the least suspition on the contrary, why did they not in some of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations and rage against him and his Doctrine, once object this unto himself, or his followers, that he was not of the family of <hi>David,</hi> and so could not be the person he pretended himself to be.

it reasonable that any man without Reason, Testimony, Evidence, or Record, to give them countenance, should call into question, dis-believe and deny the things wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed unto, and written by <hi>Moses.</hi> It is known what they will answer unto this demand, and thereby they will stop their own mouths, as to the refusal of our record in this matter, so that this exception which amounts to no more but this, that the <hi>Jews</hi> believe not the Gospel, and that because they will not, needs no particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, it being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>at which we plead with them about in all these our discourses. And as unto our own Faith it is secured by all these Evidences which we give of the sacred Authority of the Writings of the New Testament.</p>
                  <p>But moreover they except in <hi>particular,</hi> that neither of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> do either as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>13</label> or prove indeed that our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> did spring from the family of <hi>David.</hi> For whereas they assert, and Christians believe, that he was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conjunction of man, and that <hi>Joseph</hi> was only reputed to be his Father, because his Mother was <hi>legally espoused</hi> unto him, both <hi>Genealogies</hi> belong unto <hi>Joseph</hi> alone, as is evident from the beginning of the one, and the end of the other. Now the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> being not related unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> but by the <hi>legal contract</hi> of his Mother, he cannot be esteemed in his right to belong unto the family of <hi>David.</hi> This is pleaded by many of them, as also they take notice of the difficulties which have exercised many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the reconciliation of the several <hi>Genealogies</hi> recorded by the two <hi>Evangelists</hi>; unto all which exceptions, we shall briefly reply, and take them out of our way.</p>
                  <p>First, Suppose it granted, that the <hi>Genealogie</hi> recorded by <hi>Matthew</hi> be properly the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>14</label> 
                     <hi>Genealogy</hi> of <hi>Joseph,</hi> what madness is it to imagine that avowedly proposing to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to have been of the family of <hi>David,</hi> and premising that design, in the title of his <hi>Genealogy,</hi> he doth not prove and confirm what he had so designed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of <hi>Genealogies,</hi> and of the legal just asserting any one to be of such a tribe or family. No more is required for the accomplishment of the promise, but that the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> should be so of the family of <hi>David,</hi> as it was required by the Laws of Families and <hi>Genealogies,</hi> that any person might belong unto it. Now this might be by the <hi>legal marriage</hi> of his Mother unto him who was of that family; for after that contract of marriage, whatever Tribe or Family she was of before, she was <hi>legally</hi> accounted to be of that Family, whereunto by her <hi>espousals</hi> she was engrafted. And of that Family, and no other, was he to be reckoned, who was born of her, after those espousals. Now that the reckoning of Families and Relations among the <hi>Jews</hi> by God's own appointment, did not alwaies follow <hi>Natural Generations,</hi> but sometimes <hi>Legal Institutions,</hi> is manifest by the Law of a man dying without Issue: for when the next <hi>Kinsman</hi> took the Wife of the deceased, to <hi>raise up seed unto him,</hi> he that was born of the Woman, was by <hi>Law</hi> not reckoned to be his Son by whom he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but was to be the Son, and of the Family of him that was deceased, to bear his name, and inherit his estate, <hi>Numb.</hi> 36.6. And this legal <hi>cognation, Luke</hi> seems to intimate, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.27. Where he saies, that the <hi>Mother of Jesus was espoused unto a man whose name was Joseph, of the Family of David</hi>; there being no reason to mention his Family, but that the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of his Wives Son was to relate thereunto. And if this were the Law of <hi>Genealogies,</hi> and legal relations unto Tribes and Families, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently it was, <hi>Matthew</hi> recording the Genealogie of <hi>Joseph,</hi> to whom the <hi>blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> was espoused before the birth of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> doth record <hi>his,</hi> according to the mind of him who gave both Law and Promise, and upon this known Rule of Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, and legal relations, may <hi>Matthew</hi> proceed in his recital of the pedigree of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> and profess thereby to manifest, how <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Secondly, Although there was no indispensible necessity among the <hi>Jews,</hi> binding them to marry within their Tribes, unless the <hi>Women were inhaeritrixes,</hi> in which case provision was made, that inheritances might not be transferred from one Tribe unto another, yet it is more than probable, that the <hi>blessed Virgin Mary</hi> was of the same Family with <hi>Joseph,</hi> and this so notoriously known, that seeing <hi>Genealogies</hi> were not reckoned by Women, nor the Genealogies of Women directly recorded, there was no better, or more certain way of declaring his <hi>pedigree,</hi> who was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> then by his, unto whom she was so nearly related.

                     </gap> of <hi>Judah,</hi> and Family of <hi>David</hi>; and there are sundry circumstances giving weight unto this consideration.</p>
                  <p>First, Whereas the Parents of <hi>Jesus</hi> were outwardly of a mean condition, and living <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>18</label> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> it may be supposed that they were very little known, or taken notice of, to be of the <hi>lineage</hi> and off-spring of <hi>David</hi>; nor it may be in their low estate did they much desire to declare that, which would be of no advantage, and perhaps of some hazard unto them: But now their coming unto <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and that whether they would or no, upon the command of publick Authority, made their house and kindred known unto all the <hi>Jews,</hi> especially those of the Family of <hi>David,</hi> who were then all of them gathered together in that place. Secondly, There is no just nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing reason to be given that should move the <hi>Roman Emperour</hi> to decree that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> and enrolment of persons which brought them unto <hi>Bethlehem</hi>: A matter it was of great charge and trouble to the whole Empire, which at that time enjoyed the greatest peace and tranquility. The Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> was then shut, and all things in quietness in all parts of the world. Neither was there afterwards any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick use made of that enrollment; nor is it certain that it was accomplished in many other Nations. But the infinite, holy, wise Governour of all the world, puts this into his mind, and incites him on this work, to set mankind into a motion that two persons of low condition might be brought out of <hi>Galilee</hi> into <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that <hi>Jesus</hi> might according unto this Prophecy be born there. Thirdly, It is not likely that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> had any thoughts at that time about the place where the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be born, and so probably had not the least design of removing their habitation unto <hi>Bethlehem</hi>; or if they had so, yet their doing of it on their own accord, might have given advantage unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> to say that the Mother of <hi>Jesus</hi> did not indeed any way belong unto <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but only went thither to be delivered, that she might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her Son the better to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi> But by this admirable providence of God, all these, and sundry other difficulties of the like nature, are removed out of the way, their minds are determined, a Journey they must take, and that at a time very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable for the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> when she was so near the time of her delivery, and be publickly enrolled of the Family of <hi>David,</hi> upon the command of him who never knew ought of that business, which none but himself could be instrumental to accomplish. Fourthly, Not long after this, that Town of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was utterly destroyed, nor hath been for a thousand and six hundred years, either <hi>great</hi> or <hi>small</hi> among the <hi>Thousands of Judah.</hi> And all these circumstances give much light unto this <hi>characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical</hi> presignation of the person of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> from the place of his birth or nativity.</p>
                  <p>The Exceptions of the <hi>Jews</hi> unto the <hi>Evangelists</hi> citation of the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>19</label> concern not the testimony it self, nor are indeed of any great importance. For first, The <hi>Evangelist</hi> intended no more, but only to direct unto that Testimony which was given unto the Nativity of the Messiah at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> reciting so much of the words, and in such manner, as to prove by them that which he intended. He took not upon him to repeat every word as they were written by the Prophet (which he might easily have done had he designed it, and that without the least disadvantag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, He useth the words to no other purpose, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> that for which by the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledgement they were recorded by the Prophet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ther in the Alterations that are made in this recital is there one letter taken from the Prophets words, or added unto them, used by him to the advantage of his Assertion, which is the whole that the utmost scrupulosists can require in the recital of the words of another by the way of Testimony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:50110:116"/>Thirdly, He seems not to repeat the words of the Prophet himself immediately, but only to record the answer which from these words of the Prophet, was given unto <hi>Herod</hi> by the <hi>Priests</hi> and Scribes. So that the repetition of the words is <hi>theirs,</hi> and not <hi>his</hi> properly.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Whose ever the words are, as there is nothing in the whole of them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepant from, much less contrary unto, those of the Prophet, nor are used to signifie any thing but the open plain intention of the Prophet: so are all the particulars wherein a <hi>difference</hi> appears between them, capable of a fair Reconciliation. This we shall manifest by passing briefly through them.</p>
                  <p>The first difference is in the first words; <gap reason="foreign">

And it may be to denote withall the relation that the <hi>Messiah</hi> had to <hi>Judah.</hi> So that here there is no discrepancy. <hi>Bethlehem Ephrata,</hi> and <hi>Bethlehem in the Land Iudah,</hi> are one and the same name and place. 2.

And thus much have we spoken by the way, for the vindication of the recital of this Testimony, whose Application in general unto the matter in hand is every way unquestionable, and so yields us a second <hi>characteristical</hi> note of the person of the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>manner</hi> of the birth of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> namely that he should be <hi>born of a Virgin,</hi> is <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>20</label> a third <hi>characteristical</hi> note given of him. The first promise doth sufficiently intimate that he was not to be brought into the world according to the ordinary course of mankind, by natural generation, seeing he was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and in peculiar manner designed to be the <hi>seed of the Woman,</hi> that is to be born of a Woman without conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of man. To make this sign yet the more evident, God gives it forth directly in a word of promise, Isa. 7.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Moreover the Lord spake to</hi> Ahaz, <hi>saying, ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God, ask it either in the depth, or in the height above; but</hi> Ahaz <hi>said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord; And he said, hear ye now ye House of</hi> David, <hi>Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but ye will weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign, Behold, a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and call his name</hi> Emanuel, <hi>Butter and Honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good; for before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the Land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her Kings.</hi> This is the Promise and Prophecy, the accomplishment whereof in our <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> we have recorded, Matt. 1.22, 23. <hi>All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, Behold, A Virgin shall be with Child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call his name</hi> Emanuel. Now this being a thing utterly above the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which never fell out from the foundation of the world unto that day, nor ever shall do so to the end of it, seeing the miraculous power of God shall no more in the like kind be exerted; it is an infallible evidence, and <hi>demonstrative</hi> note of the true <hi>Messiah.</hi> He and he alone was to be born of a <hi>Virgin</hi>; so alone was <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> and therefore he alone is the true <hi>Messiah.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> being greatly pressed with this Prophecy, and the Accomplishment of it,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>21</label> do try all means to escape by breaking through one of them. And we might expect that they would principally attempt the story of the <hi>Evangelist</hi>; but circumstances on that side are so cogent against them, that they are very faint in that endeavour. For if it was so indeed that <hi>Jesus</hi> was not born of a <hi>Virgin</hi> as is recorded, and as both himself and his Disciples professed, why did they not charge him with untruth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in the dayes of his flesh? Why did they not call his Mother into question, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally considering that the being <hi>espoused unto an Husband</hi>; they might upon conviction have put her unto a publick and shamefull death? None of this being done, or once undertaken by their fore-fathers, no less full of Envy and Malice against the Person and Doctrine of <hi>Jesus</hi> then themselves, and much better furnished and provided for such an undertaking, might any colour be given unto it, then they are, they insist not much upon the denyal of the Truth of the Record; but to relieve themselves, they by all means contend that the words of the <hi>Prophet</hi> are no way applicable unto the birth of our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> which the <hi>Evangelist</hi> reports them <hi>prophetically</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.

                  <p>Secondly, They say, that the birth of this Child with the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Thirdly, They insist that <hi>v.</hi> 16. it is promised, that <hi>before</hi> that Child which should be so conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that for whose sake they were a people, must needs be the reason and cause of all good things; that <hi>as a people</hi> were bestowed upon them. Thus God often promiseth them to do this or that unto them, for <hi>Abrahams</hi> sake, and <hi>Davids</hi> sake, that is upon the account of the promise of the <hi>Messiah</hi> signally made unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> when his bringing forth into the world was restrained unto their families and posterity. And hence also in times of streights and difficulties, when the people were pressed on every side, and laboured for deliverance, God oftentimes renewed unto them the promise of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> partly to support their spirits with expectation of his coming, and the salvation that it should be accompanied withall, and partly to give them assurance, that they should not be consumed or utterly perish under their calamity, because the great work of God by them in bringing forth the Messiah, was not yet accomplished. So to this purpose the 4. chapter of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. And on this account it was, namely, of the temporal concernment of that people in the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that the promise of him was oftentimes mixed and interwoven with the mention of other things, that were of present use and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage unto them; so that it was not easie sometimes to distinguish the things that are properly spoken with reference unto him, from those other things which respected what was present; seeing both sorts of them are together spoken of, and that to the same end and purpose.</p>
                  <p>Upon these principles we may easily discover the true sense and importance of this <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>25</label> prophetical prediction. Upon the infidelity of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and the generality of the house of <hi>David</hi> with him, refusing a sign of deliverance tendred unto them, God tells them by his Prophet, that they had not only wearied his <hi>Messengers</hi> by their unbelief and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, but that they were ready to <hi>weary</hi> himself also, <hi>v.</hi> 13. He was even almost <hi>wearied</hi> with their manifold provocations, during that Typical state and condition, wherein he kept them. However, for the present he had promised them deliverance, and although they had refused to <hi>ask a sign</hi> of him according unto his <hi>Command,</hi> yet he would preserve them from their present fears, and utter ruin, and in his due time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish his great and wonderful intendment, and that in a miraculous manner by causing a <hi>Virgin to conceive</hi> and bring forth that Son, on whose account they should be preserved. This is the ground of the promise of the <hi>Messiah</hi> in this place; even to give them assurance that they should be preserved from utter destruction, because they were to continue their <hi>Church</hi> and State until his coming; as also to comfort and support them during their distresses with the hopes and expectation of him; for with the thoughts of his coming, do the <hi>Jews</hi> to this day relieve their spirits under their calamities, though they have had no <hi>renewed promise</hi> of him for near two thousand years. But how may it appear that it was the <hi>Messiah</hi> who should be thus born of a Virgin? This the Prophet assures them, by telling them, in his <hi>Name,</hi> what he shall <hi>be,</hi> and <hi>be called</hi> accordingly, <hi>He shall be called Immanuel,</hi> or God with us; he shall be so both in respect of his Person and Office; for he shall <hi>be</hi> God and Man, and he shall <hi>reconcile</hi> God and Man, taking away the enmity and distance that was caused by sin. And this was such a description of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as by which he was sufficiently known under the Old Testament, yea from the foundation of the world, as hath been before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. And the Prophet further assures them, that this <hi>Immanuel</hi> shall be born, truly a man, and <hi>dwell amongst</hi> them, being brought up with the <hi>common food</hi> of the Country, until he came as other men, unto the years of discretion. <hi>Butter and Honey</hi> shall he eat, until he know to chuse the good, and refuse the evil. And this was enough for the consolation of Believers, as also for the security of the people from the desolation feared. But yet because all this discourse was occasioned by the war raised against <hi>Judah</hi> by the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Damascus,</hi> unto the promise of their deliverance, God is pleased to add a threatning of judgement and destruction unto their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and because he would limit a certain season for the execution of his Judgement upon them, as he had declared the safety and preservation of <hi>Judah,</hi> to depend on the birth of <hi>Immanuel</hi> of a <hi>Virgin</hi> in the appointed season, so as to their enemies that they should be cut off and destroyed, before the time that <hi>any child</hi> not yet born could come to the years of discretion, to chuse the good, or to refuse the evil, <hi>v.</hi> 16. Now that this is the true importance and meaning of the Prophecy, will evidently appear in our vindication of it from the exception of the <hi>Jews</hi> (before laid down) against its appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by <hi>Matthew</hi> unto the Nativity of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

of all their other objections, and on the determination whereof, the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie from this place dependeth, I shall fully clear the Truth of what we assert. For the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves will not deny, but that if the conception of a <hi>Virgin</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, it must referr unto some other, and not to any in those daies. <gap reason="foreign">

Secondly, It is used here peculiarly with the prefix <gap reason="foreign">

So that by this word, a <hi>Virgin</hi> is precisely signified, or the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have no word denoting exactly that state and condition. And lastly, the prefixing of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in this place <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Further, There are other considerations offering themselves from the context,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>28</label> undeniably proving that it is the conception of a <hi>Virgin</hi> which is here intended and foretold. For first, it is plainly some marvelous thing, above, and contrary unto the ordinary course and operation of nature that is here spoken of. It is called <gap reason="foreign">

Now certainly it was no such great matter that the Wife of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> which had before born him a Son who was now eight years of age, or the Wife of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> who was the Mother of <hi>Shearj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is ridiculous what the <hi>Jews</hi> pretend, namely, that it was great in this, that the Prophet should foretell that Conception, as also that it should be a <hi>Son</hi> that should be born, and not a <hi>Daughter</hi>; for the work and sign intimated doth not consist at all in the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Prophets prediction, but in the <hi>Greatness</hi> of the thing it self that was foretold.</p>
                  <p>The Jews cannot assign either <hi>Virgin</hi> or <hi>Son</hi> that is here intended. Some of them <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>29</label> affirm that <hi>Alma</hi> was the Wife of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and the Son promised <hi>Hezekiah</hi>; but this is rejected by <hi>Kimchi</hi> himself, acknowledging that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was now eight years old, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born four years before his Father came to the Kingdom, in the fourth year of whose Reign this promise was given unto him.

And this was because of that great work which he had to accomplish among them, which was to be signal, marvelous and miraculous. And this he calls <gap reason="foreign">

Again this Child they tell us was to be called <hi>Immanuel</hi> whereas the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> was called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>There remain yet other <hi>descriptive notes</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> consisting in what he was to <label type="milestone">

I shall briefly pass through them, according unto our design and purpose; and begin with what he was to teach. This <hi>Moses</hi> directs us unto, giving that great predescription of him, which we have Deut. 18.18, 19. <hi>I will raise them up a Prophet from among their Brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.

                        </gap>soever will not hearken unto my words, which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.</hi> This is that signal Testimony concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which <hi>Philip</hi> urged out of <hi>Moses</hi> unto <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> John 1.45. which <hi>Peter</hi> not only applyes unto him, but declares that he was soly intended in it, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 23. and <hi>Stephen</hi> seals that application with his blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.37. Neither can, or do the <hi>Jews</hi> deny that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or that he was promised unto the Church in the Wilderness in these words, but we shall consider the particulars of them.</p>
                  <p>Sundry things are here asserted by <hi>Moses</hi> concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi>; as (1.) In general,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>35</label> that he should be a <hi>Prophet</hi>; a Teacher of the Church, and not a <hi>King</hi> only. The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed, who greedily desire the things which outwardly attend Kingly Power and Dominion in this world, do principally fix their thoughts and expectations on his Kingdom. The Revelation of the Will of God which was to be made by him, they little desire or enquire after. But the common faith of their Ancestors from this and other places, was that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be a Prophet; and reveal unto the Church the whole counsel of God, as we shall evince in our Comment on the first words of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. (2.) That this Prophet should be <hi>raised up unto them from among their Brethren</hi>; He shall be of the posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as was promised of old; or <hi>made of them according unto the flesh,</hi> Rom. 1.3.9.5. So that as to his original or extract, he was to be born in the <hi>level</hi> of the people, <hi>from among his Brethren was be to be raised up</hi>; Unto this Office of a Prophet and Teacher of the Church. (3.) That he must be <hi>like unto Moses.</hi> The words are plain in many places, that in the ordinary course of Gods dealing with that Church among the Prophets, there was none like unto <hi>Moses,</hi> neither before, or after him. Hence <hi>Maimonides</hi> with his followers conclude, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50110:120"/>
can ever be altered in their Law, because no Prophet was ever to arise of equal Authority with him, who was their Law-giver. But the words of the Text are plain. The <hi>Prophet</hi> here foretold, was to be <hi>like unto him,</hi> wherein he was peculiar and exempted from comparison with all other Prophets, which were to build on his foundation, without adding any thing to the Rule of Faith and Worship which he had revealed, or changing any thing therein. In that, is the Prophet here promised to be <hi>like unto him.</hi> That is, he was to be a <hi>Law-giver</hi> to the House of God, as our <hi>Apostle</hi> proves and declares, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And we have the consent of the most sober among the <hi>Jews</hi> to the same purpose.</p>

                        </gap>lity or accident; or that in all the space of time, wherein the Prophets fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, until Prophecy ceased, none should be like unto</hi> Moses; <hi>but hereafter there shall be one like him, or rather greater then he.</hi> This is that which we affirmed before, in the whole <hi>Series of Prophets</hi> that succeeded in that Church building on <hi>Moses</hi> foundation, there was none like unto him; but the Prophet here promised was to be so, and in other regards, as appears from other Testimonies, far greater then he. This was of old their common faith from this prediction of <hi>Moses.</hi> And wherein this likeness was to consist, our <hi>Apostle</hi> declares at large in his <hi>third chapter. Moses</hi> was the great Law-giver, by whom God revealed his mind, and will, as to his whole Worship, whilst the Church State instituted by him was to continue. Such a Prophet was the <hi>Messiah</hi> to be, a Law-giver, so as to abolish the <hi>old,</hi> and to institute new <hi>Rites of Worship,</hi> as we shall afterwards more fully prove and confirm. (4.) This raising up of a Prophet, like unto <hi>Moses,</hi> declares that the whole will of God, as to his Worship, and the Churches obedience, was not yet revealed. Had it so been, there would have been no need of a <hi>Prophet</hi> like unto <hi>Moses,</hi> to lay new foundations as he had done. Those who succeeded building on what he had fixed, and therefore said <hi>not to be like unto him,</hi> would have sufficed. But there are new counsels of the Will of God, as yet hid, to be finally and fully revealed by this Prophet. And after his work is done, there is no intimation of any further Revelation to ensue. (5.) The presence of God with this Prophet in his work is set down. <hi>He would put his word into his mouth,</hi> or speak <hi>in him,</hi> as our Apostle expresseth the same matter, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. And lastly, his <hi>Ministry</hi> is further described from the Event, with respect unto them who would not submit unto his Authority, nor receive the Law of God at his mouth. God would <hi>require it at their hands,</hi> that is, as those words are interpreted by <hi>Peter,</hi> they should be <hi>cut off from among his people,</hi> or from being so. And this signal Commination in the accomplishment of it, gives light unto the whole praediction. Some of the <hi>Jews</hi> from these words have fancied unto themselves another great <hi>Prophet,</hi> whom they expect as they did of old, before the coming of the Messiah. So in their dealing with <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> they asked him whethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherein they further demand whether he were <gap reason="foreign">

But this is not all; he was not only a <hi>Prophet</hi> in general, but he was that <hi>Prophet</hi> who was foretold by <hi>Moses,</hi> and all the Prophets, who built on his foundation, who was to put the last hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divine Revelations, in a full declaration of the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This absolute perfection of the Doctrine of this Prophet, joyned with those <hi>Characters</hi> of Divine Authority which are enst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mped on it, doth sufficiently evidence that it contains the great, promised, full, final Revelation of the Will of God, which was to be given forth by the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Add hereunto, that since the delivery of this Doctrine, the whole race of mankind hath not been able to invent, or find out any thing, that without the most palpable folly and madness might be added unto it, much less stand in competition with it, and it will it self sufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate its Author.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have declared in the entrance of this discourse, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>38</label> the means promised for the delivery of mankind from that woful estate of sin and misery whereunto they had cast themselves. This was <hi>declared</hi> unto all in general, this <hi>they believed</hi> whom God graciously enabled thereunto. But how this deliverance should be wrought in particular by the <hi>Messiah,</hi> how the <hi>works of the Devil should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,</hi> how God and Man should be reconciled, how sinners might recover a title unto their lost happiness, and be brought to an enjoyment of it; this was unknown not only unto all the Sons of Men, but also to all the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven themselves; who then shall unfold this mysterie which was hid in the counsel of God from the foundation of the world? It was utterly beyond the reason and wisdom of man, to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50110:121"/>
give any tolerable conjecture how these things should be effected and brought about. But all this is fully declared by this Prophet himself. In his Doctrine, in what he taught, doth this great and hidden mysterie of the Reconciliation and Salvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind open it self gloriously to the minds and understandings of them that believe, <hi>whose eyes the God of this world hath not blinded,</hi> and them alone; for although this promise of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was all that God gave out unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and by him unto his posterity to keep their hopes alive in their miserable condition in the Earth, yet such was its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, that meeting with the <hi>minds</hi> of men full of darkness, and <hi>hearts</hi> set upon the pursuit of their lusts, it was as to the <hi>substance</hi> of it, utterly lost to the greatest part of mankind. Afterwards the thing it self was again retrived unto the faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of some by <hi>new Revelations</hi> and Promises, only the manner of its accomplishment was still lost, hid in the depths of the bosom of the Almighty. But as we said by the preaching of <hi>Jesus,</hi> both the thing its self, and the manner of it, are together brought to light, made known, and established, beyond all the power of Satan, to prevail against it. This was the work of the promised Prophet; this was done by <hi>Jesus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> who is therefore both Lord and Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>39</label> Thirdly, We have also declared, how <hi>God</hi> in his Wisdom and Soveraignty restrained the Promise unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his posterity, shadowing out among them the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of it in <hi>Mosaical</hi> Rites and Institutions. And these also received manifold Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications by the succeeding Prophets. From the whole, a <hi>Systeme</hi> of Worship and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine did arise, which turned wholly on this hinge of the promised Messiah, relating in all things to the salvation to be wrought by him. But yet the will and mind of God was in this whole dispensation so folded and wrapt up in <hi>Types,</hi> so vailed and shadowed by <hi>carnal Ordinances,</hi> so obscure and hid in Allegorical Expressions, that the bringing of them forth unto light, the removal of the <hi>clouds</hi> and <hi>shades</hi> that were cast upon them, with a declaration of the Nature, Reason, and Use of all those Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was a work no less glorious then the very first Revelation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise it self. This was that which was reserved for the great <hi>Prophet, the Messiah</hi>; for that God would prescribe Ordinances and Institutions unto his Church, whose full Nature, Use, and End, should be everlastingly unknown unto them, is unreasonable to imagine. Now this is done in the Doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ. The spiritual End, Use and Nature of all these Sacrifices, and Typical Institutions, which unto them who were conversant only with their outside. Servile performances were an <hi>insupportable yoke of bondage,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> find them unto this day, being never able to satisfie themselves in their most scrupulous attendance unto them, are all made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and plain, and all that was taught by them accomplished. This was the work of the <hi>Prophet, like unto Moses.</hi> He fulfilled the End, and unvailed the mind of God in all these Institutions. And he hath done it so fully, that whoever looks upon them through his declaration of them, cannot but be amazed at the blindness and stupidity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who rejecting the Revelation of the Counsel of God by him, adhere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciously unto that whereof they understand aright no one title or syllable: for there is not the meanest <hi>Christian,</hi> who is instructed in the Doctrine of the Gospel, but can give a better account of the Nature, Use, and End of <hi>Mosaical Institutions,</hi> then all the profound <hi>Rabbins</hi> in the world either can, or ever could do. He that is <hi>least in the Kingdom of God,</hi> being greater in this light and knowledge, then <hi>John Baptist</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who yet was not behind any of the Prophets that went before him. This I say, is that which the promised Prophet was to do; and moreover, to add the Institutions of his own immediate Revelations, even as <hi>Moses</hi> had given them the Law of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of old. And in this <hi>superinstitution</hi> of new Ordinances of Worship thereby su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceding those instituted by <hi>Moses,</hi> was he <hi>like unto him,</hi> as was foretold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>40</label> Lastly, The Event confirms the Application of this Character unto the Lord Jesus. Whoever should not receive the word of this Prophet, God threatens to <hi>require it of him,</hi> that is, as themselves confess, to <hi>exterminate</hi> them from among the number of his people, or to reject them from being so. Now this was done by the body of the <hi>Jewish Nation</hi>; they received him not, they obeyed not his voice, and what was the end of this their disobedience? they who for their despising, persecuting, killing the former Prophets, were only corrected, chastened, afflicted, and again quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, out of the worst and greatest of their troubles, upon their rejection of him, and disobedience unto his voice, are cut off, destroyed, exterminated from the place of their solemn Worship, and utterly rejected from being the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ople of God. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be conceived to be contained in the commination against those who disobey
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50110:121"/>
the <hi>voice of that Prophet</hi> promised, is all of it to the full, and in its whole extent, come upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon and for their disobedience unto the Doctrine of <hi>Jesus of Nazareth</hi>; which added unto the foregoing considerations, undeniably prove him to have been that <hi>Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet another Character given of the <hi>Messiah</hi> in the Old Testament, namely,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>41</label> in what he was to <hi>suffer</hi> in the world, in the discharge of his work and office. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wherein the main foundation of the whole was to consist, and that which God knew would be most contrary to the appre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ension, and expectation of that carnal people, is of all other notes of him, most clearly and fully asserted. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and effects of these <hi>sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and how they were to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the Justice of God (without which apprehension of them, little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the promise, or of <hi>Mosaical</hi> Institutions can rightly be understood) because we must treat of them in our explication of the <hi>Epistle</hi> it self, shall not here be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on. It is sufficient unto our present intention, that we prove that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to suffer, and that as many other miseries, so <hi>death</hi> it self; and this his suffering is foretold as a Character to know and discern him by, that <hi>Jesus of Nazareth</hi> by so many other demonstrations, and evident tokens proved to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> did also suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the utmost that could be inflicted on a man, and in particular the things and evils which the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to undergo, we shall not need to prove; the <hi>Jews</hi> confess it, and even glory that their forefathers were the instrumental cause of his sufferings. Neither doth it at present concern us to declare what he suffered from God himself, what from man, what from <hi>Satan,</hi> in his life and death, in his soul and body, and all his concernments; it being abundantly sufficient unto our present purpose, that he suffered all manner of miseries; and lastly, <hi>death</hi> it self, and that not for himself, but for the sins of others.</p>
                  <p>The first evident Testimony given hereunto, is in <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. from the beginning to <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>42</label> the 22. <hi>vers.</hi> that <hi>sufferings,</hi> and those very great and unexpressible, are treated of in this <hi>Ps<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lm,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves confess, and the matter is too evident to be denied. That <hi>dereliction</hi> of God, tortures and pains in body and soul, revilings, mockings, with cruel death, are <hi>sufferings,</hi> is certain, and they are all here fore-told. Again, it is evident, that some <hi>individual person</hi> is designed as the subject of those <hi>sufferings.</hi> Most of the Jews would interpret this Psalm of the <hi>body of the people,</hi> to whom not <hi>one line</hi> in it can be properly applyed; for besides, that the person intended, is spoken of singularly throughout the whole Prophecy, he is also plainly distinguished from <hi>all the people,</hi> of what sort soever; from the <hi>evil</hi> amongst them who <hi>reviled</hi> and <hi>persecuted</hi> him, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. and from the residue, whom he calls his <hi>Brethren,</hi> and the Congregation of <hi>Israel, v.</hi> 22. It cannot then be the Congregation of <hi>Israel</hi> that is spoken of; for how can the <hi>Congregation of Israel</hi> be said to declare the praises of God, before the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Israel,</hi> which is the summ of <hi>Kimchi</hi>'s Exposition. Some of them from the title of the Psalm <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>for the hind of the morning,</hi> would have it to be a Prophecy of <hi>Hester,</hi> who appeared as <hi>beautiful</hi> as the morning in the deliverance of <hi>Israel.</hi> But as the Title is of another importance, respecting the <hi>nature of the Psalm,</hi> not the <hi>person</hi> treated of in it, so they are not able to apply <hi>one verse</hi> or <hi>word</hi> in it unto her. Others of them plead, that it is <hi>David</hi> himself who is intended; and this is not without some shadow of Truth; for <hi>David</hi> might in some things propose his own afflictions and <hi>sufferings,</hi> as <hi>Types</hi> of the sufferings of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> But there are many things in this Psalm that cannot be applied unto him absolutely. When did any <hi>open their lips, and shake their heads at him,</hi> using the words mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8? When was he, or his <hi>blood poured forth like water,</hi> and all his <hi>bones dis-joynted, v.</hi> 14? When were his <hi>hands and feet pierced, v.</hi> 16? When did any <hi>part his garments, and cast lots on his vesture, v.</hi> 18? When was he brought to the <hi>dust of death,</hi> before his last and final dissolution, <hi>v.</hi> 15? And yet all these things were to be accomplished in the person of him, who is principally treated of in this Psalm.</p>
                  <p>This whole Psalm then is a Prophecy of the Messiah, and absolutely of no other, as <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>43</label> may further be evidenced from sundry passages in the Psalm it self. For first, it treats of one in whom the welfare of the whole Church was concerned; they are therefore all of them invited to praise the Lord on his account, and for the event and success of his sufferings which they had the benefit of, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, Secondly, it is he, by whom the <hi>meek shall be satisfied,</hi> and obtain life eternal, <hi>v.</hi> 26. Thirdly, upon his <hi>sufferings,</hi> as the event and success of them the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are to be gathered in unto God, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>All the ends of the World shall remember and turn unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50110:122"/>
Nations shall worship before thee.</hi> And this by the confession of the <hi>Jews</hi> is the proper work of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> to be effected in his dayes and by him alone. Fourthly, The preaching of the Truth and Righteousness and Faithfulness of God in his Promise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Nations, that is of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> ensues on the sufferings described, <hi>v.</hi> 31. which they also acknowledge to belong unto his dayes: So that it is the <hi>Messiah</hi> and he alone, who is absolutely and ultimately intended in this Psalm.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>48</label> which at present they make unto our Application of this place unto the Messiah. It is rather rage then reason, that here they trust unto; and seem to cry, <hi>pereant &amp; amici, dummodo &amp; inimici pereant.</hi> Let <hi>Targum, Talmud, Cabal Tradition,</hi> former Masters be esteemed Lyars, and deceived; so that <hi>Christians</hi> may be disappointed. New Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Applications of this Prophecy they coin, wherein they openly contradict one another; yea, the same man (as <hi>Abarbinel</hi>) sometimes himself; and when they have done, suggest such things as are utterly inconsistent with the faith of the antient Church concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> with follies innumerable no way deserving our serious consideration. The chief things which they most confide in, we shall speedily remove out of our way.</p>
                  <p>First, Some of them say, that this Prophecy indeed concerneth the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but not <hi>Messiah Ben David,</hi> who shall be alwayes victorious, but <hi>Messiah Ben Joseph,</hi> who shall be slain in Battel against <hi>Gog and Magog.</hi> But (1.) This figment wholly overthrows the faith of the true <hi>Messiah</hi>; and they may as well make twenty as two of them. (2.) That <hi>Ben Joseph</hi> whom they have coyned in their own brains, is to be a great Warrior from his first appearance, and after many Victories to be slain in a Battle, or at least, be reputed so to be. But this Prophecy is concerning a man, poor, destitute, despised, afflicted all his life, bound, imprisoned, rejected, scorned, condemned and slain under a pretence of Judgement, no one thing whereof they do, or can ascribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>Ben Joseph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others feign that the true <hi>Messiah</hi> was born long ago, and that he lived amongst the <hi>leprous people at the Gates of</hi> Rome, being himself leprous, and full of sores; which as they say, is foretold in this Prophecy. Such <hi>monstrous imaginations</hi> as these might not be repeated without some kind of participation in the folly of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but that poor immortal souls are ruined by them; and that they evidence what a foolish thing man is when left unto himself, or judicially given up to blindness and unbelief. We are ready to admire at the senseless stupidity of their fore-fathers, they do so themselves, who chose to worship <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Moloch,</hi> rather then the true God, who had so eminently revealed himself unto them; but it doth no way exceed that of those who have lived since their rejection of the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> nor do we need any other instance then that before us to make good our Observation. And yet neither
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50110:123"/>
doth this Prodigie of folly, this <hi>leprosy,</hi> in any thing answer the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; nor indeed hath any countenance from any one word therein; that single word they reflect upon, signifying any kind of infirmities or sorrows in general.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some of them apply this Prophecy to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> concerning whom <hi>Abarbinel</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms and that truly, that no one Line or Verse in the whole can with any colourable pretence be applyed unto him; which also I have in particular manifested on another occasion. Himself applies it two wayes: (1.) To <hi>Josia</hi>; (2.) To the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the people; contradicting himself in the Exposition of every particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and the truth in the whole. But it is the whole people in their last desolation that they chiefly desire to wrest this Prophecy unto. But this is (1.) Contrary to the Testimony of their <hi>Targum,</hi> and <hi>Talmud,</hi> all their antient Masters, and some of the wisest of their latter Doctors. (2.) To their own principles, profession and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; for whereas they acknowledge that their present misery is continued on them for their sins, and that if they could but repent and live to God, their <hi>Messiah</hi> would undoubtedly come; this place speaks of the perfect Innocency and Righteousness of him that suffers, no way on his own account deserving so to do, which if they once ascribe unto themselves, their <hi>Messiah</hi> being not yet come, they must for ever bid <hi>adiew</hi> to all their expectations of him. (3.) Contrary to the express words of the Text, plainly describing <hi>one individual Person.</hi> (4.) Contrary to the Context, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing the people of the Jews, from him that was to suffer by them, among them, and for them, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6. (5.) Contrary to every particular assertion and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in the whole Prophecy, no one of them being applicable unto the body of the people. And all these things are so manifest unto every one who shall but read the place with attention, and without prejudice; that they stand not in need of any farther confirmation: Hence <hi>Johannes Isaac</hi> confesseth, that the consideration of this place, was the means of his conversion.</p>

First, Then they say, it is not the Prophet from the Lord, nor in the Persons of the people of the Jews, but the <hi>Kings of the Earth</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had afflicted them, who are mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 52. <hi>v.</hi> 15. who utter and speak the words of this Chapter, in an admiration of the blessed estate that the Jews shall at length attain unto. <hi>Answ.</hi> Any man that shall but view the Context, will easily see the shamefull folly of this evasion. For (1.) Where is there any instance in the whole Scripture of the like introduction of <hi>Aliens</hi> and <hi>Forreigners,</hi> and the Prophets personating of them in what they say, and why should such a singular imagination
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50110:123"/>
here take place? (2.) How could they say; <hi>Who hath believed our report,</hi> or the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that we had heard, and taught, concerning this person, or these persons? Had the Kings and Nations so preached the misery and happiness ensuing of the people of the Jews, that they are forced to complain of the increduli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y of men, that they would not believe them? and who would not believe them? The <hi>Jews,</hi> they believe it well enough; the Nations and their Kings, they are supposed to be the men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that they are not believed; so that the fondness of this imagination is beyond expression. (3.) How do they say, <hi>For the iniquity of my people he was stricken,</hi> v. 8. Who are they when the people themselves are supposed to speak? In brief, let all the Jews in the world, find out one expression in the whole Prophecy tolerably suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of theirs, and I shall be contented that the whole of it be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, and be used according to their desires.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They add, that the <hi>subject of this Prophecy</hi> is spoken of in the <hi>plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>52</label> and so cannot intend any one singular person. This they indeavour to prove from those words of the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <gap reason="foreign">

Lamo,</hi> is of the plural number, and so cannot respect any single person, but must denote the whole people. <hi>Answ.</hi> But what perverseness is this, whoever be intended in this Prophecy, he is spoken of <hi>twenty times</hi> as a single person; and such things spoken of him, as can by no artifices be suited unto any collective body of people; and shall one expression in the <hi>plural number</hi> out-weigh all these, and be made an Engine to pervert the whole context, and to render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible? (2.) Suppose yet the word to denote many, a people, and not one single person, will it not unavoidably follow, that here is a mention interserted occasionally of some other persons, besides him who is the principal subject of the Prophecy; and so the sense can be no other, but that the people of the Prophet, that is, the Jews, should assuredly be punished for the rejection of him, whose person and work he prophesied about.

The seed here, are the seed spoken of, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.30. <hi>A seed that shall serve the Lord,</hi> and be all accounted unto him for a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. That is a spiritual seed, as the Gentiles are called the <hi>Children of Sion brought forth upon her traveling,</hi> Isa. 66.8. Besides, how the Messiah shall obtain this <hi>seed,</hi> is expressed in the next verse; <hi>By his knowledge shall my righteous Servant justifie many</hi>; they are such as are converted to God by his Doctrine, and justified by Faith in him. And that <hi>Disciples</hi> should be called the <hi>seed,</hi> the <hi>off-spring,</hi> the <hi>children</hi> of their Masters, and Instructors, is so common among the Jews, and familiar unto them, as no phrases or expressions are more in use. Thus speaks expresly this Prophet also, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Behold, I and the Children whom the Lord hath given me</hi>; and who were their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he declares, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>bind up the Testimony, seal the Law among my Disciples:</hi> These were the Children whom the Lord had given him. And this is the summ of all that which any appearance of Reason is objected against our application of this place unto the <hi>Messiah</hi>; which how weak and trivial it is, is obvious unto every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary understanding.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>55</label> Agreeable unto these Testimonies the Jews themselves have a Tradition about the <hi>sufferings of the Messiah,</hi> which sometimes breaks forth amongst them. In <hi>Midrash Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hillim,</hi> on <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. <hi>Rabbi Hana in the name of</hi> Rabbi Idi, <hi>sayes, that the Messiah must bear the third part of the Affliction that shall ever be in the world.</hi> And <hi>R. Machir,</hi> in <hi>Abkath Kocheb,</hi> affirms, that <hi>God inquired of the soul of the Messiah at the beginning of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether he would endure sufferings and afflictions for the purging away the sins of his people, to which he answered, that he would hear them with joy.</hi> And that these sufferings of the Messiah are such, as that without the consideration of them, no rational account can be given of any of their services or sacrifices, shall in our Exposition be fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Now upon these Testimonies it is evident, that the great Argument used by the Jews to disprove <hi>Jesus of Nazareth</hi> from being the true Messiah, namely, his meanness, poverty, persecutions, and sufferings in this world, doth strongly confirm the truth of our faith, that he only was so indeed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>56</label> Unto these Characters given of the Messiah, we may also subjoyn sundry invincible Arguments proving our Lord Jesus Christ to be he that was promised. I shall add on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some few of them, and that very briefly, because they have been by others in an especial manner at large insisted on.</p>
                  <p>First, Then he testified of himself that he was the Messiah, and that those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not that he was so, should perish in their sins. Now because, according unto a general Rule he granted, that although the Testimony which he gave concerning himself, being the Testimony of the Son of God, was true, yet that it might be justly liable to exception amongst them, for the confirmation of his Assertion, he appeals to the <hi>works</hi> that he wrought, issuing the difference and question about his Testimony in this, that if his works were not such as never any other man wrought, or ever could work, but the Messiah only, that they should be at liberty as to their believing in him. <hi>The works, saith he, that my Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me,</hi> Joh. 5.36. that is, to be the Messiah. His own Record he asserts to be true, appeals also to the Testimony of <hi>John,</hi> but shews it withall inferiour to those other witnesses which he had; namely, the Scripture and his own works. And so also, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.37. <hi>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>57</label> Many things might be insisted on for the confirmation of this Argument; I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point at the <hi>Heads</hi> of them; nor is there more necessary unto our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> All true real <hi>Miracles</hi> are effects of divine Power. Many things prodigious, marvelous, or monstrous, besides the common and ordinary productions of nature, may be asserted, and brought forth by an extraordinary <hi>concurrence</hi> of Causes, not usually falling in such a juncture and coincidence; many may be wrought by the great, hidden, and to us unknown power of <hi>wicked spirits</hi>; many things may have an appearance of prodigie and wonder, by the force of some <hi>deceit,</hi> pretence, or delusion, that attend the manner of their declaration. But <hi>real Miracles</hi> are effects so above, besides, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature and efficacy of any, or all natural Causes, that by no application or disposition of them, though never so uncouth or unusual, they can be produced, and therefore must of necessity be the effects of an Almighty <hi>Creating Power,</hi> causing somewhat to exist in matter or manner out of nothing, or out of that which is more adverse unto the being or manner of existence given unto it, then nothing its self. Such are the works of <hi>raising the dead</hi>; opening the eyes of men born blind, &amp;c. And this Position the Jews will not deny, seeing they make it the foundation of their adherence unto the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>58</label> Secondly, When God puts forth his <hi>Miracle-working Power,</hi> in the confirmation of any word or Doctrine, he avows it to be of, and from himself; to be absolutely and infallibly true; setting the fullest and openest seal unto it, which men who cannot discern his Essence or Being, are capable of receiving or discerning. And therefore
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50110:124"/>
when any Doctrine which in its self is such as becometh the Holiness and Righteousness of God, is confirmed by the emanation of his divine Power in the <hi>working of Miracles,</hi> there can no greater Assurance, even by God himself, be given of the Truth of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord Jesus, in the daies of his flesh, wrought many great, <hi>real Miracles,</hi> in the confirmation of the Testimony that he gave concerning himself, that <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>59</label> he was the Christ the Son of God. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. <hi>chap.</hi> 7.31. <hi>chap.</hi> 10.25. <hi>chap.</hi> 12.37. Greater confirmation it could not have. Now that the Lord Jesus wrought the Miracles recorded by the Evangelists with others innumerable that are not recorded, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.30. <hi>chap.</hi> 21.25. We have in general, all the Testimony, Evidence, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that any man can possibly have of things which he saw not done with his own eyes; and to suppose that a man can have no assurance of any thing but what he sees or feels himself, as it overthrows all the foundations of knowledge in the world, and of all humane society, yea of every thing that as men we either do, or know; so being once granted, it will necessarily follow that we know not the things that we see any longer then whilst we see them; no nor perhaps then neither; seeing the evidence we have of knowing any thing by our senses, proceeds from principles and presumptions, which we never saw, nor can ever so do. And as for the Jews, we have all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the confirmation of what we affirm, that either we are capable of, or need to desire.</p>
                  <p>First, We plead our own Records, that are written by the <hi>Evangelists.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have but one request to make unto the Jews; namely, that they would lay no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>60</label> against them, which they know to be of equal force against the writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> and all the Prophets. If they declare themselves to be such <hi>Bedlams,</hi> as to set their own houses on fire, for no other end, but to endanger their neighbours; if they will destroy the principles of their own Faith and Religion, to cast the <hi>broken pieces</hi> of them at the heads of Christians; if they cry, <hi>pereant amici dummodo &amp; pereant inimici,</hi> they are not fit to be any longer contended withall. I desire then to know what one Exception the Jews can lay against this Record, which <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> may not be laid against the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Writings: And if they have alwaies concluded all such Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to be invalid as to an opposition unto those grounds and evidences on which they believe those Writings; why will they not give us leave to affirm the same of them, in reference unto those which we receive and believe, on no less certain Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Evidencies. Unless then they can except any thing to the <hi>credit</hi> of our Writers, or disprove that which is written by them, from Records of equal weight with them, which they can never do, nor do attempt it, they have nothing reasonable to plead in this Cause. To tell us that they do not believe what is written by them, neither did their forefathers, is, as to themselves no more then we know, and as to their forefathers, nothing but what those very Writers testifie concerning them; and to look for <hi>their consent</hi> unto that in any Record, which that Record witnesseth that they dissented from, is to overthrow the Record it self, and all that is contained in it. The Jews then have nothing to oppose unto this Testimony, but only their own unbelief; which for all the Reasons that have been insisted on, cannot be admitted as any just Exception; story or circumstance they have none to oppose unto it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We plead the <hi>Notoriety</hi> of the Miracles wrought by Christ, and the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> delivering them down unto us. This also the Jews plead concerning the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>61</label> of <hi>Moses.</hi> They were, say they, openly wrought in the sight of all <hi>Israel,</hi> and that they were so wrought, the Testimony of <hi>Israel</hi> in succeeding Ages, is, next the Writings its self, the best and only witness they have of them. And wherein doth our Testimony come short of theirs? Nay, on both accounts, of their <hi>first notoriety,</hi> and succeeding Tradition, it far exceeds what they have to plead. For as the Miracles of <hi>Moses</hi> were wrought openly; so the most of them were so only in the sight of that one People whom he had under his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in a wilderness, remote from any converse with other Nations; and that in those <hi>dark times</hi> of the world, wherein men were generally stupid and credulous, as having not been imposed on by the delusions, which the following Ages were awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by. The Jews also lay no greater weight on any Miracles then th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y do on those which were wrought in the wilderness of <hi>Midian,</hi> which had no witness unto them, but that of <hi>Moses</hi> himself. But the Miracles of <hi>Jesus</hi> were all, or most of them, wrought before the eyes of <hi>multitudes,</hi> envying, hating, and persecuting of him; and that in the most <hi>knowing daies</hi> of the world, when Reason and Learning had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the light of the minds of men, to the utmost of their capacity, in, and upon
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50110:125"/>
multitudes for sundry years together, being all of them sifted by his adversaries, to try if they could discover any thing of deceit in them. And although his <hi>personal Ministry</hi> was confined to one Nation, yet the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by his Disciples in his Name and by his Power, for the confirmation of his being the <hi>Messiah,</hi> were spread all the world over, so that all mankind were filled first with the report of them, and then satisfied with their truth; and lastly, the generality of them with faith in him, which they directed unto. The <hi>notoriety</hi> therefore of his Miracles, far exceedeth that of those of <hi>Moses.</hi> And for the means whereby the certainty of them is continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, whether we respect the <hi>number</hi> of persons confirming it, or their <hi>quality,</hi> or their dis-interest as to any carnal advantage, or their <hi>suffering</hi> for their Testimony, it is notorious that the Jews condition confined meerly to themselves, is no way to be compared with it. So that we may truly say, that no Jew can possibly on any rational account, give credit unto the Truth of the Miracles wrought by <hi>Moses,</hi> and deny it unto them wrought by the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>62</label> But yet there seems somewhat further necessary in this case. Though there were <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by our Saviour, yet they might be every way <hi>inferiour</hi> unto them wrought by <hi>Moses,</hi> and so not sufficient to testifie unto a Doctrine and Authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving and abolishing the Laws and Customs instituted by <hi>Moses.</hi> And this the Jews of old seemed to have had respect unto, in their endless tumultuary Calling after <hi>Signs</hi> and Miracles. And hence, though the Lord Christ sometimes pleaded with them the works that he wrought, leaving them to stand and fall according unto the evidence of them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.24. <hi>chap.</hi> 10.37. As also did the Apostles afterwards, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.22. unto the astonishment of all, and satisfaction of the less obdurate, <hi>Job.</hi> 7.31. <hi>chap.</hi> 12.37. Yet both he himself constantly refused to gratifie their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity and unbelief, when they required any <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Miracle</hi> of him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.38, 39. <hi>chap.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.29. And the Apostle expresly condemneth the whole principle in them, as that which in the preaching of the Gospel was not to be gratified, nor much attended unto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. But yet neither is there any strength wanting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Argument on this account also. For although it be not at all necessary, that he who comes with an after-Revelation of the will of God, reversing any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore established, should be attested unto with <hi>more Miracles,</hi> or those that are more sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, then he or they were, who were the instruments of the first Revelation of things to be repealed (seeing no more is required but that he be <hi>sufficiently evidenced</hi> to be sent of God, which may be done by one true real Miracle, as well as by a thousand) yet the wisdom of God hath so ordered things, that the Miracles wrought by the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> did on many accounts exceed those wrought by <hi>Moses,</hi> as by a comparison in some particular instances will appear.</p>
                  <p>First, The number of them gives them the preheminence. The Jews contend that <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>63</label> there were seventy six <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by <hi>Moses,</hi> whereas those of all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as they observe, amount but unto <hi>seventy four</hi>; for so do they lay hold on every occasion to exalt <hi>him,</hi> who yet judgeth and condemneth them. To make up this number, they reckon up sundry things that happened about his <hi>birth,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> far enough from <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by him, or in the confirmation of his Ministry: They add also every extraordinary work of God that fell out in his daies, to the same purpose. Be it so then, that so many Miracles were wrought by <hi>Moses,</hi> as we are far from diminishing any thing of the Glory of his Ministry, yet what are those compared unto those wrought by Christ, and his Apostles, in his Name, and by his Power and Authority? Those that are recorded of his own, are not easily reckoned up, and yet those that are <hi>written,</hi> are far the least part of what he did perform, and that in the space of three or four years, whereas those of <hi>Moses</hi> were scattered unto the whole course of his life, for an hundred and twenty years. Thus <hi>John</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, that he did many more signs besides those that are written, <hi>chap.</hi> 20.30, 31. and that his Testimony is equal unto that of <hi>Moses,</hi> we have proved before. He adds, that the <hi>world could not contain the Books</hi> that might be written of his Miracles, <hi>chap.</hi> 21.25. by which <hi>usual hyperbole,</hi> a great multitude is designed.</p>
                  <p>Nor did the Writers of the Story of the Gospel agree to give an account of all the <hi>Miracles</hi> that were wrought by the Author of it, but only to leave sufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances on record of his Divine Power, in the effecting of them. For this end they singled out some works that were occasionally attended with some Disputes or Preachings, tending unto the opening and confirmation of the Doctrine of the Gospel. Thus upon the coming of the Disciples of <hi>John</hi> unto him, it is said, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.21. <hi>In
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50110:125"/>
that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits, and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</hi> The particular stories of none of these are any where mentioned; nor had that season been at all remembred, but upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of those Persons who were sent unto him; the present works which they saw, being made the ground of that answer which he returned unto their Master; <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Go tell</hi> John <hi>the things which ye have seen and heard, how that the blind see, &amp;c.</hi> Considering therefore what is elsewhere written, of all the <hi>Regions about bringing in their sick,</hi> weak, and impotent, and of the cures of Persons by the touching of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is evident that his Personal Miracles amounted unto thousands, which might well give occasion to the <hi>Hyperbole</hi> used by <hi>John</hi> in recounting of them. Hence some among the Jews were convinced that he was the Messiah, not only by the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> but also by the <hi>number</hi> of his works, John 7.31. <hi>Many of the People believed on him, and said, when Christ cometh will he do more Miracles then these, which this man doeth?</hi> And what are the seventy six Miracles of <hi>Moses</hi> unto those, as to number, which in the first place the Jews glory in? And if we may add those which were wrought by his power by them that preached the Gospel on his Commission: as they are all of the same efficacy unto the end proposed, or confirmation of his being the <hi>Messiah,</hi> they amount not unto <hi>thousands</hi> only, but probably unto <hi>millions.</hi> For of this sort were all the <hi>miraculous gifts</hi> of the Holy Ghost, that were granted unto the Church all the world over. So that as to the <hi>number of Miracles,</hi> he was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by them attested unto, to be the Messiah, the great Law-giver of the people of the New Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Again, The Jews much insist on this, that all other Prophets wrought Miracles by <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>64</label> the <hi>Intervention of Prayer, Moses</hi> alone without it at his own pleasure. The <hi>Rod</hi> they say was committed unto him as a <hi>Kingly Scepter,</hi> to denote that Authority whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole nature of things gave place. It is true indeed it is not recorded that <hi>Moses prayed</hi> in words before every Miracle that was wrought by him; or in reference unto his Ministry: but yet this is plain in story, that he wrought no <hi>mighty work,</hi> but either upon his prayer, or some express command and direction from God in particular; which everts the <hi>Judaical pretence</hi> of an abiding power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining with him, enabling him to work Miracles when and how he would. But this which they falsly ascribe unto <hi>Moses,</hi> was eminently true in the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> Those thousands of miraculous works which he wrought, were the arbitrary effects of a word of command, without any especial direction for every new work; argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the constant presence of an infinite power with him exerted according to his will. <hi>Come forth of him, come out of the grave, I will, be thou clean, be ye opened,</hi> and the like expressions he used as signs and pledges thereof. Thus was it not with <hi>Moses,</hi> as the story manifests; yea, he himself greatly doubted of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est effect of the Divine power put forth by him, when he <hi>smote the Rock to bring forth water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>nature</hi> of the Miracles also wrought by the one and the other may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>65</label> and we shall see from thence on which side the pre-eminence will be found. For those wrought by <hi>Moses,</hi> or by God himself whilest he employed him in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of giving the Law, and the delivery of the people, they were for the most part <hi>portentous Prodigies,</hi> suited to fill men with wonder, astonishment and fear. Such were all the signs of the presence of God on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> The effects also of most of them were evil and destructive, proceeding from wrath and indignation against sin and sinners; such were all the mighty works wrought in <hi>Aegypt</hi>; such those of the swallowing up of <hi>Dathan and Abiram</hi> in the Wilderness. Those that tended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the good and relief of mankind, as the bringing of <hi>water from the rock,</hi> were ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, and occasional. And those kinds of works were suited unto that <hi>Ministry of Death</hi> and <hi>Condemnation,</hi> which was committed unto him. But on the other side, the mighty works of the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> were evidently effects of Goodness, as well as of Power, and consisted in things useful and helpful unto mankind. <hi>Healing the sick,</hi> opening the eyes of the blind, and ears of the deaf, giving strength to the lame; casting out of Devils, feeding hungry multitudes, raising the dead, are things <hi>amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and useful. And though <hi>terrible Prodigies</hi> may more affect and astonish carnal minds, such as the <hi>Jews</hi> were filled with, yet these works of Grace and Goodness, do more allure those who attend unto the dictates of right Reason. Evidences they were of a <hi>gracious Ministry,</hi> tending unto salvation and peace, in every kind; such as that of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was promised and foretold to be. As <hi>Miracles</hi> then were the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50110:126"/>
tokens of their several Ministries, and bespake the nature of them, those of the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> were exceedingly more excellent then those of <hi>Moses.</hi>

                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>66</label> Furthermore, as <hi>Moses</hi> had not a power of working <hi>miracles</hi> constantly resident with him, which he might exert according unto his own will; so he was very far from being able to <hi>communicate</hi> any such power unto others. God indeed took of <hi>the Spirit</hi> that was on him, and gave it unto the <hi>Elders</hi> that were to be joyned with him in the Government of the people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.25. but yet neither was there a power of working <hi>miracles</hi> going along with that Spirit, but only ability for Rule and Government; nor yet was that communication of it any act of <hi>Moses</hi> at all. But now our <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> as he had the Divine Power mentioned alwayes with him, so he could give Authority and Power unto whom he pleased, to <hi>effect</hi> all such <hi>miraculous works,</hi> as were any way necessary for the confirmation of their Doctrine. Of this nature was the Commission which he gave the <hi>Twelve</hi> when he sent them forth, Matth. 10.8. <hi>Heal the sick, cleanse the Lepers, raise the dead, cast out Devils.</hi> As also that unto the <hi>LXX. Luke</hi> 10.17, 19. yea, he promised them, which also came to pass, that by his power and presence with them, <hi>they should do greater things then those which they had seen him to do.</hi> John 14.12. Mark 16.17. And this difference is so eminent that nothing can be objected against it. This more evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed him to be the <hi>Master,</hi> then all the mighty works which he wrought in his own Person on the earth.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>67</label> Again, all the <hi>miracles</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> ended with his life. The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed some of them tell us a company of foolish stories about his death, which as their manner is, they would fix on those words, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.5. and <hi>Moses</hi> dyed <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) <hi>the Angel of Death,</hi> and drove him away with his rod, so that he could not dye, until God laid his mouth unto his, and so took out his soul from him. But these <hi>figments</hi> are shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and such as become none but themselves. However these things extended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto his death; therewith ended his Ministry and Miracles. But now the greatest <hi>Miracle</hi> of our Lord Jesus, was wrought by him, after the <hi>violent and cruel death</hi> which he underwent for our sakes. For he <hi>took his life</hi> again, and raised himself from the dead, <hi>John</hi> 10.17, 18. This being performed by him, after the dissolution of his <hi>humane nature</hi> in the open visible separation of his body and soul, in which state it was utterly impossible, that that nature should put forth any act toward the retrievement of its former condition, manifested his <hi>existence</hi> in another superiour nature, acting with power on the humane in the same Person. And this one Miracle was a sufficient <hi>vindication</hi> of the truth which he had taught concerning himself; namely, that he was the <hi>Messiah</hi> the Son of God. And though any should question his being raised again from the dead by his own power, yet the evidence is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable, that he was raised again by the power of God, without the application of the means and Ministry of any other; whereby the Holy and Eternal God of truth, entitled himself unto all that he had taught concerning his Person and Office, whilest he was alive. And this leaves no room for haesitation in this matter: For this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, none will deny, but that he was the Messiah; and what principles we proceed upon for the proof of it unto the Jews, hath been before declared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>68</label> Unto what hath been summarily recounted, we may lastly add the <hi>continuance</hi> of the miracles wrought by his power, after his leaving of this world, and his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Heaven. And there is in them an <hi>additional evidence</hi> unto what hath been insisted on. For whereas the <hi>miraculous works</hi> that were wrought by himself and his Disciples, whilest he conversed with them in the flesh, were confined, as we observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, unto the <hi>Land of Canaan,</hi> those who afterwards received power from above by his Grant and Donation, continued to assert the like mighty works and miracles all the world over; so that within the space of a <hi>few years,</hi> there was scarce a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Town or City in the world, wherein some of his Disciples had not received the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost. And this also distinctly confirms him to be the promised Messiah: for whereas the <hi>Isles of the Gentiles were to wait for, and to receive his Law,</hi> it was necessary that among them also it should receive this solemn kind of attestation from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>69</label> Now from what hath been spoken it appears, not only that the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by Jesus, were sufficient to confirm the Testimony which he gave concerning himself; namely, that he was the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Son of God; but also that they were so much more eminent then those wherewith God was pleased to confirm the <hi>Ministry
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50110:126"/>
of Moses</hi> in the giving of the Law, that the Jews have no Reason to doubt or question his Authority, for the reversing of any Institutions of Worship, which they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been obliged unto.</p>
                  <p>To close this Argument, I shall only manifest, that the Jews of old were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>70</label> of the truth of the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by the Lord Jesus, and therein a little discover the variety of those pretences, whereby they attempt to shield themselves from the natural consequence of that conviction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For those who lived in his own dayes: see <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.31. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.16, 24. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.13. Neither did they at any time, dispute his works, but only the power whereby they were wrought: of which afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The fame and reputation of them, was such amongst them, that those who made an Art and Trade of <hi>casting out of Devils,</hi> used the invocation of the name of <hi>Jesus</hi> over their possessed, which the notoriety of his exerting his Divine power in that kind of works, induced them unto: See Acts 19.13. They <hi>adjured the Spirits by the Name of Jesus whom</hi> Paul <hi>preached,</hi> observing the miracles that he wrought in that name. For they being ignorant of the true way and means whereby the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle wrought his miraculous works, after the manner of <hi>Magicians</hi> they used the name of him whom he preached, in their <hi>Exorcisms,</hi> as it was ever the custom of that sort of men to intermix their charms with the names of such persons, as they knew to have excelled in mighty works. And that this was common among the Jews of those dayes, is evident from <hi>Luke</hi> 9.49. which could no otherwise arise, but from a general consent in the acknowledgement of the works wrought by him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have also hereunto the suffrage of the <hi>Talmudical Rabbins</hi> themselves, the most malitious adversaries that ever the Lord Jesus had in this world. They intend not indeed to bear witness unto his miracles; but partly whilest they relate stories that were continued amongst them by <hi>Tradition,</hi> partly whilest they endeavour to shield their unbelief from the Arguments taken from them, they <hi>tacitly</hi> acknowledge, that they were indeed wrought by him. This I say they do, whilest they labour to shew by what wayes and means those <hi>Prodigies,</hi> and <hi>wondrou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> works</hi> which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of him, were wrought and effected. For they who say <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> was the way, whereby such a thing was accomplished, do plainly acknowledge the doing of the thing it self; Greater evidence of their self-conviction, it is impossible they should give in or need we desire.</p>
                  <p>First, In the <hi>Talmud</hi> its self they have <hi>traditional stories</hi> of <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>71</label> 
                     <hi>Disciples of Jesus,</hi> and by others in his name; which although they are like the rest of their Narrations, foolish and insipid, yet they evidence the <hi>Tradition</hi> that was amongst them from the forementioned conviction. Thus in <hi>Aboda Zara</hi> they have a story concerning <hi>James</hi> (who lived longest amongst them) <hi>It happened they say, that</hi> Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer <hi>the Son of</hi> Dama <hi>was bitten by a Serpent; and</hi> James <hi>of the Village of</hi> Sechaniah (<hi>that is</hi> Bethany) <hi>came to cure him in the name of Jesus</hi> (the son of <hi>Pandira</hi>) <hi>but</hi> R. Ishmael <hi>opposed him, and said, it is not lawful for thee thou Son of</hi> Dama: So owning that Miracles and Cures were wrought by <hi>James</hi> in the name of Jesus. And in <hi>Sabbat. Hierusal. Distinct. Schemona Scheraticin</hi>: they tell us that the Son of <hi>Rab. Jose the Son of Levi</hi> had swallowed poyson; a certain man came and <hi>communed with him in the name of Jesus the Son of</hi> Pandira; and he was healed; but when he was gone out, one said unto him, how <hi>didst thou advice him, he said by such a word</hi>; the other replied, <hi>tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> it had been better for him to have dyed, then to have heard that word.</hi> I mention these things, only to shew that they were never able to stifle the Tradition that passed among themselves, concerning the Miracles wrought by Jesus and his Disciples.</p>
                  <p>But this conviction more evidently discovers its self in their endeavours to assign his <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>72</label> 
                     <hi>mighty works</hi> unto other causes, so that they may not from them be forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his <hi>Divine power,</hi> and the presence of God with him. And there are two pretences which they make use of. The first is that of their fore-fathers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.24. They would have the <hi>Devil</hi> to be the Author of them, and that he wrought them by <hi>Magical Incantations.</hi> This they pleaded of old; and this some of them pretend to adhere unto, to this day; the folly of which <hi>blasphemy</hi> both reflects upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and is demonstratively removable from him, whom to their eternal ruine, they seek to reproach. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do they not know, that their own <hi>Moses</hi> was generally esteemed by the wisest of the Heathen, to have been skilled and exercised in Magick. So <hi>Pliny</hi> and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50110:127"/>
                     <hi>Apuleius</hi> testifie, and that he wrought wonders by vertue thereof, as <hi>Celsus</hi> contends at large. And can they fix on a readier course to confirm such a suspicion in the minds of <hi>Atheistical Scoffers,</hi> then by their own taking up the same accusation against the Author of more, and greater miracles then those wrought by <hi>Moses?</hi> What co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of answer can they return unto his reproaches, whilest themselves with more open impudence manage the same accusation against the Lord Jesus? Besides, as is confessed, <hi>Aegypt</hi> was the spring of Magical incantations, the worlds <hi>Academy</hi> for that diabolical cunning, where, almost alone, it was had in honour and reputation. There in the <hi>Kings Court</hi> had <hi>Moses</hi> his education and conversation forty years. How much more just then, though sufficiently unjust, might a suspicion seem concerning him of his being skilled in that falsly called <hi>Wisdom,</hi> then concerning our <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> who was persecuted thither, and returned thence in his infancy, which they childishly object unto him? So that in this whole vain pretence they do nothing but attempt to cast down their own foundations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither indeed do they account the skill in, and use of <hi>Magical incantations</hi> a crime, but an Excellency. <hi>Josephus</hi> would have us believe that the Art of Magick, and the invention of incantations, was part of the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon.</hi> And their <hi>Talmudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctors</hi> do expresly approve of that diabolical Art. Nothing then but extream malice and desperation, would put them upon inventing this Cloke for their infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which not only casts down the foundation of their own Profession, but involves also a contradiction unto those Principles, which at other times they avouch. So that <hi>Rabbi Achor</hi> was mistaken when he gave out that as a Prophecy, which was indeed an history, namely, that a <hi>generation of ungodly men among the Jews</hi> would not believe the things that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should do, but should affirm that he doth them by <hi>Art Magical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>73</label> For the <hi>blasphemy</hi> its self, there needs no other answer be given unto it, but what was returned by our Lord Jesus of old. If these things had been done by <hi>Magical incantations,</hi> and consequently the assistance of the Devil, it must needs be upon a <hi>division</hi> of those wicked spirits among themselves, and that upon the main design of their Kingdom, Dominion and Interest in this world. The open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed work of <hi>our Lord Jesus</hi> in this world, was by all wayes and means to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Kingdom of Satan and his works. This he <hi>privately</hi> taught, this he <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</hi> declared to be the main end of his coming into this world. The Works and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which he wrought, were very many, innumerable of them exercised on Devils, themselves, to their shame, terror, and <hi>dispossession</hi> of the habitations they had invaded. In, and during this work, he declares them to all the world, to be evil, wicked, malicious, <hi>unclean,</hi> and lying spirits, reserved for everlasting destruction in Hell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wrath of the great God. For this cause, they on the other side ceased not to <hi>oppose</hi> him, and to stir up all the world against him, untill they thought they had prevailed in his death. If men therefore shall imagine or fancy, that the works of Christ against the <hi>interest</hi> of Satan, upon his <hi>Person,</hi> unto his shame; wrought to confirm a Doctrine, teaching all the world to avoid him, abhor him, fight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend against him, commending every thing that he hates, with promises of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal unto them who forsake him, and maintain his quarrel against him, threatning every thing that he loves, and labours to promote in the world with eternal ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, were wrought by his help and assistance, they had more need to be sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place where the maladies of those distracted of their Wits are attended, then to have an answer given unto their folly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>74</label> They have yet another pretence to preserve themselves from the efficacy of this self-conviction. But this is so perfectly <hi>Judaical</hi>; that is, so full of <hi>monstrous, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous figments,</hi> that nothing but an aim to discover their present desperate folly, and with what unmanly inventions, they endeavour to cover themselves from the light of their own conviction, can give countenance unto the repetition of it. Besides the <hi>Fable</hi> its self is vulgarly known, and I shall therefore only give a brief <hi>compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of it, seeing it may not be wholly avoided.</p>
                  <p>The story they tell us is this; There was a <hi>stone</hi> in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> under the Ark, wherein was written <hi>Shem Hamphorash,</hi> (so the Cabalists call the Name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi>) He that could learn this Name, might by the vertue of it, do what <hi>miracles</hi> he pleased. Wherefore the <hi>Wise men</hi> fearing what might ensue thereon, made two <hi>Brazen Dogs,</hi> and set them on two Pillars before the door of the Sanctuary: And it was so, that when any one went in, and learned that Name, as he came out, those
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50110:127"/>
                     <hi>Dogs barked</hi> so horribly, that they frighted him, and made him forget the Name that he had learned. But <hi>Jesus of Nazareth</hi> going in, wrote the Name in Parchment, and put it within the skin of his leg, and closed the skin upon it; so that though he lost the remembrance of it at his coming out, by the barking of the brazen Dogs, yet he recovered the knowledge of it again out of the <hi>Parchment in his leg</hi>; and by vertue thereof, he wrought miracles, walked on the Sea, cured the lame, raised the dead, and opened the eyes of the blind. That alone which from hence we aim to evince, is the conviction that the most stubborn of the Jews had of the miracles of our blessed Saviour. Had they not been openly performed, and undeniably attested<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no Creatures that ever had the shape of men, or any thing more of modesty then the <hi>Brazen Dogs</hi> they talk of, would have betaken themselves to such monstrous foolish figments, for a countenance and pretence unto the rejection of him and them. He that should contend, that the Sun did not shine all the last year, and should give this reason of his Assertion, because a certain man of his acquaintance climbed up to Heaven by a Ladder, and put him in a Box, and kept him close in his Chamber all that while, would speak to the full, with as much probability and appearance of truth, as the <hi>grand Rabbins</hi> do in this Tale. Every word in their story is a <hi>Monster.</hi> The <hi>stone,</hi> the <hi>writing of the name of God in it,</hi> the <hi>vertue of the pronuntiation of that name,</hi> the <hi>Brazen Dogs,</hi> the <hi>entrance of a private man</hi> into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi>; the <hi>bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Dogs,</hi> are Dreams becoming men under a poenal infatuation and blindness, not much distant from those <hi>Chains of Darkness</hi> wherewith Satan himself is kept bound unto the Judgement of the Great Day.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We must not forget the <hi>Testimony of his Disciples</hi> who conversed with <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>75</label> him, and were eye Witnesses of his Miracles, especially of his rising from the dead. These, with multitudes ascertained of the Truth by their Testimony, to witness it unto the world willingly forewent all temporal interests, exposing themselves to dangers innumerable; and lastly, sealed their Testimony with their <hi>blood, shed</hi> by the most exquisite tortures that the malice of Hell could invent, all in expectation of acceptance with him, and a reward from him, which depended on the truth of the Miracles, which they asserted him to have wrought and performed. From all these considerations, we may safely conclude, that it is utterly impossible, that the nature of man should be more ascertained of any thing that ever was in this world, then we may be of the <hi>Miracles wrought by our Lord Jesus.</hi> Now all these as we have declared, were wrought by the Divine Power of God to confirm the Truth of his being the promised Messiah. And if this were not so, it is impossible that God should ever more require an Assent unto any <hi>Revelation</hi> of his mind or Will, none being capable of a more evident and full confirmation so to be, then this hath received, of <hi>Jesus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Christ.</hi> The Application of this Consideration in particular unto his <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead,</hi> hath been the special subject of so many Writers, that I shall not farther insist upon it.</p>
                  <p>One Argument more, taken from the success that the Doctrine of Jesus hath had <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>76</label> in the world, shall close this Discourse. What was his outward condition in this world, we acknowledge, and the Jews triumph in. The <hi>Poverty</hi> of it, the Contempt and Reproach that it was exposed unto, was one of the chief pretences that they had, and have to this day for their refusal of him. The time wherein he came, was that as hath been shewed, wherein the Jews were in daily expectation of their <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> and when the residue of mankind were in the full enjoyment of all that Light, Wisdom and Knowledge, which the Principles of nature could attain unto. In this state of things, a poor man, living in an obscure Village of <hi>Galilee,</hi> not taught by men so much as to <hi>read,</hi> begins to Preach and to declare himself to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Son of God, the Saviour of the World. With this Testimony he declares a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine destructive of the <hi>Religion</hi> and Sacred Worship of all, and every man then liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world; of the <hi>Jews</hi> as to the manner of it, which they esteemed above its substance, and of all others, of its very nature and being; and presseth a Course of Obedience unto God, decried by them all. To encourage men to believe in him, and to accept of his Testimony, he gives them Promises of what he would do for them when this life should be ended: No sooner doth he undertake this work, but the <hi>Jews</hi> amongst whom he conversed, almost universally, at least all the great wise learned, and esteemedly devout amongst them, set themselves to scorn, despise, reproach and persecute him. And this course they ceased not, untill conspiring with the power of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they took him out of the world as a <hi>Malefactor,</hi> by a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50110:128"/>
shamefull and ignominious death. After which he riseth again from the dead, and shews himself neither unto <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Gentiles</hi> in common, but only to some <hi>poor men</hi> chosen by himself, to be his Witnesses and Apostles. These begin to teach both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> the things before mentioned. The <hi>Jews</hi> more deeply engaged then formerly, by having slain their Master, immediately persecute them, and that unto death. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> at first deride and scorn them, but quickly changed their note, and set all their Wit and Power at work to extirpate them, and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers out of the world. The <hi>Jews</hi> on many accounts looked upon themselves as ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined and undone for ever, if their Testimony were admitted. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> saw that on the same supposition, they must foregoe all their <hi>Religion,</hi> and therewith every thing wherewith they pleased themselves in this world. Invisible <hi>infernal powers</hi> who ruled in the world by Superstition and Idolatry were no less engaged against them. With them was neither <hi>humane Wisdom</hi> or Counsels nor <hi>external force</hi>; yea, the use of both in their work was by their Master severely interdicted unto them. Had not the Truth and Power of God been engaged with him, and for him, it is such a madness to suppose that this undertaking could have been carried on, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that issue and event in the conquest of mankind, which it at length obtained, as no man not utterly forsaken of reason, or cursed with blindness of mind, or made sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and stupid by the power of his Lusts, can make himself guilty of. Many are the branches of this Argument, many the considerations that concur in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of evidence and strength unto it, all which to examine and improve, is beyond our present design. The bare proposal of it, is sufficient to cause all <hi>Jewish</hi> Exceptions to vanish out of the minds of sober and reasonable men. From it therefore, with them that went before, we conclude the third part of our general <hi>Thesis</hi> concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi>; namely, <hi>That</hi> Jesus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth <hi>whom</hi> Paul <hi>Preached was He.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THat which remaineth for a close unto these Dissertations, is the consideration <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>1</label> of those <hi>Reasons and Arguments,</hi> wherewith the <hi>present Jews</hi> do endeavour, and their fore-fathers for many Generations have laboured, to defend their obstinacy and unbelief. And this we shall engage into, with as much <hi>briefness</hi> as the nature of the matter treated of will admit. Many are the Books which they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten among themselves, mostly in the <hi>Hebrew Tongue,</hi> and some in other Languages; but the <hi>Hebrew Character,</hi> against Christians and their Religion. Unto sundry of these they give triumphant insulting Titles, as though they had undoubtedly obtained a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Victory over their Adversaries; but the <hi>Books</hi> themselves in nothing answer their specious <hi>Frontispieces.</hi> Take away wilful mistakes, gross <hi>Paralogisms,</hi> false Stories, and some few <hi>Grammatical nicities,</hi> and they vanish into nothing. What is spoken by them, or for them, that seems to have any weight shall be produced and examined.</p>
                  <p>Sundry things they object unto the Doctrine of the Gospel, concerning the <hi>Person of the Messiah,</hi> or his being God and man, the rejection of the <hi>Mosaical Ceremonies,</hi> and Law, which they deem eternal, and many exceptions they lay against parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular passages and expressions, in the <hi>Historical Books</hi> of the New Testament. But all these things have been long since cleared and answered by others, and I have also my self spoken to the most important of them, partly, in the preceding Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; partly, in my defence of the Deity, and satisfaction of Christ against the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> For what concerns the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> and the abolition of it, as to the <hi>Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship</hi> therein instituted, it must be at large insisted on in that Exposition of the <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews,</hi> which these discourses are only intended to make way unto. I shall not here therefore enter upon a particular discussion of their Opinions, Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Objections about these things: besides, they belong not immediately to the subject of our present Discourse. It is about the <hi>coming of the Messiah</hi> simply that we are disputing; this we assert to be long since past; the Jews deny him to be yet come, living in the hope and expectation of him, which at present is in them but as the giving up of the Ghost. The means whereby this dying, deceiving <hi>hope</hi> is supported in them, comes now under examination; and this alone is the subject of our ensuing Discourse.</p>
                  <p>To countenance themselves then in their denial of the <hi>coming of the Messiah,</hi> they do <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> all of them make use of one general Argument, which they seek to confirm in and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50110:129"/>
by several instances. Now this is, that the <hi>Promises</hi> made and recorded to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished at the coming of the Messiah, are not <hi>fulfilled,</hi> and therefore the Messiah is not yet come. This fills up their Books of Controversies; and is constantly made use of by their Expositors, so often as any occasion seems to offer its self unto them. The Messiah say they, was promised of old. Together with him, and to be wrought by him, many other things were promised. These things they see not at all fulfilled; nay, not those which contain the only work and business that he was promised for; and therefore they will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elieve that he is come. This general Argument I say they seek to confirm by instances, wherein they reckon up all the promises, which they suppose as yet unaccomplished, and so endeavour to estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish their Conclusion. These we shall afterwards cast under the several heads where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they do belong, and return that answer which the Word of Truth its self, and the event, do manifest to be the mind of God in them. For the present unto their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Argument we say, that <hi>all the Promises,</hi> concerning the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> are actually fulfilled, and those which concern his Grace and Kingdom, are partly already accomplished, and for the remainder shall be so, in the manner, time and season appointed for them, and designed unto them, in the purpose and Counsel of God: So that from hence, nothing can be concluded in favour of the <hi>Jews</hi> incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity. To evidence the truth of this Answer, I shall lay down and confirm certain unquestionable principles, that will guide us in the interpretation of the Promises that are under consideration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> The first is, That the <hi>Promises concerning the Messiah do principally respect spiritual things, and that eternal salvation which he was to obtain for his Church.</hi> This we have proved at large before; and this, the very nature of the thing its self, and the words of the Promises do abundantly manifest. The <hi>Jews,</hi> I suppose, will not deny, but the Promise concerning the Messiah, is of the greatest <hi>Good</hi> that ever God engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to bestow upon them. I do not find, that they any where deny it; And it is at present the summ of all their desires, prayers, and expectations, with the hopes whereof they comfort and support themselves in all their calamities. If they should deny it, it may easily be proved against them by innumerable Testimonies of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; many whereof have been already produced. Now there can be no Reason of this, but only because he was to work and effect for them who ever they be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom he was promised, the greatest Good, that they can or may be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of. And if it be only a <hi>Good</hi> of an <hi>inferior nature</hi> that he was to effect, and any other <hi>means</hi> was to be used for that which was more principal and excellent, that <hi>means</hi> is much to be preferred before him, and above him; Now what is <hi>this Chief Good of man?</hi> Doth it consist in Riches, Honor, Power, Pleasures? the blindest of the <hi>Heathen</hi> were never blind enough, to think so; nor can any man entertain any such imagination, without renouncing not only all right reason, but in an especial manner, the whole Scripture. I think the <hi>Jews</hi> will not deny, but that this Good consists in the <hi>favour of God</hi> in this world, and the Eternal Enjoyment of him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Now if the <hi>Messiah</hi> were promised only to procure those first, outward, temporary, perishing things; and these latter are to be obtained by another means, namely, by the observation of the <hi>Law of Moses</hi>; it is evident, that, that is to be preferred infinitely before him; which that it is not, as we said, is manifest from the whole Scripture, and confirmed by the traditional hope and expectation of the Jews. For if they enjoy that which is incomparably the <hi>Chiefest Good,</hi> to what end do they so miserably bemoan themselves in their present condition, and with so much impatience cry out for the coming of their <hi>Messiah?</hi> Are they such slaves in their affections unto earthly perishing things, that living in the enjoyment of all that is needful to procure them the love and favour of God, with the eternal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him, they can have no rest or quiet, because they enjoy not the good things of this life? Doubtless this great expectation, had a greater rise and cause, then now they will own. I know men are apt to complain under, and to desire relief from outward trouble; but to place the main of their Religion herein, when they have Grace, the pardon of sin and Heaven on other accounts, this is only done by the <hi>Jews.</hi> But the truth is, although they continue in their desires of the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; yet they have lost the reason why they do so; only this they find, that their fore-fathers from the dayes of <hi>Abraham</hi> placed all their happiness in his coming; and therefore they think that they also ought to do so, though why they cannot tell, or will not understand. But this is that which we have proved to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50110:129"/>
be the object of their faith and expectation of old, namely, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was promised to be a <hi>Spiritual Redeemer,</hi> to save them from Sin, Satan, Death and Hell, to procure for them the favour of God, and to bring them to an enjoyment of him. Set this aside, and what have we to do, to contend with the Jews about one that shall come and make War for them, conquer their enemies, and make them rich. Much good may it do them with such an one, when he comes. They say indeed, that having the affluence of all things under him, they shall be the better enabled to keep the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> and so the way to Heaven will be easier for them. But I fear that which they manifest their hearts to be set upon as their chiefest end, and aim, will scarcely much farther them unto any other end whatever: the <hi>last end</hi> will not be made the means to another. Nor was it otherwise with their fore-fathers; <hi>Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked.</hi> According to their pasture, they were filled, and forgot the Lord: Prosperity ruined them; nor did they ever reform, but under sore afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The <hi>Messiah</hi> then that we contend with them about, is a <hi>Spiritual Redeemer</hi>; such an one he was promised to be, as we have abundantly proved. And all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of that nature are perfectly accomplished. He is come, and hath saved his people from their sins. He hath made an end of sin, and made Reconciliation for iniquity, and brought in everlasting Righteousness. There is not one Promise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Grace, Mercy, Pardon, the Love of God, and eternal Blessedness by the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which contain the whole of his direct and principal work, but they are all <hi>yea and ámen in Christ Jesus,</hi> are all exactly made good and accomplished. And this is testified unto by <hi>millions of souls</hi> now in the unchangeable fruition of God, and all that seriously believe in him who are yet alive. And this is firstly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in our enquiry after the accomplishment of the Promises, concerning the Coming, Grace, and Kingom of the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hence it follows, <hi>That all Promises concerning temporal things, at his coming,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> 
                     <hi>or by it, are but accessory and occasional, and such as directly appertain not to his principal work, and main design of his coming.</hi> Certain it is, that the whole work for which God of old promised the Messiah, might have been effected and fully accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if not one word had been spoken of any outward advantage to ensue thereon in this world. These Promises then belong not <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> to the Covenant of the Redeemer, but are declarations only of the Soveraign Will and Wisdom of God, as to what he would do in the dispensation of his Providence, at such and such a season. Hence two things will ensue.</p>
                  <p>First, That all these Promises may be <hi>conditional.</hi> Those which concerned the sending of the <hi>Messiah</hi> for the accomplishment of his principal work, were <hi>absolute,</hi> and depended not upon any thing, in any, or all of the Sons of men. The whole of it was a meer effect of Soveraign Grace. He was therefore infallibly to come at his appointed season. But those that concern the dispensation of Gods <hi>Providence in temporal things,</hi> may all of them be <hi>conditional.</hi> And evident it is, that they have one <hi>Condition</hi> annexed to the fulfilling of every one of them; and that is, that those who would partake of them, do submit themselves unto the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> For in the midst of the greatest collection of Promises in the whole Old Testament, which at first view seem to express the glory of the Kingdom of the Messiah in outward things, it is added, <hi>the Nation and Kingdom that will not serve them shall perish; yea, those Nations shall be utterly wasted,</hi> Isa. 60.12. So that all the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness intimated depends on the condition of mens submitting themselves to the <hi>Law of the Messiah,</hi> without which they are threatned with desolation and utter wasting. This condition belongs unto them all; and what other particular considerations there may be, on which their accomplishment may be suspended, we know not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It follows also from hence, that as to the times, seasons, and places of their accomplishment, they are left unto the designation of Gods Soveraign Will, Wisdom and Pleasure, as are those of all other works of his Providence whatever. It is not necessary that they should all of them be accomplished at the same time, or in the same place, or after the same manner. God may, and God doth fulfill them when, where, how, and towards whom he pleaseth; so that in the issue they shall all have that accomplishment which he hath designed unto them, and which the Church hath ground to expect. And thus hath God provided that they should be a ground of comfort and direction to the Church in all Ages, containing encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto obedience, and consolations in what his Saints may expect to fall upon
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50110:130"/>
their persecuting adversaries. The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed, who know not even how to fancy the Kingdom of their <hi>Messiah</hi> to be any other, but what the <hi>Roman Common-wealth of men</hi> only, was like to prove, <hi>res unius aetatis</hi> the <hi>business of one age,</hi> would have all these temporal promises to be fulfilled all at once, <hi>momento turbinis,</hi> all on a sudden. But the <hi>real Kingdom of Christ</hi> being to continue through many Generations, even from his coming unto the end of the world, and that in such a variety of states and conditions, as God saw conducing unto his own glory, and the exercise of the faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his people, the accomplishment of these promises in several Ages, and at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral seasons, according to the counsel of the will of God, is exceedingly suited unto the Nature, Glory and Exaltation of it. And this one observation may be easily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to the frustrating all the objections of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the <hi>non-accomplishment pretended</hi> of these promises.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> Thirdly, <hi>Whereas spiritual things have the principal place and consideration in the work and Kingdom of the Messiah, they are oftentimes promised in words, whose first signification denotes things temporal and corporeal.</hi> And this came to pass, and was so ordered on se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral accounts. For, first, the very way and manner of the <hi>Prophets</hi> expression of their <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelations,</hi> wherein after the way of the people of the <hi>East,</hi> they made use of many <hi>Metaphors</hi> and <hi>Allegories,</hi> lead them so to set forth spiritual things. That this was the custom of the Prophets, as they expresly own it, and is manifest in their writings, so it is confessed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, in their Expositions of them, do ever and anon grant, that this and that is to be interpreted <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is <hi>Allegorically.</hi> Now when it is granted, that the subject matter treated on is principally spiritual, all these <hi>Metaphors</hi> are plain and easily accommodated unto the principal scope and end intended.</p>
                  <p>Again, as this was the manner of the Prophets, so it is a way exceedingly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and suited to convey an apprehension and sense of the things treated on, unto the minds and understandings of men. All men know the <hi>worth and usefulness</hi> of the precious things of the Creation, Gold, Silver, precious Stones; of the <hi>desirable things of natural life,</hi> Health, Strength, long Life; of the good things of men in <hi>civil conversation,</hi> Wealth, Riches, Liberty, Rule, Dominion, and the like. Men know somewhat of the worth of these things, and commonly esteem them above it. Now what is likely more to affect their minds with, and raise their affections unto <hi>spirituall things,</hi> then to have them proposed unto them under the names of these things, whose Excellency they are so well acquainted withall, and whose enjoyment they so much desire. For nothing can be more evident unto them, then that God in these condescensions unto their capacities, doth declare, that the things which he promiseth, are indeed the most excellent and desirable that they can be made partakers of.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the state and condition of the Church of old, required such a way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. For as they had then in the Covenant of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of earthly and <hi>carnal things,</hi> so they themselves were <hi>carnal,</hi> and received great encouragement to abide in their expectation of the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> from that outward Glory which they apprehended that it would be attended withall. Besides, the time was not yet come, wherein the <hi>veil</hi> was to be removed, and believers were with open face to behold the glory of God. And therefore although this way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction by <hi>Similitudes, Metaphors</hi> and <hi>Allegories</hi> was suited, as we observed, in general, to affect their minds, and to stir up their affections, yet it did not give them that clear distinct apprehension of the things of the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards revealed. God had other work to do among them, by them, and upon them, then openly and plainly to reveal his whole Counsel in these things unto them. Hence the <hi>Prophets</hi> themselves, who received the Promises and Revelations treated of, from God, were fain to enquire <hi>with all diligence</hi> into the nature of the Office, Work, Sufferings and Glory of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which they prophesied unto the Church about, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11, 12. and yet all their enquiry came short of the understanding of those mysteries, which he had, who only saw the Messiah come in the flesh, and died before he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accomplished his work. But in all these promises, there was provision laid in to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as it were, the most carnal mind to look principally after spiritual things, and to own an <hi>Allegory</hi> in the expressions of them. For many of them are such, or otherwise, have no tolerable signification or sense, nor ever shall have accomplishment unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Can any man be so stupidly sottish as to think, that in the days of the <hi>Messiah, hills shall leap, and</hi> trees <hi>clap their hands,</hi> and <hi>waste places sing,</hi> and <hi>sheep of Kedar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rams of Nebaioth, be made ministers,</hi> and <hi>Jews suck milk from the breasts of Kings,</hi> and <hi>little
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50110:130"/>
children play with Cockatrices,</hi> literally and properly? And yet those things, with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable of the like kind are promised. Do they not openly proclaim to every under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that all the expressions of them are <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> and that some other thing is to be sought for in them. Some of the <hi>Jews</hi> I confess, would fain have them all <hi>litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> fulfilled unto a tittle. They would have a <hi>trumpet to be blown,</hi> that all the world should hear, <hi>mountains to be levelled, seas to be dried up, wildernesses to be filled with springs and roses,</hi> the Gentiles carrying Jews upon their shoulders, and giving them all their gold and silver; but the folly of these imaginations is unspeakable, and the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Authors deplorable; neither to gratifie them must we expose the Word of God to the contempt and scorn of Atheistical scoffers, which such Expositions and Applications of it would undoubtedly do. Now this rule which we insist upon is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be heeded, where spiritual and temporal things, though far distant in their natures, yet do usually come under the same Appellation. Thus is it with the <hi>Peace</hi> that is promised in the days of the <hi>Messiah. Peace</hi> is either spiritual and eternal with God, or outward and external with men in this world. Now these things are not only divers, and such as may be distinguished one from the other, but such as whose espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial nature is absolutely different; yet are they both Peace, and so called. The former is that which was chiefly intended in the coming of the Messiah; but this being Peace also, is often promised in those words, which in their <hi>first signification</hi> denotes the later, or outward peace in this world amongst men. And this is frequent in the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>By the seed of Abraham, by Jacob, and Israel in many places of the Prophets, not</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>6</label> 
                     <hi>the carnal seed, at least not all the carnal seed of them is intended; but the children of the faith of Abraham, who are the inheritors of the promise.</hi> Here I acknowledge, the <hi>Jews</hi> universally differ from us. They would have none but themselves intended in those expressions; and what ever is spoken concerning the <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> if it be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in themselves, they suppose it hath no effect on any other in the world. And from this apprehension an objection was raised of old against the doctrine of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. For on supposition that <hi>Jesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and that the blessing was to be obtained by faith in him, whereas it was evident that far the greatest part of the Jews believed not in him, it would seem to follow, that the <hi>promise of God made to Abraham was of none effect: Rom.</hi> 9.1. But the Apostle answers, that the promise did never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto all the <hi>carnal seed of Abraham</hi>; for whereas he had many sons, one of whom, <hi>Ishmael,</hi> was his first-born, yet <hi>Isaac</hi> only inherited the promise. And whereas <hi>Isaac</hi> himself had <hi>two sons,</hi> yet one only of them, and he the <hi>younger,</hi> enjoyed the priviledge; and all this proceeded from the especial purpose of God, who takes into that priviledge whom he pleaseth. So was his dealing with the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time; he called whom he pleased to a participation of the promise, and passed by whom he would; whereby it came to pass at last, that all the Elect obtained, and the rest were hardned. Now the <hi>seed</hi> to whom the promise is given, are those only that obtain it by faith, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing chosen thereunto, the residue being not intended in that appellation of <hi>Israel, Jacob,</hi> the <hi>sons and seed of Abraham.</hi> Moreover, as those only of the <hi>carnal seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who embrace the promise are received in this matter to be his seed, so all that follow the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and believe unto Righteousness as he did, are his sons and the seed of the promise, although carnally they were not his off-spring. The same also is to be said concerning those names of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> of both which such glorious things are spoken. I suppose none can imagine, that it is the little Hill so called, or the streets and buildings of the Town that God did so regard. But one of them having been for a season in the days of <hi>David,</hi> the special place of his worship, and the other the principal habitation of Church and people, God expresseth his Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to his Church and Worship under those names; and it is a fond thing to suppose, that the respects mentioned should be unto those places themselves, which now for a <hi>thousand years</hi> have lain waste and desolate. Those promises then which we find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded concerning <hi>Sion, Hierusalem,</hi> the <hi>seed of Abraham, Jacob, Israel,</hi> do respect the Elect of God, called unto the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and worshipping God according unto his appointment, be they of what People or Nation soever under heaven. And this we have proved before, in our dissertation about the <hi>Oneness of the Church,</hi> of the Old and New Testament.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>By all people, all Nations, the Gentiles, all the Gentiles, not all absolutely, especially</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>7</label> 
                     <hi>at any one time or season, are to be understood; but either the most eminent and most famous of them, or those in whom the Church, by reason of their vicinity, is more especially concerned.</hi> God oftentimes charged the Jews of old; that they had worshipped the gods of <hi>all
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50110:131"/>
the Nations</hi>; whereby yet not all Nations absolutely, but only those that were about them, with whom they had commerce and communication, were intended. Those Expressions then of <hi>all Nations,</hi> and <hi>all Kingdoms</hi> who are said to come into the Church, and submit themselves unto the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> at his coming, do not denote all <hi>absolutely</hi> in the world, especially at any one time or season, but only such as are either <hi>most eminent</hi> among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or such as God would cause his light and truth to approach unto. And those which in an especial manner seem to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed in those prophetical expressions, are that collection of Nations whereof the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> was constituted, which obtained the common appellation of the <hi>whole World,</hi> being for the main of them the posterity of <hi>Japhet,</hi> who were to be perswaded to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem.</hi> The Jews would have all Nations absolutely to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and <hi>Kimchi,</hi> with <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> tells us on <hi>Isa.</hi> 2.4. in those words of the Prophet, <hi>He shall judge among the Nations; that all Nations of the Earth shall live at peace; for what ever controversies they have among themselves, they shall come and refer the determination of them to the Messiah living at Jerusalem.</hi> But how this should be done by all the Nations of the Earth absolutely, they are not pleased to declare unto us. Certainly the heat of some of their differences will be much abated, before they have made a full end of their journey.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>8</label> Sixthly, It must be observed, that <hi>what ever is to be done and effected by the Spirit, Grace, or Power of the Messiah during the continuance of his Kingdom in this world, it is mentioned in the Promises, as that which was to be accomplished, at, or by his coming.</hi> But here, as we before observed, lyeth the mistake of the <hi>Jews</hi>; what ever is spoken about his Work and Kingdom, they expect to have fulfilled <hi>as it were in a day,</hi> which neither the nature of the things themselves will bear, nor is it any way suited unto the Glory of God, or the duration of this Kingdom in the world. The <hi>Kingdom of the Messiah</hi> is prophesied of, to be set up in the room of the other great Kingdoms and Monarchies that are in the world. And if we take an instance in the last Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> namely the <hi>Roman,</hi> it is spoken of, as that which came forth as it were all at once into the world, and did all its work immediately; when we know that from its first rise to the end of the things there spoken of, there passed above the space of a <hi>thousand years.</hi> But yet all the things ascribed unto it, are mentioned as attending its rise and coming; and that because they were in process of time affected by its power. And in like manner, all the things that are foretold about the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Messiah</hi> are referred unto his <hi>Coming,</hi> because before that they were not wrought, and they are produced by his Spirit and Grace, the foundation of them all being perfectly and unchangeably wrought in what he did and effected upon his first coming and appearance. It is no wonder then that many particular promises seem as yet to be unfulfilled: for they were never designed to be accomplished, in a day, an year, an age, one place, or season, but in a long tract of time during the continuance of his Kingdom; that is, from his coming unto the end of the world. And as the <hi>care</hi> of the accomplishment of those promises is upon, so the <hi>ordering</hi> of the time and season of their being effected belongs unto, the Counsel and Will of the Father; who as unto his Children and Servants, hath engaged unto him, that he should see of the travail of his soul in all Generations: and as unto his Adversaries hath said, <hi>Sit thou on my right hand, untill I make thine enemies thy footstool.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>9</label> Again, There are <hi>two wayes whereby Promises may be said to be accomplished by him who gives them.</hi> The one is, when all is done in respect of <hi>outward means, helps and advantages,</hi> that is needful for that end, and which if men do not embrace and make use of, they are left unexcusable, and have none to blame for their coming short of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the full benefit of the Promises, but themselves alone. And in this sense all the Promises contended about, are long since accomplished towards all the world. There is plentiful provision made in the doings and Doctrine of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as to outward means, for the peace of all the Nations in the world, for the Ruine of all false Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, for the uniting of <hi>Jews and Gentiles</hi> in one body, in Peace and Unity; and that these things are not actually effected, the whole defect lyes in the blindness, unbelief, and obstinacy of the sons of men, who had rather perish in their sins, then be saved through obedience to <hi>this Captain of Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God doth sometimes accomplish his Promises, by putting forth the efficacious power of his Spirit and Grace, effectually and actually to fulfill them, by working the things promised in and upon them unto whom they are promised.</hi> And thus are all the Promises of God that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the <hi>Messiah,</hi> his Work, his Mediation, with the effects of them, his Grace and Spirit,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50110:131"/>
at all Times, in all Ages, absolutely fulfilled in and towards the Elect, that <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> unto whom all the Promises do in an especial manner belong. The Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obtaineth the promise, although the rest are hardened. Now if the <hi>Jews,</hi> or any other Nation under Heaven, shall at any time, or for a long season continue to reject the terms of Reconciliation with God, and of inheriting the promises which are proposed unto them, <hi>shall their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect?</hi> God forbid. The Truth of God failed not, when he brought only <hi>Caleb and Joshua</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> the whole body of the people being consumed in the Wilderness, by reason of their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. God hath done, doth, and alwayes will effectually fulfill all his promises in his Elect; and for the residue of men, they come not short of the enjoyment of them, but upon their own sin, blindness and unbelief.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is granted, that <hi>there shall be a time and season, during the continuance</hi>

                     <hi>of the Kingdom of the Messiah in this world, wherein the generality of the Nation of the Jews all the world over, shall be called and effectually brought unto the knowledge of the Messiah, our Lord Jesus Christ, with which mercy they shall also receive deliverance from their captivity, restauration into their own land, with a blessed, flourishing and happy condition therein.</hi> I shall not here engage into a confirmation of this concession, or assertion. The work would be long and great, because of the difference about the time, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and manner of their Call, their following state and condition, and so is unmeet for us to undertake, in the winding up of these discourses. It is only the thing its self that I assert, nor have any cause as to the end aimed at; to enquire into the time and manner of its accomplishment. Besides, the Event will be the only sure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Expositor of these things, nor in matters of such importance as those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, shall I trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with conjectures. The thing it self is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, as far as I can understand by all the world, that have any acquaintance with these things. Christians generally do assert it, look for it, pray for it, and have done so in all Ages from the dayes of the Apostles. <hi>Mahometans</hi> are not without some thoughts of what shall befall the <hi>Jews</hi> before the end of the world. As to the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves in their false notion of it, it is the life of their hopes and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. What is it then that the Jews plead, what do they expect? What promises are given unto them? they say, that they shall be delivered out of their Captivity, restored to their own Land, enjoy peace and quietness, glory and honour therein. We say the same concerning them also; but by whom shall these things be wrought for them, by their <hi>Messiah</hi> they say at his coming: But shall he do all these things for them, whether they believe in him or no; whether they obey him or reject him, love him or curse him? Is there no more required unto this delivery, but that <hi>he should come to them?</hi> Is it not also, <hi>that they should come to him?</hi> Here then lyes the only difference between us; we acknowledge that the Promises mentioned, are not yet all of them actually fulfilled towards them; this they also plead: the Reason hereof they say, is because the <hi>Messiah is not yet come,</hi> so casting the blame on God, who hath not made good his word according to the time limited expresly by himself. We say the reason of it is, because <hi>they come not by faith and obedience unto the Messiah,</hi> which long since came unto them, and so cast the blame, where sure it is more likely to lye, even on them and their unbelief. They are in expectation that the <hi>Messiah will come to them</hi>; we, that they <hi>will come unto the Messiah</hi>; and it may be this difference may ere long be reconciled, by his Appearance unto them, so calling them unto faith and obedience.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Suppose there should be any particular Promise or Promises, relating unto the Times</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>and Kingdom of the Messiah, either accomplished, or not yet accomplished, the full, clear, and perfect sense and intendment whereof, we are not able to arrive unto; shall we therefore reject that faith and perswasion, which is built on so many clear, certain, undoubted Testimonies of the Scripture its self, and manifest in the event, as if it were written with the beams of the Sun?</hi> As such a proceeding could arise from nothing but a foolish conceited pride, that we are able to find out God unto perfection, and to discover all the depths of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that are in his Word; so it would, being applied unto other things and affairs, overthrow all assurance and certainty in the world; even that which is necessary to a man to enable him to act with any satisfaction unto himself or others. What then we understand of the mind of God, we faithfully adhere unto; and what we cannot comprehend, we humbly leave the knowledge and Revelation of, unto his Divine Majesty.</p>
                  <p>On these and the like Principles, which most of them are clear in the Scripture its <label type="milestone">

self, and the rest deduced immediately from the same fountain of truth, it is no hard matter to answer and remove those particular instances which the <hi>Jews</hi> produce to make good their general Argument, whereby they would prove the <hi>Messiah</hi> not yet to be come, from the <hi>non-accomplishment</hi> of the Promises that relate unto his Coming and Kingdom. It were a work endless and useless to undertake the consideration of every particular Promise, which they wrest unto their purpose. They are not the words themselves, but the things promised that are in controversie. Now these, though expressed in great variety, and on occasions innumerable, yet may be referred unto certain <hi>general heads,</hi> whereunto they do all belong. And indeed unto these heads they are usually gathered by the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves, in all their disputes against <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> These then we shall consider, and shew their consistency with that truth which we have abundantly evinced from the Scriptures of the Old Testament, the common acknowledged principle between us.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>13</label> First then, they insist upon that <hi>universal peace</hi> in the whole world, which they take to be promised in the days of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> To this purpose they urge the Prophesie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <hi>Isa.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. <hi>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it; and many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Sion shall go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people, and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: Nation shall not lift up sword against Nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</hi> This Prophesie is in the same words repeated, <hi>Micha</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4. where there is added unto the close of it, <hi>But they shall sit every man under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and none shall make them afraid.</hi> And the like things are spoken of, in sundry other places of that Prophesie.</p>

                     <hi>Messiah the King,</hi> which manifests him to be a <hi>Prophet</hi> no less then a <hi>King</hi>; and he also is the Judge that shall judge among the Nations. Only we differ from them in the Exposition of the <hi>Mountain of the house of the Lord,</hi> which they take to be <hi>mount Moria,</hi> we the <hi>worship of God</hi> it self. And whereas both of us are necessitated to depart from the <hi>Letter,</hi> and allow a <hi>Metaphor</hi> in the words, for they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the <hi>hill Moria</hi> shall be plucked up by the roots, and taken and set on the tops of other mountains they know not where, nor can they tell unto what purpose any such thing would be; so our interpretation of the words which admits only of the most usual <hi>figurative expression,</hi> the <hi>place</hi> being taken for the <hi>worship</hi> performed in it, on the account whereof alone it was ever of any esteem, is far more easie and natural, then any thing they can wrest the remainder of the words unto, supposing <hi>mount Moria</hi> to be literally understood. And in this sense we affirm the first part of the Prophesie, to be long since really, and to the full accomplished. For whereas the worship of God before the coming of Christ, was confined unto the Temple at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> attended unto by one poor, small, enslaved Nation, and that in such outward contempt and scorn, that it was no way to be compared with the glory of the <hi>false worship</hi> of the Nations, and the compliance of multitudes of people unto it, the mountains being far more <hi>visible, conspicuous</hi> and <hi>stately</hi> then that at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> upon his coming and giving out the Law of God unto the Nations of the world, the most, the greatest, and the most glorious of them consented unto the acceptance of it, and with one consent gave themselves up to the worship of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> whereby the worship of the true God was not only exalted and made more conspicuous, then the lofty hills, and high places of the world, wherein they worshipped their Idols, but the most <hi>eminent moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> of the whole earth, as that of <hi>Diana at Ephesus,</hi> and of the <hi>Capitol at Rome,</hi> were destroyed and deserted, and the glory of the worship of God was lifted up above them. So that what the <hi>Jews</hi> think to plead for themselves, doth indeed in a manifest and open Event wholly evert their unbelief. But avoiding the consideration hereof, that which they principally insist upon is, the Peace promised under the Kingdom of the Messiah; which, as it seems to them, is not accomplished. Yea, saith one of them,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50110:132"/>
                     <hi>Men are so far from heating their swords into Plow-shares, that within a few hundreds of years, new instruments of war, never heard of in the world before, have been invented among them, who pretend to believe in the Messiah.</hi> And this, as they think, makes it appear, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he is not as yet come into the world; the vanity of which pretence may easily be discovered from our former Rules, which we shall briefly make application of unto its removal.</p>
                  <p>For, first, The temporal outward Peace of the world, if any such thing be here <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>15</label> intended, is not the <hi>principal part,</hi> matter or subject of the Promise, but only <hi>an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory</hi> unto it; the chief part of it which concerns the spiritual worship of God, is evidently and openly fulfilled. That which is <hi>temporal,</hi> for the times and seasons of it, is left unto the sovereign Will and Wisdom of God for its accomplishment. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it necessary that it should be fulfilled amongst <hi>all Nations at once,</hi> but only amongst them who at any time, or in any place, effectually receive the Laws of God from the Messiah. What ever then of outward peace is really intended in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, as it hath in part already received its accomplishment, as we shall shew, so the whole shall be fulfilled in the time and way of Gods appointment. 2. That the words are not to be understood <hi>absolutely,</hi> according to the strict exigence of the letter, is evident from that complement of the prediction of that in <hi>Micah, Every one shall sit under his own vine and fig-tree,</hi> there being many, not only persons, but great Nations in the world, that have neither the one nor the other. 3. The Jews themselves do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>such peace</hi> upon the coming of their <hi>Messiah.</hi> War great and terrible with <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> they look for, which also the Scripture mentions; and that with <hi>Amillus</hi> is their own faith or fancy: only it may be they would have no body to wage war with but themselves. For whereas they tell us, that all Nations shall come with their contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies to be ended by the <hi>Messiah</hi> at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and by that means prevent war among them: I suppose they will not do so, untill they are subdued, and those Nations broken in pieces which will not serve them, which what ever expedition they fancy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, may take up at least half the Reign of their Messiah, if he should live an hundred years, about which they differ, yea plainly and openly, great wars and desolation of the enemies of the children of God are fore-told under the Messiah, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. 4. I shall not much insist on that <hi>universal peace</hi> which God gave unto all the known Nations of the world, at the coming of Christ, in the Reign of <hi>Augustus</hi>; though it look more like an accomplishment of this Prophecie, then what the Jews imagine therein: but because it was only <hi>coincident</hi> with, by the Providence of God, and not an effect of his coming, I shall pass it by only as a <hi>diagnostick</hi> of the season wherein the Prince of peace was to be born, and was so accordingly. But I say, 5. That Christ at his coming wrought <hi>perfect peace</hi> between God and Man, slaying the enmity and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which by reason of sin was between them. This alone absolutely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is <hi>peace</hi>; without this, all other outward quiet and prosperity is ruinous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive. And where this is, no Wars nor tumults can hinder, but that the persons enjoying it shall be preserved in <hi>perfect peace</hi>; and this if the <hi>Jews</hi> did believe, they would have experience of. 6. He hath also wrought true <hi>spiritual Peace</hi> and Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all that sincerely believe in him, all his Elect, which, although it frees them not from outward troubles, persecutions, oppressions, and afflictions in the earth, and that from some also that may make profession of his Name, (for <hi>Judah may be in the siege against Jerusalem,</hi> Zach. 12.2.) yet they having peace with God, and among themselves, they enjoy the promise unto the full satisfaction of their souls. And this peace of the <hi>Elect with God, and among themselves,</hi> is that which singly and principally is intended in this Prediction, though set out under terms and expressions of the things wherein outward Peace in this world doth consist. 7. The Lord Christ by his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hath not only <hi>proclaimed</hi> and offered Peace with God unto all Nations, but also given Precepts of Peace, and <hi>self-denial,</hi> directing and guiding all the sons of men, were they attended unto and received, to live in Peace among themselves; whereas the Jews of old had express command for <hi>War,</hi> and destroying of the Nations among whom they were to inhabit, which gives a great <hi>foundation</hi> unto the promises of Peace in the days of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> 8. Let it be supposed, that it is general outward Peace, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity and Tranquility that is here promised unto the world; yet then, 1. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise time of its accomplishment is not here limited nor determined. If it be effected during the Kingdom and Reign of the <hi>Messiah</hi> in the world, the word is established, and the Prophesie verefied. 2. Our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostles have fore-told, that after his Law and Doctrine should be received in the world, there should a
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50110:133"/>
great defection and <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the power and purity of it ensue, which should be attended with great persecution, troubles, afflictions, wars and tumults, which after they are all removed, and all his Adversaries subdued, he will give peace and rest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Churches and People all the world over; and herein, and in that season which now approacheth, lies the accomplishment of all the promises concerning the glorious and peaceable estate of the Church in this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take then this Prophesie in what sense soever it may be literally expounded, and there is nothing in it that gives the the least countenance unto the <hi>Judaical</hi> pretence from the words.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>16</label> The next collection of promises which they insist upon to their purpose, is of those which intimate the destruction of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and false worship in the world, with the <hi>abundance of the knowledge of the Lord,</hi> taking away all diversity in Religion, that shall be in the days of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Such is that of <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>They shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for they shall all know me from the greatest of them to the least of them, saith the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>I will turn to the people a pure language, that they may call on the name of the Lord with one consent.</hi> As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that of <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.9. <hi>And the Lord shall be King over all the earth.

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It will prove in the issue, that the mention of these, as well as of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, will turn to their disadvantage. Their accomplishment in the sense of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath been so plain, evident and manifest, that nothing but Prejudice and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate blindness can once call it into question. For the further manifestation hereof, we may observe, 1. That these things are not spoken <hi>absolutely,</hi> but <hi>comparatively</hi>; It is not to be thought, that in the days of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> there shall be no means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in the knowledge of the Lord used; as that Parents should not teach their children; the Officers of the Church and others, those that stand in need of teaching: for neither do the <hi>Jews</hi> indeed imagine any such thing, nor can they do so, without the rejection of the Precepts of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Predictions recorded in the Prophets, wherein God promiseth, that in those days he will give the people <hi>Pastors after his own heart, Priests and Levites,</hi> to teach them his mind and will. But this is that which is signified in these expressions; namely, that in those days there shall be such a plentiful effusion of the Spirit of Wisdom and Grace, as shall cause the true saving knowledge of God to be more easily obtained, and much more plentifully to abound, then it did in the time of the Law; when the people, by an hard yoke, and insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table burden of carnal Ordinances, were darkly, meanly, and difficultly instructed in some part of the knowledge of God. And that the words are thus to be interpreted, the many promises that are given, concerning the instruction of the Church, in the days of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and his own Office, of being the great Prophet of the Church, which the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledge, do undeniably evince. 2. That the terms of <hi>all people</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> are necessarily to be understood as before explained, for <hi>many Nations,</hi> those in an especial manner, in whom the Church of Christ is concerned; neither can any one place be produced, where an <hi>absolute universality</hi> of them is intended. 3. That the season of the accomplishment of these and the like Predictions, is not limited to the day or year of the <hi>Messiah's coming,</hi> as the Jews, amongst other impossible fictions, imagine; but extends it self unto the whole duration of the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as hath been shewed before. 4. That God sometimes is said to <hi>do</hi> that, which he maketh provision of outward means for the effecting of, though as to some persons and times, they may be frustrated of their effect; and this the <hi>Jews</hi> not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, but also contend for, when they give an account why the promises which concern themselves are not yet fulfilled, the reason whereof they suppose, or at least pretend, to lie in their sin and unworthiness.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>18</label> These things being supposed, we may quickly see what was the Event, as to those Promises, upon the coming of the true and only Messiah: For, 1. It is known to all, and not denied by those with whom we have to do, that at the coming of <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> setting aside that knowledge and worship of God which was in <hi>Judea,</hi> a little corner of the earth, and that also by their own confession then horribly defiled
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50110:133"/>
and profaned the whole world, especially the greatest and most potent and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations of it; in particular the <hi>whole Roman Empire,</hi> especially concerned in these predictions, was utterly ignorant of the true God, and engaged in the Worship of <hi>Idols</hi> and Devils, and that from time immemorial. 2. That although the <hi>Jews</hi> had taken great pains, and compassed Sea and Land to make <hi>Proselytes,</hi> yet they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few, and those very obscure persons, whom they could at any time, or in any place prevail withall to receive the knowledge, or give up themselves unto the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the God of <hi>Israel</hi>; of converting People or Nations unto his obedience, they now entertained the least hopes. 3. It is manifest to all the world, that not only upon the <hi>coming of Jesus,</hi> but also by vertue of his Law and Doctrine, all the <hi>Old Idolatry</hi> of the world was destroyed, and that whole fabrick of Superstition, which Satan had been so many Ages engaged in the erection of, was cast to the ground, and those <hi>Gods of the Earth</hi> which the Nations worshipped utterly famished. Hence it is come to pass at this day, that no People or Nation under Heaven doth continue to worship those Gods, which the Old Empires of the World adored as their Deities, and in whose service they waged War against <hi>the God of Israel</hi> and his people. And all that knowledge that is at this day in the world of one true living God, and the rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the <hi>God of Israel,</hi> for that true God, however abused, as it is by some, <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> and others, it did all originally proceed from the Doctrine of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> whom these ungrateful people hate and persecute. Had it not been for him and his Gospel, the <hi>true God,</hi> the <hi>God of their fore-fathers,</hi> had been no more owned in the world at this day, then he was at his coming in the flesh; and yet these poor blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creatures, can see no glory in him or in his Ministry. 4. The Lord Jesus Christ by his Spirit and Word, did not only destroy <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>false Worship</hi> in the world, but also brought the greatest and most potent Nations of it to the Knowledge of God, that in comparison of what was past, it covered the earth; <hi>as the Waters cover the Seas.</hi> This the Jews saw and repined at in the flourishing times of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> when the Lord was one, and his Name was one, in the whole earth, as that Expression is used in the Scripture. 5. The <hi>Way</hi> whereby this Knowledge and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the true God was dispersed over the face of the earth, and spread its self like an mundation of saving waters over the world, was by such a secret energy of the spirit of Christ accompanying his Word and the Ministration of it, that it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differed from that operous, burdensome, and for the most part ineffectual way of teaching which was used by the Priests, Levites, and Scribes of old; there being much more of the efficacy of Grace, then of the pains of the Teachers seen in the Effects wrought and produced, according to the Words of the Promise, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.34. 6. In this diffusion of the knowledge of God, there was way made for the Union, Agreement, and joint Consent in Worship, of those that should receive it. For both the <hi>partition wall between Jews and Gentiles was removed,</hi> and both people did actually coalesce into one body, worshipping God with one lip and shoulder, and also an holy and plain way of spirituall Worship was prescribed unto all, that should, or did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Law of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> 7. Notwithstanding all that hath been already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, yet there is still room and time left and remaining for the further accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishment of these predictions, so that before the close of the Kingdom of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> not one <hi>Tittle</hi> of them shall fall to the ground. And thus also, the open Event, known to all the world, doth manifest the due and full accomplishment of these Promises, making it unquestionable, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is long since come, and hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the work that he was designed of old unto.</p>
                  <p>Neither are the Exceptions of the Jews of any force to invalidate our Application <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>19</label> of these Promises. Two things they object unto us. First, the <hi>Idolatry</hi> that is yet in the world; <hi>especially among Christians.</hi> Secondly, The differences in Religion that every where abound amongst men. For 1. We have shewed already, that these and the like Predictions are to have a gradual accomplishment, not all at once, in every place. It is sufficient that there is an everlasting foundation laid for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of all false Worship, which having had a conspicuous and glorious Effect in the most eminent Nations of the world, sufficient to answer the intention of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, shall yet further in the appointed seasons root out the remainder of all super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and Apostacy from God. 2. For what concerns <hi>Christians</hi> themselves, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but that many who are so called, have corrupted themselves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the guilt of that horrible iniquity, which they charge upon them. But this being the crime and guilt of some certain Persons, and not of the whole soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50110:134"/>
of the Professors of <hi>Christianity,</hi> ought not to be objected unto them. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know by what means the <hi>Jews</hi> suppose that themselves and the Nations of the world shall be kept from <hi>Idolatry</hi> and false Worship in the dayes of their <hi>Messiah</hi>: if it be, because their <hi>Messiah</hi> shall give such a perfect Law, and such full instructions in the mind and will of God, that all men may clearly know their duty, we say that this is already done, in the highest degree of perfection that is conceivable, but what if notwithstanding this, men will follow their own vain, reasonings and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and fall from the rule of their obedience into <hi>Will-worship</hi> and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what remedy have they provided against such backsliding; if they have none, but only the pressing upon them their duty to the Law, Word, and Institutions of God; we have the same, and do make use of it, to the same end and purpose. If they shall say, that their <hi>Messiah</hi> will kill them and slay them with the sword, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that ours is not of that mind, and desire them to take heed, least, in the room of the holy, humble, merciful Kings promised the Church, they look for and desire <hi>a bloody Tyrant,</hi> that should exercise force over the minds of men, and execute their revenge and lusts on those whom they like not. 3. This <hi>Apostacy</hi> of some Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of <hi>Christianity,</hi> into false Worship, Idolatry and Persecution is foretold obscurely in the <hi>Writings of the Old Testament it self,</hi> but most plainly in those of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or Revelations made by the Lord Christ unto his Apostles concerning the state of the Church unto the end of the world; so that from thence no impeachment can arise against our Interpretation of the predictions insisted on, which have a perfect coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence therewithall, 4. The same is the state of things in reference unto what they object about the <hi>variety</hi> of Religions that are in the world, and the multitude of <hi>Sects</hi> which every where spring up: For 1. Although <hi>de facto</hi> there are at this time sundry <hi>false Religions</hi> in the world, and amongst them that which is professed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet <hi>de jure</hi> they ought not to be, there being one true Religion sufficiently declared and promulgated unto the children of men. For whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> and others do wilfully shut their eyes against the light and evidence of truth, the guilt and misery is their own, the Lord Christ having graciously provided, and tendered unto them means of better instruction. And 2. It is a mistake, that the different Opinions and Sects that are amongst Christians themselves do constitute different Religions. For as they all agree in the Worship of the <hi>God of Israel</hi> by <hi>Jesus Christ the Messiah,</hi> which contains the summ of their Religion, so their profession its self is not to be measured by the Doctrines and Conceptions of some amongst them, but by the Scripture which they all receive and acknowledge. This is the Religion of them all, and it is one and the same, amongst all that receive Jesus Christ for their Saviour. That there are such pertinacious contests about mens different apprehensions of the mind of God in the Word, that they labour to impose their private conceptons one upon another, is the fault of some men, which doth not prejudice the oneness of that Religion which is taught in the Gospel. Upon all which it appears, that the Promises insisted on, have received a glorious and blessed accomplishment.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>20</label> Thirdly, They insist on the Promises which concern themselves; and these of all others they most mind and urge against their Adversaries. Nothing they say is more certain and evident in the Scripture, then that the <hi>People of Israel</hi> shall be brought into a blessed and prosperous condition by the <hi>Messiah</hi> at his coming, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that by him they shall be brought home into their own Land: And to this purpose, they plead, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 52.54, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42. whereunto sundry other places of a like impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may be added. But now say they, instead hereof, that whole people is scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over the face of the earth, under great misery and oppression for the most part, without the least interest in the Country promised unto them. And from hence it is, that they most obstinately conclude, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is not yet come; for untill they are rich, wealthy, and powerful they will not believe that God is faithfull.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It would be too long a work, and not suitable unto our present design, to go over all the Promises in particular, which seem to have an aspect this way, or wherein mention is made of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>seed of Abraham, Jacob, Israel,</hi> and the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> Besides, the Exposition of them may readily be sought from many Learned Commentaries extant in all Languages on the Prophecies of the Old Testament. I shall therefore only give such general Answers, as being applyed unto the several particular instances, will manifest the insufficiency of the <hi>Jews</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from Promises of this Nature. 1. Then in the consideration of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50110:134"/>
we must carefully distinguish, between those who had their <hi>full,</hi> at least <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> accomplishment in that return of the people from the <hi>Captivity of Babylon,</hi> and those which have a direct respect unto the dayes of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> It is known that the Prophets do very usually set out that mercifull deliverance, in <hi>Metaphorical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi> so to set off the greatness of the mercy its self. But the present Jews who now look for the accomplishing of all the most <hi>strained Allegories</hi> in a literal sense, supposing that the deliverance which their fore-fathers then obtained, because of their ensuing trouble and poverty, did not answer what is spoken of it, do wrest them all to the times of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> when they hope they shall receive them in full measure. For they reckon of all things according to their outward gain and profit, and not according to the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Love and Glory of God therein. These Promises then are in the first place to be set apart, as not concerned in our present business and difference. 2. We have manifested before, that there is mention of a double <hi>Israel</hi> in the Scripture; the <hi>spiritual Israel,</hi> that is, all the sons of the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> in all Ages and places throughout the world; and an <hi>Israel</hi> according to the flesh, or the carnal posterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which the present <hi>Jews</hi> are. This distinction we have elsewhere confirmed. Now many of the Promises pleaded, belong to <hi>Israel</hi> in the first sense, that is, the Church and people of God, who by faith are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and so made inheritors of the Promises. And these also which are by far the greatest number, are to be set aside from our present consideration of them. 3. It hath been proved, that oftentimes <hi>spiritual things</hi> are expressed <hi>metaphorically</hi> in the Prophets, by words which in their <hi>literal</hi> first sense denote things outward and corporeal. This is sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the instances formerly given, wherein such things are spoken, as it is utterly impossible that they should have a literal accomplishment, and of the like sort there are others innumerable. And thus most of the predictions that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Peace and Prosperity, must necessarily intend <hi>spiritual peace with God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause concerning the same seasons, Wars, and Trials are in other places foretold. 4. Whatever is foretold and promised concerning the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves, in the dayes of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> doubtless they have no ground nor colour of reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the accomplishment of it, until they <hi>receive him,</hi> own him, and submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which to this day they have not done. When <hi>Moses</hi> went forth to visit them of old in their distress, and slew the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> that smote one of them, because they refused him, and would not understand that it was he whom God would deliver them by, and endeavoured to <hi>betray him</hi> to death, their bondage was continued forty years longer, and yet at length by the same <hi>Moses</hi> were they delivered: And although they have refused and rejected him who was promised to be their Saviour, and so continue to this day in their captivity spiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, yet it is he, by whom in the time appointed, they shall be delivered from the one and the other. But this shall not be done untill they own and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; which when God shall give them hearts to do, they will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find the blessed success thereof. For, 5. We grant that there are many Promises on record in the Scripture concerning their gathering together, their return to God by the Messiah, with great Peace and Glory that shall ensue thereupon. Set aside their opinion concerning the perpetuity of the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> and their return in the observation of it, unto their carnal Ordinances, built on a supposition that God is pleased with the <hi>blood of Bulls and Goats for its own sake,</hi> and not for a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of that which was infinitely more excellent and glorious; an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which the whole world hath as it were by joint consent long ago renounced; and cast away the vain and foolish imaginations about their sensual pleasures, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemoth,</hi> the <hi>Wine of Paradice,</hi> and literal accomplishment of professed Allegories, which the wisest among themselves begin to be ashamed of: and there is nothing in their own expectations, but we acknowledge that they shall be made partakers of it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn they shall to their own Land, enjoy it for a quiet and everlasting possession, their Adversaries being destroyed: filled they shall be also with the Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Will and Worship of God, so as to be a guide and blessing unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the Gentiles who seek after the Lord, and it may be, be entrusted with great Empire and Rule in the world. The most of these things are foretold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, not only in their own Prophetical Writings, but also by the Divine Writers of sundry Books of the New Testament. But all this we say
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50110:135"/>
must come to pass, when the veil shall be taken from before their eyes, and they shall look on him <hi>whom they have pierced,</hi> and joyfully receive him whom they have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rejected for so many Generations. Untill this be done, they may wrestle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here lyes the <hi>Crisis</hi> of their condition. When they shall receive, acknowledge, and believe in that Messiah who came so long time since unto them, whom their Fathers wickedly slew, and hanged on a Tree, and whom themselves have since no less wickedly rejected; and when by his Spirit and Grace they shall be turned from ungodliness, and have their eyes opened to see the Mysterie of the Grace, Wisdom and Love of God in the blood of his Son, then shall they obtain mercy from the God of their fore-fathers, and returning again into their own Land, <hi>Jerusalem shall be inhabited again even in Jerusalem.</hi>

If <hi>Abraham</hi> was the eldest, as he is first expressed, he was born 292 years

after the <hi>flood,</hi> in the three hundred ninety second year of the life of <hi>Shem,</hi> who out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived him thirty five years.

But there is a difficulty in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. For if <hi>Abraham</hi> was born in the seventieth year of the age of <hi>Terah: Terah</hi> living in all two hundred and five years, <hi>Abraham</hi> at the death of <hi>Terah</hi> must needs be one hundred thirty five years of age. But the Scripture saith expresly that at his departure out of <hi>Haran,</hi> upon the death of his Father, he was no more but seventy five years old. And if he was seventy five years old at the death of his Father who lived two hundred and five years, he must be born in the one hundred and thirtieth of his Fathers life, and not before; which carries on his birth and death sixty years beyond the former account. So that he outlived <hi>Shem</hi> twenty five years, and dyed only four years before <hi>Heber.</hi> Although therefore he be mentioned before <hi>Haran, Gen.</hi> 11.26. yet indeed <hi>Haran</hi> was the Eldest Son of <hi>Terah,</hi> and born before <hi>Abraham</hi> sixty years. And it appears in the Story, that <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> who were the Children of <hi>Haran</hi> (if <hi>Sarah</hi> was the <hi>Ischa</hi> mentioned, as most suppose she was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.29.) were not much younger then <hi>Abraham</hi> himself. For when <hi>Abraham</hi> was an hundred years old, <hi>Sarah</hi> was ninety, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.17. and <hi>Lot</hi> may well be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be Elder then she; so that of Necessity <hi>Haran</hi> must be many years elder then <hi>Abraham,</hi> even no less then sixty, as we have declared.</p>

it is probable, that God gave him light into the evil of those Superstitions wherein he was educated, revealed himself as the only true God, and so prepared him for his Call unto the tedious journeying, and long peregrination that ensued thereon.</p>

And herein did God manifest that he took his <hi>seed</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him into the Covenant, as those, who no less then himself, were to be made partakers of the righteousness exhibited therein, as also to be used for the chanel where the holy seed was to be carried on; untill the <hi>Word</hi> was to take it and <hi>to be made flesh, John</hi> 1.14. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. And by this Ordinance of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> were his posterity separated from the rest of the world, and united among themselves. For however <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> carried the outward sign of <hi>circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> out of the pale and limits of the Church communicating it unto the Nations that sprang of them unto this day, unto whose observance they also adhere, who being of another extract, have received the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was of the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of persecuting <hi>Ishmael,</hi> as the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> with very many of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; yet their observance of it, was never under the Law of God, nor accepted with him, but is rather accursed by him. But as it was continued in the posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> according unto the promise, it was the fundamental uniting principle of the Church amongst them, though dispersed into innumerable particular families. For as there were as many Churches before, as there were families, <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Oeconomical</hi> or paternal Rule, being the same, now the Covenant being one, and the <hi>token</hi> of the Covenant being one and the same, unto all the families that sprang of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which in their several generations were as the sands of the Sea shore, or as the Stars for multitude, were incorporated into <hi>one body</hi> among themselves, and separated from all the rest of the world. Not that this Ordinance alone was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to constitute the whole Nation one <hi>Ecclesiastical Body</hi> or Church, which was done by the following Institutions of Worship, but that the foundation thereof was first laid herein. Neither without some such general <hi>initiation</hi> into union could it have been orderly accomplished. And as it was the <hi>Glory</hi> of the people of old whilst they walked in the steps of the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi>: So it was the carnal boast of their degenerate posterity. Hence have we so often mention of those who were <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised,</hi> in the way of reproach and contempt; and when they renewed the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of it among themselves, upon their first entrance into the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> after its commission in the Wilderness, it is said, that <hi>they rolled away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Aegypt,</hi> Josh. 5.9. because they were now no more as the <hi>Aegyptians, uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised.</hi> And it was their glory, both because God made it the token of his receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be his peculiar people out of all the Nations of the Earth, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was the pledge of their obedience unto God, which is the glory of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or people. But their posterity being <hi>carnal,</hi> and degenerating from the faith and obedience of <hi>Abraham,</hi> having quite lost the Grace betokened by it, which as <hi>Moses</hi> often declares unto them, was the <hi>circumcision of their hearts to hear and obey the voice of God,</hi> did yet, and do yet, to this day, boast of it as a sign of their <hi>separation</hi> unto God from other people: not considering that these things were <hi>mutual,</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                     <hi>Abraham,</hi> which also we have been more brief in the explication of, because its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration hath elsewhere occurred unto us. Now from this Call of <hi>Abraham</hi> unto the deliverance of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was as <hi>Moses</hi> assures us, four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.40, 41. and so saith our Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord tells <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his posterity should be afflicted in a strange Land four hundred years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.13. which words are repeated by <hi>Stephen</hi> in his Sermon to the <hi>Jews, Acts</hi> 7.6. the reason of this different account may be briefly enquired after. Here is a double limitation of time, 1. of four hundred and thirty years by <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. Of four hundred years, by God himself unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> repeated by <hi>Stephen</hi>: The words of <hi>Moses</hi> are recorded, Exod. 12.40.41. <hi>Now the sojournings of the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>in</hi> Aegypt, <hi>were four hundred and thirty years; and it came to pass, at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even on the self same day, it came to pass, that all the Hosts of the Lord went out of the Land of Aegypt.</hi> It is evident that there is an ambiguity in the words of <hi>Moses,</hi> for if <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>dwelt in Aegypt,</hi> it can design no longer space of time then they dwelt there after the descent of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which by an evident computation of the times, containeth but half the space limited, of four hundred and thirty years. If it refer only to the <hi>children of Israel,</hi> then it takes in all the sojournings and peregrinations of that People <hi>who</hi> dwelt in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> from the first day of their being the people of God. Now this ambiguity is perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by our Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made; and the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the Law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul.</hi> The giving of the Law, was, as we shall see, immediately upon their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi>; and saith he, the 430 years are to be reckoned from the <hi>Call of Abraham,</hi> when God first entred into Covenant with him; <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2, 3. From thence unto the departure out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the giving of the Law that ensued, are 430 years. It is evident then, that by the <hi>sojourning</hi> and peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> not their meer aboad in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which after their going down, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. was only 215 years, or thereabouts; but the whole course of that <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> after they were in <hi>Abraham</hi> called from their own Country and a certain Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation therein, until their leaving of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in order unto their taking possession of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> as a perpetual inheritance (that is commensurate unto the duration of the especial Covenant made with them) is intended. It remains then that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the other space of time assigned by God in Vision unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the affliction of his seed under persecution, namely, <hi>four hundred years, Gen.</hi> 11.13. Now herein, either the round number of 400 is put for 430, or 30 years are to be abated out of the latter number, for some special cause and reason. The former seems not probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Moses</hi> doth so <hi>emphatically</hi> note that it was in the <hi>four hundred and thirtieth year, that very same day, or night,</hi> and therefore 30 <hi>years</hi> must be taken of, either from the beginning or end of the latter number. To detract it from the <hi>end</hi> there is no reason; nor will <hi>Moses</hi> his exact observation of that period allow us so to do. It must therefore be from the beginning. Now this prediction of God unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> about the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or persecution of his seed for 400 years, was given him before the birth of <hi>Isaac,</hi> who being of his seed according to the promise, was to have his share in this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; yea, it was to begin with him. He was born, as was proved, 25 ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There began the 400 years of their affliction, which ended with the 430 of their peregrination.</p>

The matter of it was <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Saeh,</hi> v. 3. that is, a <hi>young Lamb</hi> or <hi>Kid</hi>; a male without blemish, for either might be used in this service, v. 5. The manner of the service was, 1. In the <hi>Preparation,</hi> the Lamb or Kid was to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into custody on the <hi>tenth day</hi> of the month, and kept therein four days, <hi>v.</hi> 6. which, as the <hi>Jews</hi> say, was partly that they might discern perfectly whether it had any <hi>blemish</hi> or no; partly that they might by the sight of the <hi>Lamb</hi> be minded of their duty, and the mercy of their deliverance. Indeed it was, that it might prefigure the <hi>imprisonment</hi> of the <hi>Lamb of God, Isa.</hi> 53.7, 8. who took away the sins of the world. This preparation, the Jews say, was temporary, and observed only at the first Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ordinance in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that partly lest in their haste they should not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have been able to prepare their Lambs. So also was the <hi>sprinkling of the bloud</hi> on the posts of the doors of their dwelling houses, <hi>v.</hi> 7. with <hi>Hysop,</hi> which could not be afterwards observed, when by God's Institution the whole Congregation were to celebrate it in <hi>one place</hi>; and it had respect unto their present deliverance from the destroying Angel, <hi>v.</hi> 12, and 13. In like manner was their eating it, with their <hi>loins girt,</hi> their <hi>shooes on their feet,</hi> and their <hi>staves in their hands,</hi> v. 11. that they might be in a readiness for their immediate departure, which was not afterwards observed by our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> nor any of the Church. For these signs ceased with the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of them. 2. This Lamb was to be provided for <hi>each houshold,</hi> v. 3, 4. which was the third distribution of that people, the first being into <hi>Tribes,</hi> and the second into <hi>Families,</hi> from the twelve Patriarchs and their immediate Sons, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7.16, 17, 18. But because their was an allowance to make their company proportionable unto their provision of a Lamb, joyning or separating housholds, <hi>v.</hi> 4. they ate it afterwards in <hi>Societies</hi> or <hi>Fraternities</hi>; as our Saviour had <hi>twelve</hi> with him at the eating of it. And the Jews require ten at least in Society unto this celebration. Whence the <hi>Targum</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly on this place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.4. <hi>If the men of the house be fewer then the number of ten</hi>; for this was a sacred number with them. They Circumcise not, Marry not, Divorce not, unless <hi>ten</hi> be present. Thence is their saying <hi>in Pirke Aboth, where ten sit and learn the Law, the divine presence resteth on them,</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.1. 3. The Lamb being provided was to be <hi>killed,</hi> and it was directed that the whole Assembly of the Congregation of <hi>Israel</hi> should <hi>kill</hi> it, <hi>v.</hi> 6. that is, every one for himself and family. But after the giving of the Law, and the erection of a <hi>Priesthood</hi> in the Church, this work, as it was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, was left unto the <hi>Priests,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 4. The <hi>place</hi> where it was to be killed, was at first in their several houses, or where-ever the Assembly of the people was; but this afterwards was forbidden, and the Sacrifice of the <hi>Passover</hi> confined expresly to the place where the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and Temple were to be, and not else-where, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.6, 7. 5. The preparation of the whole Lamb for eating, was by <hi>roasting</hi> it, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. and that was done with <hi>bread unleavened,</hi> and <hi>bitterness,</hi> or bitter herbs, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and it was <hi>all</hi> to be eaten that night. What remained until the morning was to be <hi>burned</hi> in the fire, as a thing dedicate, and not to be polluted. The Jews have many Traditions about the manner of eating and drinking at this Supper, of the <hi>Cups</hi> they drank and blessed, of the Cakes they brake, of their Washings, and the like, which as they have all of them been discussed by others at large, so I shall not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour about them, as being satisfied that they are most, if not all of them, inventions of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> since the destruction of second Temple, and many of them taken up from what they observed to be in use among Christians, or were led into by such as from the profession of Christianity <hi>apostatized</hi> unto them, which were no small multitude.</p>

The double extraordinary <hi>Sabbath</hi> wherewith it was begun and ended; for on the <hi>first day,</hi> and last day of the seven, there was to be a solemn and holy Convocation unto the Lord, to be observed in a cessation from all labour, and in holy duties; and here also it were lost labour to reckon up the <hi>Cautions,</hi> Rules and Instructions which the <hi>Jewish Doctors</hi> give about the nature, kinds and sorts of <hi>Leaven,</hi> of the search that was to be made for it, and the like, most of them being vain imaginations of superstitious minds ignorant of the Truth of God.</p>

to pass, when</hi> Pharaoh <hi>would hardly let us go, that the Lord slew all the first born in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>both the first born of Man, and the first born of beast, therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the Matrix being Males, but all the first born of my Children I redeem; and it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and as frontlets between thine eyes; for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth from out of</hi> Egypt. The last is Deut. 11. from 13. to 21. <hi>And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken diligently unto my commandments, which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul, that I will give you the rain of your Land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thy oyle, and I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattel, that thou mayest eat and be full, take heed to your selves that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside and serve other Gods, and worship them, and then the Lords wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the Heaven that there be no rain, and that the Land yield not her fruit, and lest ye perish quickly from the good Land which the Lord giveth you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall you lay up these my words in your hearts, and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, and that they may be as frontlets between your eyes, and you shall teach them your Children speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou lyest down, and when thou risest up, and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates, that your dayes may be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed, and the dayes of your Children in the Land which the Lord swore unto your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to give them as the dayes of Heaven upon the Earth.</hi>

Hence <hi>Fagius</hi> tells us a story, of a <hi>Master</hi> amongst them in his dayes, who sold many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of these <hi>Phylacteries</hi> unto his Country-men, which had nothing in them but <hi>Cards,</hi> which served their turns well enough. Their Masters also are curious in describing what <hi>part</hi> of the head they must be applyed unto, namely, the fore-part from ear to ear; and the hand must be the <hi>left</hi> hand, whereby yet they will have the <hi>arm</hi> above the <hi>elbow</hi> to be understood; and when they must be worn, namely by <hi>day,</hi> not by <hi>night,</hi> on the <hi>Week dayes,</hi> not on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the like worthy specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.

The Law of this dedication is recorded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.12, 13. and the manner of its performance is farther added, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Every thing that openeth the matrix, in all flesh which they bring unto the Lord, whether it be of men or beast, shall be thine; nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the first firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem; and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the mony of five shekels, after the shekel of the Sanctuary, which is twenty Gerahs. But the firstling of a Cow, or the firstling of a Sheep, or the firstling of a Goat, thou shalt not redeem, they are holy, thou shalt sprinkle their bloud upon the Altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the Lord.</hi> The whole dedication of the first-born Males is, distributed into three parts, 1. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> who were to be redeemed with <hi>five shekels,</hi> twenty <hi>Gerahs</hi> to one shekel, that is about <hi>twelve shillings</hi> of our mony. 2. <hi>Clean beasts,</hi> such as were appointed to be offered in sacrifice on other occasions, as the Kine, the Sheep and the Goats.

And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? And he cried unto the Lord, and the Lord shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There he made a Statute and an Ordinance, and there he proved them, and said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of those diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians, for I am the Lord that healeth thee.</hi> The whole

                  <p>The waters being <hi>bitter,</hi> that they could not drink of them, God shewed to <hi>Moses</hi> a Tree; that is, say some of the Jewish Doctors, he shewed him the <hi>virtue</hi> of a Tree to cure and make wholesome bitter waters. And they say it was a Tree, whose flowers and fruit were <hi>bitter</hi>; for no other reason, but because <hi>Elisha</hi> afterwards cured <hi>salt waters</hi> by casting into them a cruise of salt.

Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the Lord? And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill us with thirst? And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. And the Lord said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the Elders of Israel, and thy Rod wherewith thou smotest the River take in thine hand, and go, behold I will stand before thee there upon the Rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the Rock, and there shall come water out of it that they may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the Elders of Israel. And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is the Lord amongst us or not?</hi> Marching up farther into the Wilderness, and coming to <hi>Rephidim,</hi> their fourth station from the <hi>Red-sea,</hi> meeting with no waters to their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, they fell into an high murmuring against the Lord, and mutiny against <hi>Moses</hi> their Leader. And this iniquity, the <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors suppose, aggravated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were in no absolute necessity of water, the dew which fell from the <hi>Manna</hi> running in some streams.

And the holy Ghost hath put sundry remarks upon this dispensation of God towards them.</p>
                  <p>First, Upon the sin of the people, whence he gave a double name to the place where they sinned, for a memorial to all generations; he called it <hi>Massah</hi> and <hi>Meribah</hi>; which words our Apostle renders by <gap reason="foreign">

And on the part of <hi>Moses,</hi> as to the signal trial that God had there of his faith and obedience, in that great difficulty which he conflicted withall; as also of those of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Levi,</hi> who in a preparation unto their ensuing dedication unto God, clave unto him in his straits. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.8. <hi>And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The mercy likewise that ensued in giving them water from the Rock, is most frequently celebrated, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.15, 16. <hi>Psal.</hi> 105.41. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.15. Now all this was done, to bring them to attend and enquire diligently into the kernel, the pearl of this mercy, whose outward shell was so undeservedly free, and so deservedly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. For in this Rock of <hi>Horeb</hi> lay hid a <hi>spiritual Rock,</hi> as our Apostle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. even Christ the Son of God, who being smitten with the Rod of <hi>Moses,</hi> or the stroke and curse of the Law, administred by him, gave out waters of life freely unto all that thirst and come unto him.</p>

And all these intimations were still given them on their great and signal provocations, to declare, that neither did their <hi>Goodness</hi> deserve them, nor could their <hi>sins</hi> hinder the progress of the counsel of God's will, and the work of his grace. Hereby also did God revive unto them the grace of the promise, which being given, as our Apostle observes, four hundred and thirty years before the giving of the Law, could not be disanull'd or impeach'd thereby.</p>

But the opinion of <hi>Moses Gerundensis</hi> is far more probable, that <hi>Horeb</hi> was the name of the Wilderness, and <hi>Sinai</hi> of the Mountain. That <hi>Sinai</hi> was the name of the Hill is expresly affirmed, Chap. 19.18, 20. <hi>And Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>was altogether on a smoak, because the Lord descended upon it in fire; and the Lord came down upon Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>on the top of the Mount.</hi> So <hi>Psalm</hi> 68.17.

as the place materially considered, is as evident an object of Gods displeasure against the lower part of the Creation, upon the account of sin, as almost any place in the world, a wast and howling Wilderness, a place left to solitude and barrenness, so in its allusion or relation to the Worship of God, it is cast by our Apostle under <hi>bondage,</hi> and placed in an opposition to the <hi>Worship</hi> and Church State of the Gospel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24, 25.</p>
                  <p>Being come unto this place, it is said, <hi>Moses went up unto the Mount unto God.</hi> It <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>32</label> doth not appear that he had any new immediate express command so to do: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably he both came to that place, and so soon as he came thither, went up into the Mountain, in obedience to the command, and faith in the promise of God which he received upon his first call, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.12. wherein it was given him for a token and pledge of their deliverance, that thereon they should worship God, or receive the Law in that Mountain; which is also the judgement of <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> upon the place. And it is not unlikely, but that God at that time fixed the cloud which went before them, as the token of his presence, on the top of <hi>Sinai,</hi> as a new direction unto <hi>Moses</hi> for his going up thither.</p>
                  <p>Being ascended, God calls unto him, (the word of the Lord saith <hi>Jonathan</hi>) and <label type="milestone">

Two things he proposeth to their consideration; First The benefits that they had already been made partakers of hinted out unto them by the mighty and wonderful works of his power. And Secondly, <hi>New Priviledges</hi> to be granted unto them. In the first, he minds them that he had <hi>born them on Eagles wings.</hi> This <hi>Jarchi</hi> interprets of their sudden gathering out of all the <hi>Coasts of Goshen</hi> unto <hi>Ramesis</hi> to go away together the same night, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.37. But although it may be allowed, that they had in that wonderfull collection of themselves, some especial <hi>Assistance</hi> of Providence, besides the preparation which they had been making for sundry dayes before, yet this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, evidently extends it self unto the whole dispensation of God towards them, from the first of their deliverance unto that day. Generally they all of them explain this <hi>Allegorical</hi> expression from the manner how the <hi>Eagles,</hi> as they say, carry their young, which is on their <hi>backs</hi> or wings because they fear nothing above them, as soaring over all, whereas other <hi>Fowls</hi> carry their young between their feet, as fearing other Birds of Prey above them: But there is no need to wring the expression, to force out of it such uncertain niceties. There is no more intended, but that God carried them speedily and safely as an <hi>Eagle</hi> is born by its wings in her course.</p>
                  <p>To this Remembrance of former mercies, God adds Secondly, A <hi>treble</hi> Promise: First, That they should be <gap reason="foreign">

There is none who sees not the vanity and folly of these things, which yet is a part of their <hi>Oral Law,</hi> whereunto, as hath been shewed, they ascribe more oftentimes, then to the written Word it self.</p>
                  <p>Of these 613 Precepts, 248 they say are <hi>Affirmative</hi> Precepts; because there are, as <label type="milestone">

                  <p>This is the Account that the <hi>Jews</hi> give of the precepts of the Law, and both the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>33</label> number of them, as also their distribution and distinction which they have cast them into, are part as they pretend of their <hi>Oral Law</hi>; which may easily be improved unto a conviction of the vanity of it. For whereas it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is evident, that many of these precepts are <hi>coincident,</hi> many pretended so to be, are no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts at all, and sundry of them are not founded on the places from whence they profess to gather them; yea, that in many of them the mind of the Holy Ghost is plainly perverted, and a contrary sense annexed unto his words, so it is most unquestionable, that there are sundry Commands and Institutions, especially in, about and concerning Sacrifices, that are no way taken notice of by them in this collection, as I could easily make good by instances sufficient, it is evident that that Rule cannot be of God, whereof this collection is pretended to be a part. But as I have said before, because there is a Representation in them of no small multitude of commands, especially in things concerning their <hi>carnal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> it was necessary that they should be here represented, though they have been before transcribed from them by others. My principal design herein, is to give light into some passages of our Apostle, as also to other expressions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this <hi>Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances,</hi> in other places of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Censure</hi> our Apostle gives of this whole <hi>System</hi> of Divine Worship, Chap. 9.<label type="milestone">

And that not only as to the <hi>manner</hi> and multitude of them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as to their <hi>natures.</hi> They are carnal things, and could by no means effect the great, spiritual, glorious and eternal ends, which God had designed, proposed and promised in that Covenant unto whose administration they were annexed, until the <hi>time of Reformation</hi> should come.

                  </argument>
                  <p>BY the <hi>Sanction of the Law</hi> we intend the Promises and Penalties wherewith, by <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>1</label> God, the observation of it, and obedience unto it, was enforced. This the <hi>Apostle</hi> hath respect unto in sundry places of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> the principal whereof are reported in the fore-going Dissertation. To represent this <hi>distinctly,</hi> we may observe, that the <hi>Law</hi> falls under a three-fold consideration: First, As it was a Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and Expression of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and the Covenant of Works established thereon. Secondly, as it had a new <hi>End</hi> and design put upon the Administration of it, to direct the Church unto the use and benefit of the Promise given of old to <hi>Adam,</hi> and renewed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> four hundred and thirty years before. Thirdly, As it was the Instrument of the Rule and Government of the Church and People of <hi>Israel,</hi> with respect unto the Covenant made with them in and about the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And in this three-fold respect it had a three-fold <hi>Sanction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, As considered <hi>absolutely,</hi> it was attended with promises of <hi>life,</hi> and threatnings <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> of <hi>death,</hi> both Eternal. The original promise of life upon obedience, and the <hi>curse</hi> on its transgression were inseparably annexed unto it; yea, were essential parts of it, as it contained the Covenant between God and Man. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>Now in the Administration of the Law, the Church was thus far brought under <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> the obligation of these Promises and Threatnings of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> eternal, so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in the one, and made obnoxious unto the other, as that if they used not the Law according to the new dispensation of it, wherein it was put into a subserviency unto the Promise; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. that they were left to stand and fall according to the absolute tenure of that first <hi>Covenant</hi> and its ratification, which by reason of the entrance of sin proved fatally ruinous unto all that cleaved unto it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.31.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Law had in this Administration of it, a new End and design put <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> upon it, and that in <hi>three</hi> things. First, that it was made <hi>directive</hi> and instructive unto another End, and not meerly preceptive as at the beginning. The Authoritative In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions that in it were super-added to the Moral commands of the Covenant of works, did all of them <hi>direct</hi> and teach the Church to look for Righteousness and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the original ends of the first Covenant, in <hi>Another,</hi> and by another way; as the Apostle at large <hi>disputes</hi> in this Epistle, and declares positively, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. throughout. Secondly, In that it had a dispensation added unto the commands of obedience and interpretation, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by condiscension, given by God himself, as to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of its observance, and manner of its performance, in reference unto this new end. It required not absolutely <hi>perfect obedience,</hi> but <hi>perfectness of heart,</hi> integrity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in them that obeyed. And unto the Law thus considered, the former promises and threatnings are annexed. For the neglect of this use of it left the Transgressors obnoxious to the <hi>Curse</hi> denounced in general against them that <hi>continued not in the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50110:152"/>
whole Law to do it.</hi> Thirdly, It had merciful relief provided against sin, for the support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and consolation of sinners, as we shall see in the consideration of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> Thirdly, it may be considered as it was the <hi>Instrument of the Rule and Government</hi> of the People and Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> according to the tenure of the Covenant made with them about the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and their living unto God therein. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it had <hi>four</hi> things in it. First, That it represented unto the people the <hi>Holiness</hi> of God, the Effects whereof are implanted in the Law according to its Original consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; whereupon in it they are so often called to be <hi>holy,</hi> because the Lord and <hi>Law-giver</hi> was holy. Secondly, A Representation of his Grace and Condiscention, pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sin in the Covenant of mercy, in as much as he allowed a Compensation by <hi>Sacrifices</hi> for so many transgressions, which in their own nature were forfeitures of their interest in that Land. Thirdly, That it was a righteous Rule of obedience unto that People, as unto their especial <hi>Covenant</hi> condition. Fourthly, That it fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the <hi>severity</hi> of God against wilful transgressors of his Covenant, as now renewed in order to the Promise, seeing every such transgression was attended in their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Rule, with death without mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>6</label> It is of the Law, under this <hi>third consideration,</hi> though not absolutely as the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Government of the People in <hi>Canaan,</hi> but as it had a Representation in it of that Administration of grace and mercy which was contained in the <hi>Promises</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treat. Concerning this, or the Law in this sense, we may consider; first, the <hi>Promises,</hi> then the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of it. And the <hi>Promises</hi> are of two sorts. First, such as God took immediately upon himself the accomplishment of; Secondly, such as others, by his institution and appointment were to communicate the benefit of unto the obedient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>7</label> The first are of <hi>three sorts.</hi> First, of <hi>Life Temporal,</hi> as it was an Instrument of their Government, and <hi>eternal</hi> with God, as the Promise or Covenant of grace was exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified or represented therein. <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Of a Spiritual Redeemer, Saviour, Deliverer, really to <hi>effect</hi> what the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Institution did <hi>represent,</hi> so to save them eternally, to be exhibited in the fulness of time, as we have at large already proved. Thirdly, There are given out with the Law <hi>various Promises</hi> of intervenient and mixed mercies to be enjoyed in earthly things in this world, that had their immediate respect unto the mercy of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> representing spiritual Grace, annexed to the then present Administration of the Covenant of Grace. Some of these concerned the collation of good things; others, the preventing of, or delivery of them from Evils, both expressed in great variety.</p>

                     <hi>Muchram,</hi> and under the <hi>Cherem,</hi> it is almost evident, that these three degrees are not distinguished as is commonly supposed, namely, that the <hi>Shammatha</hi> should exceed the <hi>Cherem,</hi> and that only the <hi>Niddui,</hi> the highest and extremest sentence in this solemn form, being so often called the <hi>Cherem. Shammatha</hi> therefore is only a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Name for the Expulsion of a Person, sometimes with the <hi>Niddui,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the <hi>Cherem,</hi> which yet I do not suppose was alwayes thus horrid and fierce.</p>
                  <p>To add unto the terror of this Sentence, they used to accompany the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing <label type="milestone">

                  <p>I have not reported these things, as though for matter and manner, they wholly belonged unto the <hi>penalties</hi> of the Law that were of Divine Institution. Many things in the manner of their performance, as they are now expressed by the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> were certainly of their own arbitrary invention. When their use amongst them first began, is unknown; though it be not improbable, that sundry things of this nature were practised by them before the destruction of the Second Temple, when they had mixed many of their own <hi>Superstitions</hi> with the Worship of God, as is evident from the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>But this also is certain, that God in sundry cases had appointed that some Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors <label type="milestone">

Hence some have made this distinction between the three degrees of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</p>
                  <p>First, The <hi>Niddui</hi> concerned only the <hi>Person,</hi> and his separation from Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: <hi>Cherem</hi> had also Confiscation of Goods attending of it; the substance of the Transgressor being devoted; and <hi>Shammatha</hi> was accompanied with the death of the devoted Person; Which carnal penalties under the Gospel being removed, that great and sore revenge which disobedient sinners are to expect from the hand of God at the last day, is substituted by our Apostle in the room of them all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Civil Punishments</hi> next succeed, and they were of <hi>three sorts.</hi> First, <hi>Corporeal</hi>:<label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Corporeal</hi> punishment was that only of <hi>Stripes,</hi> not exceeding the number <hi>of forty,</hi> Deut. 25.23. An account of the <hi>Jews</hi> Opinions, and the manner of their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this punishment, is given us by many; in particular, exactly by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in his Preface unto his <hi>Bibliotheca Rabbinica,</hi> whither I refer the Reader. They call it <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>filius plagarum.</hi> Many Crimes doubtless rendered Persons obnoxious to this penalty; but they are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly expressed in the Law. The <hi>Jews</hi> now reckon up <hi>seven</hi> instances of unlawful
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:50110:155"/>
copulation with <hi>Women,</hi> free and unmarried, for adultery, as is known, was capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal by the express sentence of the Law. As 1. <hi>With a Sister.</hi> 2. <hi>A Fathers Sister.</hi> 3. <hi>A Mothers Sister.</hi> 4. <hi>A Wifes Sister.</hi> 5. <hi>A Brothers Widow.</hi> 6. <hi>An Vncles Widow.</hi> 7. <hi>A Woman separated.</hi> Many other Crimes also they reckon up with reference unto <hi>Ceremonial Institutions,</hi> as eating of <hi>fat,</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and <hi>leaven</hi> on the Passeover, making an <hi>Oyle</hi> like the holy Oyle; even all such trangressions as are threatned with punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but have no express kind of punishment annexed unto them.</p>

It may therefore be supposed, that there is a <hi>Prolepsis</hi> used in the recording of this story, and that indeed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Covenant by Sacrifice, which was accompanied with the <hi>Reading of the Book,</hi> was not until after the third return of <hi>Moses</hi> from the Mount, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Tables. But this also may well be doubted, seeing this Sacrifice was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and offered by the <hi>young Men of the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>v.</hi> 5. that is, the <hi>First Born,</hi> whose Office was superseded upon the Separation of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons unto the Priesthood, which God had designed before that last descent of <hi>Moses</hi> from the Mount. We must therefore leave things in the order wherein they are set down and recorded.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:50110:156"/>
It appears therefore that <hi>Moses wrote</hi> the Law as he received it from God. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, he came down and read it in the ears of the people. And he proposed it unto them, as containing the <hi>Terms of the Covenant</hi> that God would have them enter into. This they solemnly engaged to the performance of, and thereby had their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission into a New Church-State. This being done, the whole was confirmed by Sacrifice, and the sprinkling of blood, to prefigure the great confirmation of the New Covenant by the blood of Christ, as we shall see afterwards.</p>

Many Learned Men have already travailed with great diligence and skill in the discovery of all the several concernments of the Tabernacle and Temple, from whom the <hi>Reader</hi> may receive much satisfaction, who hath a mind to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these things. Add unto all this, that the Writing of this part of these Discourses, is fallen upon such a <hi>season,</hi> as affords me very little encouragement, or assistance to enlarge upon them. Only that the Reader may not go away without a taste in one instance of what he might have expected in the whole, I shall chuse out one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Vtensil</hi> of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and give an account of it unto him.

                  <p>The Jews generally affirm, that these visions of the glory of God by <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>17</label> were the same, and that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw nothing but what <hi>Isaiah</hi> saw also; only they say, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw the glory of God and his Majesty, as a <hi>country man</hi> who admires at all the splendor of the Court of the King, <hi>Isaiah</hi> as a Courtier, who took notice only of the <hi>Person</hi> of the King himself.

                     <hi>Cherubims,</hi> from their speed in the accomplishment of their duty. <hi>Isaiah</hi> saw his vision as in the Temple; for although from those words, <hi>I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the Temple. Aben-Ezra</hi> and <hi>Kimchi</hi> suppose, that he saw the Throne of God in Heaven, and only his train of Glory descending into the Temple; yet it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he saw the <hi>Throne</hi> it self in the Temple, his train spreading abroad to the filling of the whole house. For he calls the Temple, the <hi>Throne of his Glory, Jer.</hi> 14.21. and a <hi>glorious high Throne,</hi> chap. 17.12. that is, a Throne high and lifted up, as in this place. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw his vision abroad in the open field, by the River of <hi>Chebar,</hi> chap. 1.3. <hi>Isaiah</hi> first saw the <hi>Lord himself,</hi> and then his glorious attendants; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> first the <hi>Charist</hi> of his glory, and then God above it. <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s <hi>Seraphims</hi> had <hi>six wings,</hi> with two whereof they covered their faces, which <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s <hi>Cherubims</hi> had not; and that because <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s vision represented Christ <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.41. with the mysterie of the calling of the Gentiles, and rejection of the Jews, which the Angels were not able to look into, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.9, 10. and were therefore said to cover their <hi>faces with their wings,</hi> as not being able to look into the depths of those mysteries; but in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s vision, when they attended the Will of God in the works of his Providence, they looked upon them with <hi>open face.</hi> Wherefore from the diversity in all these Visions, it appears, that nothing certain concerning the <hi>form</hi> or <hi>wings</hi> of the <hi>Cherubims</hi> made by <hi>Moses</hi> can be collected. Most probably they had each of them only <hi>one face</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly looking one towards the other, and each <hi>two wings,</hi> which being stretched out forward over the <hi>Mercy-seat,</hi> met each other, and were meer <hi>Emblems</hi> of the Divine presence and care over his Covenant, People and Worship.</p>

This Priest with his Attendants of the same Family was the <hi>hinge,</hi> whereon the whole Worship of the <hi>Judaical</hi> Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended and turned.

Now this High Priest being in his Person and his Office, the <hi>Most Illustrious Type</hi> of the <hi>Messiah</hi> and his Office, and the principal means whereby God instructed his Church of Old in the Mysterie of the Reconciliation and Salvation of sinners, most things concerning him, are expresly and at large handled by our Apostle, and must, God assisting, come under our consideration in the several places wherein by him they are insisted on; I shall therefore here only in these <hi>previous discourses</hi> give a brief account of some such concernments of his Person and Office as will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly again occur unto us.</p>

The Foundation of an especial <hi>Priesthood</hi> in the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> is laid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Provision being made of <hi>Holy Things,</hi> God proceeds to supply the Church with <hi>Holy</hi> or <hi>Dedicate Persons</hi> for their Administration. The first thing expressed is the <hi>Call</hi> of the High Priest. Hereof there are two parts. First, Gods Revelation and <hi>Authoritative Constitution</hi> concerning it. Secondly, His actual <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</hi> The former is expressed, Exod. 28.1. <hi>And take thou unto thee</hi> Aaron <hi>thy Brother and his Sons, that they may Minister unto me in the Priests Office. Aaron</hi> was the Elder Brother of <hi>Moses,</hi> born three years before him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.7. and was now eighty four or eighty five years of Age, when God thus calls and appoints him to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>Priesthood.</hi> With him all his Sons, all the Males of his Family were dedicated unto the Service of God in their successive Generations. And in this <hi>Call</hi> unto his Office, he was a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ, who entered not on his Priesthood, but by the Designation and Authority of the Father: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Unto the compleating of his Call, there concurred his <hi>Consecration</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>

                     </gap>; <hi>thou shalt bring them nigh,</hi> the Word used in all sacred Approaches and Dedications to God. The Priests themselves were made a <hi>Corban.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, They were washed with water. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Thou shalt wash them with water.</hi> After this the Priests on all occasions were to wash themselves; at present this being a sacred action, and they being not as yet consecrated, it was performed towards them by <hi>Moses,</hi> who at this and other times discharged the Office of an <hi>Extraordinary Priest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Being <hi>washed,</hi> they were cloathed with the <hi>Holy Garments, v.</hi> 5, 6. of which afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The High Priest being cloathed, was anointed with the <hi>Holy Oyle</hi> poured on his Head, and running down over all his Garments, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Psalm</hi> 132. <hi>v.</hi> 2. The making, and use of this Ointment, prefiguring the Unction of the Lord Christ with all the Graces of the Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. are declared, <hi>Chap.</hi> 30. <hi>v.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Sacrifices of all sorts were offered unto God. 1. The <hi>Mincha</hi> or <hi>Meat-Offering.</hi> 2. The <hi>Chataath</hi> or Sin-Offering, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 1, 4. 3. The <hi>Hola,</hi> or whole Burnt Offerings, <hi>v.</hi> 18.25. 4. <hi>Shelamim</hi> or Peace-Offerings, <hi>v.</hi> 25. 5. <hi>Tenumoth,</hi> and <hi>Tenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>photh,</hi> Heave, and Wave-Offerings, <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. 6. <hi>Nesek</hi> or the Drink-Offerings; <hi>v.</hi> 40. So that in the Consecration of the Priest, all Sacrifices also were as it were a-new consecrated unto God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, In the use of this Sacrifice there were five Ceremonies used belonging in a peculiar manner unto their Consecration. 1. The <hi>Filling of their Hand, Ver.</hi> 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This we have rendred, <hi>Thou shalt consecrate them,</hi> as though their <hi>Consecration</hi> was some peculiar Act distinct from these prescribed Ceremonies. But that which is thus expressed, is only one of them; or the putting of some parts of the Sacrifice into, or upon their Hands to bear to the Altar, which being the first <hi>Action</hi> in them belonging to the Sacerdotal Office, (for in all the former pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages they were meerly passive) is sometimes by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> used for <hi>Consecration</hi> its self. 2. The putting of Blood, upon the Tips of their right Ears, and upon the <hi>Thumbs</hi> of their right Hands, and the great <hi>Toes</hi> of their right Feet, <hi>v.</hi> 20. intimating their readiness to hear, and perform the Will of God. And this blood was taken from one of the <hi>Rams</hi> that was offered for a Burnt-Offering. 3. The sprinkling of them with blood from the Altar, and the Anointing Oyle together, upon all their Garments, <hi>v.</hi> 21. The <hi>Imposition, or laying of their hands</hi> on the Head of the Beast to be sacrificed for a <hi>Sin-Offering, v.</hi> 10.15. denoting the <hi>passing away</hi> of their sin from them, that they might be fit to Minister before the Lord. 5. The delivery of the <hi>Wave-Offering</hi> into their Hands as a pledge of their future portion, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 28.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The <hi>continuance</hi> of all this Ceremony is observed, <hi>v.</hi> 30. By the Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Sacrifices mentioned it was continued seven dayes. During this time <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, abode <hi>night and day</hi> at the door of the Tabernacle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; after all which they were admitted unto, and administred in their Office. Now all this <hi>Solemnity</hi> was used by the appointment of God, partly, to beget a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> in the Priests themselves unto his Worship, and in the Administration of it; partly, to teach and instruct the whole Church in the Mysteries of their Redemption by the true High Priest, whose Person and Office was shadowed out hereby, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards will more fully appear.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>High priest</hi> being thus arraied, was prepared for the work of his Office, which <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>7</label> was three-fold: 1. To <hi>offer Sacrifices</hi> to God for the people. 2. To <hi>bless the people</hi> in the name of God. 3. To <hi>judge them.</hi> For the first, our Apostle declares it, and insists upon it frequently in this Epistle, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.3. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.3, 4. <hi>chap.</hi> 7.2. <hi>chap.</hi> 10.1. And his work in the business of sacrifices was three-fold.</p>
                  <p>First, That which he performed <hi>himself alone,</hi> none being admitted to assist him, or to be present with him, or so much as to look upon him. This was that which he performed when he carried the bloud into the most <hi>holy place</hi> on the day of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.7. The sacrifice before the <hi>Ark, Mercy-seat</hi> and <hi>Cherubims</hi> was peculiar to himself alone. And in case of any occasional hinderance or impediment that might befall him, there was always a second Priest who was substituted in his room, that the great service of that day might not be omitted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That which he performed <hi>assisted by other Priests.</hi> Such was the whole ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Sanctuary, Heb.</hi> 9.6. about the daily Incense, the Shew-bread, the Candle-sticks and Lamps, even all the service of the <hi>Holy place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That wherein he had the assistance of the other <hi>Priests,</hi> and the service of the <hi>Levites.</hi> Such were all the services of the <hi>Court</hi> at the <hi>Brazen Altar,</hi> where the <hi>Levites</hi> assisted in the killing, slaying, and removal of the bodies of the beasts that were sacrificed.</p>
                  <p>The especial season of these services, <hi>Diurnal, Sabbatical, Monthly</hi> and <hi>Annual,</hi> are of too great variety and extent to be here insisted on.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His <hi>blessing</hi> of the people was two-fold. First, Solemn, at stated seasons,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>8</label> according unto a <hi>Form</hi> prescribed unto him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Secondly, <hi>Occasional,</hi> with respect unto particular seasons, as <hi>Eli</hi> blessed <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:50110:160"/>Thirdly, His work also was to <hi>Judge</hi> the people. 1. In things concerning the House and Worship of God, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.7. 2. In hard and difficult cases, he joyned with the Judge or Ruler, in judging between men according to the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12. 3. He was always a member of the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> This, I know, is denied by some of the Jews, but it seems to be warranted from <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>9</label> Being thus appointed in his Office, a <hi>Succession</hi> also therein was designed, namely, by the <hi>First-born Male</hi> of the eldest Family or Branch of the Posterity or House of <hi>Aaron.</hi> But the tracing of this succession in particular, is greatly perplexed, for it is no where directly given us in the Scripture; for that space of time wherein the story of the Church is recorded therein. Different names are also in several places given unto the same persons, as seems most probable. Besides, <hi>Josephus,</hi> who is the only approved Writer of the Jews in things of this nature, is either corrupted in some passages on this subject, or doth palpably contradict himself. The <hi>Postalmudical Masters</hi> are so far from yielding any relief in this matter, that by their jarrings and wranglings they render it more perplexed. Neither have those amongst our Writers, who of old or of late have laboured to trace this <hi>Succession,</hi> been able to agree in their computations. Four or five differing <hi>Catalogues</hi> I could give in, that are contended for with some earnestness. I shall not therefore hope, in this brief account of things which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined unto, to give light unto a matter of such intricacy and perplexity.</p>
                  <p>I shall therefore content my self to give the most passant account among the Jews of this <hi>Succession</hi> in general, with some few observations upon it, and so close this discourse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>10</label> It is generally agreed after <hi>Josephus,</hi> that the whole number of <hi>High priests</hi> from <hi>Aaron inclusively</hi> to the destruction of the second Temple, was <hi>eighty and three.</hi> For though in the <hi>Babylonian Talmud,</hi> some of them reckon up above <hi>eighty High priests</hi> under the second Temple alone, yet the more learned of the later Jews, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Tzemach David ad Millen.</hi> 4. <hi>An.</hi> 829. expresly prefer the authority of <hi>Josephus</hi> above them all.</p>
                  <p>Of these <hi>eighty three, thirteen</hi> administred before the Lord under the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> or whilst the Tabernacle built by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wilderness, was the sacred seat of divine Worship and Ordinances. Of these, the first was <hi>Aaron,</hi> the last <hi>Abiathar,</hi> who was put by the Priesthood by <hi>Solomon,</hi> a little before the building of the Temple. And in this Succession there was but one interruption; namely, when <hi>Eli</hi> of the House of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> the younger son of <hi>Aaron,</hi> was preferred to the Priesthood. It is probable that he had been second Priest in the days of his Predecessor, and was doubtless ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto the Office upon the reputation of his Holiness and Wisdom. And it may be that he whose right it was to succeed of the House of <hi>Phineas,</hi> was either uncapable, or judged unworthy.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>11</label> In the first, or <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, there administred eighteen High Priests, whose names are recounted by <hi>Josephus,</hi> lib. 11. cap. 4. lib. 20. cap. 9. Of these, the first was <hi>Zadock</hi>; the last <hi>Jehozadeck</hi> who was carried into captivity by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.14. though I question whether ever he administred as High Priest, only he was left at the destruction of the City and Temple, after the death of his father <hi>Seraiah.</hi> Nor was there any known interruption in this <hi>Series</hi> of Succession, being carried down in a right line from the House of <hi>Phineas</hi> by <hi>Zadock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>12</label> The remainder of the number before mentioned, served under the <hi>second Temple,</hi> being multiplied by the tumults and disorders which the people then fell into. The first of them was <hi>Joshua</hi> the son of <hi>Josedech</hi>; the last one <hi>Phineas,</hi> or <hi>Phananias,</hi> made High Priest by the seditious Villains, a little before the last Siege and destruction of the City.</p>
                  <p>And this succession, or that during this season, had <hi>interruptions</hi> many and great. The first mentioned by <hi>Josephus</hi> was after the death of <hi>Onias,</hi> the fourteenth High Priest from the building of the Temple, when <hi>Antiochus</hi> first put in <hi>Joshua,</hi> who was called <hi>Jason,</hi> the brother of <hi>Onias,</hi> and afterwards displacing him, thrust in <hi>Menelaus</hi> into his room. After a while he puts out this <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and placeth one <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus,</hi> of another Family, in his steed.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Alcimus,</hi> the Family of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> or <hi>Hasmoneans,</hi> took on them the office of the High priesthood. Their race being extirpated by <hi>Herod, Ananus</hi> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Priest, was by force and power put into the place. And from this time forward,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50110:160"/>
to the destruction of the Temple, there was no order observed in the <hi>Succession</hi> of the High Priest, but persons were put in and out at the pleasure of the Rulers, either the <hi>Romans</hi> or the <hi>Herodians.</hi> For <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> being taken prisoner by the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the son of <hi>Aristohulus</hi> his brother, being taken by <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Sofia,</hi> and crucified at <hi>Antioch</hi> by <hi>Marc. Antony,</hi> in whom the race of the <hi>Hasmonaeans</hi> ended, vile persons were put in and out at pleasure, some for a year, some for a month, one for a day, some for a longer season; until the whole Nation, Church and State, rushing into its final and fatal ruine, in their Rebellion at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> they thrust out <hi>Matthias</hi> put in by <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and chose one by lot to succeed him; when God, to manifest his disapprobation of them, caused the lot to fall upon one <hi>Phananias,</hi> a meer <hi>Ideot,</hi> who knew nothing of the place or office which they called him unto, with whom ended the Church and Priesthood of the Jews.</p>

                     </gap>, both <hi>his hands</hi> on the head of it: whence most conclude; that <hi>both the hands</hi> are here also intended.

performance of this work, shall lay <hi>both his hands,</hi> and when a private person did it, he shall lay on <hi>his hand,</hi> the Holy Ghost seems to intimate a difference between them in this action. And this <hi>Ceremony</hi> was observed only when the Offerings was of <hi>Beasts</hi>; not so when it was of <hi>Fowls</hi> or Birds. And when the season of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was stated by Gods prescription for the use of the People, the Priest was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this duty. The meaning of the Ceremony was, <hi>quod illorum capiti sit</hi>; typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and representatively to impose the sin of the Offerer, on the head of the Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, to instruct us in the bearing of our sin by Christ, when through the eternal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he offered himself unto God.</p>

For say they, those that <hi>killed</hi> the Offering, are distinguished from them that took the blood of it, and sprinkled it on the Altar, 2 Chron. 29.22. <hi>So they killed the Bullocks, and the Priests received the blood, and sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it on the Altar.</hi> But those slayers seem not to have been the People, but the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> who were to assist the Priests in their Service, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.19. and who in all greater Sacrifices, did the outward work of <hi>killing,</hi> and slaying. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 10, 11. as also it is said expresly, that they slew the <hi>Paschal Lamb,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. And unto this <hi>killing</hi> of the Bullock, or Kid, or Lamb, answered the <hi>wringing</hi> off of the head of the <hi>Bird,</hi> if the Burnt Offering were of Fowls, which is expresly said to be done by the <hi>Priest, v.</hi> 15. And of him that kills the Offering, <hi>v.</hi> 5. it is said, he shall <hi>flay it, and cut it into its pieces,</hi> v. 6. which was the work of the Priests and their Assistants.</p>
                  <p>The place where it was to be killed, was on the North side of the Altar, <hi>v.</hi> 11. And when it was killed, the blood was taken, or wrung out and sprinkled about the Altar, <hi>v.</hi> 5. which sprinkling of blood was used in all Sacrifices of living Creatures, as eminently prefiguring our sanctification, or purifying of our hearts from an evil conscience by the <hi>sprinkling of the blood of Christ,</hi> Heb. 9.14.

Any sin is there intended whereinto men fall by Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Ignorance, Imprudence, Incogitancy, Temptation, Violence of Affections, and the like. For such was this Sacrifice instituted. And the End which it typically repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented is expressed, 1 John 2.1, 2. <hi>If any man sin we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, and he is the Propitiation for our sins</hi>; namely, in the room of, and as represented by the <hi>Sin-offering</hi> of old, whereby Attonement and Propitiation was <hi>typically</hi> made for sin. Only there was this difference, That whereas the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was appointed to be the rule of the Political Government of the People, wherein many
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50110:167"/>
sins, such as Adultery and Murder were to be punished with Death, and the sinner cut off, there was in such cases <hi>no Sacrifices</hi> appointed, nor admitted; but in the Sacrifice of Christ there is no exception made unto any sin, in those that repent, believe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their sins; not unto those in particular which were excepted in the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As to the <hi>Persons</hi> that were to offer it, there is a general distribution of them in the Text comprehensive of all sorts of Persons whatever. For it is applyed, to 1.

                     </gap>, the <hi>Anointed Priest, Chap.</hi> 4.3. that is, say the Jews generally, and our Expositors also, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; <hi>if he sin according to the sin of the people,</hi> so we; <hi>Castalio</hi> renders the passage, <hi>si Sacerdos inunctus deliquerit in noxiam populi</hi>; if the <hi>Anointed Priest so sin, as to bring guilt upon, or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage unto the people.</hi> As <hi>Achan</hi> did, and <hi>David</hi> also. <hi>Vulg. Lat. delinquere faciens po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum; causing the people to sin</hi>; which is another sense of the words. And this sense the <hi>Jews</hi> generally embrace. For they apply this sinning of the Annointed Priest, unto his <hi>teaching the people amiss</hi>; causing them to err thereby, so <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and others on the place, who are followed by many of ours. But if this be so, the Priest was not allowed the benefit of this Sacrifice of the Sin-offering, for any sin of his own, but only when he caused the people to sin also, which would render his condition worse than theirs, and is contrary unto that of our Apostle; that the Priest was <hi>to offer for his own sins,</hi> and then for the sins of the people. I would there, in <gap reason="foreign">

And so our Apostle seems to expound this place; <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2, 3. The Priests of the Law were compassed with infirmities, and by reason thereof, had need to offer <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> for their own sin, as well as for the sins of the people; seeing he also sinned <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>For the <hi>Time and Season</hi> of this Sacrifice, it may briefly observed, that there were <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>41</label> solemn and set Occasions, some <hi>Monethly,</hi> some Annual, wherein it was to be offered for the whole <hi>Congregation</hi> by especial Command and Institution.

On the <hi>fifteenth day</hi> of the seventh Moneth, and for eight dayes together during the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles.</hi> And the frequent Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrifice was to intimate that nothing was accepted with God, but on the account of what was prefigured thereby, namely, that Perfect Sacrifice which <hi>took away the sin of the world.</hi> There were also especial Occasions of it, with reference unto the persons before enumerated, which have been collected by others.</p>
                  <p>The Principal Ceremony in the <hi>Manner</hi> of its Oblation, was the disposal of <hi>the</hi>

                     <hi>Blood.</hi> For the <hi>Blood</hi> of this Sacrifice had a <hi>triple</hi> disposall. The main of the Blood was poured out at the bottom of the <hi>Altar</hi> of Burnt-offerings, in the Court before the door of the Tabernacle, <hi>v.</hi> 7. A part of it was taken and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the High Priest into the Sanctuary, and put upon the horns of the <hi>Altar of Incense,</hi> that was therein, <hi>v.</hi> 7. The third part, (which was first disposed of) was to be carried into the Most Holy Place, as it was done accordingly on the <hi>day of Expiation, Levit.</hi> 16. But because it was not lawful for him to enter in thither but once in the year, namely, on that Day, at all other times he dipped his <hi>Finger</hi> in the blood, and sprinkled it <hi>seven times</hi> towards the <hi>Veyle,</hi> that parted the Most Holy Place from the Sanctuary, <hi>v.</hi> 6. So that every place of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and all the concernments of it, were sanctified with this <hi>Blood</hi>; even as Jesus Christ who was represented in all this, was dedicated unto God in his own Blood, the <hi>Blood of the Covenant,</hi> Heb. 10.29. That <hi>seven</hi> is the <hi>number of Perfection,</hi> greatly used and variously applyed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures many have observed. And the perfect cleansing of sin by the <hi>Blood of Jesus,</hi> was evidently represented by this <hi>sevenfold sprinkling</hi>; Heb. 9. 13, 14. and therefore in Allusion hereunto, it is called the <hi>Blood of sprinkling, Heb.</hi> 12.24. Even that which was prefigured by all the <hi>Blood of the Sacrifices,</hi> that was sprinkled towards the Most Holy Place, and the <hi>Mercy seat</hi> therein.<label type="milestone">

But this opinion also may be easily disproved from the Context. This to me seems to be the Principal, if not the only difference between them; that the <hi>Asham</hi> provided a Sacrifice in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar instances, which seem not to be comprized under the general Rules of the <hi>Sin-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</hi> And hence in a peculiar manner it is said of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that he should give <gap reason="foreign">

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE general concernments of this <hi>Epistle</hi> have all of them been discussed and cleared in the preceding <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitations</hi> and Discourses. The things and matters confirmed in them, we therefore here suppose, and take for granted. And they are such some of them, as without a Demonstration whereof, a genuine and perspicuous Declaration of the <hi>Design</hi> of the <hi>Author,</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Epistle</hi> cannot be well founded or carried on. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them therefore we must remit the <hi>Reader</hi> who desires to peruse the ensuing Exposition with profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But yet because the <hi>manner of the handling</hi> of things in those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, may not be so suited unto the minds of all who would willingly enquire into the <hi>Exposition</hi> its self, I shall here make an entrance into it, by laying down some such General Principles and Circumstances of the Epistle, as may give a competent prospect into the design and Argument of the Apostle, in the whole thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first of these concerns the <hi>Persons</hi> whose instruction and edification in the Faith is here aymed at: These in general were the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the only Church of God before the promulgation of the Gospel; who in <hi>those dayes</hi> were distributed into three sorts, or parties.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some of them <hi>believing</hi> in Christ through the Gospel, were perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the <hi>Liberty</hi> given them from the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> with the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Liberty in its accomplishment in the Person, Office and Work of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> Acts <hi>2.41, 42.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some with their <hi>Profession of Faith</hi> in Christ as the <hi>Messiah</hi> promised, retained an opinion of the <hi>necessary observation</hi> of <hi>Mosaical Rites</hi>; and these also were of two sorts.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Such as from a <hi>pure Reverence</hi> of their <hi>Original Institutions,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being not fully instructed in their <hi>Liberty,</hi> or by reason of prejudices not readily admitting the <hi>consequences</hi> of that Truth wherein they were instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, abode in their observation, without <hi>seeking for Righteousness</hi> or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by them. <hi>Acts 21. v. 20.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Such as <hi>urged their observation</hi> as indispensably necessary to our <hi>Justification</hi> before God, <hi>Acts 15.1. Gal. 3.4.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> sort of those the Apostles bare with in all <hi>meekness</hi>; yea, and using the <hi>Liberty</hi> given them of the Lord, to avoid offending of them, joyned with them in their <hi>practice</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50110:170"/>
as occasion did require, <hi>Acts 16.3. Chap. 21.23, 24, 26. Chap. 27.9. 1 Cor. 9.20.</hi> whence for a long season, in many places, the <hi>Worship of the Gospel,</hi> and <hi>Synagogue Worship</hi> of the Law were observed together, <hi>James 2.2.</hi> though in process of time, many <hi>disputes</hi> and differences were occasioned thereby, between the <hi>Gentile</hi> and <hi>Jewish</hi> Worshippers, <hi>Rom. 14.</hi> The other <hi>sort</hi> they opposed, as <hi>perverters</hi> of the Gospel which they pretended to profess, <hi>Acts 15.5. Gal. 2.13, 14, 15, 16. Chap. 4.9, 10, 11. Chap. 5.2.</hi> And of these some afterwards <hi>apostatized</hi> to <hi>Judaism</hi>; others abiding in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt mixture of both professions separated themselves from the Church, and were called <hi>Nazarenes</hi> and <hi>Ebionites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Others, <hi>far the greatest number</hi> of the whole people, persisted in their <hi>Old Church-State,</hi> not receiving the salvation that was tendered unto them in the preaching of the Gospel; and these also were of <hi>two</hi> sorts: <hi>(1.)</hi> Such as who although they had not embraced the <hi>faith,</hi> yet were <hi>free</hi> and willing to attend unto the Doctrine of it, <hi>searching the Scriptures</hi> for a discovery of its <hi>Truth,</hi> and in the mean time <hi>instantly serving God,</hi> according to the Light of the Old Testament, which they had received: and in these was the essence of the <hi>Judaical Church</hi> preserved to its final dissolution, <hi>Acts 17.11. Chap. 28.22, 23, 24. (2.)</hi> Such as being <hi>hardned</hi> in their Infidelity, <hi>blasphemed,</hi> scoffed at, and persecuted the Gospel, with all that professed it, <hi>Acts 13.45, 50. Chap. 15.19. Chap. 17.5. 1. Thess. 2.15, 16. Rom. 11.7, 8, 9, 10.</hi> whom not long after the <hi>vengeance</hi> of God overtook in their total destruction.</p>
                  <p>Now our Apostle vehemently <hi>thirsting</hi> after the salvation of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in general, <hi>Rom. 9.1. Chap. 10.1.</hi> having all these <hi>several sorts,</hi> or parties to deal withal, he so frames his <hi>Epistle</hi> unto them, that it might be suited to all their <hi>Good,</hi> in their Conversion, Instruction, Edification, and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, as their <hi>several</hi> conditions did require: the <hi>latter</hi> sort only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, who being under <hi>judicial blindness</hi> were cast out of the care of God, and his, <hi>Acts 13.46, 51.</hi> Hence in part is that admirable <hi>contexture</hi> of this Epistle, which <hi>Peter</hi> ascribes unto his <hi>eminent wisdom, 2 Pet. 3.18.</hi> As it is indeed evident from the <hi>story,</hi> that he did excell, in <hi>applying</hi> himself to the various <hi>Principles,</hi> Capacities and prejudices of them with whom he had to do. The Lord Christ having set him forth as a great <hi>example</hi> of that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, zeal and prudence, which he requires in the <hi>dispensers</hi> of the Gospel. Divine reasonings, instructions, exhortations, promises, threats, arguments are so <hi>interwoven</hi> in this Epistle from the beginning to the end, that all to whose <hi>hands</hi> or <hi>hearing</hi> it should come, might every where meet with that which was of especial and immediate concernment to themselves, unto which of the <hi>sorts</hi> before mentioned soever they did belong. And this <hi>Principle</hi> we must have respect unto, in that <hi>intermixture</hi> of <hi>Arguments</hi> to prove the Truth of the Gospel, with <hi>Exhortations</hi> to constancy in the profession of it, which we shall meet withall. The several conditions of those to whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle wrote, required that way of proceedure; Hence no one Chapter in the Epistle is purely <hi>dogmatical,</hi> the first only excepted, nor purely <hi>Paraenetical.</hi> For though the design that lyes in view, and is never out of sight, be <hi>Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> yet far the greatest part of the Epistle of taken up in those <hi>doctrinalls,</hi> wherein the foundations of the exhortations do lye, both interwoven toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, somewhat variously from the method of the same Apostle in all his other Epistles, as hath been observed, that to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> which is of the like nature with this, only excepted.</p>
                  <p n="ii">II. A second thing to be previously observed is, that although those to whom the Apostle wrote, were of the several sorts before mentioned, yet they <hi>centered</hi> in this, that they were <hi>Hebrews</hi> by Birth and <hi>Religion,</hi> who all agreed in
<pb facs="tcp:50110:170"/>
some <hi>common Principles</hi> relating to the subject he treated with them about. <hi>These</hi> he makes use of unto them all; For though the <hi>unbelieving Jews</hi> did deny, or did not yet acknowledge that <hi>Jesus</hi> was the Christ, yet they also <hi>consented</hi> unto, or could not gainsay, what in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> was revealed concerning the Person, Office, Dignity, and Work of the <hi>Messiah</hi> when he should come; that being the faith whereby they were saved before his appearance, <hi>Acts 26, 6, 7.</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon these genoral <hi>Principles,</hi> wherein they also agreed, and which were the <hi>general perswasion</hi> of the whole <hi>Judaical Church,</hi> the Apostle layes the foundation of all his Arguments. And hence he oft times takes that for <hi>grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> which without this consideration, should we look on any of those to whom he writes under the <hi>general notion</hi> of unbelievers, would seem to be the thing principally in question. And therefore have we at large already manifested what was the <hi>avowed Profession</hi> of the sounder part of the <hi>Judaical Church</hi> in those dayes concerning the Messiah, which the Apostle here and elsewhere in dealing with the Jews built upon; <hi>Acts 26.22, 23, 27. Chap. 28.23. Chap. 13.16, 17, &amp;c.</hi> which the Reader must have constant respect unto.</p>
                  <p n="iii">
                     <hi>III.</hi> In urging <hi>Testimonies</hi> out of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> he doth not alwayes make use of those that seem to be most <hi>perspicuous</hi> and <hi>apposite</hi> to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but often times takes others more <hi>abstruse, obscure,</hi> and of less evident consequence at first view. And that upon a double account. First, That he might instruct the <hi>Believers</hi> amongst them in the more <hi>abstruse Prophecies</hi> of the Old Testament, and thereby incite them to the further search after Christ under the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Veil, and Prophetical <hi>Allegories,</hi> whereby he is therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, aiming to <hi>lead them on towards perfection,</hi> Chap. <hi>5.12.6.1.</hi> Secondly, Because most of the <hi>Testimonies</hi> he makes use of, were generally granted by the <hi>Jews</hi> of all sorts to belong to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> his Kingdom and Offices; and his design was to deal with them chiefly, upon their own <hi>concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and principles. As we have some few other <hi>helps</hi> remaining to acquaint us with what was the received sense of the <hi>Judaical Church,</hi> concerning sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry passages in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> relating unto the promised <hi>Christ,</hi> so the <hi>Paraphrases</hi> of Scripture that were either at that time in use amongst them, as was the <hi>Greek Translation</hi> amongst the <hi>Hellenists,</hi> or about that time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, as the <hi>Targums,</hi> at least, <hi>some parts</hi> of them, will give us much light into it. What of that <hi>antient sense</hi> appeareth yet in the corrupted Copies of those Translations which remain, being considered, will much evince the reason and suitableness of the Apostles Quotations. And this is needful to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to refute that impiety of some (as <hi>Cajetan</hi>) who not being able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, the <hi>force</hi> of some <hi>Testimonies</hi> cited by the Apostle as to his purpose in hand, have questioned the Authority of the whole Epistle; as also the mistake of <hi>Hierom,</hi> who in his Epistle to <hi>Pammachius,</hi> rashly affirmed that <hi>Paul</hi> did quote Scriptures that were not indeed to his purpose, but out of <hi>design to stop the mouths of his Adversaries,</hi> as he himself had dealt with <hi>Jovinian</hi>; which was very far from him whose only design was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to promote the Truth in Love.</p>
                  <p n="iv">
                     <hi>IV.</hi> He takes it for granted in the whole Epistle, that the <hi>Judaical Church-State</hi> did yet continue, and that the Worship of it was not yet <hi>disallowed</hi> of God; suitably to what was before declared concerning his own and the other Apostles practice. Had that <hi>Church-State</hi> been utterly <hi>abolished,</hi> all observation of <hi>Mosaical</hi> rites, which were the Worship of that Church as such, had been utterly unlawfull, as now it is. Neither did the determination recorded <hi>Acts 15.</hi> abolish them as some suppose, but only free the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from their observance. Their <hi>free use</hi> was yet permitted unto the Jews. <hi>Acts 21.20, 22, 25, 26. Chap.27.9.</hi> and practised by <hi>Paul</hi> in particular, in his <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical</hi> Vow, <hi>Acts 21.26.</hi> Which was attended with a Sacrifice, <hi>Numb. 6.13.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50110:171"/>
Nor was <hi>Mosaical</hi> Worship utterly to cease, so as to have no <hi>acceptance</hi> with God until the <hi>final ruine</hi> of that church, foretold by our Saviour himself, <hi>Mat. 24.</hi> by Peter, <hi>2 Ep. 3.</hi> by <hi>James</hi> also, <hi>Chap. 5.6, 7, 8, 9.</hi> and by our Apostle in this Epistle, <hi>Chap. 10.37. Chap. 12.25, 26, 27.</hi> was accomplished.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that our Apostle calls the times of the Gospel, the <hi>world to come, Chap. 2.5. Chap. 6.5.</hi> the name whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> denoted the <hi>State of the Church</hi> under the <hi>Messiah,</hi> proper unto it only whilest the legal administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Worship did continue. Thus as <hi>de facto</hi> he had shewed respect unto the Person of the <hi>High Priest</hi> as one yet in lawful Office, <hi>Acts 23.5.</hi> So <hi>doctrinally</hi> he takes it for granted, that, that <hi>Office</hi> was still continued, <hi>Chap. 8.4, 5.</hi> with the whole worship of <hi>Moses</hi> institution, <hi>Chap. 13.11, 12.</hi> And this dispensation of <hi>Gods patience</hi> being the last tryal of that Church, was continued in a <hi>proportion of time</hi> answerable to their <hi>abode</hi> in the Wilderness upon its first Erection; which our Apostle minds them of, <hi>Chap. 3. c. 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Law of Moses</hi> then was not actually abrogated by <hi>Christ,</hi> who observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>rules</hi> of it in the dayes of his flesh; nor by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who seldom used their liberty from it, leaving the use of it to the <hi>Jews</hi> still; but having done its <hi>work,</hi> whereunto it was designed, and its obligation <hi>Expiring,</hi> end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being removed, or taken away in the death and resurrection of <hi>Christ,</hi> and promulgation of the Gospel that ensued thereupon, which <hi>doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> declared its <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or uselesness; God in his Providence put an <hi>end</hi> unto it, as to its observation, in the utter and <hi>irrecoverable</hi> overthrow of the Temple, the place designed for the <hi>solemn exercise</hi> of its Worship; so did it <hi>decay, wax old,</hi> and <hi>vanish away,</hi> Chap. 8.13.</p>
                  <p>And this also God ordered in his <hi>infinite</hi> wisdom, that their <hi>Temple,</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Nation, and so consequently their whole Church-State should be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>wasted</hi> by the <hi>Pagan Romans,</hi> before the power of the <hi>Empire</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of men <hi>professing</hi> the name of Christ; who could neither well have suffered their <hi>Temple</hi> to stand as by them abused, nor yet have <hi>destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> it, without hardning them in their impenitency and unbelief.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> That which is proposed unto <hi>confirmation</hi> in the whole Epistle, and from whence all the Inferences and Exhortations insisted on do <hi>arise,</hi> and are <hi>drawn,</hi> is the <hi>Excellency of the Gospel,</hi> and the Worship of God therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and appointed, upon the account of its manifold relation to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of Christ the Mediator, the Son of God. Now because those to whom it is <hi>directed,</hi> did, as hath been declared, some of them adhere to <hi>Mosaical Ceremonies</hi> and Worship in <hi>conjunction</hi> with the Gospel, others with a <hi>preferency</hi> of them above it, and some to a <hi>relinquishment</hi> of it, especially when they once found its profession obnoxious to <hi>Persecution,</hi> the Apostle institutes and at large prosecutes a comparison between <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as to their usefulness and excellency, in reference unto <hi>mens acceptation</hi> with God, of the one and the other; as also of the <hi>Spirituality,</hi> Order, and Beauty of the <hi>Worship</hi> severally required in them. And herein though he derogates in no respect from the <hi>Law</hi> that which was <hi>justly due</hi> unto it, yet on the accounts before mentioned, he preferreth the <hi>Gospel</hi> before it; and not only so, but also manifests, that as <hi>Mosaical Institutions</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of any other use, but to prefigure the <hi>real</hi> Mediatory work of <hi>Christ,</hi> with the <hi>benefits</hi> thereof, so he being <hi>exhibited</hi> and his work accomplished, their observation was become <hi>needless,</hi> and themselves, if embraced to a neglect or relinquishment of the Gospel, pernicious.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>comparison</hi> (wherein also the proof of the positive <hi>worth</hi> and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Gospel is included) omitting for weighty reasons (intimated by <hi>James, Acts 21.21.</hi> by himself, <hi>Acts 9.25. Chap. 22.19, 20, 21.</hi>) all
<pb facs="tcp:50110:171"/>
Prefatory salutations he enters upon in the <hi>first verses</hi> of the Epistle; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby occasioned to make mention of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> from whose <hi>Person</hi> and Office, the difference he was to insist upon did wholly arise; he spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the residue of the Chapter in proving the <hi>divine excellency</hi> of his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and the Eminency of his Office, as the only <hi>King, Priest,</hi> and Prophet of his Church; on all which the dignity of the Gospel, in the Profession whereof he exhorts them to persevere, doth depend.</p>
                  <p>He then that would come to a right understanding of this Epistle must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bear in mind, <hi>1. To whom it was written,</hi> which were the <hi>Jews</hi> of the several sorts before mentioned: <hi>2. To what End</hi> it was written; even to prevail with them to embrace the Gospel, and to persist in the Profession of it, without any mixture of <hi>Mosaical</hi> Observations: <hi>3. On what Principles</hi> the Apostle deals with them in this Argument, which are no other for the most part then what were granted by the Jews of all sorts: <hi>4.</hi> What <hi>Testimonies out of the Old Testament</hi> he insists on to prove his purpose, namely, such as were commonly received in the <hi>Judaical Church</hi> to belong unto the <hi>Messiah</hi> and his Office: <hi>5. What he labours to instruct them in,</hi> as to the general use of all sorts amongst them, which is the nature and use of Mosaical Rites: <hi>6. The main Argument</hi> he insists on for the ends before mentioned, which is the Excellency of the Gospel, the Worship instituted therein, and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness manifested thereby, upon the account of its Author and subject, the Principal Efficient Cause of its Worship, and only Procurer of the Righteousness exhibited in it, even Jesus Christ, the Messiah, Mediator, the eternal Son of God. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nless these things are well borne in mind, and the case of the Jews parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly heeded, our Exposition will it may be seem oft times to go out of the way, though it constantly pursue the design and scope of the Apostle.</p>
                  <p n="vi">
                     <hi>VI.</hi> Though this Epistle, was written unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and immediately for their use, yet it is left on <hi>record</hi> in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Scripture by the Holy Ghost, for the same <hi>general End</hi> with the other parts of the Scripture, and the use of all believers <hi>therein</hi> to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Use</hi> in our Exposition is also to be regarded, and that principally in the <hi>paraenetical</hi> or hortatory part of it. That then which is <hi>dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and the foundation of all the Exhortations insisted on may be two wayes considered:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1. Properly,</hi> as to the special and peculiar tendency of the <hi>Principles</hi> and Doctrines handled, and so they specially intend the <hi>Jews,</hi> and must be <hi>opened</hi> with respect to them, their Principles, <hi>Traditions,</hi> Opinions, Objections; all which must therefore be considered, that the <hi>peculiar</hi> force and efficacy of the Apostles reasonings with respect unto them, may be made manifest. And from the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part of this Epistle so opened, the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations</hi> that arise do chiefly respect the <hi>Jews,</hi> and are peculiarly suited unto <hi>them,</hi> their State and condition.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Again, the <hi>Doctrines</hi> treated on by the Apostle may be considered <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely</hi> and abstractedly from the special Case of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which he had in his eye, meerly as to their own nature; and so they are many of them of the <hi>chief fundamental Principles</hi> of the Gospel. In this respect they are grounds for the <hi>application</hi> of the <hi>Exhortations</hi> in the Epistle unto all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors</hi> of the Gospel to the end of the world. And this must guide us in our <hi>Exposition.</hi> Having to deal with the <hi>Jews;</hi> the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> parts of the Epistle must be opened with special respect unto them, or we utterly lose the Apostles <hi>aim</hi> and design; and dealing with <hi>Christians,</hi> the <hi>Hortatory</hi> part shall be principally insisted on, as respecting all Professors; yet not so, but that in handling the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part, we shall weigh the <hi>Principles</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50110:172"/>
of it, as Articles of our Evangelical Faith in general, and consider also the <hi>peculiar</hi> respect that the Exhortations have unto the Jews.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas, as was said, many Principles of the Jews are partly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and taken for granted, partly urged and insisted on to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by the Apostle, we must in our passage make some stay in their disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and declaration; and shall insert them under their proper heads where they occurr, even as many of them as are not already handled in our <hi>Prolegomena.</hi>

                        <p>THe Apostle intending a comparison between the <hi>Mosaical Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> referreth it unto two Heads: First, Their <hi>Revelation and Institution</hi>; whence the Obligation to the Observance of the one and the other did arise: and Secondly, Their <hi>whole Nature, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>se and Efficacy.</hi> The First he enters upon in these words, and premising that wherein they did agree, distinctly layes down the severals wherein the difference between them doth consist; both which were necessary to compleat the comparison intended.</p>
                        <p>That wherein they agree, is the <hi>Principal Efficient Cause</hi> of their Revelation, or the <hi>Prime Author</hi> from whom they were. This is <hi>God</hi>; He was the Author of the Law and Gospel; He spake of <hi>old</hi> in the Prophets, he spake in the <hi>last dayes</hi> in the Son. Neither of them were from Men: not one from one Principle, and the other from an other; both have the same Divine Original. See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. Herein they both agree.</p>
                        <p>Their difference in this respect, namely of their <hi>Revelation,</hi> he refers to four Heads, all distinctly expressed, saving that some branches of the <hi>Antithesis</hi> on the part of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> are only <hi>included</hi> in the opposite expressions that relate unto the <hi>Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Their difference First, Respects the <hi>manner</hi> of their Revelation; and that in two particulars: 1. The Revelation of the Will of God under the Law was given out by <hi>divers parts</hi>; that under the Gospel <hi>at once,</hi> or in one dispensation of Grace and Truth: 2. That in <hi>diverse manners,</hi> this <hi>one way</hi> only, by the Spirit dwelling in the Lord Christ in his fulness, and by him communicated unto his Apostles.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The <hi>Times and Seasons of their Revelation,</hi> that of the Law was made of <hi>Old, formerly,</hi> in <hi>Times past:</hi> This of the Gospel in <hi>these last dayes.</hi>

                        <p>Fourthly, And principally, the <hi>Persons by whom these Revelations were made</hi>; That was by the <hi>Prophets</hi>; this by the Son. God spake then in the Prophets, now he hath spoken in the Son.</p>
                        <p>The whole stress of the Apostles Argument lying on this last instance, omitting the prosecution of all the other particulars, he enters upon the further description of this immediate Revealer of the Gospel in whom God spake, <hi>the Son</hi>; and layes down in general,</p>

About this there was no difference, as to the most of them with whom the Apostle treated: This he takes for granted. For the Professing <hi>Jews</hi> did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to <hi>Mosaical</hi> Institutions, because God was their Author, not so of the Gospel; but because they were given from God by <hi>Moses,</hi> in such a manner, as never to be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or abrogated. This the Apostle layes down as an acknowledged Principle with the most, that both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> received their Original from God himself; proving also as we shall see in the progress of our Discourse to the conviction of others, that such a Revelation as that of the Gospel, was foretold and expected, and that <hi>this</hi> was it in particular, which was preached unto them.</p>

                           </gap>; denoting primarily one <hi>certain Person,</hi> and the divine nature only as subsisting in that <hi>Person:</hi> This is the Person of the <hi>Father</hi>: as elsewhere the Person of the <hi>Son</hi> is so signified by that name, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.20. As also the Person of the <hi>Holy Spirit, Acts</hi> 5.3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 11. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. So that God <hi>even the Father,</hi> by the way of eminency, was the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Author of both Law and Gospel, of which afterwards. And this observation is made necessary from hence, even because he immediately assigns <hi>Divine Properties</hi> and Excellencies unto <hi>another Person,</hi> evidently distinguished from him whom he intends to denote by the name <hi>God</hi> in this place, which he could not do, did that name pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily express, as here used by him, the <hi>divine nature absolutely,</hi> but only as it is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the Person of the Father.</p>
                        <p>From this head of their Agreement, the Apostle proceeds to the instances of the difference that was between the Law and the Gospel, as to their Revelation from God; of which a little inverting the order of the words, we shall First consider that which concerns the Times of their giving out, sundry of the other instances being regulated thereby.</p>
                        <p>For the First, or the Revelation of the Will of God under the Old Testament it was, <hi>of old</hi>; God spake <gap reason="foreign">

Take it as relating to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the rise of the time expressed in it, is the <hi>giving of the Law by Moses</hi> in the Wilderness. And this is that which the Apostle hath respect unto. He had no contest with the <hi>Jews</hi> about the <hi>first Promise,</hi> and the service of God in the world built thereon; nor about their Priviledge, as they were the Sons of <hi>Abraham</hi>; but only about their then present <hi>Church Priviledge</hi> and claim by <hi>Moses</hi> Law.

the constitution of the <hi>Judaical Church</hi> and Worship, unto the close of publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie in the dayes of <hi>Malachi.</hi> From thence to the dayes of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> God granted no <hi>extraordinary</hi> Revelation of his Will, as to the standing use of the whole Church. So that this dispensation of Gods <hi>speaking in the Prophets,</hi> continued for the space of twenty one <hi>Jubilees,</hi> or near eleven hundred years. That it had been now ceased for a <hi>long time,</hi> the Apostle intimates in this word; and that agreeably to the confessed Principles of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whereby also he confirmed his own of the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> by the reviving of the gift of Prophecy, as was foretold, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29.</p>
                        <p>And we may by the way a little consider their thoughts in this matter; For as we have observed and <hi>proved</hi> before, the Apostle engageth with them upon their own acknowledged Principles.
<q>The <hi>Jewes</hi> then generally grant unto this day, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy for the publick use of the Church, was not bestowed under the second Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after the dayes of <hi>Malachie</hi>; nor is to be expected untill the coming of <hi>Elias.</hi> The delusions that have been put upon them by <hi>impostors,</hi> they now labour all they can to conceal; and are of late by experience made incredulous towards such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders as in former Ages they have been brought to much misery by.

And it is uncertain to what end was the solemn yearly entrance of the High Priest into the <hi>Most Holy Place</hi> observed to the very destruction of the second House, if neither Ark nor Mercy Seat were there. Neither is this impeached by what <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirms, <hi>Histor. lib.</hi> 5. that when <hi>Pompey</hi> entred the Temple, he found <hi>nullas Deum effigies, vacuam sedem, &amp; inania arcana</hi>; for as he wrote of the <hi>Jews</hi> with shameful negligence, so he only intimates that they had no such <hi>images</hi> as were used among other Nations, nor the <hi>head of an Ass,</hi> which himself not many <hi>Lyes</hi> before, had affirmed to be consecrated in their Sanctuary: For ought then appears to the contrary, the <hi>Ark</hi> might be in the <hi>second House,</hi> and be carried thence to <hi>Rome</hi> with the <hi>Book of the Law,</hi> which <hi>Josephus</hi> expresly mentions.

                        </p>
                        <p>It is not for nothing, that the Apostle minds the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that the season then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent was the <hi>last dayes,</hi> whereof so many things were foretold in the Old Testament; Many of their concernments lay in the knowledge of it; which because they give great light unto the whole cause, as stated then between him, and them, must be opened and considered. The summ is, that the end of their Church and State, being foretold to be a <hi>perpetual desolation,</hi> Dan. 9.27. the <hi>last dayes</hi> being now come upon them, they might understand what they were shortly to expect and look for. The <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> being a People, a Church, and Kingdom was to bring forth the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whose coming and work must of necessity put an end to their old station and condition. Now because herein is enwrapped the most infallible demonstration that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is long since come, the Apostle mentioning the <hi>last dayes</hi> to intimate that upon necessity he must be come in them; I shall further open his design in this matter, but with briefness having been large on this head in our <hi>Prolegomena</hi>; and for their sakes who by any difficulties may be deterred from the consideration of them.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50110:176"/>
the separation of <hi>Abraham</hi> from the rest of the world begin to make provision of a peculiar <hi>stock</hi> from whence it should spring. That this was the cause and end of his <hi>Call</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> is evident from hence, that immediately thereupon God assures him that <hi>in his seed all the Kindreds of the earth should be blessed, Gen.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.18. which is all one as if he had expresly said unto him, for this cause have I chosen and called thee, that in thee, I might lay a foundation of bringing forth the <hi>promised seed,</hi> by whom the curse is to be taken away, and the blessing of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life procured, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14. For this cause was his Posterity continued in a <hi>state of separation</hi> from the rest of the world, that he might <hi>seek an holy seed</hi> unto himself, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.9. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. For this cause did he raise them into a <hi>Civil, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> and <hi>Church-State,</hi> that he might in them <hi>type</hi> out, and prefigure the Offices and Benefits of the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> who was to gather to himself the Nations that were to be blessed in the <hi>seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. <hi>Hos.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.23. And all their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> did but shadow out that great <hi>expiation</hi> of sin, which he was to make in his own Person; as hath been already proved.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Things being thus disposed, God promised unto them that their <hi>Civil Political State,</hi> their condition as a <hi>peculiar Nation</hi> and People, should be continued until the coming of the <hi>Messiah, Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.27. And this was made good unto them notwithstanding the great oppositions of those <hi>mighty Empires,</hi> in the midst of whose devouring jaws they were placed, with some such short <hi>intercisions</hi> of the actual administration of Rule amongst them, as being foretold impeached not the Promise. They lost not their <hi>Civil State,</hi> untill he came, unto whom was <hi>the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the Nations.</hi> After that, though many of the individuals obtained mercy, yet their being <hi>a Nation or People,</hi> was of no peculiar use as to any special end of God. Therefore was it immediately destroyed, and irrecoverably exterminated. From that day, God in a wonderful manner blasted and cursed all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, either for the <hi>preservation</hi> of what they then had, or for its <hi>recovery</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration when lost. No means could ever retrive them into a <hi>People or Nation</hi> on the old account. What may be hereafter on a New, God knows. The <hi>End of the dayes</hi> was come; and it was to no purpose, for men to endeavour to keep up that, which God having accomplished the utmost of his design by and upon, would lay aside. And this season was fully evidenced to all the world, by the <hi>gathering of the people to the Shilo,</hi> or the coming in of the Nations to partake in the <hi>blessing of faithful Abraham,</hi> Mic. 4.1, 2.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Of their <hi>Church-State</hi> there were two Principal parts: The <hi>Temple</hi> its self; and the <hi>Worship</hi> performed in it: The first of these (as was the <hi>Tabernacle</hi>) was set up to typifie him in whom the fulness of the <hi>Godhead should dwell bodily</hi>; and the latter the same Person, as he was himself to be the great <hi>High Priest</hi> and Sacrifice. Both these also were to be continued until the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but by no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours afterwards. Hence was that Promise of the glory of the <hi>second House,</hi> built after the Captivity, and restored by <hi>Herod,</hi> because of <hi>his</hi> coming unto it who was signified by it, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.1. He was to come whilest <hi>that Temple</hi> was stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after which it was to be of no more use. And therefore <hi>Ezekiel</hi> describes a <hi>third spiritual Temple</hi> to succeed in the room thereof. The condition of their <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> was the same; Therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> fore-telling the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> four hundred and ninety years after the Captivity, adds that upon his death the <hi>daily Sacrifice must cease for ever,</hi> and a total desolation ensue, on all the things that were used for the end accomplished, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24, 25, 26, 27. The <hi>Nation, State, Temple, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> being set apart, set up, and designed for no other end but to bring him forth, he was to come whilest they were standing and in use, after which they were none of them to be allowed a being upon their old foundation. This is that which the <hi>Apostle</hi> pointed at in mentioning <hi>the last dayes,</hi> that they might consider in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Church and People of the Jews then were.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>To discover the evidence of this demonstration, as confirmed in our <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> I shall here also briefly add some considerations of the <hi>miserable entanglements of the Jews</hi> in seeking to avoid the Argument here intimated unto them by the Apostle. It is a <hi>common Tradition</hi> among them, <hi>that all things were made for the Messiah</hi>; whereby they do not intend as some have imagined, the <hi>whole old Creation,</hi> but all things of their Church State and Worship. So the <hi>Targum, Psal.</hi> 40.8. in the person of the <hi>Messiah; I shall enter into life eternal when I study in the volume of the Law,</hi> 
                              <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>that was written for my sake.</hi> By the <hi>Law</hi> they understand
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50110:177"/>
their <hi>all.</hi> All depended on their <hi>Messiah,</hi> all was written for him. They see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that there was a coincidence of all these things in the <hi>last dayes</hi> when <hi>Jesus</hi> came. No sooner had he done his work, but <hi>Scepter</hi> and <hi>Scribe</hi> departed from <hi>Judah.</hi> They ceased to be a <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi> The <hi>Temple</hi> which the <hi>Lord whom they</hi> formerly <hi>sought</hi> came to, was destroyed; their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> wherein they trusted, caused to cease, and the Nations of the Earth were gathered into the <hi>faith of Abraham.</hi> From that time they have no more been a people; nor have had any distinction of <hi>Tribes,</hi> or <hi>Families, Temple, Priesthood,</hi> or <hi>Sacrifice</hi>; nor any hope of a retrivement into their pristine condition. Let us then see what course they do, or have taken to countenance themselves in their infidelity. Two wayes to relieve themselves they have fixed on.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <q>Granting that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to come to their <hi>Government and Worship,</hi> they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to keep them up, and to restore them being cast down, that so they might prolong their expectation of that <hi>to come,</hi> which indeed was already <hi>past.</hi> This in the righteous and holy Providence of God proved the means of their ruine. For their endeavour to maintain their <hi>Liberty, Rule,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> after the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> was the cause of the utter overthrow of all Rule, Authority and publick Worship amongst them by <hi>Vespasian and Titus</hi> his Son. Their endeavour, to <hi>restore</hi> themselves into a <hi>State</hi> and <hi>People</hi> under their <hi>false Messiah Barcosbi,</hi> was the means of their utter desolation from all hopes of being a people and Nation any more by <hi>Adrian</hi>; as also of their extermination for ever out of that Countrey, wherein they were <hi>separated</hi> from all Nations for that End which God appointed unto them. After this, once more, still to avoid the thoughts that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was come, and had put an end unto their former condition, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured and were encouraged by <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> to rebuild their <hi>Temple,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store their <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> And this attempt also God turned to their further confusion. For whereas in former dayes in the <hi>building of the Temple</hi> he encouraged and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them against all difficulties and oppositions; being now upheld and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by the favour and wealth of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> in the same work, he sets himself against them, and scatters them with no less indignation, than he did the builders of <hi>Babel of old.</hi> When he would have a <hi>Temple</hi> amongst them, he punished them with famine for <hi>building their own houses, and suffering his to lye waste, Hag.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11. Now they may build <hi>houses for themselves</hi> where they please; but if they take in hand to build a <hi>Temple,</hi> God is against them. This State of theirs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now continued <hi>sixteen hundred years,</hi> were not <hi>blindness come upon them to the utmost,</hi> they could not but see, that it is not the Will of God, that they should be a <hi>People, State,</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> on the former account any more. What then is become of their <hi>Messiah,</hi> who was to come unto them whilest they were so; seeing they were so by their own confession only for his sake? This puts their latter Masters to their last miserable shifts.</q>
For,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <q>Contrary to the open nature of all things relating unto them from the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating of the Promise to the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> contrary to the whole design of the Scripture, and the express testimonies of it before mentioned, with many other to the same purpose, they deny that their <hi>Messiah</hi> was to <hi>come</hi> to them, or at least to <hi>abide</hi> with them for the work whereunto he was destinated, whilest their <hi>State, Temple</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> continued. In the management of this shift of unbelief, they are wofully divided amongst themselves.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <q>For the Continuance of their <hi>State,</hi> untill the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> Gen. 49.11.

                        <p n="1">1. To <hi>David,</hi> which was peculiarly designed to perfect the Revelation of the will of God concerning the <hi>Old Testament-Worship</hi> in those things that their Wilderness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was not capable of, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. To him we may joyn <hi>Solomon,</hi> with the rest of the Prophets of their dayes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To the <hi>Prophets</hi> after the division of the Kingdom unto the Captivity, and dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Captivity; to whom pleading with the people about their <hi>defection</hi> by Sin and false Worship, was peculiar.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To <hi>Ezra,</hi> with the Prophets that assisted in the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church after its return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> who in an especial manner, excited the people to an expectation of the coming of the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These were the principal <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of the Revelation of the will of God from the foundation of the world until the coming of Christ in his fore-runner <hi>John</hi> the Baptist. And all this I have fully handled and unfolded in my Discourse of the rise, <hi>nature and progress of Scripture Divinity or Theology.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But as I shewed before, if we attend unto the special <hi>intention</hi> of the Apostle, we must <hi>take in</hi> the date of these Revelations, and begin with that to <hi>Moses,</hi> adding to it those other <hi>subservient</hi> ones mentioned peculiar to the <hi>Judaical Church,</hi> which taught and confirmed the Worship that was established amongst them.</p>
                        <p>This then is that, which in this <hi>word</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> minds the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of; namely, that the will of God concerning his Worship and our obedience was not formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed <hi>all at once</hi> to his Church, by <hi>Moses</hi> or any other; but by several <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>degrees,</hi> by new additions of Light, as in his infinite Wisdom and Care he saw meet. The close and last hand was not to be put unto this work before the coming of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> He, they all acknowledged, was to reveal the <hi>whole Counsel of God, John</hi> 4.25. after that his way had been prepared by the coming of <hi>Elias, Mal.</hi> 4 until when they were to <hi>attend to the Law of Moses,</hi> with those Expositions of it which they had received, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. That was the time appointed, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>to seal,</hi> compleat, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, <hi>Vision and Prophet</hi>; as also <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>to seal up sin,</hi> or as we render it, <hi>to make an end of sin,</hi> or the Controversie about it, which had held long agitation by <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> that could never put an end to that quarrel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2, 14.</p>
                        <p>Now in <hi>this very first word</hi> of his Epistle, doth the Apostle clearly convince the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of their mistake in their obstinate adherence unto <hi>Mosaical Institutions.</hi> It is as if he had bidden them consider <hi>the way</hi> whereby God revealed his will to the Church hitherto. Hath it not been by <hi>parts and degrees</hi>? Hath he at any time <hi>shut up the Progress</hi> of Revelation? Hath he not alwayes kept the Church in <hi>expectation</hi> of new Revelations of his mind and will? did he ever declare that he would <hi>add no more</hi> unto what he had commanded, or make no <hi>alteration</hi> in what he had instituted? What he had revealed was to be observed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.29. and when he had revealed it: but untill he declare that he will <hi>add no more,</hi> it is folly to account what is already done, absolutely compleat and immutable. Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> when he had finished all his work in the Lords house, tells the Church, that God would raise up <hi>another Prophet like him</hi>; that is, who should reveal <hi>new Laws and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50110:178"/>
Institutions</hi> as he had done, whom they were to <hi>hear and obey</hi> on the penalty of utter extermination, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>And this discovers the obstinacy of the <hi>Modern Jews,</hi> who from the dayes of <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> who dyed about the year of our Lord 1104. have made it one of the <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Articles</hi> of their Religion, which they have inserted in their <hi>Prayer Books,</hi> that the <hi>Law of</hi> Moses <hi>is never to be changed,</hi> and that God will never give them any other Law, or Rule of Worship: and as they further ground that Article in <hi>Ezrim Vearba,</hi> printed in the end of <hi>Bombergs Bibles,</hi> they affirm, that <hi>nothing can be added unto it, nothing taken away from it, no alteration in its obligation be admitted</hi>; which is directly contrary both to the Truth, and to the Confession of all their Predecessors, who looked for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as we shall afterwards declare.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In Opposition to this <hi>Gradual Revelation</hi> of the mind of God under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Apostle intimates that now by <hi>Jesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Lord hath at <hi>once</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and finished the whole Revelation of his Will according to their own hopes and expectation. So <hi>Jude</hi> 3. The Faith <hi>was once delivered unto the Saints:</hi> not in one <hi>day,</hi> not in one <hi>Sermon</hi>; or by one <hi>Person,</hi> but at one <hi>season,</hi> or under one dispensation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing all the time from the entrance of the Lord Christ upon his Ministry, and the closing of the <hi>Canon</hi> of Scripture, which period was now at hand. This Season being once past and finished, <hi>no new Revelation</hi> is to be expected to the end of the world. Nothing shall be added unto, nor altered in the Worship of God any more. God will not do it, men that attempt it, do it on the <hi>price</hi> of their souls.</p>

And therefore having mentioned it, he proceeds immediately unto that description of <hi>him,</hi> which gives evidence to all that he draws from this consideration. Now because no one Argument of the <hi>Apostle</hi> can be understood, unless this be rightly stated, we must on necessity insist somewhat <hi>largely</hi> upon it; and unto what we principally intend, some previous observations must be premised.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I take it at present for granted, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> appeared unto the <hi>Prophets</hi> under the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> Whether ever he spake unto them immediately, or only by the <hi>Ministry of Angels,</hi> is not so certain. It is also granted, that there was in <hi>Vision</hi> sometimes signs or representations of the Person of the <hi>Father,</hi> as <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. But that the <hi>Son of God</hi> did mostly appear to the <hi>Fathers</hi> under the Old Testament, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Antients, and is evident in Scripture: See <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10, 11. And he it was who is called <hi>the Angel, Exod.</hi> 23.20, 21. The reason that is pleaded by some, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> was not the <hi>Angel</hi> there mentioned, namely, because the Apostle sayes that <hi>to none of the Angels was it said at any time, thou art my Son, this day I have begotten thee,</hi> which could not be affirmed, if the <hi>Son of God</hi> were that Angel, is not of any force. For notwithstanding this assertion, yet both the Antient <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> generally grant, that it is the <hi>Messiah</hi> that is called the <hi>Angel of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Mal.</hi> 3.1. though the <hi>Modern Jews</hi> foolishly apply that name to <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they fancy to be present at Circumcision, which they take to be the Covenant; a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge as they say, granted him upon his complaint, that the <hi>Children of</hi> Israel <hi>had forsaken the Covenant,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 29.14. that is, as they suppose, <hi>neglected Circumcision.</hi> The Apostle therefore speaks of those who were <hi>Angels by nature,</hi> and no more, and not of him who being <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Son, was sent of the Father, and is therefore called <hi>his Angel</hi> or Messenger, being so only by <hi>Office.</hi> And this appearance of the Son of God, though not well understanding what they say, is acknowledged by sundry of the <hi>Postalmudical Rabbins.</hi> To this purpose very considerable are the words of <hi>Moses Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundensis,</hi> on Exod. 23. <hi>Iste Angelus si rem ipsam dicamus, est Angelus Redemptor, de quo scriptum est, quoniam nomen meum in ipso est. Ille inquam Angelus qui ad Jacob dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, Ego Deus Bethel. Ille de quo dictum est, &amp; vocabat Mosen Deus de rubo. Vocatur autem Angelus quia mundum gubernat.

The Angel if we speak exactly, is the Angel the Redeemer, of whom it is written, my name is in him; that Angel which said unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>I am the God of</hi> Bethel: <hi>He of whom it is said, God called unto</hi> Moses <hi>out of the Bush. And he is called the Angel, because he governeth the world. For it is written,</hi> Jehovah <hi>brought us out of</hi> Egypt; <hi>and elsewhere he sent his Angel, and brought us out of</hi> Egypt. <hi>And again, it is written, and the Angel of his presence [face] saved them; namely, the Angel which is the Presence [face] of God; of whom it is said, my presence [face] shall go before thee, and I will cause thee to rest: Lastly, that Angel of whom the Prophet speaks, the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple, the Angel of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant whom you desire.</hi> To the same purpose speaks the same Author on <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.14. <hi>My presence shall go before thee; Animadverte attentè quid ista sibi velint.

Atqui facies Dei ipsum significat Deum</hi>— And again, <hi>Facies mea praecedet, hoc est, Angelus foederis quem vós cupitis.

The <hi>Son of God</hi> having from the foundation of the world undertaken the Care and Salvation of the <hi>Church,</hi> he it was who immediately dealt with it in things which concerned its instruction and edification. Neither doth this hinder but that <hi>God the Father</hi> may yet be asserted, or that he <hi>is</hi> in this place, to be the fountain of all <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. There is a difference between the Son of God revealing the will of God in his <hi>Divine Person</hi> to the Prophets of which we have spoken, and the Son of God as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,</hi> revealing the will of God immediately to the Church. This is the difference here insisted on by the Apostle. Under the Old Testament the <hi>Son of God</hi> in his <hi>Divine Person,</hi> instructed the <hi>Prophets</hi> in the will of God, and gave them that Spirit on whose <hi>Divine Inspiration</hi> their infallibility did depend, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. but now in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Gospel</hi> taking his own humanity; or our Nature <hi>hypostatically</hi> united unto him, in the room of all the <hi>internuncii</hi> or <hi>prophetical</hi> Messengers he had made use of, he taught it <hi>immediately</hi> himself.</p>
                        <p>There lyes a seeming exception unto this distinction in the <hi>giving of the Law</hi>; for as we affirm, that it was the <hi>Son</hi> by whom the Law was given, so in his so doing he spake <hi>immediately</hi> to the whole Church, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.22. The Lord said, <hi>I have talked with you from Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> say, that the people understood not one word of what was spoken, but only <hi>heard a voice, and saw the terrible appearances of the Majesty of God</hi>; as <hi>v.</hi> 18. for immediately upon that <hi>sight,</hi> they removed and stood afar off; And the matter is left <hi>doubtful</hi> in the repetition of the story, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.4. It is said indeed <hi>the Lord talked with you face to face in the Mount</hi>; but yet neither do these words <hi>fully</hi> prove that they understood <hi>what</hi> was spoken, and as it was spoken, but only that they clearly discovered the presence of God delivering the Law: for so are those words expounded in <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>I stood</hi> saith <hi>Moses, between the Lord and you at that time, to shew you the word of the Lord, for you were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up unto the Mount</hi>; that is, you <hi>understood</hi> not the words of the Law, but as I declared them unto you; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, though the <hi>Person</hi> of the Son caused the words to be heard, yet he spake not immediately to the whole Church, but by <hi>Moses.</hi> But Secondly, We shall afterwards shew, that all the voices then heard by <hi>Moses</hi> or the <hi>people,</hi> were formed in the air by the <hi>Ministry of Angels,</hi> so that they heard not the immediate voyce of God. Now in the <hi>last dayes</hi> did the Lord take that work into his own hands, wherein from the foundation of the world he had employed <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Though the Apostles argument arise not immediately from the differing wayes of Gods revealing himself <hi>to the Prophets,</hi> and <hi>to Christ,</hi> but in the difference that lyes in his immediate speaking <hi>unto us in Christ</hi> the Son, and his speaking unto the <hi>Fathers in the Prophets,</hi> yet that former difference also is intimated by him, in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that he spake to them <hi>variously or diversly,</hi> as hath been declared, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must consider that also; And herein we are to obviate the great <hi>Judaical</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice against the Gospel; to which end observe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That though the Apostle mentions the <hi>Prophets</hi> in general, yet it is <hi>Moses</hi> whom he principally intends. This is evident in the <hi>Application</hi> of this Argument which he makes in particular, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.3. where he expresly prefers the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> before <hi>Moses</hi> by name, in this matter of Ministring to the Church in the name of God. For whereas, as was before intimated, the Apostle mannages this thing with <hi>excellent Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> considering the inveterate prejudices of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering unto <hi>Moses,</hi> he could not mention him in particular, until he had proved him whom he preferred above him, to be <hi>so excellent</hi> and glorious, so far exalted above <hi>Men and Angels,</hi> that it was no disreputation to <hi>Moses</hi> to be esteemed inferiour to him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the great Reason why the <hi>Jews</hi> adhered so pertinaciously unto <hi>Mosaical
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50110:180"/>
Institutions</hi> was their perswasion of the <hi>unparallel'd excellency</hi> of the Revelation made to <hi>Moses.</hi> This they retreated unto, and boasted of when they were pressed with the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and Miracles of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 9.28, 29. And this was the main foundation in all their contests with the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.21, 28. And this at length they have made a principal root or <hi>fundamental Article</hi> of their Faith, being the fourth of the <hi>thirteen Articles</hi> of their Creed; namely, that <hi>Moses</hi> was the most excellent and most sublime among the Prophets, so far above that excellency, that degree of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and honour which men may attain unto, that he was <hi>equal to Angels.</hi> This <hi>Maimonides</hi> the first disposer of their Faith into <hi>fundamental Articles</hi> expounds, at large, More Nebuch. p. 2. cap. 39. <hi>Declaravimus,</hi> saith he, <hi>quod Prophetia Mosis doctoris no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri ab omnium uliorum Prophetiis differat; dicemus nunc quod propter solam illam ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensionem ad legem vocati sumus; quia nempe vocationi illi qua Moses nos vocavit simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is neque antecessit ab Adamo primo ad ipsum us<expan>

                        <p>The first is granted; and a signal Priviledge it was; God spake unto him

But that <hi>Moses</hi> saw the <hi>essence of God,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> contend from those words, is expresly <hi>denyed</hi> in the Text it self. For even then when it was said, that God spake to him <hi>face to face,</hi> it is also affirmed that he did not, nor could see the <hi>face of God, Exod.</hi> 33.20. See <hi>John</hi> 1.17, 18. Both those expressions intend only that God revealed himself unto him in a <hi>more clear and familiar way</hi> than he had done unto other Prophets, or would do, whilest that administration continued. For although the <hi>things</hi> which he revealed to, and by other Prophets, were more clear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> evident and open to the understanding of believers, than they were in the Revelation made to <hi>Moses,</hi> (they being intended as Expositions of it,) yet in the <hi>way</hi> of the Revelation its self, God dealt more clearly and <hi>familiarly</hi> with <hi>Moses,</hi> than with any other Prophet of that Church what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Second difference</hi> assigned is <hi>vain.</hi> Of the <hi>times and seasons</hi> wherein the Prophets received their Visions there can be no determinate rule assigned. Many of them were at ordinary seasons, whilest they were waking, and some about the employment of their Callings, as <hi>Amos, Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Third</hi> also about the <hi>consternation</hi> of Spirit which befell other Prophets is groundless. Sometimes it was so with them, as the instance of <hi>Daniel</hi> proves, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.28. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 8. and so it befell <hi>Moses</hi> himself, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.21. which if we attain to that place we shall prove the Jews themselves to acknowledge. Ordinarily it was otherwise, as with <hi>him,</hi> so with <hi>them,</hi> as is manifest in the whole story of the Prophets.</p>
                        <p>There is the same mistake in the <hi>last</hi> difference assigned. <hi>Moses</hi> did not so receive the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> as that he could at his own pleasure reveal those things which were not discoverable but by that Spirit; or speak out the mind of God <hi>infallibly</hi> in any thing for the use of the Church without actual inspiration as to that particular, which is evident from the <hi>mistake</hi> that he was under as to the <hi>manner</hi> of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he rectified by the advise of <hi>Jethro, Exod.</hi> 18.19. And likewise in other Instances did he <hi>wait</hi> for particular Answers from God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.34. To have a comprehension at once of the <hi>whole Will</hi> of God concerning the obedience and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Church, was a Priviledge reserved for <hi>him who in all things was to have the preheminence.</hi> And it seems that <hi>Maimonides</hi> himself in his exaltation of <hi>Moses</hi> excepted the <hi>Messiah.</hi> For whereas in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Copies of <hi>More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buch. part.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 45. there are these words, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Not to follow them in their imaginations, the <hi>just</hi> priviledges of <hi>Moses</hi> above all other Prophets lay in these three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That he was the Law-giver,</hi> or <hi>Mediator</hi> by whom God gave that Law, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed that Worship, in the observation whereof, the very <hi>being</hi> of the Judaical Church did consist.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That God in the Revelation made unto him, <hi>dealt in a more familiar and clear manner,</hi> as to the way of his outward dealing, than with any other Prophets.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In that the Revelation made unto him, <hi>concerned the ordering of the whole house of God,</hi> when the other Prophets were employed only about <hi>particulars</hi> built on his foundation.</p>
                        <p>In these things consisted the <hi>just and free preheminence</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> which whether it were such as would warrant the <hi>Jews</hi> in their <hi>obstinate</hi> adherence to his Institutions upon their own Principles shall be enquired into. But before we manifest that indeed it was not, the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the mind of God in and by the Son, which is compared with, and <hi>preferred</hi> before and above this of <hi>Moses,</hi> must be unfolded; and this we shall do in the ensuing Observations.</p>

The <hi>Papists</hi> have made a vain Controversie about the knowledge of the <hi>humane soul</hi> of Christ. Those whom they charge with <hi>error</hi> in this matter affirm no more than what is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly</hi> asserted in the places of Scripture above mentioned; and by their <hi>answers</hi> unto those places, it is evident how little they care what scorn they expose the <hi>Scripture</hi> and all Religion unto, so they may secure their own mistakes. But this <hi>Wisdom</hi> whatever it were, is not that whereby God so revealed his mind unto him, as <hi>thereby</hi> to be said to <hi>speak to us in him.</hi> He had it by his <hi>

                        <p n="4">4. That Jesus Christ in his <hi>divine Nature,</hi> as he was the Eternal Word and Wisdom of the Fathers, not by a <hi>voluntary</hi> communication, but <hi>eternal</hi> generation had an <hi>omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of the <hi>whole nature</hi> and will of God, as the Father himself hath, because the same with that of the Father; their will and wisdom being the same.

See what we have elsewhere delivered concerning that Covenant.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Lord Christ discharged his <hi>Office</hi> and work of <hi>Revealing the Will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in and by his <hi>humane nature</hi>; that nature wherein he <hi>dwelt among us, Joh.</hi> 1.14.

                        <p n="6">6. This <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of Christ, as he was in <hi>it made of a woman made under the Law, Gal.</hi> 4.4. was from the instant of its <hi>

                        <p>This was the foundation of the Fathers <hi>speaking in the Son</hi> as incarnate.

                        <p n="8">8. The <hi>Preheminencies</hi> of the Prophecy of <hi>Christ,</hi> above that of <hi>Moses,</hi> and all other Prophets were of two sorts: 1.

                        <p n="1">1. They arise from the <hi>infinite Excellency of his Person</hi> above theirs. This is that which the Apostle from the close of this verse insists upon to the very end of the Chapter, making his discourse upon it the <hi>basis</hi> of ensuing his exhortations. I shall therefore remit the consideration of it, unto its proper place.</p>

All the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the counsel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Eternal Word for the salvation of the Elect, with all the <hi>ways</hi> whereby it was to be accomplished through his own blood, were <hi>known</hi> unto him; as also were all the bounds, the whole extent of that <hi>Worship</hi> which his Church was to render unto God, with the assistance of the Spirit that was to be afforded unto them for that end and purpose. Hence the <hi>only reason</hi> why he did not at <hi>once</hi> reveal unto his <hi>Disciples</hi> the whole counsel of God, was not because <hi>all the treasures of it</hi> were not committed unto him, but because they could <hi>bear no other</hi> but that <hi>gradual communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of it, which he used towards them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.12. But he himself <hi>dwelt</hi> in the midst of those treasures, seeing to the bottom of them. All other Prophets, even <hi>Moses</hi> himself, receiving their revelation by <hi>transient irradiations</hi> of their minds, had no <hi>treasure of truth</hi> dwelling in them, but apprehended only <hi>that particular</hi> wherein they were enlightned; and that not <hi>clearly</hi> neither in its fulness and perfection, but in a <hi>measure of light,</hi> accommodated unto the Age wherein they lived, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11, 12. Hence the Spirit is said to <hi>rest on him, Isa.</hi> 11.2, 3. and to <hi>abide</hi> on him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. who did only in a <hi>transient act</hi> affect the minds of other Prophets; and by an <hi>actual motion,</hi> which had not an <hi>habitual</hi> spring in themselves, cause them to <hi>speak</hi> or <hi>write</hi> the will of God, as an instrument of <hi>Musick</hi> gives forth a sound according to the <hi>skill</hi> of him that strikes it, and that only when it is so stricken or used. Hence,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Prophets receiving their Revelations, as it were, by <hi>number</hi> and <hi>tale</hi> from the holy Ghost, when they had spoken or written what in particular at any season they had received from him, could not <hi>adde one word</hi> or syllable of the same infallibility and authority with what they had so received. But the Lord Christ having <hi>all the treasures</hi> of Wisdom, Knowledge, and Truth <hi>hid</hi> and laid up in him, did at all times, in all places, with <hi>equal infallibility and authority</hi> give forth the mind and will of God, even as he would; what he so spake having its <hi>whole Authority</hi> from <hi>his speaking</hi> of it, and not from its <hi>consonancy</hi> unto any thing otherwise revealed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Prophets</hi> of old were so <hi>barely instrumental</hi> in <hi>receiving</hi> and <hi>revealing</hi> the will of God, being only <hi>servants in the house, Heb.</hi> 3.4. for the <hi>good of others,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. that they saw not to the <hi>bottom</hi> of the things by themselves revealed; and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both diligently <hi>read</hi> and <hi>study</hi> the books of them that wrote before their time, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. and <hi>meditated</hi> upon the things which the Spirit <hi>uttered by themselves,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an understanding in them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. But the Lord Jesus, the <hi>Lord over his own house,</hi> had an absolutely <hi>perfect comprehension</hi> of all the mysteries revealed to him and by him, by that <hi>divine Wisdom</hi> which always dwelt in him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The <hi>Difference</hi> was no less between them in respect of the <hi>Revelations themselves</hi> made to them, and by them. For although the <hi>substance</hi> of the will and mind of God concerning salvation by the <hi>Messiah</hi> was made known unto them all, yet it was done so <hi>obscurely</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> that ensued, that they came all short in the <hi>light</hi> of that Mystery to <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> who did not rise up in a clear and distinct appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of it, unto the <hi>least of the true Disciples</hi> of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.11. whence the <hi>giving of the Law</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> to instruct the Church in that Mystery, by its <hi>types and shadows,</hi> is opposed to that <hi>Grace and Truth</hi> which were brought by Jesus Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17, 18. See <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26, 27. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                        <p>In these, and sundry other things of the like importance, had the <hi>Fathers speaking in the Son,</hi> the <hi>preheminence</hi> above his speaking in <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi>; for which cause the Apostle placeth this consideration in the <hi>head</hi> of his Reasonings and Arguments, for attendance unto, and observation of the things revealed by him. For even all these things have <hi>influence</hi> into his present Argument, though the main stress of it be laid on the <hi>excellency of his Person,</hi> of which at large afterwards.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. We must yet further observe, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> with whom the Apostle had to do,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50110:182"/>
had all of them an expectation of a new <hi>signal and final Revelation</hi> of the will of God, to be made by the <hi>Messias</hi> in the last days, that is of <hi>their Church state,</hi> and not as they now fondly imagine, of the world. Some of them indeed imagined that <hi>great Prophet</hi> promised <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. to have been one distinct from the <hi>Messias, Joh.</hi> 1.21. but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expectation of the Church for the <hi>full Revelation</hi> of the will of God, was upon the <hi>Messias, Joh.</hi> 4.25. Of the same mind were their more <hi>antient Doctors,</hi> that retained any thing of the tradition of their Fathers; asserting, that the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable by the <hi>Messias,</hi> and that in some things it should be so. <hi>Maimonides</hi> is the leader in the opinion of the <hi>eternity</hi> of the Law: whose Arguments are answered by the Author of <hi>Sepher Ikkarim, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. and some of them by <hi>Nachmanides.</hi> Hence it is laid down as a Principle in <hi>Neve shalom,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Messias the King shall be exalted above Abraham, be high above Moses, yea, and the ministring Angels.</hi> And it is for the <hi>excellency</hi> of the <hi>Revelation</hi> made by him, that he is so exalted above <hi>Moses.</hi> Whence <hi>Maimonides</hi> himself acknowledgeth, <hi>Tractat. de Regibus,</hi> that at the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>hidden and deep things</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> of the counsel of God) <hi>shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed or laid open unto all.</hi> And this perswasion they built on the Promise of a <hi>new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> to be made with them, not <hi>like the Covenant made with their fathers, Jerem.</hi> 31.32, 33. Whence the <hi>Author</hi> before mentioned concludes, that it was the judgment of the <hi>antient Doctors,</hi> that they should receive a <hi>new Covenant</hi> from the mouth of God himself; and all their <hi>Worship</hi> being annexed and subservient unto the Covenant that was made with them in <hi>Horeb,</hi> upon the removal of that Covenant, there was of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity a <hi>new kind of Worship,</hi> subservient thereunto, to ensue.</p>
                        <p>From all these <hi>observations</hi> we may evidently perceive wherein the <hi>force</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <hi>Argument</hi> doth lie, which he insists upon in this very entrance of his Discourse: rather insinuating it from <hi>their own Principles,</hi> than openly pressing them with its reason, which he doth afterwards. They acknowledged that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to come, that he was to be in a special manner the <hi>Son of God,</hi> (as we shall shew;) that in him God would <hi>ultimately reveal</hi> his mind and will unto them, and that <hi>this Revelation</hi> on many accounts would be far <hi>more excellent,</hi> than that of old made to and by <hi>Moses</hi>; which that it was all accomplished in the <hi>ministery of Jesus Christ,</hi> and that unto <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> in the <hi>latter days of their Church,</hi> according to what was long before fore-told, he asserts and proves; whence it was easie for them to gather, what a <hi>necessity</hi> of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereing to his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Institutions,</hi> notwithstanding any contrary pleas or arguings, was incumbent on them.</p>
                        <p>But moreover the Apostle in these words hath opened the <hi>spring,</hi> from whence all his ensuing Arguments do flow; in fixing on <hi>him</hi> who brought life and immortality to light by the Gospel. And from thence takes occasion to enter upon the <hi>Dogmatical</hi> part of the Epistle, in the description of the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, the Son of God, and his <hi>Excellency,</hi> in whom God spake unto them, that they might consider with whom they had to do; wherein he proceeds to the end of this Chapter.</p>
                        <p>But before we proceed, we shall stay here a little to consider <hi>some things</hi> that may be a <hi>refreshment</hi> to Believers in their passage, in the consideration of those <hi>spiritual Truths,</hi> which for the use of the Church in general are exhibited unto us, in the words we have considered.</p>
                        <p>And the first is this.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>I.</hi> The Revelation of the of Will God, as to all things concerning his Worship, our Faith and Obedience, is peculiarly and in a way of eminency from the Father.</q>
                        <p>This is that which the Apostle partly <hi>asserts,</hi> partly takes for <hi>granted,</hi> as the head and spring of his whole ensuing discourse. And this shall now be a little further <hi>cleared</hi> and confirmed: to which end we may observe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the whole <hi>Mystery</hi> of his Will antecedently to the Revelation of it, is said to be <hi>hid in God,</hi> that is, the Father, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.9. it lay wrapt up from the <hi>eyes of men and Angels,</hi> in his Eternal Wisdom and Counsel, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26, 27. The <hi>Son</hi> indeed, who is, and from eternity was in the <hi>bosome of the Father, Joh.</hi> 1.18. as one <hi>brought up with him,</hi> his eternal delight and wisdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.29, 30. was partaker with him in this <hi>Counsel, v.</hi> 31. as also his <hi>eternal Spirit,</hi> who searches and knows <hi>all the deep things of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11. but yet the rise and <hi>spring</hi> of this Mystery, was in the Father.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50110:183"/>
For the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>acting</hi> in the blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> follows the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>subsistence.</hi> As the <hi>Father</hi> therefore is the Fountain of the Trinity as to <hi>subsistence,</hi> so also to <hi>operation.</hi> He hath <hi>life in himself,</hi> and he <hi>gives</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi> to have life in himself, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. And he doth it by communicating unto him his <hi>subsistence</hi> by eternal Generation. And thence saith the Son, <hi>As my Father worketh, so I work,</hi> v. 17. And what he <hi>seeth the Father do,</hi> that doth the Son likewise, <hi>v.</hi> 19. not by <hi>imitation,</hi> or repetition of the like works; but in the <hi>same</hi> works, in <hi>order</hi> of nature the will and wisdom of the Father, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; so also is it in respect of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> whose order of <hi>subsistence</hi> denotes that of his of <hi>operation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Mystery of the will of God, so <hi>hidden</hi> in the counsel of his will from Eternity, was always made and given out in the pursuit, and for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the <hi>purpose of the Father</hi>; or that eternal purpose of the will of God, which is by the way of <hi>eminency</hi> ascribed unto the Father. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>He hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>stery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself.</hi> It is the <hi>Father</hi> of whom he speaks, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Now he abounds to us-wards in <hi>wisdom</hi> and prudence, or <hi>abundantly</hi> manifests his <hi>infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in his dealing with us, by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the mystery of his will; and this he doth in pursuit of his <hi>good pleasure,</hi> which he purposed in himself; or that <hi>purpose</hi> of his will which had its foundation solely in his good pleasure. This is the purpose of <hi>Election,</hi> as is declared, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4 5. And this <hi>purpose</hi> is peculiarly assigned unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.13. For the accomplishment of this <hi>purpose,</hi> or the bringing of those <hi>predestinated</hi> thereby, to the end purposed for them by the means ordained, for the <hi>praise of Gods glorious grace,</hi> is the whole Revelation of the will of God, first, and last, made. He <hi>spake in his Son,</hi> and he spake in him that he might manifest his <hi>Name</hi> (himself and will) to the men whom he gave him: for, saith the Son, <hi>thine they were,</hi> set apart for thee in thy eternal purpose, and <hi>thou gavest them unto me, Joh.</hi> 17.6. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that in preaching of the Gospel, he endured <hi>all things for the elects sake,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. knowing that it was for <hi>their salvation,</hi> that the mystery of it was revealed from the bosome of the Father, as God also had before taught him, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.11. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>chap</hi> 8.28, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This Purpose of God being <hi>communicated</hi> with, and unto the Lord Christ, or the Son, and so becoming the <hi>Counsel of peace between them both, Zech.</hi> 6.13. He <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing</hi> to do the work that was incumbent on him for the accomplishment of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30, 31, 32. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.7, 8. it became peculiarly the <hi>care</hi> and work of the Father, to see that the <hi>inheritance</hi> promised him upon his undertaking, (<hi>Isa.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12.) should be given unto him. This is done by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the will of God unto men, concerning their <hi>obedience</hi> and salvation, whereby they are made the <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>t,</hi> the <hi>seed,</hi> the portion and inheritance of Christ. To this end doth the Lord, that is, the <hi>Father,</hi> who said unto the Lord the <hi>Son, Sit thou on my right hand,</hi> (<hi>Psal.</hi> 110.2.) send the <hi>Rod of his power out of Sion, v.</hi> 2. and that by it to declare his <hi>rule</hi> even over his enemies, and to make his <hi>people,</hi> those given unto him, <hi>willing and obedient, v.</hi> 3. The inheritance given by the <hi>Father</hi> unto Christ, being wholly in the possession of <hi>another,</hi> it became him to take it out of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>surpers</hi> hand, and deliver it up to him, whose right it was; and this he did, and doth by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of his mind in the preaching of the Word, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12, 13. And from these considerations it is, that</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The whole Revelation and <hi>Dispensation</hi> of the will of God in and by the Word, is (as was said) eminently appropriated unto the <hi>Father. Eternal life</hi> (the counsel, the purpose, ways, means, and procurer of it) <hi>was with the Father, and was manifested to us by the word of truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2. And it is the <hi>Father,</hi> that is, his <hi>will, mind, purpose, grace, love,</hi> that the Son declares, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. in which work he speaks nothing, but what he <hi>heard</hi> from, and was <hi>taught</hi> by the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.28. And thence he says, the <hi>doctrine is not mine,</hi> (that is, principally and originally) <hi>but his that sent me, Joh.</hi> 7.16. And the Gospel is called the <hi>Gospel of the glory of the blessed God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11. which is a <hi>periphrasis</hi> of the Person of the <hi>Father,</hi> who is the <hi>Father of glory, Ephes.</hi> 1.17. And we might also declare, that the great work of making this Gospel <hi>effectual</hi> on the minds of men, doth peculiarly <hi>belong</hi> unto the <hi>Father,</hi> which he accomplisheth by his Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>c.</hi> 4.6. But that is not our present business. Thus the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> of events that should befall the Church to the end of the world, that Christ <hi>signified by his Angel</hi> unto <hi>John,</hi> was first <hi>given him of the Father, Revel.</hi> 1.1. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though all declarations of God and his will, from the foundation of the world,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50110:183"/>
were made by the <hi>Son</hi> the second Person of the Trinity, and <hi>his Spirit</hi> speaking in the Prophets, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13. yet as it was not by him <hi>immediately,</hi> no more was it as <hi>absolutely</hi> so, but as the great <hi>Angel and Messenger</hi> of the Covenant, by the will and appointment of the Father. And therefore the very Dispensers of the Gospel are said, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap>, saith the Apostle; as <hi>if God</hi> the Father <hi>exhorted in and by us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. For to him doth this whole work principally relate.</p>
                        <p>And from the appropriating of this work originally and principally to the Father, there are three things, that are particularly intimated unto us.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Authority</hi> that is to be considered in it: the Father is the <hi>Original</hi> of all power and Authority; of him the <hi>whole Family of Heaven and Earth is named, Ephes.</hi> 3.15. He is the Father of the whole Family, from whom Christ himself receives <hi>all</hi> his Power and Authority as Mediator, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. which when his work is accomplished, he he shall give up again into his hand, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. He <hi>sent</hi> him into the world, <hi>set</hi> him over his house, gave him <hi>command</hi> unto his work. The very name and Title of <hi>Father,</hi> carries <hi>Authority</hi> along with it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. And in the disposal of the Church, in respect of this <hi>paternal power</hi> doth the Son affirm, that the <hi>Father is greater than he, Joh.</hi> 14.28. And runs up the <hi>contempt</hi> of the <hi>word</hi> in the preaching of it by his <hi>Messengers,</hi> into a contempt of this <hi>Authority</hi> of the Father, he that <hi>refuseth you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth me, he that refuseth me, refuseth him that sent me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Revelation then and dispensation of the mind and will of God in the word, is to be considered as an <hi>act of Supream Soveraign Authority</hi>: requiring all subjection of Soul and Conscience in the receiving of it. It is the <hi>Father of the Family</hi> that speaks in this word; he that hath all power and Authority <hi>essentially</hi> in him, over the souls and eternal conditions of them to whom he speaks. And what <hi>holy reverence,</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and universal subjection of soul to the word this in a particular manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, is easie to be apprehended.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There is also <hi>Love.</hi> In the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the blessed Trinity about the work of our Salvation, that which is <hi>eminently</hi> and in an especial manner ascribed unto the Father, is <hi>Love,</hi> as hath been at large elsewhere shewed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9, 10, 16. <hi>God,</hi> that is, the Father saith he, <hi>is Love.</hi> And how he <hi>exerts</hi> that property of his nature in the work of our Salvation by Christ, he there shews at large: So <hi>Joh..</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7, 8. To be <hi>Love,</hi> full of Love, to be the especial spring of all fruits of Love, is peculiar to him as the Father. And from <hi>Love</hi> it is that he makes the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Will whereof we speak, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.8. <hi>c.</hi> 33.3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 147.19, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. It was out of <hi>infinite Love,</hi> mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and compassion, that God would at all <hi>reveal</hi> his Mind and Will unto sinners. He might for ever have <hi>locked</hi> up the <hi>treasures</hi> of his Wisdom and Prudence, wherein he abounds towards us in his word, in his own eternal breast.

And thence our Saviour who had a <hi>delegated Care</hi> of his people, commends them to the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. as to whom the <hi>Care</hi> of them did principally and <hi>originally</hi> belong. <hi>Care</hi> is proper to a <hi>Father</hi> as such; to God as a Father. <hi>Care</hi> is inseparable from <hi>paternal Love.</hi> And this also is to be considered in the Revelation of the Will of God.</p>
                        <p>What <hi>directions</hi> from these Considerations may be taken for the use both of them that <hi>dispense</hi> the word, and of those whose duty it is to <hi>attend</hi> unto the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of it, shall only be marked in our passage.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. With what <hi>Reverence</hi> and godly fear, they ought to attend unto the dispensation of it, seeing it is a <hi>proper</hi> effect and issue of the <hi>Authority</hi> of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. And,</p>

                        <p>Other Observations I shall more briefly pass over. <hi>God spake in them.</hi>

                        <q>
                           <hi>II.</hi> The Authority of God speaking in and by the Pen-men of the Scriptures, is the sole bottom and foundation of our assenting to them, and what is contained in them, with Faith Divine and Supernatural.</q>
                        <p>He spake in them; he then continues to speak <hi>by</hi> them, and therefore is their word received, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20, 21. But this is <hi>elsewhere</hi> handled at large.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>III.</hi> Gods gradual Revelation of himself, his Mind and Will unto the Church, was a fruit of infinite Wisdom and Care towards his Elect.</q>
                        <p>These are parts of his wayes, sayes <hi>Job,</hi> but <hi>how little a portion is heard of him, Job</hi> 26.14. Though all his wayes and dispensations are ordered in <hi>infinite Wisdom,</hi> yet we can but stand at the <hi>shoar of the Ocean,</hi> and admire its glory and greatness. Little it is that we can comprehend. Yet what may be our instruction, that may <hi>further</hi> our Faith and Obedience is not hidden from us. And these things lye evident unto us, in this <hi>gradual</hi> discovery of himself and his Will.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That he <hi>over-filled</hi> not their Vessels, He gave them out light as they were <hi>able</hi> to bear; though we know not perfectly what their <hi>condition</hi> was, yet this we know, that as no <hi>generation</hi> needed <hi>more light</hi> than they had, for the discharge of the duty that God required of them, so <hi>more light</hi> would have <hi>unfitted</hi> them for somewhat or other, that was their duty in their respective generations.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He kept them in a <hi>Continual dependance</hi> upon himself, and waiting for their Rule and Direction from him; which as it tended to <hi>his glory,</hi> so it was exceedingly suited to <hi>their safety,</hi> in keeping them in an humble waiting frame.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. He <hi>so</hi> gave out the <hi>Light and Knowledge of himself,</hi> as that the great work which he had to accomplish, that lay in the <hi>stores</hi> of his <hi>infinitely Wise Will,</hi> as the end and issue of all Revelations, namely, the <hi>bringing forth of Christ into the world,</hi> in the way wherein he was to come, and for the Ends which he was to bring about, might not be obviated. He gave <hi>light</hi> enough to <hi>believers</hi> to enable them to receive him; and not <hi>so much,</hi> as to hinder <hi>obdurate sinners,</hi> from crucifying him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. He did this work so, that the <hi>Preheminence fully</hi> to reveal him, and <hi>ultimately,</hi> might be reserved for him, in whom all things were to be <hi>gathered unto an head.</hi> All <hi>Priviledges</hi> were to be kept for, and unto him; which was principally done by this <hi>gradual</hi> Revelation of the mind of God.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And there was <hi>tender Care</hi> conjoyned with this infinite Wisdom. None of his <hi>elect</hi> in any age, were left without that <hi>Light</hi> and instruction which were needful for them in their seasons and generations: And this <hi>so</hi> given out unto them, as that they might have fresh <hi>consolation</hi> and supportment, as their occasions did require. Whilest the Church of <hi>old</hi> was under this <hi>dispensation,</hi> they were still hearkning when they should hear <hi>new tydings</hi> from Heaven for their teaching and refreshment. And if any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty did at any time befall them, they were <hi>sure</hi> not to want relief in this kind. And this was necessary before the <hi>final hand</hi> was set to the work. And this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the <hi>woful state</hi> of the present <hi>Jews.</hi> They grant that the Revelation of the Will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50110:184"/>
of God is not perfected, and yet notwithstanding all their <hi>miseries,</hi> darkness and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, they dare not pretend that they have <hi>heard one word from heaven</hi> these 2000 years; that is, from the days of <hi>Malachi</hi>: and yet they labour to keep the vail upon their eyes.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>IV. We may see hence the</hi> absolute Perfection of the Revelation of the will of God by Christ and his Apostles, as to every end and purpose what ever, for which God ever did, or ever will in this world reveal himself, or his mind and will.</q>
                        <p>For as this was the <hi>last way</hi> and means that God ever designed for the discovery of himself, as to the worship and obedience which he requires, so the <hi>Person</hi> by whom he accomplished this work makes it <hi>indispensably</hi> necessary, that it be also <hi>absolutely perfect</hi>; from which nothing can be taken, to which nothing must be added, under the penalty of the <hi>extermination</hi> threatned to him that will not attend to the <hi>voice of that Prophet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Return we now again unto the words of our Apostle. Having declared the Son to be the <hi>immediate Revealer</hi> of the Gospel; in pursuit of his design, he proceeds to declare his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Excellency,</hi> both that which he had in himself <hi>antecedent</hi> to his susception of the Office of Mediator, and what he <hi>received</hi> upon his <hi>in-vestiture</hi> therewith.</p>
                        <p>Two things in the close of this verse he assigns unto him; 1. That <hi>he was appointed heir of all.</hi> 2. That <hi>by him the worlds were made.</hi> Wherein consists the first <hi>Amplification</hi> of his Proposition, concerning the <hi>Revealer</hi> of the Gospel, in two parts, both acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the <hi>Jews,</hi> both directly conducing to his purpose in hand.</p>

                        <p n="5">5. The <hi>Original</hi> and Rise of this Inheritance of Christ will give us its true extent, which must therefore more especially be <hi>considered.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon the <hi>Creation</hi> of man God gave unto him a <hi>Dominion</hi> over all things in this <hi>lower world, Gen.</hi> 1.28, 29. He made him his <hi>Heir, Vice-gerent</hi> and Substitute in the earth. And as for those other Creatures to which his Power and Authority did not immediately extend, as the <hi>Sun, Moon and Stars,</hi> the whole inanimate Host of the <hi>Superiour World,</hi> they were ordered by him that made them, to serve for his good and behoof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.19. So that even they also in a sort belonged unto his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> being made to <hi>serve</hi> him in his subjection unto God.</p>
                        <p>Further, besides this <hi>lower part</hi> of his Dominion, God had for his Glory created <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven <hi>above,</hi> of whom we shall have occasion hereafter to treat. These made up another <hi>branch</hi> of Gods <hi>Providential Kingdom,</hi> the whole administred in the <hi>upper</hi> and <hi>lower</hi> world, being of each other <hi>independent,</hi> and meeting in nothing but their dependance upon, and subjection unto <hi>God</hi> himself. Hence they did not so <hi>stand</hi> in the condition of their Creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that one <hi>kind</hi> or race of them might fail and <hi>perish</hi> without any impeachment of the other. So also it came to pass. <hi>Man</hi> might have persisted in his honour and dignity notwithstanding the <hi>fall</hi> and Apostacy of some of the <hi>Angels.</hi> When he fell from his <hi>heirship and dominion,</hi> the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of all things unto him, and by him unto God, was lost. And all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures returned to an <hi>immediate absolute dependance</hi> on the Government of God; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect to the <hi>Authority</hi> and Soveraignty delegated unto man. But as the fall of <hi>Angels</hi> did not in its own nature prejudice <hi>mankind,</hi> no more did this fall of <hi>man,</hi> the Angels that persisted in their obedience, they being no part of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. However by the Sin, Apostacy, and punishment of that <hi>portion of the Angels</hi> which kept not their first station, it was manifested how possible it was, that the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder</hi> of them might sin after the similitude of their transgression. Things being brought into this condition, <hi>one branch</hi> of the Kingdom of God under the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of <hi>man,</hi> or allotted to his service, being cast out of that <hi>order</hi> wherein he had placed it, and the <hi>other</hi> in an open possibility of being so also, it seemed good to the Lord in his infinite Wisdom to <hi>erect one Kingdom</hi> out of these <hi>two disordered members</hi> of his first Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this was the <hi>Son</hi> as the Apostle tells us, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.10. <hi>He gathered together in one all things in Christ, both which are in the Heavens, and which are in Earth, even in him.</hi> He designed <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>to bring all into one head,</hi> and rule in him. It is not a <hi>similitude</hi> taken from <hi>casting up accounts,</hi> wherein <hi>lesser summs</hi> are in the close brought into <hi>one head,</hi> as some have imagined; nor yet an Allusion to <hi>Orators,</hi> who in the close of their <hi>long Orations, summ</hi> up the matter they have at large treated of, that the Apostle makes use of; both which are <hi>beneath</hi> the Majesty of, and no way suited to illustrate the <hi>matter</hi> he hath in hand.

Besides the <hi>Heirship</hi> promised unto Christ was neither of a <hi>Temporal Kingdom of Israel</hi> which he never enjoyed, nor of any other thing in dependance thereon. Were it so, the <hi>Jews</hi> must first have the <hi>Dominion</hi> before he could inherit it. And such indeed was the mistake of the <hi>Disciples</hi> (as it is of the <hi>Jews</hi> to this day) who enquired not whither <hi>he would take the Kingdom to himself,</hi> but whether he would <hi>restore</hi> it unto <hi>Israel.</hi>

For the present I shall only intimate the <hi>continuance</hi> of this <hi>perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> among the Jews, both then when the Apostle wrote unto them, and afterwards.

                        <p>The <hi>Influence</hi> of this Assertion, or <hi>common Principle</hi> of the <hi>Judaical Church,</hi> into the Argument that the Apostle hath in hand is evident and manifest; He who is the <hi>Heir and Lord of all things,</hi> Spiritual, Temporal, Ecclesiastical, must needs have power over all <hi>Mosaical</hi> Institutions, be the Lord of them, which are no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from his Rule.</p>
                        <p>The words being <hi>opened,</hi> and the design of the Apostle in them discovered, because they contain an <hi>eminent Head</hi> of the Doctrine of the Gospel concerning the <hi>Lordship and Kingdom of Jesus Christ</hi> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> I shall stay here a little to give in a <hi>Scheme</hi> of his whole Dominion, seeing the consideration of it, will not again so <hi>directly</hi> occur unto us. That which is the intendment of the words in the interpretation given of them is this,</p>
                        <q>God the Father in the pursuit of the Soveraign purpose of his Will, hath granted unto the Son as incarnate, and Mediator of the New Covenant, according to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Council between them both, a Soveraign Power and Authority over all things in Heaven and Earth, with the Possession of an absolute proprietor, to dispose of them at his pleasure, for the furtherance and Advancement of his proper and peculiar work, as Head of his Church.</q>
                        <p>I shall not insist on the <hi>several Branches</hi> of this <hi>Thesis</hi>; but as I said in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this <hi>Grant</hi> of Power and Dominion unto the Lord Christ, and then give in our <hi>Scheme</hi> of his Kingdom in the several Branches of it, not <hi>enlarging</hi> our Discourse upon them, but only <hi>pointing</hi> at the heads and springs of things as they lye in the Scripture.</p>

                           <p>THe <hi>Grant</hi> of <hi>Dominion</hi> in general unto the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is intimated in the first <hi>promise</hi> of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. His <hi>Victory</hi> over Satan was to be attended with <hi>Rule, Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion, Psal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.12. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.8, 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. and confirmed in the Renewal of that <hi>Promise</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.17, 18. For in him it was, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was to be <hi>Heir of the world, Rom.</hi> 4.13. As also unto <hi>Judah,</hi> whose seed was to enjoy <hi>the Scepter and Law-giver,</hi> until he came who was to be <hi>Lord over all, Gen.</hi> 49.10. As <hi>Baalam</hi> also saw the <hi>Star of Jacob,</hi> with a <hi>Scepter</hi> for <hi>Rule, Numb.</hi> 24.17, 19. This Kingdom was fully revealed unto <hi>David,</hi> and is expressed by him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. throughout. <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, <hi>&amp;c.

                           <p>As this was foretold in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> so the accomplishment of it is expresly asserted in the <hi>New.</hi> Upon his Birth he is proclaimed to be <hi>Christ the Lord, Luke</hi> 2.11. And the first enquiry after him is, where is he <hi>that is born King, Matth.</hi> 2.2, 6. And this Testimony doth he give concerning himself; namely, that all <hi>judgement was his,</hi> and therefore all honour was due unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, 23. And that <hi>all things were
<pb facs="tcp:50110:187"/>
and a Saviour, Acts</hi> 5.31. He is highly exalted, having a <hi>name given him above every name, Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. being set at the <hi>Right Hand of God in heavenly places</hi> far above, <hi>&amp;c. Ephes.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. where he <hi>reigns for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. being the <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Revel.</hi> 5.12, 13, 14. for he is <hi>Lord of quick and dead, Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8, 9.</p>
                           <p>And this in general is fully asserted in the Scripture, unto the <hi>Consolation</hi> of the Church, and <hi>Terror</hi> of his Adversaries. This I say is the <hi>spring</hi> of the Churches Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Comfort, and Assurance. It is our <hi>Head, Husband,</hi> and <hi>Elder Brother,</hi> who is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously vested with all this Power. Our <hi>nearest</hi> Relation, our <hi>best</hi> Friend is thus exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; not to a place of Honour and trust <hi>under</hi> others, a thing that contents the <hi>aiery fancy</hi> of poor Earth-worms; not yet to a <hi>Kingdom on the Earth,</hi> a matter that swells some, and even breaks them with pride; no nor yet to an <hi>Empire</hi> over this perishing world; but to an abiding, an <hi>everlasting Rule</hi> and Dominion over the whole Creation of God. And it is but a little while, before he will cast off and dispell all those Clouds and shades which at present interpose themselves, and eclipse <hi>his Glory and Majesty</hi> from them that love him. <hi>He</hi> who in the dayes of his flesh, was <hi>reviled, reproached, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, crucified</hi> for our sakes, that same <hi>Jesus</hi> is thus <hi>exalted</hi> and made a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>Saviour,</hi> having a <hi>Name</hi> given him above every name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for though he was <hi>dead</hi>; yet he is <hi>alive,</hi> and lives for ever, and hath the Keys of Hell and Death: These things are every where proposed for the <hi>Consolation</hi> of the Church.</p>
                           <p>The Consideration of it also is suited to strike <hi>Terror</hi> into the hearts of <hi>ungodly</hi> men, that oppose him in the world. Whom is it that they do despise? Against <hi>whom</hi> do they magnifie themselves, and lift up their horns on high? whose <hi>Ordinances,</hi> Laws, Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do they contemn? whose <hi>Gospel</hi> do they refuse Obedience unto? whose <hi>people</hi> and servants do they revile and persecute? Is it not <hi>He?</hi> are they not <hi>his,</hi> who hath <hi>all power</hi> in Heaven and Earth committed unto him? in whose <hi>hand</hi> are the Lives, the Souls, all the concernments of his Enemies. <hi>Caesar</hi> thought he had spoken with <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> when threatning him with death who stood in his way, he told him, <hi>Young man, he speaks it, to whom it is as easie to do it.

                              <hi>Being made better than the Angels</hi>; the <hi>original right</hi> and equity of this Grant, with the ends of it, are now only to be intimated.</p>

The Radical <hi>fundamental</hi> Equity of this Grant lies in his <hi>Divine Nature</hi>: and his creation of Angels, over whom as Mediator he is made Lord. Unto the general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of his being made <hi>Heir of all,</hi> the Apostle in this place subjoyns that general Reason, manifesting the <hi>rise</hi> of the Equity of it in the Will of God, that it should be so: <hi>By whom also he made the worlds.</hi> Which reason is particularly applicable to every part of his inheritance, and is especially pleaded in reference unto Angels: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature</hi>; that is, the Heir and Lord of them all: and the reason is, <hi>Because by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, or powers, all things were created by him and for him.</hi> His <hi>creation</hi> of those heavenly powers, is the foundation of his <hi>Heirship</hi> or Lordship over them. <gap reason="foreign">

Because, saith he, mention is made of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is the <hi>name of a man,</hi> and so the Creation of all things cannot be attributed unto him. But Christ is the name of the Son of God incarnate, <hi>God and Man:</hi> Christ, who is <hi>over all, God blessed for ever, Rom.</hi> 9.5. See <hi>Luke</hi> 2.11. And he is here spoken of as the <hi>Image of the invisible God, v.</hi> 15. the essential Image of the Father, endowed with all his eternal Attributes, and so the <hi>Creator</hi> of all. The <hi>Socinians</hi> adde, that the words are used in the abstract, <hi>Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers,</hi> and therefore their <hi>Dignities,</hi> not their <hi>Persons</hi> are intended. But, 1. <hi>All things created in heaven and earth, visible and invisible,</hi> are the Substances and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences of things themselves, and not their Qualities and Places only. 2. The Distribution into <hi>Thrones and Dominions, Principalities and Powers,</hi> respects only the last branch of things affirmed to be created by him, namely, things in heaven, invisible; so that if it should be granted, that he made or created them only as to their <hi>Dignity,</hi> Order and Power, yet they obtain not their purpose, since the Creation of all other things, as to their <hi>being</hi> and subsistence, is ascribed unto him.

It is founded in that <hi>Establishment</hi> in the condition of their Creation, which by his interposition to <hi>recover</hi> what was lost by sin, and to <hi>preserve</hi> the untainted part of the Creation from ruine, they did receive.

                           <p>This is the first branch of the <hi>Lordship and Dominion</hi> of Christ, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of the severals of it before laid down. He is Lord of <hi>Angels,</hi> and they are all of them his servants, the <hi>fellow-servants</hi> of them that have the testimony of Jesus. And as some men do wilfully cast themselves by their <hi>Religious adoration of Angels,</hi> under the curse of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to be servants unto servants, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.25. so it is the great honour and priviledge of <hi>true believers,</hi> that in their worship of Christ, they are admitted into the <hi>society of an innumerable company of Angels, Heb.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.11, 13. for they are not ashamed to esteem them their <hi>fellow-servants,</hi> whom their Lord and King is not ashamed to call his <hi>Brethren.</hi> And herein consists our communion with them, that we have one <hi>common Head</hi> and Lord; and any <hi>intercourse</hi> with them, but only on this account, or any <hi>worship</hi> performed towards them, breaks the bond of that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and causeth us not to hold the Head, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. The priviledge, the safety and advantage of the Church from this <hi>subjection of Angels</hi> to its Head and Saviour, are by many spoken unto.</p>
                           <p n="ii">II. There is another sort of <hi>Angels,</hi> who <hi>by sin left their primitive station,</hi> and fell off from God; of <hi>whom,</hi> their Sin, Fall, Malice, Wrath, Business, Craft in evil, and Final judgment, the Scripture treateth at large. These belong not indeed to the <hi>possession</hi> of Christ, as he is the <hi>Heir</hi>; but they belong unto his <hi>Dominion</hi> as he is a <hi>Lord.</hi> Though he be not a <hi>King and Head</hi> unto them, yet he is a <hi>Judge</hi> and Ruler over them. All things being given into his hand, they also are <hi>subjected</hi> unto his power. Now, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former head, I shall consider, 1. The <hi>Right</hi> or Equity: and 2. The <hi>End</hi> of this Authority of Christ over this <hi>second</hi> sort of the <hi>first</hi> Race of Intellectual Creatures, the <hi>Angels</hi> that have sinned.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. As before, this Right is founded in his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> by vertue whereof, he is <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>,<hi>fit</hi> for this Dominion. He made <hi>these Angels</hi> also, and therefore, <hi>as God,</hi> hath an absolute Dominion over them. The <hi>Creatures</hi> cannot cast off the Dominion of the <hi>Creator</hi> by rebellion; though they may lose their <hi>moral Relation</hi> unto God as <hi>obedient creatures,</hi> yet their <hi>natural,</hi> as <hi>creatures,</hi> cannot be dissolved. God will be God still, be his creatures never so wicked; and if they <hi>obey</hi> not his Will, they shall <hi>bear</hi> his Justice. And this Dominion of Christ over <hi>faln Angels,</hi> as God, makes the grant of Rule over them to him, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> just and equal.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The immediate and <hi>peculiar Foundation</hi> of his Right unto <hi>Rule</hi> over <hi>faln Angels,</hi> rendring the special grant of it equal and righteous, is <hi>Lawful Conquest.</hi> This gives a <hi>special Right, Gen.</hi> 48.22.

full of instances as to his executing his Power and Authority over <hi>Evil Angels</hi>; They take up a good part of the <hi>Historical</hi> Books of it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Man</hi> having sinned by the instigation of <hi>Satan,</hi> he was by the just Judgement of God <hi>delivered</hi> up unto his power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. The Lord Christ undertaking to recover <hi>lost man</hi> from under his power by <hi>destroying</hi> his works, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. and to bring them again into favour with God; <hi>Satan</hi> with all his might sets himself to oppose him in his Work; and failing in his enterprise, being <hi>utterly conquered,</hi> he became abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely subjected unto him, trodden under his feet, and the <hi>prey</hi> he had taken delivered from him.</p>
                           <p>This is the next Foundation of the Authority of Christ over the <hi>Evil Angels.</hi> He had a great Contest and <hi>War</hi> with them, and that about the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, his own <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the Eternal <hi>Salvation</hi> of the Elect; prevailing absolutely against them, he made a <hi>Conquest</hi> over them, and they are put in subjection unto him for ever.

And this purchase of Christ, is <hi>peculiar</hi> to them so given him of the Father in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Mediator: as (1.) Proceeding from his <hi>especial and greatest Love, Joh.</hi> 15.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. And (2.)

                           <p n="3">3. These <hi>thus given him</hi> of the Father and redeemed by him, are of two sorts. 1. Such as are <hi>actually called</hi> to faith in him, and Union with him. These are further become <hi>his,</hi> upon many other especial accounts. They are his, in <hi>all Relations</hi> of Subjection, his <hi>Children, Servants, Brethren, Disciples,</hi> Subjects, his House, his Spouse. He stands towards them in <hi>all Relations</hi> of Authority; is their <hi>Father,</hi> Master, Elder Brother, Teacher, King, Lord, Ruler, Judge, Husband; Ruling <hi>in them</hi> by his Spirit and Grace, <hi>over them</hi> by his Laws in his Word, preserving them by his <hi>power; chastening</hi> them in his Care and Love, <hi>feeding</hi> them out of his stores, <hi>trying</hi> them, and delivering them in his Wisdom, <hi>Bearing</hi> with their miscarriages in his Patience, and <hi>taking</hi> them for his portion, lot and inheritance; in his Providence, <hi>raising</hi> them at the last day, <hi>taking</hi> them to himself in Glory, every way avouching them to be <hi>his,</hi> and himself to be their Lord and Master.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Some of them, are alwayes <hi>uncalled,</hi> and <hi>shall</hi> be so, untill the <hi>whole number</hi> of them be compleated and filled. But before, they belong on the <hi>former accounts,</hi> unto his Lot, Care and Rule, <hi>John</hi> 10.6. They are already his <hi>sheep</hi> by <hi>grant and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,</hi> though not yet really so by <hi>Grace and Holiness</hi>: They are not yet <hi>his,</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Obediential Subjection,</hi> but they are his by <hi>Eternal Designation</hi> and reall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition.</p>
                           <p>Now the power that the Lord Jesus hath over this sort of Mankind is <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niversal,</hi> unlimited, absolute, and exclusive of all other power over them, as unto the things peculiarly belonging unto his Kingdom. He is their <hi>King, Judge, Law-giver,</hi> and in things of God, purely Spiritual and Evangelical; other they have none. It is true he takes them not <hi>out of the world,</hi> and therefore as unto <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, the <hi>things of this life,</hi> things of the world, they are subject to the <hi>Laws</hi> and Rulers of the world; but as unto the <hi>things of God,</hi> he is the <hi>only Law-giver</hi> who is able to kill and make alive. But the nature and ends of the Lordship of Christ over the Elect, are too large and comprehensive to be here spoken unto, in this brief <hi>delineation</hi> of his Kingdom, which we undertook in this digression.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. His Lordship and <hi>Dominion</hi> extends to the other sort of men also; namely, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,</hi> and men finally impenitent. They are not exempted from that <hi>all flesh,</hi> which he hath power over, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. nor from those <hi>quick and dead</hi> over whom he is Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. nor from that <hi>World</hi> which he shall judge; <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. And there are two especial grounds that are peculiar to them, of this Grant, and Power, and Authority over them.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. His <hi>interposition</hi> upon the entrance of Sin against the immediate Execution of the Curse due unto it; as befell the <hi>Angels</hi>: This fixed the World under a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Forbearance</hi> and Patience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30 <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Psal.</hi> 75.3.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Goodness</hi> and Mercy, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16, 17.</p>
                           <p>That God who spared not the <hi>Angels,</hi> when they sinned, but immediately cast them into <hi>chains of darkness,</hi> should place sinners of the Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> under a dispensation of <hi>Forbearance</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> that he should spare them with much Long-suffering dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> on the earth, and fill their hearts with <hi>food</hi> and gladness, with all those fruits of kindness, which the <hi>womb</hi> of his Providence is still bringing forth for their benefit and advantage, is thus far on the <hi>account</hi> of the Lord Christ, that though these things as relating unto <hi>Reprobates,</hi> are no part of his <hi>especial purchase,</hi> as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Everlasting Covenant of Grace, yet they are a <hi>necessary consequent</hi> of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition

They are in his hand, as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were in <hi>Joseph's,</hi> when he had purchased both their persons and their Estates to be at arbitrary disposal; And he deals with them as <hi>Joseph</hi> did with those, so far as any of the Ends of his Rule and Lordship are concerned in them. And,</p>

                           </p>
                           <p n="ii">II. The Second part of the <hi>Heirship</hi> and Dominion of Christ, consisteth in his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship over <hi>all Things</hi> besides, which added to the former comprize the whole Creation of God. In the distribution of these premised, the first that occur are <hi>Spiritual</hi> things, which also are of two sorts: 1. <hi>Temporal,</hi> or such as in this life we are made partakers of; and 2. <hi>Eternal,</hi> the things that are reserved for them that believe in the State of Glory. The former may be reduced unto two heads; for they are all of them either <hi>Grace,</hi> or <hi>Gifts,</hi> and Christ is Lord of them all.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. All that which comes under the name of <hi>Grace</hi> in Scripture, which flowing from the <hi>free</hi> and special Love of God, tends directly to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and Eternal Good of them on whom it is bestowed, may be referred unto four heads. For as the fountain of all these (or the gracious free purposes of the Will of God from whence they all do flow) being <hi>Antecedent</hi> to the Mission of Christ the Mediator, and <hi>Immanent</hi> in God, it can be no otherwise <hi>granted</hi> unto him, but in respect of its Effects, which we shall shew that it is. Now these are;</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Pardon of sin,</hi> and the free Acceptation of the Persons of sinners, in a way of mercy. This is <hi>Grace, Ephes.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 7. And a saving Effect and fruit of the Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>Regenerating of the Person of a dead sinner,</hi> with the purifying and sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Nature, in a way of Spiritual power. This also is <hi>Grace,</hi> and promised in the Covenant; and there are three parts of it: (1.) The Infusion of a <hi>quickning Principle</hi> into the soul of a dead sinner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.16. (2.) The <hi>Habitual furnishment</hi> of a spiritually quickned soul, with abiding radical principles of <hi>Light, Love</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> fitting it for Spiritual Obedience, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. (3.) <hi>Actual Assistance,</hi> in a Communication of supplies of strength for every Duty and Work, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.13. <hi>John</hi> 15.3.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Preservation</hi> in a Condition of Acceptation with God, and holy Obedience unto him unto the End, is also of <hi>Especial Grace</hi>: It is the <hi>Grace of Perseverance,</hi> and eminently included in the Covenant; as we have elsewhere shewed at large.</p>
                           <p n="4">

                           <p>All these with all those <hi>admirable and inexpressible</hi> mercies that they branch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into, giving <hi>deliverance</hi> unto sinners from evil temporal and eternal; raising them to <hi>Communion</hi> with God here, and to the Enjoyment of him for ever hereafter, are called <hi>Grace</hi>; and do belong to the Lordship of Christ, as he is <hi>Heir, Lord</hi> and Possessor of them all. All the <hi>stores</hi> of this Grace and Mercy that are in Heaven for sinners, are given into his hand, and resigned up to his Soveraign disposal; as we shall intimate in general, and particular.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. In <hi>General</hi>; Col. 1.19. <hi>It pleased the Father that in him all fulness should dwell.</hi> There is a fourfold <hi>fulness</hi> in Christ: 1. Of the <hi>Deity</hi> in his Divine Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. 2. Of <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> in his Person, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. 3. Of <hi>Grace</hi> in his Humane Nature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.34. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.52. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. 4. An <hi>Authoritative fulness</hi> to communicate of it unto others; that is the <hi>fulness</hi> here intended. For it is in him as the <hi>head of the Church, v.</hi> 18. so as that from him, or that <hi>fulness,</hi> which it pleased the Father to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust him withall, believers might receive <hi>grace for grace Joh.</hi> 1.16, 17. Thus he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies that <hi>all things</hi> are delivered to him of the Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. put into his power and possession. And they are <hi>the things</hi> he there intends on the account where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he invites sinners <hi>weary and laden</hi> to come unto him, <hi>v.</hi> 28. That is, all <hi>Mercy and Grace,</hi> which are the <hi>things</hi> that burdened sinners need, and look after. The same is testified <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.35, 36. and <hi>fully, Joh.</hi> 16.15. All things that the <hi>Father hath are mine, Joh.</hi> 16.19. All the Grace and Mercy that are in the <hi>Heart</hi> of God as a Father, to bestow upon his Children, they are all given into the <hi>hand</hi> of Christ, and are <hi>his,</hi> or part of his Inheritance.</p>
                           <p>In particular;</p>
                           <p n="1">1. All <hi>Pardoning Grace</hi> for the Acceptance of our Persons, and Forgiveness of our sins is his; he is the Lord of it; <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. He is made <hi>a Prince and a Saviour to give repentance and the forgiveness of sins. Forgiveness</hi> of sin, is wholly given unto him, as to the Administration of it; nor doth any one receive it, but out of his stores. And what is the Dominion of ten thousands of worlds in comparison of this Inheritance? Sure he shall be my <hi>God</hi> and <hi>King</hi> who hath <hi>all forgiveness</hi> at his disposal. All that this World can do, or give, is a thousand times lighter than the dust of the ballance, if compared with these <hi>good things</hi> of the Kingdom of Christ.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. All <hi>Regenerating,</hi> quickning, sanctifying, assisting Grace is his: 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.21. He <hi>quickneth whom he pleaseth</hi>: He walks among dead souls, and sayes to whom he will, <hi>Live.</hi> And 2. He <hi>sanctifies</hi> by his Spirit whom he pleaseth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. All the <hi>living waters</hi> of saving Grace are committed to him, and he invites men unto them freely, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. And 3. All Grace <hi>actually assisting</hi> us unto any duty, is his also; for without him we <hi>can do nothing, Joh.</hi> 15.5. for it is he alone that gives out <hi>suitable help</hi> at the time of need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. No man was ever <hi>quickned,</hi> purified or strengthened but by him: nor can any dram of this Grace be obtained, but out of his Treasures. Those who pretend to stores of it in their own <hi>wills</hi>; are so far <hi>Antichrists.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Grace of our <hi>Preservation</hi> in our Acceptation with God, and Obedience unto him is solely his, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. And so also,</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Are all the blessed and <hi>gracious Priviledges</hi> whereof we are made partakers, in our <hi>Adoption, Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. He is so Lord over the whole House and <hi>family</hi> of God, as to have the whole inheritance in his power, and the absolute disposal of all the good things belonging unto it.</p>
                           <p>These are the <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Treasure</hi> of the Kingdom of Christ; the good things of his House, the <hi>Revenues</hi> of his Dominion. The <hi>Mass</hi> of this Treasure that lyes by him is <hi>infinite,</hi> the stores of it are inexhaustible; and he is ready, free, gracious and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in his Communications of them to all the <hi>Subjects</hi> of his Dominion. This part of his <hi>Heirship</hi> extends unto, 1. All the <hi>Grace and Mercy</hi> that the Father could find in his own gracious Heart to bestow, when he was <hi>full</hi> of Counsels of Love, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to exalt himself by the way of Grace, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.6. 2. To all the Grace and Mercy which he himself <hi>could purchase</hi> by the Effusion of his Blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. and indeed these are <hi>commensurate</hi>; if things, in respect of us altogether boundless, may be said to be <hi>commensurate.</hi> 3. All that Grace which hath <hi>saved the World of Sinners</hi> which are already in the enjoyment of God, and that shall effectually save all that come to God by him. 4. <hi>All that Grace</hi> which in the Promises of it in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> is set out by all that is <hi>rich, precious,</hi> glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, all that is eminent in the whole Creation of God; and in the <hi>New</hi> is called
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50110:191"/>
                              <hi>Treasures, unsearchable Riches,</hi> and <hi>exceeding Excellency,</hi> which being communicated by him to all the subjects of his Kingdom, makes every one of them <hi>richer</hi> than all the Potentates of the earth, who have no interest in him.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>especial Foundation</hi> of all this Trust is in an eminent manner expressed, <hi>Esay</hi> 53.10, 11, 12. His <hi>suffering</hi> for the sins of all those to whom he intends to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate of this his fulness, according to the will of God; and the <hi>Purchase</hi> he made in his death, according to the tenour of the Covenant of the Mediator, makes it <hi>just</hi> and righteous that he should enjoy this part of his Inheritance. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.12. The Father says unto him, <hi>Seest thou these poor wretched Creatures, that lie perishing in their bloud, and under the curse? They had once my Image gloriously enstamped on them, and were every way meet for my service; but behold the Misery that is come upon them, by their sin and rebellion; sentence is gone forth against them upon their sin; and they want nothing to shut them up under Everlasting Ruine, but the Execution of it: Wilt thou undertake for to be their Saviour and Deliverer, to save them from their sins, and the wrath to come? Wilt thou make thy Soul an Offering for their sins? and lay down thy Life a Ransome for them? Hast thou Love enough to wash them in thy own Blood, in a Nature to be taken of them? Being obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient therein unto death, the death of the Cross?</hi> Whereunto he replies, <hi>I am content to do thy Will, and will undertake this work, and that with joy and delight. Lo, I come for that purpose, my delight is with these sons men,</hi> Psal. 40.8. Prov. 8.31. <hi>What they have taken, I will pay. What is due from them, let it be required at my hand. I am ready to undergo Wrath and curse for them, and to pour out my soul unto death. It shall be,</hi> saith the Father, <hi>as thou hast spoken, and thou shalt see of the travel of thy soul and be satisfied.</hi> I <hi>will give thee for a Covenant and a Leader unto them, and thou shalt be the Captain of their salvation. To this end take into thy power and disposal all the Treasures of Heaven, all Mercy and Grace to give out unto them for whom thou hast undertaken. Behold, here are unsearchable hidden Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, not of many Generations, but laid up from Eternity; take all these Riches into thy power, and at thy disposal shall they be for ever.</hi> This is the noble peculiar foundation of this part of the Inheritance of Christ.</p>
                           <p>From what hath been spoken, the <hi>Rule</hi> also, whereby the Lord Christ proccedeth in disposing these <hi>Treasures</hi> to the sons of men, is made evident. Though he hath <hi>all Grace</hi> committed unto him, yet he bestowes not grace upon all. The <hi>Rule</hi> of his procedure herein is <hi>God's Election.</hi> For the <hi>Foundation</hi> of this whole Trust is his <hi>undertaking</hi> for them, who were given him of his Father, see <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And the <hi>variety</hi> which is seen in his actual Communication of Grace and Mercy unto sinners, depends upon the <hi>Sovereign</hi> and Eternal Designation of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of them, who by him were to obtain mercy, and be made Heirs of Salvation.</p>
                           <p>But although the Persons are <hi>designed</hi> and allotted unto him from Eternity, who were to receive this Grace and Mercy at his hands, yet as to the <hi>manner,</hi> and all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of his Dispensation and Communication of them, they are <hi>wholly committed</hi> unto his own Sovereign Will and Wisdom. Hence some he calls at <hi>one</hi> time, some at <hi>another</hi>; some in the <hi>Morning,</hi> that they may glorifie Grace in working all the day; some in the <hi>Evening</hi> of their lives, that they may exalt <hi>pardoning</hi> mercy to Eternity; on some he bestows <hi>much Grace,</hi> that he may render them useful in the strength of it; on others <hi>less,</hi> that he may keep them humble in a sense of their wants. Some he makes <hi>rich</hi> in Light, others in <hi>Love</hi>; some in <hi>Faith,</hi> others in <hi>Patience</hi>; that they may all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly praise him, and set out the fulness of his stores. And hereby, 1. He glorifies <hi>every Grace</hi> of his Spirit, by making it shine eminently in one or other, as Faith in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> Love in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Patience in <hi>Job.</hi> And, 2. he renders his subjects <hi>useful</hi> one to another, in that they have opportunities upon the defects and fulness of each other, to exercise all their Graces. And, 3. so he renders his whole Body <hi>uniform</hi> and comely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. 4. Keeping every Member in Humility and dependance, whilst it sees its own wants in some Graces that others excells in, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                           <q>This is another <hi>most eminent part</hi> of the Inheritance and Kingdom of Christ.</q>
                           <p n="ii">II. All <hi>Gifts</hi> that are bestowed on any of the sons of men, whereby they are <hi>differenced</hi> from others, or made <hi>useful</hi> unto others, belong also unto the <hi>Inheritance</hi> and Kingdom of Christ.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Gifts</hi> bestowed on men are either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Spiritual: Natural</hi> Gifts are <hi>especial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments</hi> of the Persons or Minds of men, in Relation unto things appertaining unto

this Life; as Wisdom, Learning, skill and cunning in Arts and Sciences: I call them <hi>Natural,</hi> in respect of the Objects that they are exercised about, which are <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>things of this life,</hi> as also in respect of their End and Use. They are not always <hi>so,</hi> as to their <hi>rise</hi> and spring, but may be immediately <hi>infused,</hi> as Wisdom was into <hi>Solomon,</hi> for Civil Government, 1 <hi>King</hi> 9.12. and <hi>skill</hi> for all manner of <hi>Mechanical</hi> Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into <hi>Bezaleel, Exod.</hi> 31.2, 3, 6. But how far these gifts are <hi>educed</hi> in an ordinary course of Providence, out of their <hi>hidden seeds</hi> and principles in nature, in a just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of Causes and Effects, and so fall under a <hi>certain Law of Acquisition,</hi> or what there may be of the Interposition of the Spirit of God in an especial manner, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>conferring them</hi> on any, falls not under our present consideration of them. Nor yet can we insist on their Use, which is such, that they are the <hi>great Instrument</hi> in the hand of God for the preservation of <hi>Humane Society,</hi> and to keep the course of mans life and pilgrimage from being wholly bruitish. I design only to shew, that even they also belong (though <hi>more remotely</hi>) to the Lordship of Jesus Christ; which they do on two accounts;</p>
                           <p n="1">1. In that the very <hi>use of mens Reason,</hi> and their natural faculties, as to any good end or purpose, is continued unto them upon the account of his <hi>Interposition,</hi> bringing the world thereby under a dispensation of patience and forbearance, as was declared, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. He is endued with Power and <hi>Authority</hi> to use them, in whose hand soever they lie, whether of his <hi>friends</hi> or <hi>enemies,</hi> to the especial Ends of his Glory, in doing good unto his Church. And indeed in the Efficacy of his Spirit and Power upon the <hi>Gifts</hi> of the minds of men, exciting, ordering, disposing, enabling them unto various Actings and Operations, by and with them; controuling, over-ruling, entangling each other, and themselves in whom they are by them, his Wisdom and care in the Rule, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chastisement, and Deliverance of his Church, are most conspicuous.</p>
                           <p n="iii">III. 2. <hi>Spiritual Gifts,</hi> which principally come under that Denomination are of two sorts; <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> and <hi>Ordinary.</hi> The first are immediate <hi>Endowments</hi> of the minds of men with Abilities exceeding the whole <hi>Systeme of Nature,</hi> in the exercise whereof they are meer Instruments of him who bestows those gifts upon them. Such of old were the <hi>Gifts</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> Tongues, Healing, Prediction, and infallible Inspiration, given out by the Lord Christ unto such as he was pleased to use in his <hi>Gospel</hi> service in an Extraordinary manner. The latter sort are <hi>Furnishments</hi> of the minds of men, enabling them unto the <hi>Comprehension of spiritual things,</hi> and the management of them for <hi>spiritual Ends</hi> and purposes. Such are Wisdom, Knowledge, Prudence, Utterance, Aptness to teach; in general, <hi>Abilities to manage the things of Christ</hi> and the Gospel, unto their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ends. And these also are of two sorts. 1. Such as are peculiar unto <hi>Office</hi>; and, 2. Such as are <hi>common</hi> unto others for their own and others Good and Edification, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are called unto the exercise of them. And these two sorts of <hi>Gifts</hi> differ only in respect of <hi>degrees.</hi> There are no ordinary Gifts that Christ's <hi>Officers</hi> are made partakers of, their <hi>Office</hi> only excepted, which differs in the <hi>kind</hi> or nature of them from those which he bestows on all his Disciples: which makes their stirring up, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to improve the <hi>Gifts</hi> they have received exceeding necessary unto them. And Christ's collation of these <hi>Gifts</hi> unto men, is the foundation of all the <hi>Offices</hi> that under him they are called to discharge. See <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.8, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.21, 22. And as they are the spring and foundation of <hi>Office,</hi> so they are the great and only means of the <hi>Churches edification.</hi> By them Christ builds up his Church, to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure appointed unto the whole and every member of it. And there is no <hi>Member</hi> but hath its <hi>Gift</hi>: which is the Talent <hi>given,</hi> or rather <hi>lent,</hi> to trade withall.</p>
                           <p>Now of all these Christ is the <hi>only Lord,</hi> they belong unto his Kingdom. <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.18. <gap reason="foreign">

of him, with <hi>power over all gifts,</hi> he makes the bottom of the mission of the Apostles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. This he had as a fruit of his suffering, as a part of his purchase, and it is a choice portion of his Lordship and Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>End</hi> also why all these gifts are given into his power and disposal, is evident, 1. The <hi>propagation</hi> of his Gospel, and consequently the setting up of his Kingdom in the world d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>pends upon them. These are the <hi>Arms</hi> that he furnished his Messengers withall, when he sent them forth to <hi>fight</hi> with, to conquer and <hi>subdue</hi> the world unto him. And by these they prevailed. By that Spirit of wisdom and knowledge, prayer, utterance, wherewith they were endowed; attended where, and when needful, with the <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> before mention'd, did they accomplish the work committed unto their charge. Now the Lord Christ having a <hi>right</hi> unto a Kingdom and Inheritance given him, which was actually <hi>under possession of his Adversary,</hi> it was necessary that all those <hi>arms,</hi> wherewith he was to make a conquest of it, should be <hi>given</hi> to his disposal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. These were the <hi>weapons of the warfare</hi> of his Apostles and Disciples, which through God were so <hi>mighty to cast down the strong holds of sin and Sathan.</hi> These are the <hi>slings</hi> and stones, before which the <hi>Goliahs</hi> of the Earth and Hell did fall. This was that <hi>power from above,</hi> which he promised his Apostles to furnish them withall, when they should address themselves to the <hi>conquest of the world, Acts</hi> 1.8. With these weapons, this furniture for their warfare, a <hi>few despised persons</hi> in the eyes of the world, went from <hi>Judea</hi> unto the ends of the earth, subduing all things before them to the obedience of their Lord and Master. And,</p>
                           <p n="2">2. By these is his <hi>Church edified</hi>; and to that end doth he continue to bestow them on men, and will do so to the end of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 13, 14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. And for any to hinder their <hi>growth and exercise,</hi> is what in them lies to pull down the Church of Christ, and to set themselves against that testimony which he gives in the world, that he is <hi>yet alive</hi>; and that he takes care of his Disciples, being present with them according unto his promise.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And by these means and ways is <hi>God glorified</hi> in him and by him which is the great end of his Lordship over all the gifts of the Spirit.</p>
                           <p>That we may a little by the way look into our <hi>especial concernment</hi> in these things, the order of them, and their subserviency one to another, may be briefly considered. For as <hi>Natural gifts</hi> are the foundation of, and lie in an especial subordination unto <hi>Spiritual,</hi> so are <hi>Spiritual gifts</hi> enlivened, made effectual and durable by <hi>Grace.</hi> The principal end of Christ's bestowing <hi>gifts,</hi> is the erection of a <hi>Ministery</hi> in his Church, for the ends before mentioned. And where all these in their order and mutual <hi>subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency unto one another,</hi> are received by any, there, and there alone, is a <hi>competent furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> for the work of the Ministery received. And where any of them, as to their <hi>whole kind,</hi> are wanting, there is a <hi>defect</hi> in the Person, if not a <hi>nullity</hi> as to the Office. <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gifts</hi> and endowments of mind are so necessary a foundation for any that looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the work of the Ministery, that without some <hi>competent measure</hi> of them, it is madness and folly to entertain thoughts of any progress. Unless unto these, <hi>Spiritual gifts</hi> are in Christ's time super-added, the other will be never of any use for the edification of the Church, as having in their own nature and <hi>series,</hi> no especial tendency unto that end. Nor will these super-added <hi>spiritual gifts</hi> enable any man to discharge his duty unto all well-pleasing before God, unless they also are <hi>quickned</hi> and seasoned by Grace.

And this for the most part falleth out, when men either have <hi>abused their natural gifts</hi> to the service of their lusts, and in an <hi>opposition</hi> to the simplicity of the Gospel; or when they set upon <hi>Spiritual things,</hi> and pretend to the service of Christ, meerly in their own strength, without dependance on him, as the Heir and Lord of all, for abilities and furniture for his work; or when they have some <hi>fixed</hi> corrupt end and design to accomplish and bring about by a <hi>pretence of the Ministery,</hi> without regard to the glory

When these <hi>gifts,</hi> in the good pleasure of the Lord of them are super-added unto the <hi>natural endowments</hi> before mentioned, they carry on them, who have received them, cheerfully, comfortably and usefully in their way and progress. The <hi>former</hi> are increased, heightned, strengthned and perfected by the latter, towards that special end, whereunto themselves are designed; namely, the <hi>glory</hi> of Christ in the work of the Gospel. But if these also are not in due season <hi>quickned</hi> by saving grace, if the heart be not <hi>moistned</hi> and made fruitful thereby, even they also will wither and decay.

                           <p n="iv">IV. 3. To close our considerations of this part of the Lordship of Christ, there remains only that we shew him to be the Lord of all <hi>Spiritual Eternal things,</hi> which in one word we call Glory. He is himself the <hi>Lord of glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. and the Judge of all, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25.

                           <p>The <hi>Apostle</hi> in these words gives further <hi>strength</hi> to his present Argument, from another Consideration of the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; wherein he also discovers the foundation of the <hi>Preheminence</hi> ascribed unto him in the words last insisted on. <hi>By him the worlds were made</hi>; so that they were his <hi>own, Joh.</hi> 1.11. and it was meet that in the <hi>new condition</hi> which he underwent, that he should be the <hi>Lord</hi> of them all. Moreover, if all things be <hi>made by him,</hi> all disobedience unto him is certainly most <hi>unreasonable,</hi> and will be attended with inevitable ruine; of the Truth whereof, the <hi>Apostle</hi> aims to convince the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>

                           <p>Now whereas the <hi>Assertion</hi> which presents its self at first view in these words is such, as if we rightly apprehend the meaning of the Holy Ghost in it, must needs <hi>determine</hi> the Controversie that the <hi>Apostle</hi> had with the Jews, and is of great use and importance unto the faith of the Saints in all ages, I shall first free the words from <hi>false glosses</hi> and interpretations, and then <hi>explain the Truth</hi> asserted in them, both absolutely, and with relation to the present purpose of the Apostle.</p>
                           <p>That which some men design in their wresting of this place, is to deface the <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Testimony</hi> given in it unto the <hi>Eternal Deity</hi> of the Son of God; and to this purpose they proceed variously.</p>

                           <p n="5">5. His last refuge is, in Isa. 51.16. <hi>Where the work of God, as he observes, in the reduction of the people of the Jews from the Captivity of</hi> Babylon, <hi>is called his planting the Heavens, and laying the foundation of the Earth: And the Vulgar Latin Translation, as he farther observes, renders the word,</hi> ut corlum plantes, ut terram fundes, <hi>ascribing that to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet which he did but declare; and in this sense he contends, that God the Father is said to make the worlds by his Son. Answ.</hi> 1. The work mentioned is not that which God would do in the reduction of the people from <hi>Babylon,</hi> but that which he had done in their delivery from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> recorded to strengthen the faith of Believers in what for the future he would yet do for them. 2. The expressions <hi>of planting the Heavens, and laying the foundation of the Earth,</hi> are in this place of the Prophet plainly, <hi>Allegorical,</hi> and are in the very same place declared so to be. First, In the circumstance of time when this work is said to be wrought, namely, at the coming of the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when the Heavens and the Earth properly so called, could not be made, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, founded, or created. Secondly, By an adjoyned Exposition of the Allegory, <hi>I have put my words into thy mouth, and said unto</hi> Zion, <hi>thou art my people</hi>: This was his planting of the Heavens, and laying the foundation of the Earth, even the erection of a Church and Political State amongst the <hi>Israelites.</hi> 3. It is not to the Prophet; but to the Church that the words are spoken, and <gap reason="foreign">

There is not then, any similitude between that place of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> wherein words are used <hi>Allegorically,</hi> (the Allegory in them being instantly explained;) and this of the <hi>Apostle</hi> whose discourse is <hi>didactical,</hi> and the words used in it, <hi>proper,</hi> and suited to the things intended by him to be expressed. And this is the substance of what is pleaded to wrest from believers this <hi>illustrious</hi> Testimony given to the <hi>eternal Deity</hi> of the Son of God. We may yet further consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reasons that offer themselves from the <hi>Context</hi> for the removal of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation suggested.</p>

The Apostle intending to set out the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the Son of God, affirms that <hi>by him the worlds were made</hi>; that is, say they, <hi>Christ preaching the Gospel converted some to the faith of it, and many more were converted by the Apostles preaching the same Doctrine, whereupon blessed times of Light and Salvation ensued.</hi> Who not overpowered with <hi>prejudice</hi> could once imagine any such sense in these words? especially considering that it is as contrary to the <hi>design</hi> of the Apostle, as it is to the <hi>importance</hi> of the words themselves. This is that which <hi>Peter</hi> calls, mens <hi>wresting the Scripture</hi> to their own perdition.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Apostle as we observed, writes <hi>didactically,</hi> plainly expressing the matter whereof he treats, in words usual and proper. To what end then should he use so <hi>strained an Allegory</hi> in a point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> yea, a fundamental Article of the Religion he taught, and that to express what he had immediately in the words foregoing properly expressed; For, <hi>by whom he made the worlds,</hi> is no more in these mens apprehensions, than, <hi>in him hath he spoken in these latter dayes.</hi> Nor is this Expression any where used, no not in the most <hi>allegorical</hi> Prophecies of the Old Testament, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note that which here they would wrest it unto. But <hi>making of the world,</hi> signifies, <hi>making of the World,</hi> in the whole Scripture throughout, and nothing else.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The <hi>making of the worlds</hi> here intended, was a thing then past; <gap reason="foreign">

But now that which the <hi>Jews</hi> called the <hi>world to come,</hi> or the blessed state of the Church under the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Apostle speaks of, as of that which was not yet come; the <hi>present worldly</hi> State of the Judaical Church yet continuing.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Thus the <hi>Apostle</hi> having declared the Honour of the Son as Mediator, in that he was made <hi>Heir of all,</hi> adds thereunto his <hi>Excellency in himself</hi> from his eternal power and Godhead; which he not only asserts, but gives evidence unto by an Argument from the works of Creation. And to avoid all <hi>streightning thoughts</hi> of this work, he expresseth it in terms comprehending the whole Creation in that distribution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it was usually cast by themselves: As <hi>John</hi> contents not himself by affirming that he <hi>made all things,</hi> but adds to that Assertion, that <hi>without him nothing was made that was made, Joh.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                           <p>And this was of old the <hi>common faith</hi> of the Judaical Church. That all things were made, and all things disposed by the <hi>Word</hi> of God, they all confessed. Evident footsteps of this faith abide still in their <hi>Targums.</hi> For that by the <hi>Word of God</hi> so often mentioned in them they did not understand the <hi>Word of his Power,</hi> but an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis</hi> in the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> is manifest from the <hi>Personal Properties</hi> which are every where assigned unto it; as the Word of God, <hi>did</hi> this, <hi>said</hi> that, <hi>thought, went,</hi> and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50110:195"/>
like; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.17. They affirm that <hi>Word,</hi> which gave the <hi>Law</hi> on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> to <hi>dwell in the highest heavens.</hi> Yea, and they say in <hi>Bereschit Rabba,</hi> of those words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2.

                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                              <hi>this is the Spirit of the King Messiah</hi>; by which they cannot deny but that all things were formed. And the Apostle in this expression lets the <hi>Hebrews</hi> know, that <hi>Jesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> was that Word of God, <hi>by whom all things were made.</hi> And so the influence of these words into his <hi>present Argument</hi> is manifest. For the <hi>Son,</hi> in whom the <hi>Father</hi> had now spoken to them, and declared the Gospel, being his <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> by whom the world and all Ages were created, there could be no question of his Authority to alter their <hi>ceremonious Worship,</hi> which he himself had appointed for a season.</p>
                           <p>Before we pass to the next Verses, we may mark out those <hi>Instructions,</hi> which the words passed through afford us in common, as to the abiding interest of all Believers.</p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>The foundation of them is,</hi> That the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of his Church under the New Testament, the only Revealer of the Will of the Father, as the Son and Wisdom of God, made the Worlds, and all things contained in them. <hi>And therein,</hi>
                           </q>
                           <p n="1">1. We have an illustrious testimony given to the <hi>Eternal Godhead</hi> and Power of the Son of God; for he who made all things is God, as the Apostle else-where affirms. And,</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Unto the <hi>Equity</hi> of his being made <hi>Heir,</hi> Lord and Judge of all. No creature can decline the Authority, or wave the Tribunal of him that <hi>made them all.</hi> And,</p>
                           <p n="3">3. A stable bottom of Faith, <hi>Hope, Contentment</hi> and Patience, is administred unto the Saints in all dispensations. He who is their Redeemer, that bought them, hath all that interest in all things wherein they are concerned, that the Sovereign right of Creation can afford unto him; besides that <hi>Grant</hi> which is made unto him for this very end, that they might be disposed of to his own <hi>Glory,</hi> in their good and advantage, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. And,</p>
                           <p n="4">4. From this Order of things, that Christ as the <hi>Eternal Son</hi> of God having made the worlds, hath them and all things in them put under his power as Mediator and Head of the Church; we may see what a <hi>subserviency</hi> to the interest of the Saints of the most High, the whole <hi>Creation</hi> is laid and disposed in. And,</p>
                           <p n="5">5. The way of obtaining a <hi>sanctified Interest</hi> in, and use of the things of the <hi>Old Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; namely, not to receive them meerly on the <hi>general account</hi> as made by the Son of God, but on the more especial of their being <hi>granted</hi> unto him, as Mediator of the Church. And,</p>
                           <p n="6">6. How men on both these foundations, are to be <hi>accountable</hi> for their <hi>use</hi> or <hi>abuse</hi> of the things of the first Creation.</p>
                           <p>But besides these <hi>particular Instances,</hi> there is that which is more general, and which we may a little insist upon from the <hi>Context</hi> and design of the Apostle in this whole discourse, whose consideration will not again <hi>occur</hi> unto us; and it is, <hi>That God in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wisdom ordered all things in the first Creation, so as that the whole of that work might be subservient to the glory of his grace in the new creation of all by Jesus Christ.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>By the Son he made the worlds in the <hi>beginning</hi> of time, that in the <hi>fulness</hi> of time he might be the <hi>just Heir</hi> and Lord of all. The <hi>Jews</hi> have a saying, that <hi>the world was made for the Messiah</hi>; which is thus far true, that both it, and all things in it, were made, disposed of, and <hi>ordered</hi> in their Creation, so as that God might be everlastingly glorified in the <hi>work</hi> which he was designed unto, and which by him he had to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish. I shall consider it only in the present instance; namely, that by the Son he <hi>made the worlds,</hi> that he might be the <hi>proper Heir and Lord of them</hi>: of which latter we shall treat more particularly on the ensuing words.</p>
                           <p>This was declared of <hi>Old,</hi> where he was spoken of as the <hi>Wisdom of God,</hi> by whom he wrought in the <hi>Creation</hi> and Production of all things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. This <hi>Son,</hi> or Wisdom of God, declares at large, 1. His <hi>Coexistence</hi> with his Father from Eternity, before all, or any of the <hi>visible</hi> or <hi>invisible</hi> Creation were by his Power brought forth, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, and so onward. And then sets forth the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, Eternal and <hi>Ineffable Delight,</hi> that was between him and his Father, both <hi>before,</hi> and also <hi>in</hi> the work of Creation, <hi>v.</hi> 30. Farther, he declares his <hi>presence</hi> and <hi>co-operation</hi> with him in the whole work of making the world, and the several parts of it, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28, 29, 30. which in other, places is expressed as here by the Apostle, that God by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50110:196"/>
him made the worlds. After which he declares the <hi>End</hi> of all this Dispensation, namely, that he might <hi>rejoyce in the habitable parts of the earth, and his delight be with the sons of men</hi>; to whom therefore he calls to hearken unto him, that they may be blessed, <hi>v.</hi> 31. to the <hi>end of the chapter</hi>; that is, that he might be <hi>meet</hi> to accomplish the work of their Redemption, and bring them to <hi>Blessedness,</hi> to the Glory of the Grace of God; which work his heart was set upon, and which he greatly <hi>delighted</hi> in, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.6, 7, 8.</p>
                           <p>Hence the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> in the beginning of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> brings both the <hi>Creations</hi> together; the first by the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> absolutely; the other by him as <hi>incarnate,</hi> that the Suitableness and <hi>Correspondency</hi> of all things in them, might be evident. The <hi>Word was with God,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the beginning,</hi> and <hi>all things were made by him,</hi> and without him <hi>was not any thing made that was made,</hi> v. 1, 2, 3. But what was this unto the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> that he undertook to declare? Yes, very much; for it appears from hence, that when <hi>this Word</hi> was <hi>made flesh,</hi> and came and <hi>dwelt among us, v.</hi> 14. that he came into the world that <hi>was made by him,</hi> though it knew him not, <hi>v.</hi> 10. he came but <hi>to his own,</hi> what ever were the entertainment that he receeived, <hi>v.</hi> 11. For this End then God <hi>made all things by him,</hi> that when he came to change and <hi>renew</hi> all things, he might have <hi>good right and title</hi> so to do, seeing he undertook to deal with, or about, no more but what he had <hi>originally</hi> made.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Holy and Blessed Trinity</hi> could have so ordered the work of Creation, as that it should not immediately, eminently, and signally have been the work of the <hi>Son,</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Word.</hi> But there was a farther <hi>design</hi> upon the world to be accomplished by him, and therefore the work was <hi>signally</hi> to be his; that is, as to <hi>immediate Operation,</hi> though as to <hi>Authority and Order</hi> it peculiarly belonged to the <hi>Father</hi>; and to the <hi>Spirit</hi> as to <hi>Disposition</hi> and Ornament, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Job</hi> 26.13.</p>
                           <p>This, I say, was done, for the <hi>End</hi> mentioned by the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.10. All things at <hi>first</hi> were made by him; that when they were <hi>lost, ruined, scattered,</hi> they might again in the appointed season be <hi>gathered together</hi> into one head in him; of which place more at large else-where.</p>
                           <p>And this mysterie of the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, the Apostle at large unfoldeth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Speaking of the <hi>Son</hi> by whom we have <hi>Redemption,</hi> he informs us, that in himself and his own nature, he is the <hi>Image of the invisible God</hi>; that is, of <hi>God the Father,</hi> who until then had alone been clearly <hi>revealed</hi> unto them; and that in respect of other things he is the <hi>first-born of every creature,</hi> or as he terms himself, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.14. the <hi>Beginning of the creation of God</hi>; that is, he who is <hi>before all creatures,</hi> and gave <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> to the Creation of God. For so expresly the Apostle explains himself in the next verses. <hi>By him all things were created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</hi> But this is not the full design of the Apostle. He declares not only that <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> but also that <hi>All things were made for him,</hi> v. 16. so made for him, that he might be the <hi>Head of the Body the Church</hi>; that is, that he might be the <hi>fountain,</hi> head, spring, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the <hi>new Creation,</hi> as he had been of the Old. So the Apostle declares in the next words, <hi>Who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead.</hi> As he was the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and the <hi>First-b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>rn</hi> of every creature in the old Creation, so he is the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>First-born</hi> from the dead; that is, the <hi>Original</hi> and Cause of the whole <hi>new Creation.</hi> And hereunto he subjoyns the <hi>End</hi> and design of God in this whole mysterious work, which was, that the Son might <hi>have the preheminence in all things</hi>; as he had in and over the works of the <hi>old Creation,</hi> seeing they were all made by him, and all <hi>consist</hi> in him; so also he hath over the <hi>New</hi> on the same account, being the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>First-born</hi> of them. The Apostle in these words gives us the whole of what we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, namely, that the <hi>making of the worlds,</hi> and of all things in them, in the first Creation by the Son, was peculiarly <hi>subservient</hi> to the Glory of the Grace of God, in the Reparation and <hi>Renovation</hi> of all things by him as incarnate.</p>
                           <p>It is not for us to enquire <hi>much</hi> into, or after the reason of this <hi>Oeconomy</hi> and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation; we cannot by <hi>searching find out God, we cannot find out the Almighty unto perfection, Job</hi> 11.7. It may suffice us, that he disposeth of all things according <hi>to the counsel of his own will, Ephes.</hi> 1.12. This <hi>Antecedently</hi> unto the consideration of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, we cannot, we may not <hi>search</hi> into, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. What are the Effects and <hi>Consequences</hi> of his infinitely holy wise Counsel, wherein his Glory shines forth unto his Creatures, those we may <hi>consider</hi> and contemplate on, and rejoyce in the <hi>light</hi> that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50110:196"/>
they will afford us, into the <hi>treasures</hi> of these counsels themselves.</p>
                           <p>Now herein we see, first, that it was the <hi>Eternal Design</hi> of God, that the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation should be put in subjection unto the <hi>Word incarnate,</hi> whereof the Apostle also treats in the <hi>second Chapter</hi> of this <hi>Epistle.</hi> God hath highly exalted him, and given him <hi>a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father, Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. God hath put <hi>all things</hi> in subjection unto him, not only the things peculiarly redeemed by him, but <hi>all things what ever,</hi> as we shall shew in the <hi>next words</hi> of our Epistle. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11. Hence <hi>John</hi> saw <hi>every creature which is in heaven and earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, even all that are in them, ascribing blessing, and honour, and glory, and power unto the Lamb for ever and ever, Rev.</hi> 5.13. that is, owning and avowing their Duty, Obedience and Subjection unto him. This being <hi>designed</hi> of God in the Eternal Counsel of his Will, before the world was, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. He prepared and made way for it in the <hi>Creation of all things by him</hi>; so that his <hi>Title</hi> and right to be the Ruler and <hi>Lord</hi> of all Angels and Men, the whole Creation, in and of <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> might be laid in this great and blessed foundation, that <hi>he made them all.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Again, God <hi>designed</hi> from Eternity, that his great and everlasting Glory should arise from the <hi>new Creation,</hi> and the work thereof. Herein hath he <hi>ordered all things to the praise of the glory of his grace, Ephes.</hi> 1.6. And this praise will he inhabit for ever. It is true, the works of the <hi>old Creation</hi> did set forth the <hi>glory of God, Psal.</hi> 19.1. they manifested his <hi>eternal power and Godhead, Rom.</hi> 1.20. But God had not resolved, ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately to commit the <hi>manifestation of his glory</hi> unto those works, though very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and therefore did he suffer <hi>sin</hi> to enter into the world, which stained the beauty of it, and brought it wholly under the curse. But he never suffered <hi>spot</hi> nor <hi>stain</hi> to come upon the work of the new Creation, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.6. nothing that might defeat, <hi>eclipse,</hi> or impair the glory that he intended to exalt himself in thereby. Yet God hath so <hi>ultimately</hi> laid up his glory in the <hi>new Creation,</hi> as that he will not lose any thing of that, which also is due unto him from the <hi>Old</hi>: but yet he will not receive it <hi>immediately</hi> from thence neither; but as it is put over into a <hi>subserviency</hi> unto the work of the New. Now God ordered all things so, as that this might be <hi>effected</hi> without <hi>force, coaction,</hi> or wresting of the Creation, or putting it besides its own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And is there any thing more <hi>genuine,</hi> natural and proper, than that the world should come into <hi>subjection</hi> unto him, by whom it was made, although there be some <hi>alteration</hi> in its state and condition, as to outward <hi>dispensation,</hi> in his being <hi>made Man?</hi> And this I take to be the meaning of that <hi>discourse</hi> of the Apostle about the <hi>bondage</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> of the creature, which we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, 21, 22. The Apostle tells us, that the <hi>Creature it self</hi> had an expectation, and desire after the Manifestation of the Sons of God, or the bringing forth of the Kingdom of Christ in Glory and Power, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and gives this reason for it, because it is brought into a condition <hi>of vanity, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> and <hi>bondage</hi>; wherein it did, as it were, unwillingly abide, and <hi>groaned</hi> to be delivered from it; that is, by the <hi>entrance</hi> of sin, the Creation was brought into that condition, as wherein it could not answer the end for which it was <hi>made</hi> and erected; namely, to declare the <hi>glory of God,</hi> that he might be worshipped and honoured as God; but was, as it were, left, especially in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the Inhabitants of it, to be a <hi>stage</hi> for men to act their enmity against God upon, and a means for the fulfilling and satisfaction of their filthy lusts. This state being unsuitable unto its <hi>primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> preternatural, occasional, and forced, it is said to <hi>dislike it,</hi> to <hi>groan</hi> under it, to hope for <hi>Deliverance</hi>; doing that in what it is, by its nature, which it would do <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily</hi> were it endowed with a rational understanding. But, saith the Apostle, there is a better condition for this <hi>Creation</hi>; which whilst it was afar of, it <hi>put out its head</hi> after and unto. What is this better state? Why the <hi>glorious liberty of the Sons of God</hi>; that is, the new state and condition that all things are <hi>restored unto,</hi> in order unto the glory of God, by Jesus Christ. The Creation hath, as it were, a <hi>natural propensity,</hi> yea, a longing to come into a <hi>subjection</hi> unto Christ, as that which <hi>retrieves</hi> and frees it from the <hi>Vanity,</hi> Bondage and Corruption that it was cast into, when put out of its first <hi>Order</hi> by sin. And this ariseth from that <hi>plot and design</hi> which God first laid in the <hi>Creation</hi> of all things; that they being made by the Son, should <hi>naturally</hi> and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, as it were, give up themselves unto Obedience unto him, when he should take the <hi>Rule</hi> of them upon the new account of his Mediation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50110:197"/>Thirdly, God would hereby instruct us, both in the <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>se</hi> that we are to make of <hi>his creatures,</hi> and the <hi>improvement</hi> that we are to make of the work of the Creation unto his glory. For the first, it is his Will that we should not <hi>use</hi> any thing as meerly made and created by him, though originally for that purpose; seeing as they are so left, they are under the <hi>curse,</hi> and so <hi>impure</hi> and <hi>unclean</hi> unto them that use them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. But he would have us to look upon them, and receive them as they are given over unto Christ. For the Apostle in his Application of the <hi>eighth Psalm</hi> unto the Lord Christ, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. manifests, that even the <hi>beasts of the field,</hi> on which we live, are passed over in a peculiar manner unto his Dominion. And he lays our interest in their <hi>use</hi> as to a <hi>clear,</hi> profitable, and sanctified way of it, in the new state of things brought in by Christ. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, if it be received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</hi> The word of <hi>promise</hi> confirmed in Christ, called on by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> given by Christ in prayer, gives a <hi>sanctified use</hi> of the creatures. This God instructs us in, namely to look for a profitable sanctified <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>se</hi> of the creatures in Christ, in that himself ordered them in the very <hi>first Creation,</hi> to fall at length <hi>naturally</hi> under his Rule and Dominion, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all by him. And hereby also we are instructed how to <hi>learn</hi> the glory of God from them. The whole mystery of laying the <hi>works of the old Creation</hi> in a subserviency unto the New, being <hi>hidden</hi> from many Ages and Generations, from the foundation of the world men did by the Effects and works which they saw, conclude, that there was an <hi>Eternal Power and Infinite Wisdom,</hi> whereby they were produced. But whereas there is but a <hi>two-fold holy</hi> use of the works of the Creation, the one suited unto the <hi>state of Innocency,</hi> and the moral natural Worship of God therein, which they had lost; the other, to the <hi>state of Grace,</hi> and the Worship of God in that, which they had not attained, the world and the inhabitants thereof being otherwise involved in the <hi>Curse and Darkness</hi> wherewith it was attended, exercised themselves in <hi>fruitless speculations</hi> about them, (foolish <hi>imaginations,</hi> as the Apostle calls them) and glorified not God in any due manner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. Neither do, nor <hi>can</hi> men unto this day make any better improvement of their contemplation on the <hi>Works of Creation,</hi> who are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Recapitulation</hi> of all things in Christ, and the Beauty of it; in that all things at first were made by him. But when men shall by faith perceive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the <hi>Production</hi> of all things owes it self, in its first original, unto the Son of God, in that by him the world was made, and that unto this End and Purpose, that he being afterwards <hi>Incarnate</hi> for our Redemption, they might all be put into <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> unto him, they cannot but be ravished with the Admiration of the Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodness, and Love of God, in this holy, wise, <hi>beautiful disposition</hi> of all his works and ways. And this is the very subject of the <hi>Eighth Psalm.</hi> The <hi>Psalmist</hi> considers the <hi>Excellency and Glory</hi> of God in the Creation of all things, instancing in the most glorious and eminent parts of it. But doth he do this <hi>absolutely,</hi> as they are such? doth he rest there? No, but proceeds to manifest the cause of his <hi>Admiration,</hi> in that God did of old design, and would at length actually put, all these things into <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> unto the Man Christ Jesus; as the Apostle expounds his meaning, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. which causeth him to renew his Admiration and praise, <hi>v.</hi> 9. that is, to <hi>glorifie God,</hi> as God, and to be thankful; which yet <hi>Paul</hi> declared that they were not, who considered the works of God only <hi>absolutely,</hi> with reference to their first <hi>Original</hi> from infinite Power and Wisdom.</p>
                           <p>But against what we have been <hi>discoursing,</hi> it may be objected, that God in the <hi>Creation</hi> of all things suited them perfectly and <hi>absolutely</hi> unto a state of Innocency and Holiness, without any respect unto the <hi>entrance</hi> of sin, and the curse that ensued, which gave <hi>Occasion</hi> to that infinitely wise and holy work of the <hi>Mediation</hi> of Christ, and the Restoration of all things by him; so that they could not be laid in such a <hi>subserviency</hi> and Order, one to the other, as is pretended: though the <hi>former</hi> might be afterwards traduced, and <hi>translated</hi> into the use of the other. But,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. What is clearly <hi>testified</hi> unto in the Scripture, as that truth is, which we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on, is not to be called into question, because we cannot understand the <hi>Order</hi> and method of things in the hidden Counsels of God. <hi>Such knowledge is too wonderful for us.</hi> Neither do we benefit our selves much by <hi>inquiring</hi> into that which we cannot comprehend. It is enough for us, that we hold fast <hi>revealed things,</hi> that we may know and do the will of God; but <hi>secret things</hi> belong to him; and to him are they to be left.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Scripture testifieth, that <hi>Known unto God are all his works from the foundation
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50110:197"/>
of the world, Acts</hi> 15.18. Not only all those, which at <hi>first</hi> he wrought, but also all that ever he would so do. The <hi>Idea</hi> and <hi>System</hi> of them was all in his Holy Mind from Eternity. Now though in their creation and <hi>production</hi> they are all singly suited and fitted, to the <hi>time</hi> and season wherein they are brought forth and made, yet as they <hi>lye all together</hi> in the Mind, Will, and Purpose of God, they have a Relation one to another, from the <hi>first</hi> to the last. There is an <hi>Harmony</hi> and correspondency between them all; they lye all in a blessed subserviency in themselves, and in their respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one another, unto the <hi>Promotion</hi> of the Glory of God. And therefore though in the <hi>Creation of all things,</hi> that work was suited unto the state and condition wherein they were created, that is, of <hi>Innocency</hi> and Holiness; yet this hinders not, but that God might and did so <hi>order</hi> them, that they might have a respect unto that <hi>future work</hi> of his in their Restauration by Christ, which was then no less <hi>known</hi> unto him, than that which was perfectly wrought.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The most reasonable and best <hi>intelligible</hi> Way of declaring the Order of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, is that which casts them under the <hi>two general heads,</hi> which all rational Agents respect in their Purposes and Operations; namely, of the <hi>last End,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thereunto. Now the <hi>utmost End of God</hi> in all his wayes towards the Sons of men, being the <hi>Manifestation of his own Glory</hi> by the way of Mercy and Justice, what ever <hi>tendeth</hi> thereunto, is all jointly to be looked on, as one <hi>entire means</hi> tending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>End</hi> and purpose. The works therefore of the Old and <hi>New Creation</hi> being of this sort and nature, one joint and general <hi>means</hi> for the compassing of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned end, nothing can hinder but that they may have that <hi>respect to each other,</hi> which before we have declared.</p>

                        <p>THe Apostle proceeds in his Description of the <hi>Person</hi> in whom God spake in the Revelation of the Gospel; ascending unto such a manifestation of him, as that they might understand his <hi>Eminency</hi> above all formerly used in the like Ministrations; as also how he was pointed out and <hi>shaddowed</hi> by sundry Types and Figures under the Old Testament.</p>

The <hi>Things</hi> intended are unquestionably <hi>sublime</hi> and <hi>Mysterious.</hi> The <hi>Terms</hi> wherein they are expressed are <hi>rare,</hi> and no where else used in the Scripture to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; some of them not at all, which deprives us of one great help in the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them. The <hi>Metaphors</hi> used in the Words, or <hi>Types</hi> alluded unto by them, are abstruse and dark; so that the difficulty of discovering the true, precise, and genuine meaning of the Holy Ghost in them is such, as that this verse, at least some part of it, may well be reckoned among those places which the Lord hath left in his Word, to <hi>exercise</hi> our Faith and Diligence and Dependance on his Spirit, for a right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of them. It may be indeed, that from what was known and acknowledged in the <hi>Judaical</hi> Church, the whole intention of the Apostle was more plain unto them, and more plainly and clearly delivered, than now it seemeth unto us to be,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50110:199"/>
who are deprived of their Advantages. However both to them and us, the things were and are <hi>deep</hi> and Mysterious. And we shall desire to handle, (as it becometh us) both Things and Words with Reverence and Godly fear, looking up unto him for Assistance, who alone can lead us into all Truth.</p>
                        <p>We begin with the <hi>double Description</hi> given us of the Lord Christ at the entrance of the Verse, as to <hi>What he is</hi> in himself; and here a double Difficulty presents it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; First, In general unto <hi>what Nature</hi> in Christ, or unto <hi>what of Christ,</hi> this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription doth belong: Secondly, what is the <hi>particular meaning</hi> and importance of the Words or Expressions themselves.</p>
                        <p>For the First, Some assert, that these words intend only the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> of Christ, wherein he is <hi>Consubstantial</hi> with his Father. Herein as he is said to be, <hi>God of God,</hi> and <hi>Light of Light,</hi> (an expression doubtless taken from hence) receiving as the Son his Nature and subsistence from the Father, so fully and absolutely as that he is every way the same with him in respect of his Essence, and every way <hi>like him</hi> in respect of his Person; so he is said to be the <hi>brightness of his Glory,</hi> and the <hi>Character of his Person</hi> on that account. This way went the Antients generally; and of Modern Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors very many; as <hi>Calvin, Brentius, Marlorat, Rollocus, Gomarus, Paraeus, Estius, Tena, A Lapide, Rihera,</hi> and sundry others.</p>
                        <p>Some think that the Apostle speaks of him as <hi>Incarnate</hi>; as he is declared in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, or as preached to be the <hi>Image of the invisible God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. And these take three wayes in the <hi>Explication</hi> of the words, and their <hi>Application</hi> of them unto him.</p>
                        <p>First, Some affirm that their meaning is, that whereas God is in himself <hi>infinite and incomprehensible,</hi> so that we are not able to contemplate on his Excellencies, but that we are overpowred in our minds with their Glory and Majesty, he hath in Christ the Son as incarnate, <hi>contemperated</hi> his infinite Love, Power, Goodness, Grace, Greatness and Holiness, unto our Faith, Love and Contemplation, they all shining forth in him, and being eminently expressed in him; so <hi>Beza.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Some think that the Apostle pursues the Description that he was entered upon of the <hi>Kingly Office of Jesus Christ,</hi> as <hi>Heir</hi> of all; and that his being exalted in Glory unto Power, Rule and Dominion, expressing and representing therein the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Father, is intended in these words; so <hi>Camero.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Some refer these words to the <hi>Prophetical Office of Christ</hi>; and say that he was the <hi>Brightness of Gods Glory, &amp;c.</hi> by his revealing and declaring of the Will of God unto us, which before was done darkly only, and in shadows. So the <hi>Socinians</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; though <hi>Schlictingius</hi> refer the Words unto all that <hi>similitude,</hi> which they fancy to have been between God, and the man Christ Jesus, whilest he was in the earth; and therefore renders the <hi>Participle</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, not by the <hi>present,</hi> but <hi>praeterimperfect tense; who was,</hi> that is, whilest he was on the Earth, though as he sayes, not exclusively unto what he is now in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>I shall not examine in particular the Reasons that are alledged for these several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations; but only propose and confirm <hi>that sense</hi> of the place, which on full and due consideration, appears, as agreeable unto the <hi>Analogie</hi> of Faith, so expresly to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the <hi>Design</hi> and intendment of the Apostle; wherein also, the unsoundness of the two last branches or wayes of applying the second Interpretation, with the <hi>real coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence</hi> of the first, and first branch of the latter Exposition, will be discovered. To this End the following <hi>Positions</hi> are to be observed.</p>
                        <p>First, It is not the direct and immediate design of the <hi>Apostle</hi> to treat absolutely of <hi>either Nature</hi> of Christ, his Divine or Humane; but only of his <hi>Person.</hi> Hence though the <hi>things</hi> which he mentioneth and expresseth, may some of them belong unto, or be the Properties of <hi>his Divine Nature,</hi> some of his <hi>Humane,</hi> yet none of them are spoken of <hi>as such,</hi> but are all considered as belonging unto his <hi>Person.</hi> And this solves that difficulty which <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observes in the Words, and strives to remove by a <hi>similitude</hi>; namely, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth not observe any Order or Method, in speaking of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Natures of Christ distinctly one after another; but first speaks of the one, then of the other, and then returns again to the former, and that frequently: But the Truth is, he intends not to speak directly, and absolutely of <hi>either nature</hi> of Christ; but treating <hi>ex professo</hi> of his Person, some things that he mentions concerning him, have a special <hi>Foundation</hi> in, and respect unto his <hi>Divine Nature</hi>; some in and unto his <hi>Humane,</hi> as must every thing that is spoken of him. And therefore the Method and Order of the <hi>Apostle</hi> is not to be enquired after in what relates in his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50110:199"/>
expressions to this or that Nature of Christ, but in the <hi>Progress</hi> that he makes in the description of his <hi>Person</hi> and Offices, which alone he had undertaken.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That which the <hi>Apostle</hi> principally intends in and about the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, is to set forth his <hi>Dignity, Preeminence,</hi> and Exaltation above all; and that not only <hi>consequentially,</hi> to his discharge of the Office of Mediator, but also <hi>antecedently,</hi> in his worth, fitness, ability and suitedness to undertake and discharge it, which in a great measure depended on, and flowed from his Divine Nature.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. These things being supposed, we observe thirdly, That as these Expressions are none of them <hi>singly,</hi> much less in that <hi>conjunction</hi> wherein they are here placed, used concerning any other but Christ only; so they do plainly contain and express things that are more <hi>sublime</hi> and glorious, than can by the Rule of Scripture, or the <hi>Analogy</hi> of faith, be ascribed unto any <hi>meer creature,</hi> however used or exalted. There is in the word evidently a <hi>comparison</hi> with God the Father; he is <hi>infinitely glorious,</hi> Eternally subsisting in his own Person; and the Son is the <hi>brightness of his glory,</hi> and the <hi>express image of his person.</hi> Angels are called the <hi>sons</hi> of God, are mighty in power, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in created glory; but when they come to be compared with God, it is said they are not <hi>pure in his sight, and he chargeth them with folly; Job</hi> 4.18. And they cover their faces at the <hi>brightness of his glory, Isa.</hi> 6.2. So that they cannot be said <hi>so</hi> to be. Man also was created in the <hi>image of God,</hi> and is again by grace renewed thereunto, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.23, 24. But to say a man is the <hi>express image of the Person of God the Father,</hi> is to depress the glory of God by <hi>Anthropomorphism.</hi> So that unto God asking that question, <hi>Whom will ye compare unto me, and whom will you liken me unto?</hi> we cannot answer of any one who is not God by nature, that he is the <hi>brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Though the design of the Apostle in general be to shew how the <hi>Father</hi> expressed and declared himself unto us in the <hi>Son</hi>; yet this could not be done without manifesting what the Son is in himself, and in reference unto the Father, which <hi>both the expressions</hi> do in the first place declare. They express him <hi>such an one,</hi> as in whom the infinite Perfections and Excellencies of God are revealed unto us. So that the first Application of the words, namely to the <hi>Divine Nature of Christ,</hi> and the first Branch of the second, considering him as <hi>incarnate,</hi> are very well consistent; as <hi>A Lapide</hi> grants, after he had <hi>blamed Beza</hi> for his interpretation. The first direction then given unto our faith in these words, is, by what the Son is in respect of the Father, namely, the <hi>Brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person</hi>; whence it follows, that in him being incarnate, the Fathers glory and his person are e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>essed and manifested unto us.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, There is nothing in these words that is not <hi>applicable</hi> unto the Divine Nature of Christ. Some, as we have shewed, suppose that it is not that which is peculiarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the words; but yet they can give no reason from them, nor manifest any thing denoted by them, which may not be <hi>conveniently applied</hi> thereunto. I say, what ever can be proved to be signified by them, or contained in them, if we will keep our selves within the bounds of that holy reverence which becomes us in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Majesty of God, may be <hi>applied</hi> unto the Nature of God as existing in the person of the Son. He is in his Person <hi>distinct</hi> from the Father, another, not the Father, but yet the <hi>same</hi> in Nature, and this in all glorious Properties and Excellencies. This <hi>Oneness</hi> in Nature, and <hi>Distinction</hi> in Person, may be well shadowed out by these Expressions, <hi>He is the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person.</hi> The Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Curiosity of the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and some others, in expressing the <hi>way</hi> and manner of the Generation of the Son, by similitudes of our <hi>understanding</hi> and its Acts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring how he is the <hi>Image of the Father</hi> in their terms, are intollerable, and full of offence. Nor are the <hi>rigid impositions</hi> of those Words and Terms, in this matter which they, or others, have found out to express it by, of any better nature. Yet I confess, that supposing with some, that by the first expression here used, <hi>the brightness of glory,</hi> the Apostle intends to set forth unto us the <hi>Relation</hi> of the Son to the Father, by an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion unto the <hi>Sun</hi> and its <hi>Beams,</hi> or the Light of Fire in Iron, some relief may thence be given unto our <hi>weak understandings</hi> in the Contemplation of this Mysterie, if we observe that one known Rule, whose use <hi>Chrysostome</hi> urgeth in this place, namely, that in the use of such <hi>Allusions,</hi> every thing of imperfection is to be removed in their Application unto God. A few instances we may give unto this purpose, holding our selves unto an Allusion to the <hi>Sun</hi> and its <hi>Beams.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. As the <hi>Sun</hi> in comparison of the <hi>Beam</hi> is of it self, and the <hi>Beam</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi>; so
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50110:200"/>
is the Father of himself, and the Son of the Father. 2. As the <hi>Sun,</hi> without diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or partition of its substance, without change or alteration in its nature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the <hi>Beam</hi>; so is the Son <hi>begotten</hi> of the Father. 3. As the <hi>Sun</hi> in Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is before the <hi>Beam,</hi> but in time both are coexistent; so is the Father in Order of Nature before the Son, though in Existence both Coeternal. 4. As the <hi>Beam</hi> is distinct from the <hi>Sun,</hi> so that the <hi>Sun</hi> is not the <hi>Beam,</hi> and the <hi>Beam</hi> is not the <hi>Sun</hi>; so is it between the Father and the Son. 5. As the <hi>Beam</hi> is never separated from the <hi>Sun,</hi> nor can the <hi>Sun</hi> be without the <hi>Beam</hi>; no more can the Son be from the Father, nor was the Father ever without the Son. 6. As the <hi>Sun</hi> cannot be seen but by the <hi>Beam,</hi> no more can the Father but in and by the Son.</p>
                        <p>I acknowledge that these things are <hi>true,</hi> and that there is nothing in them disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto the <hi>Analogy</hi> of faith. But yet as sundry other things may be affirmed of the <hi>Sun</hi> and its <hi>Beam,</hi> whereof no tollerable Application can be made to the matter in hand; so I am not perswaded that the <hi>Apostle</hi> intended any such Comparison or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion, or aimed at our Information or Instruction by them. They were <hi>common people</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not <hi>Philosophers,</hi> to whom the Apostle wrote this <hi>Epistle.</hi> And therefore either he expresseth the things that he intends, in terms answering unto what was in <hi>use</hi> among themselves to the same purpose, or else he asserts them <hi>plainly</hi> in words, as meet to express them <hi>properly</hi> by, as any that are in use amongst men. To say there is an <hi>Allusion</hi> in the words, and that the <hi>Son</hi> is not <hi>properly,</hi> but by a <hi>Metaphor</hi> the <hi>brightness</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> is to teach the Apostle to express himself in the things of God. For my part, I understand as much of the <hi>Nature, Glory,</hi> and Properties of the Son, in, and by this expression, <hi>He is the Brightness of Glory,</hi> as I do by any of the most accurate expressions, which men have <hi>arbitrarily invented</hi> to signifie the same thing. That he is one distinct from God the Father, related unto him, and partaker of his glory, is clearely asserted in these words, and more is not intended in them.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, These things then being premised, we may discern the <hi>general</hi> importance of these expressions. The words themselves, as was before observed, being <hi>no where else</hi> used in the Scripture, we may receive a contribution of light unto them from those in other places, which are of their <hi>nearest alliance.</hi> Such are these and the like, <hi>We have seen his glory, the glory of the only Son of God,</hi> Joh. 1.14. <hi>He is the Image of the invisible God,</hi> Col. 1.15. <hi>The glory of God shines forth in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. Now in these and the like places, the glory of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is so intimated, as that we are directed to look unto the <hi>Glory</hi> of the absolutely invisible and incomprehensible God, in him <hi>Incarnate.</hi> And this in general is the mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                           </gap>g and intendment of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in these expressions; the <hi>Son</hi> in whom God speaks unto us in the Revelation of the Gospel, doth in <hi>his own Person</hi> so every way answer the Excellencies and Perfections of God the Father, that he is in him expresly represented unto our Faith and Contemplation.</p>
                        <p>It remaineth then in the <hi>second place</hi> that we consider the <hi>Expressions</hi> severally, with the reasons why the Apostle thus expresseth the <hi>Divine glory</hi> of Jesus Christ. <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>; <hi>Who being the Brightness; Light, Lustre,</hi> Majesty of Glory. The <hi>Apostle,</hi> in my judgment, (which is humbly submitted unto consideration) alludes and attends unto some thing, that the people were instructed by <hi>typically</hi> under the Old Testament, in this great Mystery of the manifestation of the glory of God unto them in and by the Son, the Second Person in the Trinity. The <hi>Ark,</hi> which was the most signal <hi>Representation</hi> of the presence of God amongst them, was called <hi>his Glory.</hi> So the Wife of <hi>Phineas,</hi> upon the taking of the Ark, affirmed, that the <hi>Glory was departed,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.22. <hi>The glory is departed from Israel, for the Ark of God is taken.</hi> And the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi> mentioning the same thing, calls it <hi>his glory</hi> absolutely: <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.61. <hi>He gave his glory into the hand of his enemies</hi>; that is the Ark. Now on the filling of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle with the signs of God's presence in Cloud and Fire, the <hi>Jews</hi> affirm that there was a constant <gap reason="foreign">

And this was to instruct them in the way and manner whereby God would dwell amongst them. The Apostle therefore calling them from the <hi>Types,</hi> by which in much darkness they had been instructed in these Mysteries, unto the things themselves represented obscurely by them, acquaints them with what that <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical glory</hi> and <hi>splendour</hi> of it signified, namely the <hi>Eternal glory</hi> of God, with the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>beaming</hi> and brightness of it in the Son, in and by whom the glory of the Father shineth forth unto us. So that the words seem to relate unto that way of Instruction, which was of old granted unto them.</p>

                           </gap>. Many controversies about these words there were of old.

The</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Hypostasis</hi> of the Father, is the Father himself. Hereof, or of him, is the Son said to be the <hi>express image.</hi> As is the Father, so is the Son.

What the Father is, doth, hath; that the Son is, doth, hath; or else the Father as the Father could not be <hi>fully satisfied</hi> in him, nor represented by him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By <hi>Character</hi> two things seem to be intended. 1. That the Son in himself is <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>; and their use seems thus to difference them. 1. That is said of him, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Neither were the <hi>Jews</hi> of old ignorant of this notion of the Son of God. So <hi>Philo</hi> expresseth their sense, <hi>de confusione linguarum,</hi>

                        <p>We have seen what it is, that is intended in this Expression; and shall only adde thereunto a consideration of <hi>that,</hi> from whence the Expression is taken. The ordinary ingraving of <hi>Rings,</hi> or Seals, or Stones, is generally thought to be alluded unto. It may be also, that the Apostle had respect unto some <hi>Representation</hi> of the glory of God by <hi>Ingraving</hi> amongst the Institutions of <hi>Moses.</hi> Now there was scarcely any thing of old that more gloriously represented God, than that of the <hi>Ingraving of his Name</hi> on a plate of gold to be worn on the front of the <hi>Mitre</hi> of the High priest; at the sight whereof, the great <hi>Conqueror</hi> of the East fell down before him. Mention of it we have, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.36. <hi>Thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the ingraving of a signet,</hi>

And <hi>Aaron</hi> was to wear this <hi>ingraven Name</hi> of God on his fore-head, that he might bear the <hi>iniquity of the holy things and gifts of the children of Israel</hi>; which could really be done only by him who was <hi>Jehovah</hi> himself. And thus also when God promiseth to bring forth the Son, as the <hi>corner stone</hi> of the Church, he promiseth to <hi>ingrave upon him the seven eyes of the Lord, Zech.</hi> 3.9. or the perfection of his Wisdom and Power to be expressed unto the Church in him. There having been then this Representation of the presence of God, by the <hi>character</hi> or ingraving of his glorious Name upon the <hi>plate of gold,</hi> which the High priest was to wear that he might <hi>bear iniquities</hi>; the Apostle lets the <hi>Hebrews</hi> know, that in Christ the Son is the real accomplishment of what was typified thereby, the Father having actually communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto him his <hi>Nature</hi> denoted by that name, whereby he was able <hi>really</hi> to bear our iniquities, and most gloriously represent the <hi>Person</hi> of his Father unto us.</p>
                        <p>And this, with <hi>submission to better judgments,</hi> do I conceive to be the design of the Apostle, in this his description of the Person of Jesus Christ. It pleased the holy Ghost herein, to use these terms and expressions, to mind the <hi>Hebrews</hi> how they were of old instructed, though <hi>obscurely,</hi> in the things now actually exhibited unto them; and that nothing was now preached or declared, but what in their <hi>Typical</hi> Institutions they had before given their assent unto.</p>
                        <p>We have been somewhat <hi>long</hi> in our Explication of this description of the Person of the Son of God; yet, as we suppose, not any longer than the nature of the things treated of, and the manner of their expression, necessarily required us to be. We shall therefore here <hi>stay a while,</hi> before we proceed to the ensuing words of this verse, and take some <hi>observation</hi> from what hath been spoken for our direction and refreshment in our passage.</p>
                        <p>Observe. 1. <hi>All the glorious Perfections of the Nature of God, do belong unto, and dwell in the person of the Son.</hi> Were it not so, he could not gloriously <hi>represent</hi> unto us the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Father; nor by the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of him, could we be led to an acquaintance with the Person of the Father. This the Apostle here teacheth us, as in the Explication of the words we have manifested. Now because the confirmation of this allusion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the <hi>proofs</hi> and <hi>testimonies</hi> given of and unto the Divine Nature of Christ, which I have else-where largely <hi>insisted</hi> on, and <hi>vindicated</hi> from Exceptions, I shall not here reassume that task; especially considering that the same Truth will again occur unto us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:50110:201"/>Observ. 2. <hi>The whole Manifestation of the Nature of God unto us, and all communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of grace, are immediately by and through the Person of the Son.</hi> He represents him unto us, and <hi>through him,</hi> is every thing that is communicated unto us from the fulness of the Deity conveyed.</p>
                        <p>There are sundry signal instances wherein God <hi>reveals</hi> himself, and communicates from his own <hi>infinite fulness</hi> unto his creatures; and in all of them he doth it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by the Son. 1. In the <hi>Creation</hi> of all things. 2. In their <hi>Providential</hi> rule and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal. 3. In the <hi>revelation</hi> of his Will, and institution of Ordinances. 4. In the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> of his Spirit and Grace. In <hi>none</hi> of which is the Person of the Father any otherwise <hi>immediately</hi> represented unto us, than in and by the Person of the Son.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Creation</hi> of all things, God both gave them their <hi>Being,</hi> and imparted unto them of his Goodness, and manifested his Nature unto those that were capable of an holy Apprehension of it. Now all this God did <hi>immediately</hi> by the Son; not as a <hi>subordinate Instrument,</hi> but as the <hi>principal Efficient,</hi> being his own Power and Wisdom. This we have manifested in our Explication of the last words of the <hi>Verse fore-going.</hi> In express testimony hereunto, see <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. The Son, as the Power and Wisdom of the Father, <hi>made all things</hi>; so that in that work, the glory of the Father shines forth in him, and no otherwise: By him was there a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Being,</hi> Goodness and Existence unto the Creation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In the <hi>providential</hi> Rule and disposal of all things created, God farther manifests hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lf if unto his creatures, and farther communicates of his goodness unto them. That this also is done in and by the Son, we shall farther evidence in the explication of the next words of this verse.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The matter is yet more plain, as to the <hi>Revelation</hi> of his Will, and the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ordinances from first to last. It is granted, that after the <hi>entrance</hi> of sin, God doth not <hi>graciously</hi> reveal, nor communicate himself unto any of his creatures but by his Son. This might fully be manifested by a consideration of the <hi>first promise,</hi> the foundation of future Revelations and Institutions, with an <hi>induction</hi> of all ensuing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. But whereas all Revelations and Institutions springing from the first promise, are compleated and finished in the Gospel, it may suffice to shew, that what we assert is true, with peculiar reference thereunto. The testimonies given unto it are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable. This is the <hi>substance</hi> and end of the Gospel, to reveal the Father by and in the Son unto us, to declare that through him <hi>alone</hi> we can be made partakers of his grace and goodness; and that no other way we can have either acquaintance or communion with him, see <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. The whole end of the Gospel is to give us the <hi>knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. that is, the glory of the <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible God,</hi> whom none hath seen at any time, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.12. that is, to be communicated unto us. But how is this to be done, absolutely and immediately as it is the glory of the <hi>Father?</hi> no, but as it <hi>shines forth in the face of Jesus Christ</hi>; or as it is in his Person manifested and represented unto us: for he is, as the same Apostle in the same place, <hi>v.</hi> 4. the <hi>image of God.</hi> And herein also, as to the communication of <hi>Grace</hi> and the Spirit, the Scripture is express, and believers are daily instructed in it. See <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. especially 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11, 14. Now the grounds of this Order of the things lies,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the Essential <hi>Inbeing</hi> of the Father and the Son. This our Saviour expresseth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.38. <hi>The Father is in me, and I in him</hi>; the same Essential Properties and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being in each of the persons, by vertue thereof their <hi>Persons</hi> also are said to be in each other. The Person of the Son is in the Person of the Father; not as <hi>such,</hi> not in or by its own <hi>personality,</hi> but by union of its Nature and Essential Properties, which are not <hi>alike,</hi> as the Persons are, but the <hi>same</hi> in the one and the other. And this <hi>Inbeing</hi> of the Father in the Son, and of the Son in him, our Saviour affirms to be manifested by the works that he wrought, being wrought by the power of the Father, yet as <hi>in him,</hi> and not as <hi>in the Father</hi> immediately. See to the same purpose <hi>chap.</hi> 14.10, 11. and <hi>chap.</hi> 17.21.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Father being thus in the Son, and the Son in the Father, whereby all the <hi>glorious Properties</hi> of the one do shine forth in the other, the order and <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the blessed Trinity in Subsistence and Operation, requires that the manifestation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Father unto us, be through and by the Son. For as the Father is the <hi>Original</hi> and Fountain of the whole Trinity as to subsistence, so as to Operation he works not but by the Son, who having the Divine Nature communicated unto him by <hi>Eternal Generation,</hi> is to communicate the Effects of the Divine Power, Wisdom
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50110:202"/>
and Goodness by <hi>temporary Operation.</hi> And thus he becomes the <hi>brightness</hi> of his Father's <hi>glory,</hi> and the <hi>express image of his person</hi>; namely by the receiving his glorious Nature from him, the whole and all of it, and expressing him in his works of nature and grace unto his creatures.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Because in the <hi>dispensation</hi> and councel of Grace, God hath determined, that all communication of himself unto us, shall be by the Son, as incarnate. This the whole Gospel is given to testifie. So that this truth hath its foundation in the very <hi>subsistence</hi> of the Persons of the Deity, is confirmed by the <hi>Order and Operation,</hi> and <hi>Voluntary Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                        <p>And this discovers unto us, first, The <hi>Necessity</hi> of coming unto God by Christ. God in himself is said to be in <hi>thick darkness,</hi> as also to <hi>dwell in Light,</hi> whereunto no creature can approach; which expressions though <hi>seeming</hi> contrary, yet teach us the <hi>same thing,</hi> namely the <hi>infinite distance</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> from our apprehensions and conceptions; <hi>no man having seen God at any time.</hi> But this God, <hi>invisible,</hi> eternal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibly glorious, hath implanted sundry <hi>characters</hi> of his Excellencies, and left footsteps of his bless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d Properties on the things that he hath made, that by the Consideration and Contemplation of them, we might come to some such <hi>Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> with him, as might encourage us to fear and serve him, and to make him our utmost End. But these <hi>Expressions</hi> of God in all other things, besides his Son Christ Jesus, are all of them <hi>partial,</hi> revealing only <hi>something</hi> of him, not <hi>All</hi> that is necessary to be known, that we may live unto him here, and enjoy him hereafter; and <hi>obscure,</hi> not leading us unto any perfect stable knowledge of him. And hence it is, that those who have attempted to <hi>come unto God</hi> by the light of that manifestation which he hath made of himself, any other way than in and by Christ Jesus, have all failed and <hi>come short of his glory.</hi> But now the Lord Christ being the <hi>Brightness of his glory,</hi> in whom his glory shines out of the <hi>immense Darkness</hi> that his Nature is enwrapped in unto us, and <hi>beams</hi> out of that <hi>inaccessible light</hi> which he inhabits; and the <hi>express image of his Person,</hi> representing <hi>all</hi> the perfections of his Person, fully and clearly unto us, in him alone, can we attain a <hi>saving</hi> Acquaintance with him. On this account he tells <hi>Philip, Joh.</hi> 14.9. <hi>He that hath seen me, he hath seen the Father</hi>; the reason of which assertion, taken from the mutual <hi>inbeing</hi> of Father and Son, and his expression of his mind and glory, he asserts in the next verses. He then is the <hi>only way and means</hi> of coming unto the knowledge and enjoyment of God; because in and by him alone, is he fully and perfectly expressed unto us. And therefore, this, secondly, is our <hi>great Guide</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in all our endeavours after an <hi>acceptable access</hi> unto him. Would we come to that acquintance with the <hi>Nature,</hi> Properties, and Excellencies of the Father, which poor, weak, <hi>finite</hi> creatures are capable of attaining in this world, which is sufficient that we may <hi>love him,</hi> fear him, serve him and come unto the enjoyment of him; would we know his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> would we admire his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi>; let us labour to come to an <hi>intimate</hi> and near acquaintance with his Son <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> in whom all these things <hi>dwell in their fulness,</hi> and by whom they are exhibited, revealed, unfolded unto us. Seek the Father in the Son; out of whom, not one Property of the Divine Nature can be savingly apprehended, or rightly understood; and in whom they are all <hi>exposed</hi> to our faith and spiritual contemplation. This is our Wisdom, to abide in Christ, to abide with him, to learn him, and in him we shall learn, see and know the Father also.</p>

                           <hi>Cherubims</hi> with their wheels made that <hi>Chariot,</hi> over which sate the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> in his disposing and ruling of all things. And the words themselves have that affinity in signification, which is frequently seen among the <hi>Hebrew Roots,</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only in the <hi>transposition</hi> of one letter. And the description of him who sat above the <hi>Cherubims</hi> of Providence, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.10. is the same with that of <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 4. Now God in that Vision is placed <gap reason="foreign">

And though this <hi>divine Administration of all things</hi> be dreadful to consider, the <hi>rings of the wheels</hi> being high and dreadful, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.18. and the living creature ran as the <hi>appearance of a flash of lightning, v.</hi> 14. as also full of entanglements, there being to appearance cross wheels, or <hi>wheels within wheels, v.</hi> 16. which are all said to be <hi>rolling, chap.</hi> 10.13. yet it is carried on in an unspeakable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without the least Confusion, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 17. and with a <hi>marvellous facility,</hi> by a meer intimation of the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of him who guides the whole; and that because there was a <hi>living powerful spirit,</hi> passing through all, both <hi>living creatures</hi> and <hi>wheels,</hi> that moved them speedily, regularly and effectually, as he pleased; that is, the <hi>Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical</hi> Power of divine Providence, <hi>animating,</hi> guiding and disposing the whole, as seemed good unto him.</p>
                        <p>Now all this is excellently expressed by the Apostle in these words. For as that power which is in him that sits over the <hi>Chariot,</hi> influencing and giving existence, life, motion and guidance unto all things, is clearly expressed by <gap reason="foreign">

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the <hi>Essential</hi> Word of God, who is the Person spoken of; nor <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>This in the Vision of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is the communication of a <hi>spirit of life</hi> to the <hi>Cherubs</hi> and <hi>Wheels,</hi> to act and move them as seems good to him by whom they are guided. For as it is very probable, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> in these words, setting forth the Divine Power of the Son in ruling and governing the whole Creation, did intend to mind the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that the Lord Christ the Son is he who was represented in the form of a man unto <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ruling and disposing of all things, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the <hi>Almighty,</hi> whose voice was heard amongst the <hi>Wheels</hi>; so it is most certain that the same thing is intended in both places. And this expression of <hi>upholding</hi> or <hi>disposing</hi> of all things <hi>by the word of his power,</hi> doth fully declare the glorious providence <hi>emblematically</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in that Vision. The Son being over all things made by himself, as on a <hi>Throne</hi> over the <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Wheels,</hi> influenceth the whole Creation with his Power, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating unto it respectively subsistence, life and motion, acting, ruling and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of all according to the counsel of his own will.</p>
                        <p>This then is that which the <hi>Apostle</hi> assigns unto the Son, thereby to set out the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Person, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> might well consider all things before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted his Doctrine. He is one that is partaker <hi>essentially</hi> of the Nature of God, being the <hi>brightness of glory,</hi> and the <hi>express image</hi> of his Father's Person, who exerciseth and <hi>manifesteth</hi> his divine Power, both in the creation of all things, as also in the <hi>support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> rule and disposal of all, after they are made by him. And hence will follow, as his Power and Authority to change the <hi>Mosaical Institutions,</hi> so his Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Will of God by him made, which it was their duty to embrace and adhere unto.</p>
                        <p>The several passages of this Verse are all of them conjoyned by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> and used unto the same general end and purpose; but themselves are of such <hi>distinct</hi> senses and importance, considered absolutely and apart, that we shall in our <hi>passage</hi> take out the Observations which they singly afford unto us.</p>
                        <p>And from these last words we may learn.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God, hath the weight of the whole Creation upon his hand, and disposeth of it by his Power and Wisdom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Such is the nature and condition of the Vniverse, that it could not subsist a moment, nor could any thing in it act regularly unto its appointed end, without the continual supportment, guidance, influence and disposal of the Son of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We may briefly consider the <hi>sum</hi> of both these joyntly, to manifest the Power and Care of Christ over us, as also the <hi>weak dependent condition</hi> of the whole Creation in and by it self. The things of this <hi>Creation</hi> can no more support act and dispose themselves, then they could at first <hi>make</hi> themselves out of nothing. The <hi>greatest</hi> cannot conserve it self by its Power, or Greatness, or Order; nor the <hi>least</hi> by its <hi>distance</hi> from Opposition. Were there not a mighty hand under them all and every one, they would all <hi>sink</hi> into confusion and nothing; did not an effectual Power <hi>influence</hi> them, they would become a <hi>slothful</hi> heap. It is true, God hath in the creation of all things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in every <hi>particle</hi> of the Creation, a special natural inclination and disposition, according unto which it is ready to act, move, or work regularly; but he hath not placed this Nature and Power <hi>absolutely</hi> in them, and <hi>independently</hi> of his own Power and Operation. The <hi>Sun</hi> is endued with a nature to produce all the glorious <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> that we behold or conceive; the <hi>Fire</hi> to burn, the <hi>Wind</hi> to blow, and all creatures also in the like manner; but yet neither could <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Wind</hi>
                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:50110:204"/>
preserve themselves in their being, or retain the principles of their Operations, did not the Son of God, by a constant continual <hi>emanation</hi> of his eternal Power uphold and preserve them; nor could they produce any one effect by all their actings, did not he work in them, and by them. And so is it with the <hi>sons</hi> of men, with all Agents what ever, whether <hi>natural</hi> and unnecessary, or <hi>free,</hi> and proceeding in their operations by <hi>election</hi> and choice. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that in God <hi>we live, and move, and have our being, Acts</hi> 17.28. He had before asserted, that he had of <hi>one bloud made all nations, v.</hi> 26. That is, <hi>all men of one,</hi> whom he first created; to which he addes, that we may may know that he hath not so left us, to stand by our selves on that first foundation, or that we have any Power or Ability being made, to do or act any thing without him, that <hi>in him,</hi> that is in his Power, Care, Providence, and by vertue of his effectual influence, our <hi>lives</hi> are supported and continued, that we are <hi>acted, moved,</hi> and enabled thereby to do all we do, be it never so small, wherein there is any effect of <hi>life</hi> or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion So <hi>Daniel</hi> tells <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> that <hi>his breath and all his ways were in the hand of God, Dan.</hi> 5.23. His <hi>breath</hi> in the supportment and continuance of his Being; and his <hi>ways</hi> in his effectual guidance and disposal of them. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks to the same purpose in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, concerning the <hi>fabrick</hi> of the Heavens, Sea, and Earth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                        <p>Now what is thus spoken of God in general, is by <hi>Paul</hi> particularly applied unto the Son. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>All things were created by him, and for him, and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</hi> He did not only make all things, as we have declared, and that <hi>for himself</hi> and his own glory, but also he <hi>continues</hi> in the head of them; so that by him, and by his Power, they <hi>consist,</hi> are preserved in their present state and condition, kept from dissolution, in their <hi>singular existence,</hi> and in a <hi>consistency</hi> among themselves.</p>
                        <p>And the reason hereof is taken, first, from the <hi>limited,</hi> finite, dependent condition of the Creation, and the absolute <hi>necessity</hi> that it should be so. It is utterly impossible and repugnant to the very <hi>nature</hi> and being of God, that he should make, create, or produce any thing without himself, that should have either a <hi>self-subsistence,</hi> or a <hi>self-sufficiency,</hi> or be independent on himself. All these are natural and Essential Properties of the Divine Nature; where <hi>they</hi> are, <hi>there</hi> is God, so that no <hi>creature</hi> can be made partaker of them: Where we name a <hi>creature,</hi> we name that which hath a derived and dependant Being. And that which cannot <hi>subsist</hi> in and by it self, cannot <hi>act</hi> so neither.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The <hi>Energetical</hi> Efficacy of God's Providence joyned with his infinite Wisdom in caring for the works of his own hands, the product of his Power, requires that it should be so. He <hi>worketh yet.</hi> He did not create the world, to leave it to an <hi>uncertain event</hi>; to stand by, and to see what would become of it, to see whether it would return to its <hi>primitive nothing,</hi> of which cask it always <hi>smells</hi> strongly; or how it would be tossed up and down by the adverse and contrary <hi>Qualities</hi> which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the severals of it: But the same Power and Wisdom that produced it, doth still accompany it, powerfully piercing through every <hi>parcel</hi> and particle of it. To fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy a Providence in God, without a continual <hi>Energetical Operation,</hi> or a Wisdom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a constant <hi>care</hi> inspection and over-sight of the works of his hands, is not to have apprehensions of the <hi>Living God,</hi> but to erect an <hi>Idol</hi> in our own imaginations.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, This work is <hi>peculiarly</hi> assigned unto the Son, not only as he is the <hi>Eternal Power</hi> and Wisdom of God, but also because by his <hi>interposition,</hi> as undertaking the work of Mediation, he reprieved the world from an immediate <hi>dissolution</hi> upon the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of sin and disorder; that it might continue, as it were, the <hi>great Stage</hi> for the mighty works of God's Grace, Wisdom, and Love to be wrought in. Hence the care of the <hi>continuance</hi> of the Creation and the disposal of it, is <hi>delegated</hi> unto him, as he that hath undertaken to bring <hi>forth</hi> and consummate the glory of God in it, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great breach made upon it by the <hi>sin</hi> of Angels and men. This is the substance of the <hi>Apostles</hi> discourse, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Having asserted him to be the <hi>Image of God,</hi> in the sense before opened and declared, and to have <hi>made all things,</hi> he affirms, that all things have also their present <hi>consistency</hi> in him, and by his Power; and <hi>must</hi> have so, until the work of <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of all things unto God being accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the glory of God may be fully retrieved and established for ever.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We may see from hence the Vanity of expecting any thing from the <hi>Creatures,</hi> but only what the Lord Christ is pleased to communicate unto us by them. They that cannot <hi>sustain,</hi> move or <hi>act</hi> themselves, by any power, vertue, or strength of their own, are very <hi>unlikely</hi> by and of themselves to afford any <hi>real assistance,</hi> relief, or help unto
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50110:204"/>
others. They all abide and exist severally, and consist together, in their Order, and Operation, by the <hi>Word of the Power</hi> of Christ; and what he will communicate by them, that they will yield and afford, and nothing else. In themselves they are <hi>broken Cisterns</hi> that will hold no water; what he drops into them may be derived unto us, and no more. They who <hi>rest</hi> upon them, or rest in them, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of their constant dependance on Christ, will find at length all their <hi>hopes</hi> disappointed, and all their Enjoyments vanish into nothing.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Learn hence also the full, absolute, plenary <hi>self-sufficiency</hi> and Soveraignty of the Son our Saviour. We shewed before the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niversality</hi> of his Kingdom and Moral Rule over the whole Creation; but this is not all. A King hath a <hi>Moral Rule</hi> over his Subjects in his Kingdom; but he doth not really and <hi>physically</hi> give them their Being and Existence; he doth not <hi>uphold</hi> and <hi>act</hi> them at his pleasure; but every one of them stand therein upon the <hi>same,</hi> or an <hi>equal</hi> bottom with himself. He can indeed by the permission of God, take away the Lives of any of them, and so put an end to all their <hi>actings</hi> and operations in this World; but he cannot give them <hi>life,</hi> or continue their lives at his pleasure one moment, or make them so much as to move a finger. But with the Lord Christ it is otherwise; he not only <hi>rules</hi> over all the whole Creation, disposing of it according to the <hi>Rule</hi> and Law of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and pleasure; but also they all have their <hi>Beings,</hi> Natures, Inclinations, and Lives from him; by his Power are they <hi>continued</hi> unto them, and all their Actions are influenced thereby. And this as it argues an <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> in himself, so an <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Soveraignty</hi> over all other things. And this should teach us our <hi>constant depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> on him, and our <hi>universal subjection</hi> unto him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And this abundantly discovers the Vanity and folly of them, who make use of the Creation in an <hi>Opposition</hi> unto the Lord Christ, and his peculiar interest in this World. His <hi>own Power</hi> is the very ground that they stand upon in their <hi>Opposition</hi> unto him; and all things which they use against him, <hi>consist</hi> in him. They hold their Lives absolutely at the pleasure of him whom they oppose; and they act against <hi>him,</hi> without whose continual supportment and influence, they could neither <hi>live</hi> nor <hi>act</hi> one moment, which is the greatest <hi>madness,</hi> and most contemptible folly imaginable.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> renders these words; <hi>purgationem peccatorum faciens</hi>; not without sundry mistakes. For First, Those words, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>hat is here intended. And therefore the Expositors of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50110:205"/>
                           <hi>Thomas, Lyranus, Cajetan, Estlus, Ribera, A Lapide,</hi> all desert their own Text, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the words according to the <hi>Original</hi>: The Antients also as <hi>Chrysostom, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philact,</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> lay the chief weight of their whole Exposition of this place, on the words <hi>omitted</hi> in that Translation.</p>
                        <p>The doctrine of <hi>purging our sins</hi> by Christ, is deep and large, extending its self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many weighty heads of the Gospel: but we shall follow our <hi>Apostle,</hi> and in this place pass it over <hi>briefly</hi> and in general, because the consideration of it will directly <hi>occur</hi> unto us in our progress.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Two</hi> things the Apostle here expresseth concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi>; and <hi>one,</hi> which is the foundation of both the other he <hi>implyeth</hi> or supposeth. First, He expresseth <hi>What</hi> he did; he <hi>purged our sins</hi>: Secondly, <hi>How</hi> he did it, he did it <hi>by himself.</hi> That which he supposeth as the foundation of both these is, that he was the <hi>Great High Priest of the Church</hi>; they with whom he dealt knowing full well that this matter of <hi>purging sins,</hi> belonged only unto the Priest.</p>
                        <p>Here then the <hi>Apostle</hi> tacitely enters upon a Comparison of <hi>Christ</hi> with <hi>Aaron,</hi> the High Priest; as he had done before with all the <hi>Prophetical</hi> Revealers of the Will of God; and as he named <hi>none</hi> of them in particular, no more doth he here name <hi>Aaron</hi>; but afterwards when he comes more largely to insist on the same matter again, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly makes mention of his name, as also of that of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in both the things here ascribed unto him as the great High Priest of his Church doth he prefer him above <hi>Aaron. First,</hi> In that he <hi>purged our sins</hi>; that is, really and effectually before God, and in the Conscience of the sinner, and that for ever. Whereas the <hi>Purgation of sins</hi> about which <hi>Aaron</hi> was employed, was in its self but <hi>typical,</hi> external, and representative of that which was true and real, both of which the <hi>Apostle</hi> proves at large afterwards. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that he did it <hi>by himself,</hi> or the offering of himself; whereas what ever <hi>Aaron</hi> did of this kind, he did it by the <hi>offering of the blood of Bulls and Goats,</hi> as shall be declared.</p>
                        <p>And hence appears also the vanity of the <hi>Gloss</hi> of a learned man on these words; <hi>postquam,</hi> saith he, <hi>morte sua causam dedisset ejus fidei per quam à peccatis purgamur, quod nec Moses fecerat, nec Prophetae.</hi> For as we shall see that Christs <hi>purging of our sins,</hi> doth not consist in giving a <hi>ground and cause for faith,</hi> whereby <hi>we purge our selves,</hi> so the Apostle is not comparing the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> in these words with <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who had nothing to do in the work of <hi>purging sin,</hi> but with <hi>Aaron</hi> who by Office was designed thereunto.</p>

The High Priest of old made Attonement, and <hi>typically</hi> purged the sins of the People, by sacrificing of <hi>Beasts</hi> according unto the Appointment of the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. This High Priest by the Sacrifice of <hi>himself, Isa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. Of the nature of <hi>Propitiatory</hi> or <hi>Expiatory</hi> Sacrifices, we must treat at large afterwards. We keep our selves now, unto the <hi>Apostles</hi> general Proposition, expressing briefly the <hi>Sacerdotal Office</hi> of Christ, and the Excellency of it, in that he <hi>really</hi> purged our sins, and that by the Sacrifice of <hi>himself.</hi> And this was in and by his death on the Cross, with his antecedent preparatory sufferings. Some distinguish between his <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Oblation</hi> of himself. This they say he <hi>performed</hi> in Heaven, when as the High Priest of his Church, he entered into the <hi>Holiest</hi> not made with hands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto his death was but a preparation. For the <hi>slaying</hi> of the Beast, they say, was not the Sacrifice, but the offering of its blood upon the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the carrying of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy Place. But this utterly overthrows the <hi>whole Sacrifice</hi> of Christ, which indeed is the thing by them aimed at. It is true, the <hi>slaying</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> was not the <hi>whole Sacrifice,</hi> but only an <hi>essential</hi> part of it, as was also the offering of its blood; and the sprinkling of it in the Holy Place, in the <hi>anniversary</hi> Sacrifice of Attonement, but not in any other. And the Reason why the <hi>whole Sacrifice</hi> could not consist in any <hi>one Action,</hi> arose meerly from the <hi>imperfection</hi> of the things and persons employed in that work. The <hi>Priest</hi> was <hi>one</hi> thing, the <hi>Beast</hi> to be sacrificed another, the <hi>Altar</hi> another, the <hi>Fire</hi> on the <hi>Altar</hi> another, the <hi>Incense</hi> added another, each of them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and designed unto its peculiar end, so that the <hi>attonement</hi> could not be made by any one of them, nor the Sacrifice consist in them. But now in this <hi>sacrifice</hi> of Christ all these meet in one, because of his Perfection; He himself was both <hi>Priest, Sacrifice, Altar</hi> and <hi>Incense,</hi> as we shall see in our progress; and he perfected his whole sacrifice at once, in and by his death and blood-shedding, as the Apostle evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.12.14.</p>
                        <p>Thus by <hi>himself</hi> did Christ purge our sins, making an Attonement for them by the sacrifice of himself in his <hi>death,</hi> that they should never be imputed unto them that believe.</p>

                              <hi>So great was the work of freeing us from sin, that it could no otherwise be effected but by the self-sacrifice of the Son of God.</hi>

                        <p>Our <hi>Apostle</hi> makes it his design in several places to evince that <hi>none</hi> of those things

                        <p>The best that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> could attain, all that they had to trust unto, was but the Improvement of <hi>natural Light</hi> and Reason, with an attendance unto those seeds and Principles of Good and Evil, which are yet left in the depraved nature of man. Under the <hi>Conduct,</hi> and in Obedience unto these, they sought for <hi>Rest,</hi> Glory, and Immortality: how miserably they were <hi>disappointed</hi> in their aims and expectations, and what a wofull issue all their endeavours had, the <hi>Apostle</hi> declares and proves at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. unto the end.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> who enjoyed the benefit of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> having lost for the most part the true spiritual import of them, sought for the same ends by the <hi>Law,</hi> and their own diligent Observation of it. They <hi>rested in the Law; Rom.</hi> 2.17. namely, that by it, they should obtain Deliverance from sin, and Acceptance with God; and <hi>followed after it, Chap.</hi> 9.31. that is, to attain Righteousness and Salvation by it. And this seemed to be a sufficient bottom and foundation for them to build upon: for having lost the <hi>spiritual</hi> Understanding, the use and End of the Law, as renewed unto them in the <hi>Covenant of Horeb,</hi> they went back unto th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> primitive Use and End of it, upon its first giving in Innocency; and foolishly thought, as many more yet do, that it would do the same things for <hi>sinners,</hi> that it would have done for <hi>men,</hi> if they had not sinned in <hi>Adam</hi>; that is, have given them Acceptance with God here, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life hereafter; Wherefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> in many places takes great pains to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, to rectifie their mistake, and to prove that God had <hi>no such design</hi> in giving them the <hi>Law,</hi> as that, which they would impose upon him.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>First,</hi> He asserts and proves in general, that the Law would <hi>deceive</hi> their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; and that by the <hi>deeds of the Law no flesh should be justified, Rom.</hi> 3.20. and that it would <hi>not give them life, Gal.</hi> 3.21. or Righteousness. And that they might not complain, that then God himself had <hi>deceived</hi> them in giving a Law that would not serve the turn for which it was given; he declares, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they had <hi>mistaken the End</hi> for which the Law was renewed unto them; which was not that it might give them Life or Righteousness, but that it <hi>might discover sin,</hi> exact obedience, and by both drive and compell them to look out after some other thing, that might both <hi>save them</hi> from their sin, and afford them a Righteousness unto Salvation. And furthermore, he <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Acquaints them whence it was, that the <hi>Law</hi> was become <hi>unsufficient</hi> for these ends; and that was, because it was become <hi>weak through the flesh, Rom.</hi> 8.3. The Law was able to continue our Acceptance with God, in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein at <hi>first</hi> we were created; but after that man by <hi>sin</hi> became <hi>flesh,</hi> to have a Principle of <hi>Enmity against God</hi> in him, bringing forth the fruits of sin continually, the Law <hi>stood aside,</hi> as weakened and insufficient to help and save such an one. And these things the <hi>Apostle</hi> expresly and carefully insists upon in his <hi>Epistles</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though the <hi>Law,</hi> and an <hi>earnest endeavour</hi> after the Observation of it in general, would not serve to save us from our sins, yet there were <hi>especial Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the Law, that were appointed for that End and Purpose; as namely, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> in particular; which were designed to make <hi>Attonement</hi> for the delivery of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to procure their Reconciliation with God. These the <hi>Jews</hi> principally rested on, and trusted unto; and indeed to expect <hi>Righteousness</hi> and Justification by the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Sacrifices, as they did, was far more <hi>rational,</hi> than to expect it by the <hi>Works of the Moral Law</hi> as some now do; for all Good works what ever, are required in the Law, and so far are <hi>works of the Law</hi>: For in the Sacrifices, there was a <hi>supposition of sin,</hi> and an appearance of a <hi>compensation</hi> to be made, that the sinner might go free; but in the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> there is nothing but <hi>absolute universal</hi> and exact Righteousness required or admitted, without the least provision of relief for them who come short therein. But yet our <hi>Apostle</hi> declar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s, and proves that neither were these <hi>available</hi> for the End aimed at, as we shall see at large on the <hi>ninth</hi> and <hi>tenth</hi> Chapters of this <hi>Epistle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now within the compass of these <hi>three, Natural Light</hi> or Reason, with ingrafted principles of Good and Evil, the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> thereof, do lye and consist, all the hopes and endeavours of sinners after <hi>Deliverance</hi> and Acceptance with God. Nothing is there that they <hi>can</hi> do, or put any confidence in, but may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto one of these heads. And if all this <hi>fail</hi> them, as assuredly they will, (which we might prove by Reasons and Demonstrations in numerable, though at
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50110:206"/>
present we content our selves with the Testimonies above reported) it is certain, that there is nothing under Heaven can yield them in this case the least relief.</p>
                        <p>Again, This is the only way for that End which is suited unto the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God. The <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God is an infinite <hi>abysse,</hi> which as it lyes in his own Eternal breast, we cannot at all <hi>look</hi> into. We can only adore it, as it breaks forth and discovers it self in the <hi>Works that outwardly are of him,</hi> or the Effects of it. Thus, <hi>David</hi> in the consideration of the Works of God, falls into an admiration of the <hi>Wisdom</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were made, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.24. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 136.5. The <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God opens and manifests its self in its Effects; and thence according unto our measure, do we learn what doth <hi>become</hi> it, and is suitable unto it. But when the Holy Ghost cometh to speak of this Work of our Redemption by Christ, he doth not only call us to consider singly the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, but his <hi>Various and manifold Wisdom, Ephes.</hi> 3.10. and affirms that all the Treasures of <hi>Wisdom are hid in it, Col.</hi> 2.3. plainly intimating that it is a work so <hi>suited</hi> unto, so <hi>answering</hi> the Infinite Wisdom of God in all things throughout, that it could <hi>no otherwise</hi> have been disposed and effected. And this as well upon the account of the <hi>Wisdom of God</hi> its self absolutely considered, as also as it is that Property whereby God <hi>designs</hi> and effects the glorifying of all other Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of his Nature; whence it is called <hi>various,</hi> or <hi>manifold</hi>; so that we may well conclude that no other way of Deliverance of sinners was suited unto the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This was alone answered the <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God. He is an holy God, who will not suffer the <hi>guilty to go free,</hi> of <hi>purer eyes than to behold iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and his <hi>Judgement</hi> is that they who <hi>commit sin are worthy of death.</hi> Sin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his <hi>Nature</hi>; and his <hi>Justice</hi> requireth that it go not unpunished. Besides he is the great and supream <hi>Governour</hi> of all; and whereas sin breaketh and dissolveth the <hi>dependance</hi> of the creature upon him, should he not avenge that defection, his whole <hi>Rule</hi> and Government would be disannulled. But now if this Vengeance and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment should fall on the <hi>sinners</hi> themselves, they must perish under it eternally; not one of them could <hi>escape,</hi> or ever be freed or purged from their sins. A <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> then there must be; that the <hi>Punishment</hi> due to sin, which the Holiness and Righteousness of God exacteth may be inflicted, and <hi>Mercy</hi> and Grace shewed unto the sinner. That none was able, <hi>fit,</hi> or worthy to undergo this <hi>penalty,</hi> so as to make a compensation for all the sins of <hi>all</hi> the Elect, that none was able to bear it, and break through it, so as that the End of the undertaking might be happy blessed and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous on all hands, but only the Son of God, we shall farther manifest in our progress; and it hath been elsewhere declared.</p>
                        <p>And this, First should teach us to live in an <hi>Holy Admiration</hi> of this mighty and wonderful product of the Wisdom, Righteousness, Grace and Goodness of God, which had found out, and appointed this <hi>Way</hi> of delivering sinners, and have glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously accomplished it in the <hi>self-sacrifice</hi> of the Son of God. The Holy Ghost every where proposeth this unto us, as a <hi>Mysterie,</hi> a great and hidden Mysterie, which none of the <hi>Great,</hi> or Wise, or Disputers of the World, ever did or could come to the least acquaintance withall. And <hi>three</hi> things he asserts concerning it. First, That it is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and is thence alone to be learned and attained, whence we are invited again and again, to <hi>search</hi> and enquire diligently into it; unto this very End, that we may become <hi>wise</hi> in the Knowledge and Acknowledgement of this <hi>deep</hi> and hidden Mysterie. Secondly, That we cannot in our <hi>own strength,</hi> and by our own most diligent Endeavours, come to an holy Acquaintance with it, notwithstanding that <hi>Revelation</hi> that is made of it, in the letter of the Word; unless moreover we receive from God, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wisdom</hi> Knowledge and Revelation, opening our eyes, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our minds <hi>spiritual,</hi> and enabling us to discover these depths of the Holy Ghost in a spiritual manner. Thirdly, That we <hi>cannot by these helps</hi> attain in this life unto a <hi>perfection</hi> in the knowledge of this deep and unfathomable <hi>Mysterie</hi>; but must still labour to <hi>grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of it.</hi> Our thriving in all Grace and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience depending thereon. All these things the Scripture abounds in the Repetition of. And besides, it every where sets forth the <hi>blessedness</hi> and Happiness of them, who by Grace obtain a spiritual insight into this <hi>Mysterie</hi>; and themselves also find by experience the satisfying Excellency of it, with the <hi>Apostle, Phil.</hi> 3.8. all which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations are powerful motives unto this Duty of <hi>enquiring</hi> into, and <hi>admiring</hi> this wonderful <hi>Mysterie,</hi> wherein we have the <hi>Angels</hi> themselves for our Associates and Companions.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="68" facs="tcp:50110:207"/>2. Consider we may also the <hi>unspeakable Love of Christ</hi> in this work of his delivering us from sin. This the Scripture also abundantly goeth before us in; setting forth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling, <hi>commending this Love of Christ,</hi> and calling us to an holy consideration of it. Particularly it shews it accompanied with all things that may <hi>make Love expressive</hi> and to be admired. For, First, It proposeth the <hi>Necessity</hi> and Exigency of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein the Lord Christ gave us this relief; that was when we were <hi>sinners,</hi> when we were <hi>lost,</hi> when we were Children of <hi>Wrath,</hi> under the <hi>Curse,</hi> when no eye did <hi>pitty</hi> us, when no hand could relieve us. And if <hi>John</hi> mourned greatly, when he thought that there was none found <hi>worthy in Heaven or Earth to open his Book of Visions,</hi> and to unloose the seals thereof; how justly might the whole Creation mourn and lament, if there had been none found to yield <hi>Relief,</hi> when all were obnoxious to this fatal ruine. And this is an exceeding commendation of the <hi>love of Christ,</hi> that he set his hand to that <hi>work</hi> which <hi>none could touch</hi>; and put his shoulders under that <hi>Burden</hi> which none else could bear, when all lay in a desperate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>greatness</hi> of this delivery; it is from <hi>Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Curse,</hi> and <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> Eternal: Not from a Trouble or Danger of a few dayes continuance, not from a <hi>momentary suffering,</hi> but from <hi>Everlasting Wrath,</hi> under the curse of God and power of Satan in the execution of it; which necessarily attend sin and sinners; And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Way</hi> whereby he did it; not by <hi>his word</hi> whereby he <hi>made</hi> the world; not by his <hi>Power</hi> whereby he <hi>sustains</hi> and rules the things that he hath made; not by paying a price of <hi>corruptible</hi> things; not by <hi>revealing a way</hi> unto us only, whereby we our selves might escape that condition wherein we were, as some <hi>foolishly</hi> imagine; but by the <hi>sacrifice of himself,</hi> making his soul an Offering for sin; and offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto God through the Eternal Spirit; by laying down his Life for us; and <hi>greater love</hi> can no man manifest than by so doing. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Infinite Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension</hi> that he used to put himself into that condition, wherein <hi>by himself</hi> he might purge our sins. For to this purpose when he was in the <hi>form of God,</hi> he <hi>emptied</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of his Glory, made himself of <hi>no account,</hi> was made <hi>flesh,</hi> took on him the <hi>form of a servant,</hi> that he might be obedient unto death, the death of the Cross. And <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>End</hi> of his undertaking for us; which was the <hi>bringing of us unto God,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Love and Favour here, and the Eternal Enjoyment of him hereafter. All these things, I say, doth the Scripture insist <hi>frequently</hi> and largely upon, to set forth the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the Love of Christ, to render it <hi>admirable</hi> and <hi>amiable</hi> unto us; And these things should we lay up in our Hearts and continually ponder them, that we may give due Acceptance and entertainment to this wonderful Love of the Son of God.</p>

                        <p>These words we have already opened, as to their sense and importance. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and <hi>meaning</hi> of the Holy Ghost in them is nextly to be considered. The things to be enquired after to this End, are; <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>scope</hi> of the Apostle in these words: <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>manner of his expressing</hi> his intendment; and the particulars therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What he <hi>related</hi> unto in the <hi>Mosaical Oeconomy,</hi> whereby he strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Argument</hi> which he had in hand.</p>
                        <p>Two things the Apostle in general <hi>designs</hi> in these words:</p>
                        <p>First, That the Lord Christ undertaking to <hi>purge our sins,</hi> did by the one offering of himself <hi>perfectly</hi> effect it, so discharging the whole work of his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> as to the making <hi>Attonement</hi> for sinners. This the blessed issue of his undertaking doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate; Immediately upon his work, he entered into the <hi>Glorious Condition</hi> here expressed; a signal pledge and Evidence that his Work was <hi>perfected,</hi> and that God was fully satisfied, and well pleased with what he had done.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The <hi>blessed and Glorious Condition</hi> of the Lord Jesus after his Humiliation
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50110:207"/>
is expressed in these words. His Spirit did of old signifie both his <hi>sufferings</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> that should follow, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. as himself interpreted the <hi>Scriptures unto his Disciples, Luke</hi> 24.26. And this upon the close of his work, he requested as due unto him upon Compact and Promise, <hi>John</hi> 17.5. These are the things in general designed by the Apostle in these words.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Manner of his Expression</hi> of the Glory and blessed Condition of the Son of God after his <hi>purging our sins,</hi> and what is <hi>particularly</hi> intimated therein, is to be considered. Some <hi>mistakes,</hi> or groundless <hi>curiosities</hi> must first be removed, and then the <hi>real</hi> importance of the words declared.</p>
                        <p>Some contend, that the <hi>Left</hi> Hand of old was most honourable; so that the placing of Christ at the <hi>Right</hi> Hand of God, as it denotes his Honour and Glory, so also an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority</hi> unto the Father. To this purpose they produce some <hi>sayings</hi> out of some antient Writers among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> giving the preference of place or dignity unto the <hi>Left</hi> Hand. As these sayings are made use of by the <hi>Romanists,</hi> to answer an Objection of very little moment against <hi>Peters Supremacy,</hi> taken from some antient <hi>Episcopal Seals,</hi> wherein the figure of <hi>Paul</hi> was placed on the Right Hand of that of <hi>Peter.</hi> But this conjecture may be easily disproved by <hi>Testimonies innumerable</hi> out of approved Authors among the <hi>Gentiles</hi>: And in Scripture the <hi>Right Hand</hi> doth constantly denote Dignity and Preheminence. The instance of <hi>Jacobs</hi> blessing <hi>Josephs</hi> Children testifies also the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant usage of those antient times from the intimation of nature it self, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.17, 18, 19. And the disposal of the <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> at the last day, to the <hi>Right</hi> hand and Left, gives the Priviledge to the former. So <hi>Basil,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>: <hi>the right hand place denoteth a quality of dignity.</hi> And <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Some, granting the <hi>Right Hand</hi> to denote the most <hi>honourable place,</hi> enquire whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be spoken in reference unto God the Father himself, or unto others that do or may be supposed to sit on his <hi>left hand.</hi> For the first sense contends <hi>Maldonate</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. For saith he, <hi>though it be impossible that the Son in absolute or Essential Glory should be preferred before or above the Father, yet as to his immediate Rule over the Church, he may more shew forth his Power and Glory in the Rule and Government of all things.</hi> Others contend that it is spoken with respect unto sitting at the <hi>left</hi> hand, above which, this is preferred. But this whole enquiry, is both curious and groundless, For First, Though <hi>sitting at the Right Hand</hi> be a token of great Glory and Dignity, yet as the Apostle speaks in this very case, it is manifest that <hi>he is excepted who put all things under him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. He who thus <hi>exalted him</hi> over all at his right hand is excepted: and Secondly, Here is no comparison at all, or regard to sitting on the <hi>left hand,</hi> nor is there so where ever that expression is used, but only the Glory of Christ the Mediator is absolutely declared.</p>
                        <p>And this may be cleared by other instances. <hi>Solomon</hi> placed his <hi>Mother</hi> when she came unto him on his <hi>Right Hand</hi>; a token of exceeding Honour; but he himself sate down on the <hi>Throne</hi> of the Kingdom, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.19. The <hi>Church</hi> is said to be at the <hi>Right Hand of Christ, Psalm</hi> 45.9. which as it prefers her above all others, so it takes not off, her <hi>subjection</hi> unto Christ. <hi>Nero</hi> in <hi>Suetonius</hi> when <hi>Tirid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence <hi>Cato</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi> when <hi>Juba</hi> would have placed himself in the midst between him and <hi>Scipio,</hi> removed himself to the left hand of <hi>Scipio,</hi> that <hi>Juba</hi> might not have the place of preheminence above <hi>Roman</hi> Magistrates.</p>
                        <p>It is not unlikely but that there may be an Allusion in this expression unto the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin</hi> the highest Court of <hi>Judicature</hi> among the Jews. He who presided in it was called <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>The whole Expression then is plainly <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> and taken from what is, or was in use amongst men, and thence translated to signifie the <hi>State</hi> and Condition of Christ
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50110:208"/>
in Heaven. And this is that which the <hi>Apostle</hi> in general intimates in these words, that as the <hi>greatest Honour</hi> that can be done unto any one among the sons of men, is for the <hi>Chief Ruler</hi> to set him next himself on his <hi>Right Hand,</hi> so is the Son as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, made <hi>partaker of the greatest glory</hi> that God hath to bestow in Heaven. It is not then the <hi>Essential Eternal Glory</hi> of the Son of God, that he hath equal with the Father, which in these words is expressed, and whereof the <hi>Apostle</hi> had spoken before; but that Glory and Honour which is bestowed on <hi>him by the Father,</hi> after and upon the Sacrifice of himself for the Expiation of sin. So then, the <hi>Right hand</hi> of God is not here taken <hi>absolutely,</hi> as in other places, for the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> of God, but with the adjunct of <hi>sitting at it,</hi> it shadows out a place and eminency of Glory, as he is considered on his <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Majesty:</hi> and therefore it is here termed the <hi>Right hand</hi> of Majesty, and not of Omnipotency or Power.</p>
                        <p>In particular, two things are intended in this Expression.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Security</hi> of Christ from all his Adversaries, and all sufferings for the future. The <hi>Jews</hi> knew what he suffered from God and Man. Hereof he lets them know what was the reason, it was for the <hi>purging of our sins.</hi> And moreover declares, that now he is <hi>everlastingly secured</hi> from all Opposition, for where he is, thither his <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries cannot come</hi>; as <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.34. He is above their reach, beyond their power, <hi>secure</hi> in the Throne and Presence of God. Thus the fruit of the Church, being <hi>secured</hi> from the rage and persecution of Sathan, is said to be <hi>caught up unto God, and to his throne, Rev.</hi> 12.5. Hence though men do, and will continue their <hi>malice</hi> and wrath against the Lord Christ to the end of the world, as though they would <hi>crucifie him afresh</hi>; yet he dies no more, being <hi>secure</hi> out of their reach at the Right hand of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> His <hi>Majesty and Glory</hi> inexpressible. All that can be given of God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. God on <hi>his Throne,</hi> is God in the full <hi>manifestation of his own Majesty</hi> and Glory; on his <hi>Right hand</hi> sits the Mediator; yea so, as that he also is in the <hi>midst of the Thrones, Revel.</hi> 5.6. How little can our weak understandings apprehend of this <hi>Majesty?</hi> See <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.20.</p>
                        <p>These are the things which the <hi>Apostle</hi> sets forth in this Expression. And they are plainly intimated in the Context of the <hi>Psalm</hi> from whence the words are taken, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.1. So that it is not his <hi>Rule</hi> and Authority, but his <hi>Safety, Majesty</hi> and Glory which accompany them, that are here intended.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are to enquire what it was that the Apostle had <hi>respect</hi> unto in this Ascription of <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majesty</hi> unto Christ in the old Church state of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and so what it is that he <hi>preferreth</hi> him above.</p>
                        <p>It is thought by many, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> in these words exalteth Christ above <hi>David,</hi> the chiefest <hi>King</hi> among the Jews. Of him it is said, that God would make him his <hi>first-born, higher than the Kings of the earth, Psal.</hi> 89.27. His <hi>Throne</hi> was high on the earth, and his Glory above that of all the Kings about him, but for the <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> he is incomparably exalted above him also, in that he is <hi>sate down</hi> at the <hi>Right hand</hi> of the Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sty on High. But, as was said, these words denote not the <hi>Rule,</hi> Power, or Authority of Christ, <hi>typed</hi> by the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi>; but his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the <hi>magnificent</hi> Throne of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Besides, he is not treating of the <hi>Kingly Power</hi> of Christ, but of his <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Office, and the Glory that ensued upon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thereof.</p>
                        <p>That therefore which in these words the Apostle <hi>seems</hi> to have had respect unto, was the <hi>high Priests</hi> entrance into the Holy Place, after his offering of the <hi>solemn anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary</hi> Sacrifice of Expiation. Then alone was he admitted into that <hi>Holy Place,</hi> or Heaven below; where was the solemn Representation of the Presence of God, his <hi>Throne</hi> and his Glory. And what did he there? He <hi>stood</hi> with all Humility and lowly Reverence ministring before the Lord, whose presence was there represented. He did not go and <hi>sit down</hi> between the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> but worshipping at the <hi>foot-stool</hi> of the Lord, he departed. It is not, saith the Apostle, <hi>so</hi> with Christ; but as his Sacrifice was infinitely more <hi>excellent,</hi> and effectual than theirs, so upon the offering of it, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the <hi>Holy Place,</hi> or Heaven it self above, and into the <hi>real glorious presence of God,</hi> not to minister in humility, but to a participation of the <hi>Throne</hi> of Majesty and Glory. He is a King and Priest upon his Throne, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13.</p>
                        <p>Thus the <hi>Apostle</hi> shuts up his general Proposition of the whole matter, which he intends farther to dilate and treat upon. In this description of the Person and Offices of the Messiah, he coucheth the springs of all his <hi>ensuing Arguments,</hi> and from thence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50110:208"/>
the <hi>Exhortation</hi> which we have observed him constantly to pursue. And we also may hence observe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is nothing more vain, foolish and fruitless, than the Opposition which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and his Agents yet make unto the Lord Christ and his Kingdom.</hi> Can they ascend into heaven? Can they pluck the Lord Christ from the Throne of God? A little time will manifest this madness, and that unto Eternity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>That the service of the Lord Christ is both safe and honourable.</hi> He is, as a Good, so a glorious Master; one that sits at the Right Hand of God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Great is the spiritual and eternal security of them that truly believe in Christ.</hi> Of all which severally afterwards.</p>

                        <head>Verse IV.</head>
                        <p>THE design of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> as we have now <hi>often</hi> shewed, is to evince the necessity of abiding in the Doctrine of the Gospel, from the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the Person by whom it pleased God to reveal it unto us. This he hath done already in general, in that <hi>Description</hi> which he hath given us of his Person, Power, Works, Offices and Glory; whereby he hath made it evident, that <hi>no creature,</hi> whom God was pleased at any time to make <hi>use of</hi> in the Revelation of his Will, or the Institution of his Worship, was any way to be compared with him. Having proceeded thus far in <hi>general,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends now to the consideration of <hi>particular</hi> instances, in all those whom God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in the Ministration of the <hi>Law,</hi> and constitution of <hi>Mosaical</hi> Worship, and takes occasion from them all to set forth the <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>incomparable</hi> Excellencies of the Lord Christ, whom in all things he exalts.</p>
                        <p>First then, he treateth concerning <hi>Angels,</hi> as those who were the most <hi>glorious creatures</hi> imployed in the giving of the <hi>Law.</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> owned, yea pleaded this in their own defence, That besides the Mediation of <hi>Moses,</hi> God used the Ministery of <hi>Angels</hi> in the <hi>giving</hi> of the Law, and in other <hi>occasional</hi> instructions of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. Some of them contend that the <hi>last</hi> of the Prophets was <hi>personally an Angel,</hi> as the signification of his name imports. Holy <hi>Stephen</hi> upbraiding them with their abuse and contempt of their greatest priviledges, tells them that they <hi>received the Law by the disposition,</hi> ordering, or ministery <hi>of Angels, Acts</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 53. And the <hi>Targum</hi> interprets the <hi>Chariots of God</hi> with the <hi>thousands of Angels, Psal.</hi> 68.18, 19. of the Angels, by whose <hi>ministery</hi> God taught <hi>Israel</hi> the Law. This then might leave a special <hi>prejudice</hi> in their minds, that the <hi>Law</hi> being so <hi>delivered by Angels,</hi> must needs have therein the advantage above the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and be therefore excellent and <hi>immutable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To remove this <hi>prejudice</hi> also, and further to declare the <hi>Excellency</hi> and Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in all things of him who revealed the Gospel, the Apostle takes occasion from what he had newly taught them concerning the <hi>Exaltation of Jesus Christ</hi> at the Right Hand of God, to prove unto them <hi>out of the Scriptures of the Old Testament,</hi> that he is exceedingly advanced, and glorious above the <hi>Angels</hi> themselves, whose concurrence in the Ministration of the <hi>Law</hi> they boasted in; and to this purpose produceth <hi>four signal testimonies</hi> one after another.</p>
                        <p>This is the design of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> which he pursues and makes out unto the end of this <hi>Chapter</hi>; and that we may rightly conceive of his intention, and the <hi>meaning</hi> of the Holy Ghost in the whole, we shall, before we consider his <hi>Proposition</hi> laid down in this <hi>fourth verse,</hi> or the ensuing confirmations of it, enquire in general what it is in Christ which he <hi>compareth</hi> with, and <hi>preferreth</hi> above the <hi>Angels,</hi> and wherein it is that he so exalts him.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>comparison</hi> entred on between the Lord Christ and <hi>Angels,</hi> must be either with respect unto their <hi>Natures,</hi> or unto their <hi>Dignity,</hi> Office, Power and Glory. If the comparison be of <hi>Nature</hi> with <hi>Nature,</hi> then it must be either in respect of the <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi> Nature of Christ. If it should be of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> of Christ, with the <hi>Nature</hi> of Angels, then it is not a comparison of <hi>Proportion,</hi> as between <hi>two Natures</hi> agreeing in any general kind of being, as do the nature of a <hi>man</hi> and a <hi>worm</hi>; but a <hi>comparison</hi> only manifesting a Difference and distance without any Proportion. So answereth <hi>Athanasius, Orat.</hi> 2. and <hi>Arian.</hi> But the truth is, the Apostle hath no design to prove by <hi>Arguments and Testimonies</hi> the Excellency of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> above the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50110:209"/>
                           <hi>Angelical.</hi> There was no need so to do, nor do his <hi>Testimonies</hi> prove any such thing. Besides, speaking of <hi>Angels,</hi> the other part of the comparison, he treats not of their <hi>Nature,</hi> but their <hi>Office,</hi> Work and Employment; with their honourable and glorious Condition therein. Whereas therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> produceth sundry <hi>Testimonies,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the <hi>Deity</hi> of the Son, he doth it not <hi>absolutely</hi> to prove the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> to be more excellent that the <hi>Angelica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>,</hi> but only to manifest thereby the glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of him, who is partaker of it, and <hi>consequently</hi> his Preheminence above <hi>Angels,</hi> or the Equity that it should be so.</p>
                        <p>Neither is the <hi>comparison</hi> between the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of Christ and the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi>: For that absolutely considered and in it self, is <hi>inferiour</hi> to the <hi>Angelical</hi>; whence in regard of his Participation of it, he is said to be made <hi>lower than the Angels, chap.</hi> 2.</p>
                        <p>The Apostle then treats of the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> God and Man, who was appointed and designed of God the Father, to be the <hi>Revealer of the Gospel,</hi> and Mediator of the New Testament. As such, he is the <hi>subject</hi> of the ensuing general Proposition; as <hi>such,</hi> he was spoken of in the words immediately fore-going; and concerning him as <hi>such,</hi> are the ensuing testimonies to be interpreted; even those which testifie his <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> being produced to demonstrate the <hi>Excellency of his Person,</hi> as vested with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the King, Priest and Prophet of his Church, the <hi>great Revealer</hi> of the will of God in the last days.</p>

                           <hi>Being in so much preferred</hi> (exalted, made eminent) <hi>above Angels, as he</hi> (obtained) <hi>inherited a more excellent name than they.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are five things considerable in, and for the Exposition of these words.</p>
                        <p>First, What it is that the <hi>Apostle</hi> asserts in them as his general Proposition; namely, that the <hi>Son,</hi> as the great Priest and Prophet of the Church, was <hi>preferred above,</hi> and made more <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> than the <hi>Angels</hi>; and how this was done, and wherein it doth consist.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>When</hi> he was so preferred above them; which belongs unto the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and right understanding of the former.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Degree</hi> of this <hi>preference</hi> of him above the Angels, intimated in the <hi>comparison</hi>; being by <hi>so much</hi> made <hi>more excellent,</hi> as he hath, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly. The <hi>Proof</hi> of the Assertion, both absolutely, and as to the Degree inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated; and this is taken from <hi>his Name.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fifthly, The <hi>way</hi> whereby he came to have this Name; he <hi>obtained it</hi> as his lot and portion, or he <hi>inherited</hi> it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="73" facs="tcp:50110:209"/>First, He is <hi>made more excellent than the Angels,</hi> preferred above them; that is, say some, <hi>declared</hi> so to be. <hi>Tum res dicitur fieri, cum incipit patesieri.</hi> Frequently in tho Scripture, a thing is <hi>then</hi> said to be <hi>made,</hi> or to <hi>be,</hi> when it is <hi>manifested</hi> so to be. And in this sense the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> is sometimes used. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; <hi>Let God be true, and every man a liar</hi>; that is, <hi>manifested</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged so to be. So, <hi>James</hi> 1.12. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, he that is approved in trial, and thereby <hi>manifested</hi> to be sincere and sound. In this sense the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. that the Lord Christ was <hi>declared to be the Son of God by the resurrection from the dead.</hi> The resurrection from the dead did not <hi>make him</hi> to be the Son of God, but evidently <hi>manifested</hi> and declared him so to be. According to this interpretation of the words, that which the holy Ghost intimateth is, That whereas the Lord Christ mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred in an outwardly <hi>low</hi> condition in this world, whilst he <hi>purged our sins,</hi> yet by his <hi>sitting down</hi> at the right hand of God, he was revealed, <hi>manifested,</hi> declared to be <hi>more excellent</hi> than all the Angels in heaven.</p>
                        <p>But I see no reason why we should desert the <hi>proper</hi> and most usual signification of the word, nothing in the <hi>Context</hi> perswading us so to do. Besides, this suits not the <hi>Apostles</hi> design, who doth not prove from the Scripture that the Lord Christ was <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested</hi> to be more excellent than the Angels, but that really he was <hi>preferred</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above them.</p>
                        <p>So then, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> is as much as <hi>preferred, exalted,</hi> actually placed,<note place="margin">
                              <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>.</note> in more Power, Glory, Dignity, than the Angels. This <hi>John Baptist</hi> affirms of him, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>He was preferred before me, because he was before me.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred above him, called to another manner of <hi>Office</hi> than that which <hi>John</hi> ministred in; <hi>made before</hi> or above him in Dignity, because he was <hi>before</hi> him in Nature and Existence. And this is the proper sense of the words; The Lord Jesus Christ, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer of the Will of God in the Gospel, is exalted above, <hi>preferred</hi> before, made <hi>more excellent</hi> and glorious than the Angels themselves, all or any of them, who ministred unto the Lord in the giving of the <hi>Law</hi> on mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some object unto this Interpretation, That he who is said to be <hi>made</hi> or <hi>set</hi> above the Angels, is supposed to have been <hi>lower</hi> than they before: To which I answer, And <hi>so</hi> he was, not in respect of <hi>Essence, Subsistence,</hi> and real Dignity, but in respect of the <hi>infirmities and sufferings</hi> that he was exposed unto, in the discharge of his word here on the earth; as the Apostle expresly declares, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And this gives us light into our <hi>second enquiry</hi> on these words; namely, <hi>When</hi> it was, that Christ was thus exalted above the Angels.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Some</hi> say, that it was in the <hi>time of his Incarnation</hi>; for then the Humane Nature being taken into <hi>Personal subsistence</hi> with the Son of God, it became <hi>more excellent</hi> than that of the Angels. This sense is fixed on by some of the <hi>Antients,</hi> who are followed by sundry <hi>Modern</hi> Expositors. But we have proved before, that it is not of <hi>either Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of Christ absolutely or abstractedly, that the Apostle here speaketh; nor of his <hi>Person,</hi> but as <hi>vested</hi> with his Office; and discharging of it. And moreover the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of Christ was part of his <hi>Humiliation</hi> and Exinanition, and is not therefore especially intended, where his <hi>Exaltation</hi> and Glory is expresly spoken of.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Some</hi> say, that it was at the time of his <hi>Baptism,</hi> when he was anointed with the Spirit, for the discharge of his <hi>Prophetical Office, Isa.</hi> 60.1, 2. But yet neither can this Designation of the <hi>time</hi> be allowed. And that because the main things wherein he was <hi>made lower</hi> than the Angels, as his temptations, and sufferings, and death it self, did <hi>follow</hi> his <hi>Baptism</hi> and Unction.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It must therefore be the time of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> Ascension, and Exaltation at the Right hand of God, which ensued thereon, that is designed as the <hi>season</hi> wherein he was made <hi>more excellent</hi> than the Angels, as evidently appears from the Text and Context.</p>
                        <p>For, 1. That was the <hi>Time,</hi> as we have shewed before, when he was gloriously vested with that <hi>All Power</hi> in heaven and earth, which was of old designed unto him, and prepared for him. 2. The <hi>Order</hi> also of the Apostles discourse leads us to fix on this <hi>season.</hi> After he <hi>had by himself purged our sins,</hi> he <hi>sat down,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Being made so much more excellent</hi>; that is, <hi>therein,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> he was so made. 3. The <hi>Testimony</hi> in the first place produced by the Apostle in the confirmation of his Assertion, is elsewhere, as we shall see, applied by himself unto his <hi>Resurrection</hi> and the Glory that ensued, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently they are also in this place intended. 4. This <hi>Preference</hi> of the Lord Christ above the Angels, is plainly included in that Grant of <hi>All Power</hi> made unto him,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50110:210"/>
                           <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. expounded <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.21, 22. 5. The <hi>Testimony</hi> used by the Apostle in the first place, is the word that God spake unto his <hi>King,</hi> when he set him upon <hi>his holy Hill of Sion, Psal.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. which <hi>typically</hi> expresseth his glorious Enstalment in his heavenly Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The Lord Christ then, who in respect of his <hi>Divine Nature</hi> was always infinitely and incomparably himself <hi>more excellent</hi> than all the Angels, after his Humiliation in the Assumption of the <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> with the sufferings and temptations that he underwent, upon his <hi>Resurrection</hi> was exalted into a condition of Glory, Power, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Excellency, and entrusted with Power <hi>over them,</hi> as our <hi>Apostle</hi> here informs us.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In this <hi>Preference</hi> and Exaltation of the Lord Christ, there is a <hi>Degree</hi> intimated; being made <hi>so much more,</hi> &amp;c. now our conceptions hereabout, as to this place, are wholly to be <hi>regulated</hi> by the <hi>Name</hi> given unto him. Look, saith the Apostle, how much the <hi>Name</hi> given unto the <hi>Messiah,</hi> excels the <hi>Name</hi> given unto <hi>Angels,</hi> so much doth he himself excell them in Glory, Authority and Power; for these <hi>Names</hi> are severally given them of God, to signifie <hi>their state</hi> and condition. What, and how great this difference is, we shall afterwards see, in the consideration of the Instances given of it by the <hi>Apostle</hi> in the Verses ensuing.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The <hi>Proof</hi> of this Assertion which the Apostle first fixeth on, is taken from the <hi>Name</hi> of Christ. His <hi>Name,</hi> not <hi>given</hi> him by man, not <hi>assumed</hi> by himself, but ascribed unto him by God himself. Neither doth he here by the <hi>Name</hi> of Christ, or the <hi>name</hi> of the Angels, intend any individual <hi>proper names</hi> of the one or the other; but such <hi>Descriptions</hi> as are made of them, and Titles given unto them by God, as whereby their state and condition may be known. Observe, saith he, how they are <hi>called</hi> of God; by what <hi>Names</hi> and Titles he owns them, and you may learn the <hi>Difference</hi> between them. This Name he declares in the next Verse; God said unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> It is not absolutely his <hi>being the Son</hi> of God that is intended; but that by the testimony of the holy Ghost, God said these words unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi> and thereby declared his state and condition to be far above that of the Angels, to none of whom he ever said any such thing, but speaks of them in a far distinct manner, as we shall see. But hereof in the next Verse.</p>
                        <p>Some by this <hi>excellent Name</hi> understand his Power, and Dignity, and Glory, called <hi>his name above every name, Phil.</hi> 2.8. but then this can no way prove that which the Apostle produceth it for, it being directly the same with that which is asserted, in whose confirmation it is produced.</p>
                        <p n="5">5.<note place="margin">

                              </gap>.</note> The last thing considerable is, <hi>How</hi> the Lord Christ <hi>came by this Name,</hi> or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; he obtained it by <hi>Inheritance,</hi> as his peculiar lot and portion for ever. In what sense he is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the <hi>Heir,</hi> was before declared. As he was made the <hi>Heir of all,</hi> so he inherited a more <hi>excellent Name</hi> than the Angels. Now he was made <hi>Heir of all,</hi> in that all things being made and formed by him, the Father <hi>committed</hi> unto him as Mediator a peculiar <hi>Power</hi> over all things, to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of by him unto all the ends of his Mediation. So also being the Natural and Eternal Son of God, in, and upon the discharge of his work, the Father declared and pronounced <hi>that to be his Name</hi>; see <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>Isa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.6. His <hi>being</hi> the Son of God, is the proper foundation of his <hi>being called</hi> so; and his discharge of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the <hi>Occasion</hi> of its <hi>declaration</hi>: so he came unto it by Right of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> when he was declared to be the Son of God with Power, <hi>by the resurrection from the dead, Rom.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                        <p>This then is the sum of the <hi>Apostles</hi> Proposition, and the Confirmation of it. A <hi>Name</hi> given by God to that end and purpose, doth truly declare the <hi>nature,</hi> state and condition of him or them to whom it is given. But unto Christ the Mediator there is a <hi>Name</hi> given of God himself, exceedingly <hi>more excellent</hi> than any that by him is given unto the <hi>Angels</hi>; which undeniably evinceth, that he is placed in a <hi>state and condition</hi> of Glory far above them, or <hi>preferred before them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I shall only observe one or two things, concerning the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle wrote, and so put an end to our Exposition of this Verse.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First</hi> then, this discourse of the <hi>Apostle</hi> proving the <hi>Preheminence</hi> of the <hi>Messiah</hi> above the <hi>Angels,</hi> was very necessary unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> although it were very suitable unto their own principles, and in general acknowledged by them. It is to this day a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> amongst them, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> shall be exalted above <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>ministring Angels.</hi> Besides, they acknowledged the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi>
                           <pb n="75" facs="tcp:50110:210"/>
wherein the <hi>Apostle</hi> shews them that this Truth was taught and confirmed. But they were <hi>dull and flow</hi> in making Application of these Principles unto the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their faith in the Gospel, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> chargeth them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.11, 12. And they had at that time great <hi>Speculations,</hi> about the Glory Dignity and Excellency of <hi>Angels,</hi> and were fallen into some kind of <hi>worshipping</hi> of them. And it may be this <hi>Curiosity</hi> Vanity and Superstition in them, was heightned by the heat of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> about them; the one denying their <hi>Existence</hi> and being, the other whom the body of the People followed, <hi>ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And of their Ministry in the giving of the Law they still boasted. It was necessary therefore, to take them off from this Confidence of that <hi>Priviledge,</hi> and the superstition that ensued thereon, to instruct them in the <hi>Preheminence</hi> of the Lord Christ above them all; that so their thoughts might be directed unto him, and their <hi>Trust</hi> placed in him alone.

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <p>The Doctrine of the <hi>Preference and Preheminence</hi> of Christ is insisted on by the Apostle unto the End of this Chapter; and therefore I shall not treat of it, untill we have gone through all the <hi>Proof's</hi> of it produced; and then but briefly neither, having already in part spoken of it, in our Consideration of his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and Lordship over all.</p>
                        <p>That which we are peculiarly instructed in by these words is, that,</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>All Preheminence and Exaltation of one above others, depends on the supream Counsel and Will of God.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <p>The instance he gives of him who is exalted over all, sufficiently confirms our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule. He had his <hi>Name,</hi> denoting his Glory and excellency by <hi>Inheritance</hi>; an heritage designed for him, and given unto him in the Counsel, Will and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50110:211"/>
of God: He gave him that <hi>name above every name, Phil.</hi> 2.9. And that of his own Will and pleasure; <hi>It pleased the Father, that in him all fulness should dwell.</hi> That so in all things he might have the Preheminence, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17. He <hi>fore-ordained</hi> him unto it from Eternity, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. and actually exalted him according to his Eternal Counsel in the fulness of time, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.31.</p>
                        <p>This Prelation then of Christ above all, depends on the <hi>Counsel</hi> and Pleasure of God; and he is herein a Pattern of all <hi>Priviledge</hi> and Preheminence in others.</p>
                        <p>Grace, Mercy and Glory, spiritual things, and eternal, are those wherein really there is any <hi>difference</hi> among the Sons of men. Now that any one in these things is <hi>preferred</hi> before another, it depends meerly on the sole good pleasure of God. No man in these things makes himself to <hi>differ</hi> from another, neither hath he any thing that he hath not received. God hath Mercy on whom he will have mercy. And this <hi>Discrimination</hi> of all things by the Supream Will of God, especially Spiritual and Eternal, is the Spring, Fountain and Rule of all that Glory which he will manifest, and be exalted in, unto Eternity.</p>

                        <p>Two things are considerable in these words.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>manner</hi> of the Apostles producing the Testimony which he intended to make use of. <hi>Vnto which of the Angels said he at any time.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Testimony</hi> it self; <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the former, three things may be observed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> That the Testimonie which in a matter of Faith he insisted on, is that of the Scripture. He refers the <hi>Jews</hi> unto that common Principle which was acknowledged between them. Men had not as yet learned in such contests to make that <hi>cavilling</hi> return, which we are now used unto; <hi>How do you know those Scriptures to be the word of God</hi>? Nor indeed is it suitable unto <hi>common Honesty,</hi> for men to question the credit, and prostitute the Authority of their <hi>own</hi> most Sacred Principles, for no other end, but to prejudice their Adversaries. But our <hi>Apostle</hi> here confidently sends the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to the acknowledged Rule of their Faith and Worship; whose Authority he knew they would not decline, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.21.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Apostle</hi> argues <hi>negatively</hi> from the Authority and Perfection of the Scripture in things relating to Faith and the Worship of God. It is <hi>no where said in the Scripture to Angels</hi>; therefore they have not the <hi>Name</hi> spoken of, or not in that <hi>manner</hi> wherein it is ascribed to the <hi>Messiah.</hi> This Argument saith an <hi>Expositor</hi> of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50110:211"/>
great name in this place, seems to be <hi>weak</hi> and not unlike unto that which the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> make use of in the like cases. And therefore answers, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> argues <hi>negatively,</hi> not only from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but from <hi>Tradition</hi> also. But this <hi>Answer</hi> is far more <hi>weak</hi> than the <hi>Argument</hi> is pretended to be. The <hi>Apostle</hi> deals expresly in all this Chapter from the <hi>Testimony</hi> of Scripture; and to that <hi>alone</hi> do his words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; and therein doth he issue the whole Controversie he had in hand; knowing that the <hi>Jews</hi> had many <hi>corrupt Traditions</hi> expresly contrary to what he undertook to prove; particularly, that the <hi>Law of Moses</hi> was Eternally Obligatory, against which he directly contends in the whole <hi>Epistle.</hi> An Argument then taken <hi>negatively</hi> from the Authority of the Scripture in matters of Faith, or what relates to the Worship of God, is valid and effectual, and here <hi>consecrated</hi> for ever to the use of the Church by the <hi>Apostle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the <hi>Apostle</hi> either inde<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d <hi>grants</hi> or else for Arguments sake <hi>condescends</hi> unto the Apprehension of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that there is a distinction of degrees and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence</hi> amongst the <hi>Angels</hi> themselves. To confirm therefore his general Assertion of the Dignity and <hi>Preheminence</hi> of Christ above them all, he provokes them to instance in any <hi>one</hi> of them, which either indeed, or in their <hi>Apprehension,</hi> was promoted above others, to whom such Words as these were ever <hi>spoken. To which of the Angels said he</hi>; his Assertion respects not only the <hi>community</hi> of them, but any, or all of the chief, or <hi>Princes</hi> among them. There are <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Chief Princes</hi> among the Angels. And of them <hi>Michael,</hi> the Prince of the People of God, is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>One</hi>; that is not in <hi>Order</hi>; but the chief in <hi>Dignity,</hi> their Head and Leader. Now saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> to which of any of these, or of the rest of them, were these words spoken?</p>
                        <p>Proceed we now to the <hi>Testimony</hi> its self produced. Three things are required to make it <hi>pertinent</hi> unto his Purpose, and <hi>useful</hi> unto the End for which he makes mention of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>He</hi> of whom he speaks was peculiarly <hi>intended</hi> therein.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there be in it an <hi>Assignation of a Name</hi> unto him made by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which thereon he might claim as his peculiar Inheritance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>this Name</hi> either absolutely, or in its peculiar manner of <hi>Appropriation</hi> unto him, is <hi>more excellent</hi> than any that was ever given unto Angels, as a sign of their Dignity, Authority, and Excellency.</p>
                        <p>And these things for the clearing of the <hi>Apostles</hi> Argument must particularly be insisted on.</p>
                        <p>First, The words produced do <hi>peculiarly</hi> belong unto him to whom they are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That is, it is the <hi>Messiah</hi> who is prophesied of in the <hi>second Psalm</hi> from whence they are taken. This with all Christians is put beyond dispute, by the <hi>Application</hi> of it in several places unto him: as <hi>Acts</hi> 4.25, 26, 27. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain also, that the <hi>Jews</hi> alwayes esteemed this <hi>Psalm</hi> to relate unto the Messiah, they do so to this day. Hence the <hi>Targum</hi> on the Psalm expresly applyes it unto him; thus rendring these words; <hi>O beloved, as a Son to his Father, thou art pure to me as in the day wherein I created thee.</hi> So are the words perverted by the <hi>Targumist</hi>; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what sense to ascribe unto them, which is frequent with him. But it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that the constant Opinion of the antient <hi>Jews,</hi> was that this Psalm principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the <hi>Messiah</hi>; nor did any of them of old dissent. Some of their latter <hi>Masters</hi> are otherwise minded; but therein discover their obstinacy and iniquity.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Rabbi Solomon Jarchi</hi> in his Comment on this Psalm, in the <hi>Venetian Edition</hi> of the great <hi>Masoretical</hi> Bibles, affirms, that what ever is sung in this Psalm, our <hi>Masters</hi> interpreted of <hi>Messiah</hi> the King; but saith he, <hi>according unto the sound of the words, and for the confutation of the Hereticks</hi> (that is, Christians) <hi>it is convenient that we expound it of David.</hi> So wickedly corrupt and partial are they now in their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the Scripture. But these words are left out in the <hi>Basil Edition</hi> of the same Notes and Comments, by the fraud it may be of the Jews employed in that work, so to hide the <hi>dishonesty</hi> of one of their great Masters. But the confession of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their <hi>Fathers</hi> or <hi>Predecessors</hi> in this matter, is therein also extant. And <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> though he would apply it unto <hi>David,</hi> yet speaks doubtfully whether it may not better be ascribed unto the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this was not <hi>enough</hi> for the Apostle, that those with whom he dealt <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged</hi> these words to be spoken concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> unless they were so really,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50110:212"/>
that so his Argument might proceed <hi>ex veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>,</hi> as well as <hi>ex concessis,</hi> from what was <hi>true,</hi> as upon what was <hi>granted.</hi> This then we must next enquire into.</p>
                        <p>The whole <hi>Psalm</hi> say some, seems principally, if not only to intend <hi>David.</hi> He having taken the Hill and <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi> and setled it for the seat of his Kingdom; the Nations round about <hi>tumultuated</hi> against him; and some of them as the <hi>Philistines</hi> presently engaged in War against him for his ruine, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.17. To declare how vain all their <hi>Attempts</hi> should be, and the certainty of Gods purpose in raising him to the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> and for his preservation therein against all his adversaries, with the indignation of God against them, the Holy Ghost gave out this <hi>Psalm</hi> for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Establishment of the Church in the perswasion of so great a mercy. And this is borrowed of <hi>Rashi.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But suppose the <hi>Psalm</hi> to have a farther resp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap> than unto <hi>David</hi> and his temporal Kingdom, and that it doth point at the <hi>Messiah</hi> under the Type of <hi>David,</hi> yet then also what ever is spoken in it, must <hi>firstly</hi> and properly be understood of <hi>David.</hi> So that if the words insisted on by the Apostle do prove that the Lord Christ was made <hi>more excellent</hi> than the Angels, they prove the same concerning <hi>David</hi> also, concerning whom they were spoken in the first place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. There is no <hi>cogent Reason</hi> why we should acknowledge <hi>David</hi> and his Kingdom to be at all intended in this Psalm. The <hi>Apostles</hi> we see apply it unto the Lord Christ without any mention of <hi>David,</hi> and that <hi>four</hi> several times; Twice in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and twice in this <hi>Epistle.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledge that it belongs unto the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Besides there are sundry things spoken in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> that could never truly and properly be applyed unto <hi>David.</hi> Such are the <hi>Promises, v.</hi> 8, 9. and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of all men to <hi>put their Trust and Confidence</hi> in him, <hi>v.</hi> 12. And we have a Rule given us by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that where any thing seems to be spoken of any one, to whom it doth not <hi>properly</hi> belong, there the Person is not at all to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, but the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> himself immediately. This Rule <hi>Peter</hi> gives us in his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the sixteenth Psalm, and his Application of it unto the Lord <hi>Jesus, Acts</hi> 2.29, 30, 31. So that there is no necessity to grant that there is any reference in these words to any <hi>Type</hi> at all. But,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> We grant the <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ, and that as he was <hi>King</hi> of the people of God. Hence he is not only often signally called the <hi>Son of David,</hi> but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> also, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.24, 25. <hi>Hos.</hi> 3.5. And the Throne and Kingdom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to <hi>David</hi> for ever and ever, that it should be as the <hi>Sun, and established for ever as the Moon, Psal.</hi> 89.36, 37. that is, whilest the world endures, had no Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but in the Throne and Kingdom of his Son <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Thus also many other things are said of him and his Kingdom, which in <hi>Propriety</hi> of Speech can no way be applyed unto him, but as he was a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ, and represented him to the Church; We may then grant, as that about which we will not contend, that in this <hi>Psalm</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration was had of <hi>David</hi> and his Kingdom, but not <hi>absolutely,</hi> but only as a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ. And hence two things will follow.</p>
                        <p>First, That some things may be spoken in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> which no way respect the <hi>Type</hi> at all. For when not the <hi>Type,</hi> but the Person or thing <hi>signified</hi> is principally aimed at, it is not necessary that every thing spoken thereof should be applicable properly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Type</hi> it self; It being sufficient that there was in the <hi>Type</hi> somewhat that bare a general Resemblance unto <hi>him,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> which was principally intended. So on the contrary; where the <hi>Type</hi> is principally intended, and an <hi>Application</hi> made to the thing signified only, by way of general Allusion; there it is not required that all the <hi>particulars</hi> assigned unto the <hi>Type,</hi> should belong unto, or be accommodated unto the <hi>thing typed</hi> out; as we shall see in the next <hi>Testimony</hi> cited by the <hi>Apostle.</hi> Hence though in general <hi>David,</hi> and his Deliverance from trouble, with the Establishment of his Throne, might be respected in this <hi>Psalm,</hi> as an obscure <hi>Representation</hi> of the Kingdom of Christ, yet sundry particulars in it, and among them this mentioned by our Apostle, seem to have no <hi>respect</hi> unto him, but directly and immediately to intend the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, If it yet be supposed that what is here spoken, <hi>Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee,</hi> is also to be applyed unto <hi>David</hi>; yet it is not ascribed unto him <hi>Personally</hi> and absolutely, but meerly considered as a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ: What then is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50110:212"/>
and directly intended in the words, is to be sought for in <hi>Christ</hi> alone; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficient to preserve the Nature of the <hi>Type,</hi> that there was in <hi>David</hi> any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance or Representation of it.</p>
                        <p>Thus whether <hi>David</hi> be admitted as a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ in this Psalm or no, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the <hi>Apostle</hi> stands firm, that the words were principally and properly spoken of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and unto him. And this is the first thing required in the Application of the Testimony insisted on.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is required that in the <hi>Testimony</hi> produced, a <hi>signal Name</hi> be given unto the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and appropriated unto him, so as that he may <hi>inherit</hi> it for ever as his own; neither men nor <hi>Angels</hi> having the same interest with him in it. It is not being <hi>called</hi> by this or that <hi>name</hi> in common with others, that is intended; but such a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>Assignation</hi> of a Name unto him, as whereby he might for ever be distinguished from all others. Thus <hi>many</hi> may be <hi>beloved of the Lord,</hi> and be so termed; but yet <hi>Solomon</hi> only was peculiarly called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Jedediah</hi>; and by that name was distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from others. In this way it is that the <hi>Messiah</hi> hath this <hi>name</hi> assigned unto him. God decreed from Eternity that he should be <hi>called by that name</hi>; he spake unto him and <hi>called</hi> him by that name, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> He is not called the <hi>Son of God</hi> upon such a common account as Angels and Men, the one by <hi>Creation,</hi> the other by <hi>Adoption,</hi> but God peculiarly, and in a way of <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency</hi> gives this name unto him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This name must be such, as either <hi>absolutely,</hi> or by Reason of its peculiar manner of <hi>Appropriation</hi> unto the <hi>Messiah,</hi> proves his <hi>preheminence</hi> above the Angels. Now the Name designed, is the <hi>Son of God; Thou art my Son</hi>; not absolutely, but with that <hi>exegetical</hi> Adjunct of his generation, <hi>this day have I begotten thee. Chrysost. Hom.</hi> 22. on <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. positively denyes, that the Angels in Scripture are any where called the <hi>sons of God.</hi> Hence some conjecture, that the <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>LXX.</hi> is changed since that time; seeing it is evident that they are so called in the <hi>Greek Bibles</hi> now extant. However in the <hi>Original</hi> they are called the <hi>sons of God, Job</hi> 1.6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 38.7. <hi>Psalm</hi> 89.6. Believers are also called the <hi>sons of God, Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. And <hi>Magistrates</hi> Gods, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.1, 6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.34. It doth not therefore appear, how the meer <hi>assigning</hi> of this name to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> doth prove his preheminence above the Angels, who are also called by it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> Angels may be called the <hi>Sons of God</hi> upon a general Account, and by vertue of their Participation in some common Priviledge; as they are by Reason of their Creation, like <hi>Adam, Luke</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> and constant Obedience, <hi>Job</hi> 1. But it was never said unto <hi>any Angel personally</hi> upon his own account, <hi>thou art the son of God.</hi> God never said so unto any of them; especially with the Reason of the Appellation annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>this day have I begotten thee.</hi> It is not then the <hi>general name</hi> of a <hi>Son,</hi> or the <hi>sons of God,</hi> that the Apostle instanceth in; but the <hi>peculiar Assignation</hi> of this Name unto the Lord Jesus on his own particular account, with the Reason of it annexed, <hi>this day have I begotten thee,</hi> which is insisted on. So that here is an especial <hi>Appropriation</hi> of this Glorious Name unto the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Appropriation</hi> of this Name unto him in the manner expressed, proves his <hi>Dignity</hi> and Preheminence above all the Angels. For it is evident, that God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby to declare his <hi>singular Honour and Glory,</hi> giving him a name to denote it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that was never by him assigned unto any <hi>meer creature,</hi> as his peculiar Inheritance; in particular, not unto any of the <hi>Angels</hi>; not <hi>one</hi> of them can lay any claim unto it, as his peculiar <hi>Heritage</hi> from the Lord.</p>
                        <p>And this is the whole that was incumbent on the <hi>Apostle</hi> to prove by the Testimony produced. He manifests him sufficiently to be <hi>more excellent than the Angels,</hi> from the Excellency of the name which he inherits, according to his Proposition before laid down. There is indeed included in this reasoning of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> an intimation of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>Filiation</hi> and <hi>Sonship</hi> of Christ; had he not <hi>been so</hi> the Son of God, as never any Angel or other creature was, he never had been <hi>called so,</hi> in such a way as they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so called. But this the <hi>Apostle</hi> at present doth not expresly insist upon; only he intimates it as the foundation of his discourse.</p>
                        <p>To conclude then our Considerations of this <hi>Testimony,</hi> we shall briefly enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>sense</hi> of the words themselves, absolutely considered; although as I have shewed, that doth not belong directly unto the pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nt <hi>Argument</hi> of the Apostle.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:50110:213"/>
                           <hi>Expositors</hi> are much divided about the precise Intendment of these words; both as they are used in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> and variously applied by the <hi>Apostles.</hi> But yet generally the Expositions given of them are <hi>pious,</hi> and consistent with each other. I shall not insist long upon them, because as I said, their <hi>especial sense</hi> belongeth not unto the design and Argument of the Apostle.</p>
                        <p>That Christ is the <hi>Natural</hi> and Eternal Son of God, is agreed at this day by all Christians, save the <hi>Socinians.</hi> And he is <hi>called</hi> so, because he <hi>is</hi> so. The Formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he is so called, is <hi>one</hi> and the same; namely, his <hi>Eternal Sonship</hi>; but Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of <hi>actual</hi> ascribing that name unto him, there are many. And hence ariseth the difficulty that is found in the words. Some think those words, <hi>This day have I begotten thee,</hi> do contain the <hi>formal Reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>n</hi> of Christs being properly called the Son of God, and so to denote his <hi>Eternal Generation.</hi> Others think they express only some <hi>outward Act</hi> of God towards the Lord Christ, on the Occasion whereof he was <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi> to be the Son of God, and so <hi>called.</hi> The former way went <hi>Austin</hi> with sundry of the <hi>Antients.</hi> The <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the <hi>bodie,</hi> or <hi>this day,</hi> here was the same with them, which the <hi>nunc stans,</hi> as they call it, of <hi>Eternity</hi>; and the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>I have begotten thee,</hi> denotes as they say, the <hi>proper natural Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this doctrine is <hi>true,</hi> but whether here <hi>intended</hi> or no, is by some greatly questioned.</p>
                        <p>Others therefore, take the words to express only an <hi>Occasion</hi> of giving this name at a <hi>certain season</hi> to the Lord Christ when he was revealed, or declared to be the Son of God. And some assign this to the day of his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> when he declared him to be his Son, and that he should be so called, as <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. Some to the Day of his <hi>Baptism</hi> when he was again solemnly from Heaven proclaimed so to be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. Some to the Day of his <hi>Resurrection</hi> when he was declared to be the Son of God with Power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. and <hi>Acts</hi> 13.33. Some to the day of his <hi>Ascension,</hi> whereunto these words are applyed. And all these <hi>Interpretations</hi> are consistent, and reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with each other, in as much as they are all <hi>means</hi> serving unto the same end; That of his <hi>Resurrection</hi> from the <hi>dead</hi> being the most signal amongst them, and fixed on in particular by our Apostle in his <hi>Application</hi> of this Testimony unto him, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.33.</p>
                        <p>And in this sense <hi>alone</hi> the words have any Appearance of respect unto <hi>David</hi> as a Type of Christ; seeing he was said as it were to be <hi>begotten</hi> of God when he rais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d him up, and <hi>established</hi> him in his Rule and Kingdom. Neither indeed doth the <hi>Apostle</hi> treat in this place of the <hi>Eternal Generation</hi> of the Son, but of his Exaltation and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence</hi> above Angels.</p>
                        <p>The word also <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> constantly in the Scripture denotes some <hi>signal time, one day,</hi> or more. And that expression, <hi>This Day have I begotten thee,</hi> following immediately upon that other <hi>Typical</hi> one, <hi>I have set my King upon my holy hill of Sion,</hi> seems to be of the same Importance, and in like manner to be interpreted. Thus far I then chuse to embrace the <hi>latter Interpretation</hi> of the words; namely, that the <hi>Eternal Generation</hi> of Christ, on which his <hi>Filiation</hi> or Sonship, both name and thing doth depend, is to be taken only <hi>declaratively</hi>; and that declaration to be made in his <hi>Resurrection</hi> and Exaltation over all, that ensued thereon. But every one is left unto the Liberty of his own Judgement herein.</p>
                        <p>And this is the <hi>first Testimony,</hi> whereby the Apostle confirms his Assertion of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence</hi> of the Lord Christ above the <hi>Angels,</hi> from the <hi>name</hi> that he inherits as his peculiar Right and Possession.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>further</hi> confirmation of the <hi>same</hi> Truth, he adds another <hi>Testimony</hi> of the same Importance, in the words ensuing.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>This is the second <hi>testimony</hi> produced by the Apostle to prove the preheminence of the Lord Christ above the Angels, from the excellency of the <hi>Name</hi> given unto him. <hi>One</hi> word, <hi>one</hi> witness, the testimony being that of God, and not of man, had been sufficient to have evinced the truth of his assertion. But the <hi>Apostle</hi> addes a <hi>second</hi> here, partly to manifest the importance of the <hi>matter</hi> he treated of, and partly to stir them up unto a diligent search of the Scripture, where the same truths, especially those that are of most concernment unto us, are <hi>stored</hi> up and down in sundry places, as the holy Ghost had Occasion to make mention of them. This is that <hi>Mine</hi> of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Gold which we are continually to dig for, and search after, if we intend to grow, and to be rich in the knowledge of God in Christ, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>Expositors</hi> do generally perplex themselves and their <hi>Readers</hi> about the application of these words unto the Lord Christ. <hi>Cajetan</hi> for this cause, that this <hi>Testimony</hi> is not rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced nor applied as it ought, rejects the whole <hi>Epistle,</hi> as not written by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> nor of <hi>Canonical</hi> authority. Such instances do even <hi>Wise and Learned</hi> men give of their folly and self-fulness every day. The conclusion that he makes must needs be built on these two suppositions. First, that what ever <hi>any man</hi> might or could apprehend concerning the right application of this testimony, that he himself might and could so do; for otherwise he might have acknowledged his own <hi>insufficiency,</hi> and have left the solution of the difficulty unto them to whom God should be pleased to reveal it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That when men of <hi>any Generation</hi> cannot understand the force and efficacy of the Reasonings of the <hi>Pen-men</hi> of the holy Ghost, nor discern the suitableness of the Testimonies they make use of, unto the things they produce them in the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, they may lawfully reject any portion of Scripture thereon. The <hi>folly</hi> and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of which principles or suppositions are manifest.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>application</hi> of Testimonies out of the <hi>Old</hi> Testament in the <hi>New,</hi> depends as to their <hi>authority,</hi> on the veracity of him that maketh use of them; and as to their <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency</hi> in Argument, on the acknowledgment of them on whom they are pressed. Where we find these concurring, as in this place, there remains nothing for us, but to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a <hi>Right understanding</hi> of what is in it self infallibly true, and unquestionably cogent unto the ends for which it is used.</p>
                        <p>Indeed the main Difficulty, which in this place <hi>Expositors</hi> generally trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves withall, ariseth purely from their own mistake. They cannot understand how these words should p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ove the <hi>Natural Sonship</hi> of Jesus Christ, which they supposed they are produced to confirm, seeing it is from thence that he is exalted above the <hi>Angels.</hi> But the truth is, the words are not designed by the <hi>Apostle</hi> unto any such end; his aim is only to prove, that the Lord Christ hath a <hi>Name</hi> assigned unto him more <hi>excellent,</hi> either in it self, or in the manner of its Attribution, than any that is given unto the Angels, which is the <hi>medium</hi> of this first Argument to prove him, not as the Eternal Son of God, nor in respect of his Humane Nature, but as the <hi>Revealer</hi> of the Will of God in the Gospel, to be preferred above all the <hi>Angels</hi> in heaven, and consequently in particular above those whose <hi>ministery</hi> was used in the giving of the Law.</p>
                        <p>Two things then are necessary to render this <hi>Testimony</hi> effectual to the purpose for which it is cited by the Apostle; first, that it was <hi>originally</hi> intended of him to whom he doth apply it; secondly, that there is a <hi>Name</hi> in it assigned unto him, <hi>more excellent</hi> than any ascribed unto the Angels.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>first</hi> of these, we must not wave the <hi>Difficulties</hi> that Interpreters have either <hi>found</hi> out in it, or <hi>cast</hi> upon it. The words are taken from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14. and are part of the <hi>Answer</hi> returned from God unto <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Nathan,</hi> upon his resolution to build him an house. The whole Oracle is as followeth, v. 11. <hi>The Lord telleth thee, that he will make thee an house.</hi> v. 12. <hi>And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish

his Kingdom:</hi> (Or as 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.11. <hi>And it shall come to pass when thy days be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that</hi> I <hi>will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons, and I will establish his kingdom.</hi>) v. 13. <hi>He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</hi> (chap. 13. v. 12. <hi>he shall build me an house, and I will establish his throne for ever.</hi>) v. 14. <hi>I will be his Father, and he shall be my son; if he commit iniquity, I will chastise him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men.</hi> v. 15. <hi>But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</hi> (1 Chron. 13. <hi>I will be his Father, and he shall be my son, and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee.</hi>) v. 16. <hi>And thy house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before me; thy throne shall be established for ever.</hi> (1 Chron.) <hi>But I will settle him in mine house, and in my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for ever, and his throne shall be established for evermore.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the whole <hi>Divine Oracle,</hi> from whence the Apostle takes the testimony under consideration; and the <hi>difficulty</hi> wherewith it is attended ariseth from hence, that it is not easie to <hi>apprehend,</hi> how any thing at all in these words should be <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated</hi> unto the Lord Christ; seeing <hi>Solomon</hi> seems in the whole to be directly and only intended. And concerning this difficulty, there are three <hi>Opinions</hi> among In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Some <hi>cutting</hi> that knot, which they suppose could not otherwise be <hi>loosed,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that <hi>Solomon</hi> is not at all intended in these words, but that they are a direct and immediate <hi>Prophesie of Christ,</hi> who was to be the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and to build the Spiritual House or Temple of God. And for the confirmation of this Assertion, they produce sundry Reasons from the <hi>Oracle</hi> it self: As,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is said, That <hi>God would raise up to David</hi> a seed, or son; intimating that he was not as yet born, being foretold to be raised up; whereas <hi>Solomon</hi> was born at the time of this Prophesie.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is also affirmed, that this Son or seed should <hi>reign and sit upon the throne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid after his decease,</hi> and being gathered unto his fathers; whereas <hi>Solomon</hi> was made King, and sate upon the Throne whilst <hi>David</hi> was yet alive, and not entred into rest with his fathers.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Throne</hi> of this Son is to be established <hi>for ever,</hi> or as the same promise is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. <hi>whilst the Sun and Moon continue.</hi> The Throne of <hi>Solomon</hi> and his posterity failing within a few Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>rations.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The <hi>Title</hi> there given unto <hi>him</hi> who is directly prophesied of, shews him, as our Apostle intimates, to be preferred above all the Angels; and none will say that <hi>Sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was so, who as he was inferiour to them in Nature and Condition, so by <hi>sin</hi> he greatly provoked the Lord against himself and his posterity.</p>
                        <p>But yet all these <hi>Observations,</hi> though they want not some appearance and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of reason, come short of proving evidently what they are produced for, as we may briefly manifest: for,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It doth not appear that <hi>Solomon</hi> was <hi>born</hi> at the time of the giving forth of this <hi>Oracle</hi>; if we must suppose that God intimated in it unto <hi>David,</hi> that none of the sons which he then had should succeed him in his Kingdom; yea, it is manifest from the story that he was not. Besides, <hi>raising up</hi> doth not denote the <hi>Birth</hi> or Nativity of the person intended, but his <hi>Designation or Exaltation</hi> to his Throne and Office, as is the usual meaning of that expression in the Scripture; so that <hi>Solomon</hi> might be intended, though now born, yea and grown up, if not yet by the providence of God marked and taken out from amongst his brethren to be <hi>King,</hi> as afterwards he was.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Although a <hi>few days</hi> before the death of <hi>David,</hi> to prevent Sedition and Division about <hi>Titles</hi> and Pretensions to the Kingdom, <hi>Solomon</hi> by his appointment was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King, or Heir to the Crown, yet he was not <hi>actually vested</hi> with the whole Power of the Kingdom, until after his natural decease. Moreover also, <hi>David</hi> being then very weak and feeble, and rendred unable for Publick Administration, the short remainder of his days after the Inauguration of <hi>Solomon</hi> needed no Observation in the Prophesie.</p>
                        <p>The other two remaining Reasons must be afterwards spoken unto. And for the present removal of this Exposition, I shall only observe, That, to affirm <hi>Solomon</hi> not at all to be intended in this <hi>Oracle,</hi> nor the House or Temple which afterwards he built, is to make the whole Answer of God by the Prophet unto <hi>David</hi> to be <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal.</hi> For <hi>David</hi> enquired of <hi>Nathan</hi> about building an <hi>House or material Temple</hi> unto God. <hi>Nathan</hi> returns him answer from God, that he shall not do so, but that his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50110:214"/>
                           <hi>son</hi> should perform that work. This Answer <hi>David</hi> understands of his <hi>immediate son,</hi> and of a <hi>material House,</hi> and thereupon makes material provision for it, and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in great abundance upon the encouragement he received in this Answer of God. Now if neither of these were at all <hi>intended</hi> in it, neither his <hi>son,</hi> nor the <hi>material Temple,</hi> it is evident that he was led into a <hi>great mistake,</hi> by the Ambiguity and Equivocation of the word, which we find by the Event that he was not, God approving and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of his Obedience in what he did. It remains then that <hi>Solomon firstly</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately is intended in these words.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Some on the other hand affirm the whole Prophesie so to belong unto, and so to be fulfilled in <hi>Solomon,</hi> and in him alone, that there is no direct respect therein unto our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> And the reason for their assertion they take from those words which immediately follow those insisted on by the Apostle, namely, <hi>If he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit iniquity, I will chastise him with the rod of men</hi>; which cannot be applied unto him who did no sin, neither was there guile found in his mouth. They say therefore, that the Apostle applies these words unto Christ, only by way of an <hi>Allegory</hi>; thus he deals with the Law of not <hi>muzling the Ox</hi> which treadeth out the corn, applying it to the provision of <hi>carnal things</hi> to be made for the Dispensers of the Gospel. As he also in another place representeth the <hi>two Testaments</hi> in the story of <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That which principally is to be insisted on for the removal of this difficulty, and which will utterly take it out of our way, will fall in with our Confirmation of the third <hi>Interpretation</hi> to be proposed. For the present, I shall only answer, that as the words <hi>cited</hi> by the Apostle do principally concern the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> himself, yet being spoken and given out in form of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> they have respect also unto him as he is the Head of the Covenant, which God makes with <hi>all the Elect</hi> in him. And thus <hi>whole mystical Christ,</hi> Head and Members, are referred unto in the Prophecy; and therefore <hi>David</hi> in his repetition and pleading of this <hi>Oracle, Psal.</hi> 89.30. changeth those words, <hi>if he commit iniquity,</hi> into, <hi>if his children forsake my law.</hi> Notwithstanding then a supposition of transgression in <hi>him,</hi> concerning whom these words are spoken, the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> may be intended in them; such failings and transgressions as <hi>disannul not the Covenant,</hi> often falling out on their part, for whom he undertaketh therein. But I offer this only in <hi>majorem cautelam,</hi> to secure the testimony insisted on unto our Apostles intention; the difficulty it self will be clearly afterwards assoiled.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We say therefore with others, that both <hi>Solomon</hi> and the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> are intended in this whole <hi>Oracle; Solomon</hi> literally and nextly, as the <hi>Type</hi>; the Lord Christ <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally</hi> and mystically, as he who was <hi>typed,</hi> figured, and represented by him. And our sense herein shall be farther explained and confirmed in the ensuing Consider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there never was any <hi>one Type</hi> of Christ and his Offices, that entirely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him, and all that he was to do. For as it was <hi>impossible</hi> that any <hi>one thing</hi> or person should do so, because of the perfection of his Person, and the Excellency of his Office, which no <hi>one thing,</hi> that might be appointed to prefigure him as a Type, because of its limitedness and imperfection, could fully represent; so had any such been found out, that <hi>multiplication</hi> of Types which God in his infinite Wisdom was pleased to make use of for the revelation of him intended in them, had been altogether useless and needless. Wherefore according as God saw good, and as he had made them meet and fit; so He designed <hi>one</hi> thing or person to figure out one thing in him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for another end and purpose.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That <hi>no Type</hi> of Christ was in <hi>all things</hi> that he was or did a Type of him, but only in <hi>that particular</hi> wherein he was designed of God so to be, and wherein he hath revealed him so to have been. <hi>David</hi> was a Type of Christ, but not in <hi>all things</hi> that he was and did. In his Conquests of the Enemies of the Church, in his Throne and Kingdom he was so; but in his <hi>private actions,</hi> whether as a Man, or as a King, or Captain, he was not so. The like must be said of <hi>Isaac, Melchisedeck, Solomon,</hi> and all other personal Types under the Old Testament, and much more of other things.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That not <hi>all things</hi> spoken of <hi>him</hi> that was a Type, even <hi>therein wherein</hi> he was a Type, are spoken of him <hi>as a Type,</hi> or have any respect unto the thing signified, but some of them may belong unto him in his <hi>personal capacity</hi> only. And the reason is, because he, who <hi>was a Type</hi> by God's institution, might <hi>morally</hi> fail in the performance of his duty, even then and in those things, when and wherein he was a Type. Hence somewhat may be spoken of him as to his <hi>moral performance of his Duty,</hi> that may no way concern the <hi>Anti-type,</hi> or Christ prefigured by him. And this wholly removes the difficulty men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50110:215"/>
in the <hi>second Interpretation</hi> of the words, excluding the Lord Christ from being directly in the <hi>Oracle,</hi> upon that expression, <hi>if he sin against me</hi>; for those words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>moral duty of Solomon,</hi> in that wherein he was a Type of Christ, namely the <hi>Rule and Administration of his Kingdom,</hi> may not at all belong to Christ, who was prefigured by God's institution of things, and not in any <hi>moral deportment</hi> in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That what is spoken of <hi>any Type, as it was a Type,</hi> and in respect of its institution to be such, doth not really and properly belong unto <hi>him,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> which was the <hi>Type,</hi> but unto him who was represented thereby. For the <hi>Type</hi> it self, it was enough that there was some resemblance in it of that which was principally intended; the things belonging unto the <hi>Anti-type</hi> being affirmed of it <hi>Analogically,</hi> on the account of the relation between them by God's institution. Hence that which follows on such Enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations, doth not at all respect, or belong to the <hi>Type,</hi> but only to the Anti-type. Thus at the Sacrifice of <hi>Expiation,</hi> the <hi>scape Goat</hi> is said <hi>to bear and carry away all the sins of the people into a land not inhabited</hi>; not really, and in the substance of the matter, but only in an instituted Representation: for the Law was given by <hi>Moses,</hi> but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. Much less may the things that ensue upon the Lord Christ's real <hi>bearing</hi> and taking away of our sins, be ascribed to the <hi>devoted beast.</hi> So is it in this case. The words applied by the <hi>Apostle</hi> to prove the Son to have a <hi>more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> Name than the Angels, and consequently to be preferred above them, do not at all prove that <hi>Solomon</hi> of whom they were spoken meerly as he was a Type, should be esteemed to be <hi>preferred above all Angels,</hi> seeing he did only represent him who was so, and had these words spoken unto him, not <hi>absolutely,</hi> but with respect unto that Representation. And this removes the <hi>fourth Objection</hi> made in the behalf of the <hi>first Interpretation,</hi> excluding <hi>Solomon</hi> from being at all intended in the Prophecy, for what was spoken of him <hi>as a Type,</hi> required not a full accomplishment in his own person but only that he should represent him, who was principally intended.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That there is a <hi>two-fold Perpetuity</hi> mentioned in the Scripture, the one <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>relative,</hi> the other <hi>absolute</hi>; and both these are applied unto the Kingdom of <hi>David.</hi> First, there was a <hi>Perpetuity</hi> promised unto him and his Posterity in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as of the Priesthood to <hi>Aaron</hi>; that is a <hi>limited</hi> perpetuity, namely, during the continuance of the <hi>typical state</hi> and condition of that People; whilst they continued, the Rule by right belonged unto the <hi>House of David.</hi> There was also an <hi>absolute perpetuity</hi> promised to the <hi>Kingdom of David,</hi> to be made good only in the Kingdom and Rule of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; and both these kinds of <hi>Perpetuity</hi> are expressed in the same words, giving their sense according as they are applied. If applied to the <hi>successors of David,</hi> as his Kingdom was a Type of that of Christ, they denote the <hi>limited Perpetuity</hi> before mentioned, as that which respected an <hi>Adjunct</hi> of the Typical state of that People, that was to be regulated by it, and commensurate unto it: but as they were referred to the Kingdom of Christ represented in the other, so an <hi>Absolute Perpetuity</hi> is expressed in them. And this takes away the <hi>third Reason, excluding Solomon</hi> from being intended in these words; the Perpetuity promised being unto him limited and bounded.</p>
                        <p>These considerations being premised, I say, the words insisted on by the <hi>Apostle, I will be unto him a Father, and he shall be unto me a son,</hi> belonged first and nextly unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> denoting that fatherly Love Care and Protection that God would afford unto him in his Kingdom, so far forth as Christ was <hi>represented</hi> by him therein; which requires not that they must <hi>absolutely,</hi> and in all just consequences from them belong unto the person of <hi>Solomon: principally</hi> therefore they intend Christ himself, expressing that <hi>eternal unchangeable Love</hi> which the Father bore unto him, grounded on the <hi>Relation</hi> of Father and Son.</p>
                        <p>The Jews, I confess, of all others, do see least of <hi>Typicalness</hi> in <hi>Solomon.</hi> But the reason of it is, because that his <hi>sin</hi> was the Occasion of ruining their carnal earthly Glory and Wealth, which things alone they lust after. But the thing was doubtless confessed by the Church of old, with whom <hi>Paul</hi> had to do; and therefore we see, that the Writer of the Book of the Chronicles, written after the return of the People from their Captivity, when <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>line</hi> was failed, and <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> of the house of <hi>Nathan</hi> was Governour amongst them, yet records again this Promise, as that which looked forward, and was yet to receive its full accomplishment in the Lord Christ. And some of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> themselves tell us, that <hi>Solom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>
                           </hi> because of his sin had only the <hi>name of peace,</hi> God stirring up Adversaries against him; the thing it self is to be looked for under <hi>Messiah Ben-david.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50110:215"/>The allegation of these words by the Apostle being thus fully and at large vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, I shall now briefly enquire into the sense and meaning of the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                        <p>It was before observed, that they are not produced by the Apostle to prove the <hi>Natural Sonship</hi> of Jesus Christ, nor do they signifie it; nor were they urged by him to confirm directly and immediately that he is <hi>more excellent than the Angels,</hi> of whom there is nothing spoken in them, nor in the place from whence they are taken. But the <hi>Apostle</hi> insists on this testimony, meerly in confirmation of his former Argument, for the <hi>preheminence of the Son above Angels,</hi> taken from that <hi>more excellent Name</hi> which he obtained by inheritance; which being the Name of <hi>the Son of God,</hi> he hereby proves that indeed he was so called by God himself.</p>
                        <p>Thus then do these words confirm the intention of the Apostle. For to which of the Angels said God at any time, <hi>I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son.</hi> The words contain a great and signal priviledge; they are spoken unto and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Messiah</hi>; and neither they nor any thing <hi>equivalent</hi> unto them were ever spoken of any Angel; especially the Name of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> so <hi>emphatically,</hi> and in way of distinction from all others, was never assigned unto any of them. And this, as hath been already shewed, proves an <hi>Eminency</hi> and Preheminence in him, above all that the Angels attain unto. All this, I say, follows from the peculiar signal <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation</hi> of the Name of the Son of God unto him; and his especial Relation unto God therein expressed.</p>
                        <p>Briefly, we may <hi>adjoyn</hi> the intention of the words as in themselves considered, and so complete the Exposition of them. Now God promiseth in them to be unto the Lord Christ, as exalted into his Throne, a <hi>Father,</hi> in love, care, power, to protect and carry him on in his Rule unto the end of the world. And therefore upon his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he says that he went <hi>unto his God and Father, Joh.</hi> 20.17. And he rules in the <hi>Name and Majesty of God, Mic.</hi> 5.4. This is the importance of the words; they intend not the Eternal and Natural Relation that is between the Father and Son, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor can be the subject of any Promise, but the <hi>Paternal care</hi> of God over Christ in his Kingdom, and the dearness of Christ himself unto him.</p>
                        <p>If it be asked on what account God would thus be a Father unto Jesus Christ in this peculiar manner, it must be answered, that the radical fundamental cause of it lay in the <hi>Relation</hi> that was between them from his Eternal Generation; but he <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested</hi> himself to be his Father, and engaged to deal with him in the love and care of a Father, as he had accomplished his work of Mediation on the Earth, and was exalted unto his Throne and Rule in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>And this is the <hi>first Argument</hi> of the Apostle, whereby he proves that the Son, as the Revealer of the Mind and Will of God in the Gospel, is made <hi>more excellent</hi> than the Angels, whose Glory was a refuge to the <hi>Jews</hi> in their adherance to Legal Rites and Administrations, even because they were given unto them by the Disposition of Angels.</p>
                        <p>According unto our <hi>proposed method,</hi> we must in our progress draw hence also some Instructions for our own use and edification. As,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Every thing in the Scripture is instructive.</hi> The Apostles arguing in this place is not so much from the <hi>thing spoken,</hi> as from the <hi>manner</hi> wherein it is spoken: even that also is highly Mysterious. So are all the concernments of it. Nothing is in it needless, nothing useless. Men sometimes perplex themselves to find out the <hi>suitableness</hi> of some Testimonies produced out of the Old Testament unto the confirmation of things and Doctrines in the New, by the Pen-men of the holy Ghost; when all the difficulty ariseth from a <hi>fond conceit,</hi> that they can apprehend the depth and breadth of the Wisdom that is laid up in any one Text of Scripture; when the Holy Ghost may have a principal aim at those things which they are not able to dive into. Every letter and tittle of it is teaching, and every thing that relates unto it, is <hi>instructive</hi> in the Mind of God. And it must be so, because,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It proceeds from <hi>infinite Wisdom,</hi> which hath put an impress of it self upon it, and filled all its capacitie with its blessed effects. In the whole Frame, Structure and Order of it, in the Sense, Words, Coherence, Expression, it is filled with Wisdom; which makes the <hi>Commandment exceeding broad and large,</hi> so that there is no absolute comprehension of it in this life. We cannot perfectly trace the foot-steps of infinite Wisdom, nor find out all the Effects and characters of it, that it hath left upon the Word. The whole Scripture is full of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> as the Sea is of Water, which fills and covers all the parts of it. And,</p>

Because <hi>it was to be very Comprehensive.</hi> It was to contain directly or by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, one way or other, the <hi>whole Revelation of God unto us,</hi> and all our Duty unto him, both which are marvelous, great, large and various: Now this could not have been done in so narrow a room, but that every Part of it, and all the Concernment of it, with its whole Order, were to be filled with Mysteries, and Expressions or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations of the Mind and Will of God. It could not hence be that any thing <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous</hi> should be put into it, or any thing be in it, that should not relate to Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Instruction.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is that which God hath given unto his servants, for <hi>their continual Exercise day and night in this world</hi>; And in their enquiry into it, he requires of them their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Diligence and endeavours. This being assigned for their Duty, it was conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto Divine Wisdom and Goodness to find them blessed and <hi>useful</hi> work in the whole Scripture, to exercise themselves about: That every where they might meet with that which might satisfie their Enquiry, and answer their Industry. There shall never be any Time or Strength <hi>lost</hi> or mispent, that is laid out according to the Mind of God in and about his Word. The matter, the Words, the Order, the Contexture of them, the Scope, Design and aim of the Holy Ghost in them, <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>every one</hi> of them, may well take up the utmost of our Diligence; are all divine. Nothing is empty, unfurnished, or unprepared for our spiritual use, advantage and benefit. Let us then learn hence,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To admire, and as one said of old, to <hi>adore the fulness of the Scripture,</hi> or of the Wisdom of God in it; it is all full of <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> and calls for our Reverence in the Consideration of it. And indeed a constant Awe of the Majesty, Authority and Holiness of God in his word, is the only teachable frame. Proud and careless spirits see nothing of Heaven, or Divinity in the Word; but the <hi>humble</hi> are made wise in it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To stir up and <hi>exercise our Faith and Diligence</hi> to the utmost in our <hi>study</hi> and search of the Scripture. It is an endless store-house, a bottomless Treasure of Divine Truth. Gold is in every sand; All the wise men in the world may every one for himself learn somewhat out of every Word of it, and yet leave enough still behind them for the Instruction of all those that shall come after them. The <hi>fountains</hi> and springs of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in it are endless, and will never be dry. We may have <hi>much</hi> truth and power out of a word, sometimes <hi>enough,</hi> but never <hi>All</hi> that is in it. There will still be enough remaining, to exercise and refresh us anew for ever. So that we may attain a <hi>True s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>nse,</hi> but we can never attain the <hi>full sense</hi> of any Place; we can never exhaust the whole <hi>impress of infinite Wisdom</hi> that is on the Word. And how should this stir us up to be meditating in it day and night; and many the like inferences may hence be taken. Learn also,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That it is <hi>lawful to draw consequences from Scripture Assertions, and such consequences rightly deduced are infaliibly true, and de fide.</hi> Thus from the <hi>Name</hi> given unto Christ, the Apostle deduceth by just consequence his Exaltation and Preheminence above Angels. Nothing will rightly follow from Truth, but what is so also; and that of the same nature with the Truth from whence it is derived: So that whatever by just consequence is drawn from the Word of God, is it self also the Word of God, and of Truth infallible. And to deprive the Church of this liberty in the <hi>interpretation</hi> of the Word, is to deprive it of the chiefest benefit intended by it. This is that on which the whole Ordinance of Preaching is founded; which makes that which is <hi>derived</hi> out of the Word, to have the <hi>Power,</hi> Authority and Efficacy of the Word ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it. Thus though it be the proper Work and Effect of the Word of God to quicken, regenerate, sanctifie and purifie the Elect, and the Word primarily and directly is only that which is <hi>written</hi> in the Scriptures; yet we find all these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>cts produced in and by the <hi>preaching of the Word,</hi> when perhaps not one sentence of the Scripture is <hi>verbatim</hi> repeated. And the Reason hereof is, because whatsoever is directly deduced, and delivered according to the Mind and Appointment of God from the Word, is the Word of God, and hath the Power, Authority and Efficacy of the Word accompanying of it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>The Declaration of Christ to be the Son of God, is the Care and Work of the Father.</hi> He said it, he recorded it, he revealed it. This indeed is to be made known by the Preaching of the Gospel; but that it shall be done, the Father hath taken the care up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself. It is the <hi>design</hi> of the Father in all things to glorifie the Son; <hi>that all men may honour him even as they honour the Father</hi>; This cannot be done, without the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50110:216"/>
of that Glory which he had with him before the world was; that is the Glory of his <hi>Eternal Sonship.</hi> This he will therefore make known and maintain in the world.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>God the Father is perpetually present with the Lord Christ in Love, Care and power, in the Administration of his Office as he is Mediator, Head and King of the Church.</hi> He hath taken upon himself, to stand by him to own him, to effect every thing that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto the Establishment of his Throne, the enlargement of his Kingdom, and the Ruine and Destruction of his Enemies. And this he will assuredly do to the end of the world.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because he hath <hi>promised so to do</hi>; innumerable are the Promises on record that are made unto Jesus Christ unto this purpose; God hath engaged to hold him in his Hand, and to hide him as a <hi>polished shaft in his quiver,</hi> to give him a <hi>Throne,</hi> a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Kingdom, an everlasting Rule and Government, and the like. Now what he hath promised in <hi>Love and Grace,</hi> he will make good with <hi>Care and Power.</hi> See <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 50.7, 8, 9.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. All these Promises <hi>have respect unto the Obedience of the Lord Christ in the work of Mediation,</hi> which being performed by him rightly, and to the utmost, gives him a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Right unto them, and makes that <hi>just</hi> and righteous in the Performance, which was <hi>meer soveraign Grace</hi> in the Promise. The condition being <hi>absolutely</hi> performed on the part of Christ, the Promise shall be <hi>certainly</hi> accomplished on the part of the Father. By this is the Covenant of the Redeemer compleated, ratified and established; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it on his part being performed unto the uttermost, there shall be no <hi>failure</hi> in the Promises, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.11, 12.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>The Lord Christ makes it his request, that he may enjoy the Presence and Power of his Father with him in his work,</hi> and the Administration of his Mediation; and the Father alwayes hears him. Part of his Covenant with his Father was like that of <hi>Barak</hi> who was a type of him, with <hi>Deborah</hi> the Prophetess, who spake in the name of the Lord, <hi>Judg.</hi> 4.8. <hi>If thou wilt go with me, I will go, against</hi> all the enemies of the Church: <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.8, 9. And accordingly upon his engagement to go with him, he <hi>requests</hi> his Presence; and in the assurance of it, professeth that he is not <hi>alone,</hi> but that his <hi>Father</hi> is with him, <hi>John</hi> 8.16. To this purpose see his requests, <hi>John</hi> 17.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>The nature of his Work and Kingdom require it.</hi> God hath appointed him to reign in the <hi>middest of his Enemies</hi>; and mighty Opposition is made on all hands to his whole Design, and every particular Act of it. The whole work of <hi>Satan</hi> sin and the world, is both to obstruct in general the Progress of his Kingdom, and to ruine and destroy every particular subject of it; And this is carried on continually with unspeakable Violence, and unsearchable Stratagems; This makes the Presence of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power of the Father necessary to him in his work; This he asserts as a great ground of consolation to his Disciples, <hi>John</hi> 10.28, 29. There will be great <hi>plucking,</hi> great contending to <hi>take believers out of the hand of Christ</hi>; one way or other to make them come short of Eternal Life; and though his own Power be such, as is able to preserve them, yet he lets them know also for their greater Assurance and Consolation, that his <hi>Father who is over all,</hi> is greater, more powerful than all, greater than he himself in the Work of Mediation, <hi>John</hi> 14.28. is also <hi>engaged</hi> with him in their defence and preservation: So also is he as to the Destruction of his Adversaries; all opposing power whatever: <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.5, 6. The Lord stands by him, on his right hand, to smite and tread down his enemies, all that arise against his design, interest, and Kingdom; be they never so many, never so great, he will ruine them, and make them his <hi>footstool</hi> every one. See <hi>Micha</hi> 5.4.</p>

                        <p>We must also enquire what is the <hi>Introduction,</hi> or <hi>bringing in</hi> here intended; How and When performed; as also what is the world whereinto he was brought. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties about all which must be severally considered.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>again,</hi> may be joyned with <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>; And then the sense of the words must run as above intimated; namely, <hi>when he bringeth in again the first-born into the world.</hi> And it is evident, that most Expositors both Antient and Modern embrace this sense. So do <hi>Chrysostom, Theodoret, Ambrose, Oecumenius, Thomas, Lyra, Cajetan, Ribera, Camero; Gomarus, Estius, A Lapide</hi>; our <hi>Mede,</hi> with many others. But about what this <hi>bringing in again,</hi> or <hi>Second bringing in of the first-born into the world</hi> should be, they are greatly divided.</p>
                        <p>The Antients refer it to his <hi>Incarnation</hi>; affirming somewhat harshly, that he was brought before into the world, when all things <hi>were made by him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Others refer it to the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> which was as it were a second <hi>bringing of Christ</hi> into the world, as <hi>David</hi> was brought into his Kingdom again, after he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the Conspiracy and Rebellion of <hi>Absolom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Others refer it unto his <hi>coming forth in the Effectual Preaching of the Gospel</hi> after his Ascension, whereby he was brought forth in another manner, and with another kind of Power, than that which he appeared in, in the <hi>Dayes of his flesh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Some suppose the <hi>Personal Reign</hi> of Christ on the earth for a thousand years with his Saints, is intended in these words, when God will <hi>bring him again</hi> with Glory into the world; of which judgement was <hi>Mede</hi>; and now many follow him.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Others again, and they the most, assign the Accomplishment of what is here asserted, to the General Judgement, and the Second Coming of Christ in the Glory of the Father, with all the holy Angels attending him to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Some of the <hi>Socinians</hi> refer them unto the Triumphant Ascension of Christ into Heaven, after his Resurrection; he having, as they fancy, once before been taken into it, there to be instructed in the Mind and Will of God.</p>
                        <p>Now all these Assertions concerning the <hi>bringing in of Christ into the world,</hi> have a Truth in them <hi>absolutely</hi> considered; but whether any of them be here intended by the Apostle, we must enquire by an Examination of the common Foundation that all their Authors proceed upon, with the Reasons given for its Confirmation. Now this is that which we observed before; namely, that in the Construction of the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>again,</hi> is to be joyned with <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>he bringeth in</hi>; and so to be rendered, <hi>when he brings in again,</hi> or a <hi>second time,</hi> the first-born; which must needs point to a <hi>second coming</hi> of Christ, of one kind or another: And to this purpose they say,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Trajection</hi> of the words in the other sense, is hard and difficult, and not to be admitted but upon very cogent Reasons. It is to suppose that the Apostle by <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>When Again</hi>; intends <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; <hi>Again when</hi>; And besides, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition of the many words between it, and <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>he saith,</hi> will not admit that they should be conjoyned in Sense and Construction.</p>
                        <p>But this Reason is not cogent: for,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Most of the antient <hi>Translations</hi> acknowledge this Transposition of the words; so the <hi>Syriack</hi>; reading thus, <hi>and again when he bringeth in</hi>; so the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi>; and the <hi>Arabick,</hi> omitting the term <hi>again,</hi> as not designing any new thing, but meerly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50110:218"/>
denoting a new Testimony. And they are followed by <hi>Valla, Erasmus, Beza,</hi> and the best of Modern <hi>Translators.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Such <hi>Trajections</hi> are not unusual, and that in this place hath a peculiar Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>again,</hi> being used in the head of the Testimony foregoing, this Transposition adds to the Elegancy of the words; and that there was cause for it, we shall see afterwards.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Apostle having immediately before used the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>again,</hi> as his note of producing a <hi>second Testimony,</hi> and placing it here in the entrance of a <hi>third,</hi> it must needs be used <hi>Equivocally,</hi> if the <hi>Trajection</hi> opposed be not allowed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They deny that the <hi>Angels worshipped Christ</hi> at his <hi>first coming</hi> into the world; that is, that they are recorded so to have done; and therefore it must needs be his <hi>second coming</hi> that is intended, when he shall come in Glory with all his holy Angels, openly worshipping him, and performing his commands.</p>
                        <p>This Reason is especially suited unto the <hi>Fifth Opinion</hi> before mentioned, referring the words to the coming of Christ at the General Day of Judgement, and is unservice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto any of the rest. But yet neither is this satisfactory; for the Question is not, whether it be any where <hi>recorded,</hi> that the Angels worshipped Christ at his first En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the World; but whether the Lord Christ upon his <hi>Incarnation</hi> was not put into that condition, wherein it was the Duty of all the Angels of God to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him. Now this being at least <hi>interpretative,</hi> a Command of God, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels expresly alwayes doing his Will, the thing it self is certain, though no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Instances of it be recorded. Besides, the <hi>Angels</hi> attendance on his Birth, proclamation of his Nativity, and celebrating the Glory of God on that account, seem to have been a performance of that duty, which they had received command for. And this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by those of the <hi>Antients</hi> who suppose that the <hi>second bringing</hi> of Christ into the world, was upon his Nativity.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They say, that this <hi>bringing in</hi> of the first begotten into the world, denotes a glorious Presenting of him in his Rule, and enjoyment of his Inheritance;</p>
                        <p>But (1.) This proves not, that the Words must respect the coming of Christ unto Judgement, to which End this Reason is insisted on; because he was certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed with Glory to be the Son, Lord and Heir of all, upon his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and by the first preaching of the Gospel. And (2.) No such thing indeed can be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deduced from the words. The Expression signifies no more, but an <hi>Introduction</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; a real <hi>bringing in,</hi> without any intimation of the way or manner of it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is argued in the behalf of the same Opinion from the <hi>Psalm</hi> from whence these words are taken, that it is a <hi>Glorious Reign</hi> of Christ, and his coming unto <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that is set forth therein; and not his coming and abode in the state of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this reason <hi>Camero</hi> affirms to prove undeniably, that it is the coming of Christ unto Judgement that is intended.</p>
                        <p>But the Truth is, the consideration of the scope of the <hi>Psalm</hi> doth quite reject the Opinion which is sought to be maintained by it. For (1.) <hi>v.</hi> 1. upon the Reign of the Lord therein set forth, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, the Earth</hi> and the <hi>multitude of the Isles,</hi> are called to rejoyce therein: that is to receive, delight in, and be glad of the Salvation brought by the Lord Christ unto mankind; which is not the Work of the <hi>last day</hi>: (2.) <hi>Idolaters</hi> are deterred from their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and exhorted to worship him, <hi>v.</hi> 7. a duty incumbent on them before the day of Judgement. (3.) The Church is exhorted upon his <hi>Reign,</hi> to abstain from sin, and promised Deliverance from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and oppressors; all which things as they are unsuited unto his coming at the day of Judgement, so they expresly belong unto the setting up of his Kingdom in this world.</p>
                        <p>And hereby it appears, that that Opinion which indeed seems with any probability to assert <hi>a second coming of Christ</hi> into the world, to be intended in these words, is inconsistent with the scope of the place from whence the Testimony is taken, and consequently the design of the Apostle himself.</p>
                        <p>The other <hi>Conjectures</hi> mentioned will easily be removed out of the way;</p>
                        <p>Unto that of the <hi>Antients</hi> assigning this bringing in of Christ into the world unto his <hi>Incarnation</hi>; we say it is true; but then that was his <hi>first bringing in,</hi> and being supposed to be intended in this place, the words can be no otherwise rendered, but that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>again,</hi> must be esteemed only an Intimation of the <hi>Citation</hi> of a new Testimony.</p>
                        <p>Neither can the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the Lord Christ be assigned as the season of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of this word, which was not indeed a <hi>bringing of him into the world,</hi>
                           <pb n="91" facs="tcp:50110:218"/>
but rather an Entrance into his leaving of it; neither did he at his death leave the world utterly, for though his <hi>Soul</hi> was separated from his <hi>Body,</hi> yet his <hi>Body</hi> was not separated from his Person; and therein he continued on the Earth.</p>
                        <p>The coming of Christ to <hi>Reign here on earth a</hi> 1000 <hi>years</hi> is, if not a groundless Opinion, yet so <hi>dubious</hi> &amp; uncertain, as not to be admitted a place in the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our interpretation of Scripture, in places that may fairly admit of another Application.</p>
                        <p>The figment of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that the Lord Christ during the time of his <hi>forty days fast,</hi> was taken into Heaven, which they lay as a Supposition unto their Interpretation of this place, I have else-where shewed to be <hi>Irrational, Anti-scriptural, Mahumetical,</hi> and derogatory to the Honour of our Lord Jesus, as he is the Eternal Son of God.</p>
                        <p>From what hath been spoken it is evident, that the <hi>Trajection</hi> proposed may be allowed, as it is by most of the Antient and Modern Translations. And so the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>again,</hi> relating unto <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>he saith,</hi> denotes only the Introduction of a new proof, and doth not intimate a <hi>second bringing</hi> in of the Lord Christ. And unto what hath already been spoken I shall only adde, that such an intention in the words as hath been pleaded for, would be so far from promoting the Apostles design, that it would greatly weaken and impair it. For the matter he had in hand was to prove the Preheminence of the Lord Christ above the Angels, not <hi>absolutely,</hi> but as he was the <hi>Revealer of the Gospel</hi>; and if this was not so, and proved to be so by this testimony, whilst he was employed in that work in the world, it is nothing at all to his purpose.</p>
                        <p>Having cleared this Difficulty, and shewed that no <hi>Second Coming</hi> of Christ is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this word, but only a new testimony to the same purpose with them fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going produced, the intention of the Apostle in his <hi>Prefatory Expression,</hi> may be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opened, by considering what that <hi>world</hi> is whereunto the Father brought the Son, with <hi>how</hi>; and <hi>when</hi> he did so, and the <hi>manner</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>There are two Opinions about the <hi>World,</hi> whereinto Christ is said to be brought by the Father; the one is, that of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> asserted as by others of them, so by <hi>Schliclingius</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> on this place; and by <hi>Grotius</hi> after them in his <hi>Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>

In like manner <hi>Schliclingius, Per terram istam; non esse intelligendam hanc quam mortales incolimus, sed coelestem illam quam aliquando immortales affecti incolemus, &amp; res ipsa, &amp; D. autor sequenti capite v.</hi> 5. <hi>aperte declarat.</hi> That is, by the <hi>Earth,</hi> not the <hi>Earth</hi> but the <hi>Heaven</hi> is to be understood. But,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This suits not at all with the Purpose and Design of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> which is plainly to prove that the Lord Christ, <hi>then,</hi> when he spake to us, and revealed the will of God, and in that work, was above the Angels, which is not at all proved by shewing what befell him after his work was accomplished.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It receives no countenance from that other place of <hi>chap.</hi> 2.5. whither we are sent by these <hi>Interpreters.</hi> For that the Apostle is there <hi>treating</hi> of a matter quite of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other nature, without any respect unto these words, shall be there declared.

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. By <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> then, the World, or <hi>Habitable Earth</hi> with them that dwell therein, and nothing else is intended; for as the word hath no other signification, so the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi> in the place from whence the ensuing testimony is taken expounds it, by the <hi>multitude of the Isles,</hi> or the Nations <hi>lying abroad in the wide earth.</hi> This is the <hi>World</hi> designed, even that <hi>Earth</hi> wherein the rational creatures of God converse here below. Into this was the Lord Christ brought in by the Father.</p>
                        <p>We are therefore nextly to enquire wherein the Fathers <hi>bringing</hi> of the Son into this <hi>world</hi> did consist. We have seen formerly, that some have assigned it unto One thing in particular, some Another; some to his <hi>Incarnation</hi> and Nativity, some to his <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> some to his Mission of the Spirit, and propagation of his Kingdom that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued. The Opinion about his <hi>Coming to reign in the world a thousand years,</hi> as also that of his coming at the general Judgment, we have already excluded. Of the others, I am apt to think, that it is not any one particular exclusive to the other, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50110:219"/>
intendeth or designeth. That which was intended in the Old Testament in the Promises of his <hi>coming into the world,</hi> is that which is here expressed by the phrase of <hi>bringing him in.</hi> See <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>The Lord whom ye seek shall come, but who may abide the day of his coming?</hi> Now it was not any one <hi>special Act,</hi> nor any one particular Day that was designed in that and the like Promises. But it is the <hi>whole work</hi> of God in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the <hi>Messiah</hi> by his Conception, Nativity, Unction with the Spirit, Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Sending of the Holy Ghost, and preaching of the Gospel, which is the subject of those Promises. And their accomplishment it is which those words express, <hi>When he brings the first-born into the world</hi>; that is, after he had kept his Church under the Administration of the Law given by Angels in the hand of <hi>Moses</hi> the Mediator, in the expectation of the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> when he bringeth him forth unto and carries him on in his work unto the accomplishment of it, he says, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worship him.</hi> And herein most of the former senses are comprised.</p>
                        <p>And this Interpretation of the words compleatly answers the intention of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the <hi>citation</hi> of the ensuing Testimony, namely, to prove that in the discharge of his work of revealing the Will of God, he was such an One, as by reason of the Dignity of his Person, had all Religious Worship &amp; Honour due unto him from the Angels themselves.</p>
                        <p>This sense also we are led unto by the <hi>Psalm</hi> whence the ensuing testimony is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97. The Exultation which the first verse of the <hi>Psalm</hi> requires and calls for, is not unlike that which was in the Name of the whole Creation expressed at his <hi>Nativity, Luke</hi> 2.11. And the four following verses are an <hi>Allegorical</hi> description of the work that the Lord Christ should make, in and by the preaching of the Gospel. See <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.24. And hereon ensues that shame and ruine which was brought upon <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi> thereby <hi>v.</hi> 7. And the joy of the whole Church in the presence of Christ, <hi>v.</hi> 8. attended with his glorious Reign in Heaven, as a consequent of the Accomplishment of his work, <hi>v.</hi> 9. Which is proposed as a motive unto Obedience, and a matter of confidence and rejoycing unto the Church. And this is the <hi>Fathers bringing of the Son into the world,</hi> described by the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> and intended by the <hi>Apostle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It remains that we enquire why, and in what sense, Christ is here called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>primogenitus,</hi> or the <hi>first-born.</hi> The common Answer is, <hi>Non quod post illum alii, sed quod ante illum nullus; Not that any was born after him,</hi> (in the same way) <hi>but that none was born before him</hi>; which as we have shewed before will agree well enough with the use of the Word. And this is applied both to the Eternal G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But if we suppose that his Person and Eternal Generation may be intended in this Expression, we must make <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or the <hi>first-born,</hi> to be the same with <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or <hi>only begotten,</hi> which may not be allowed; for Christ is absolutely called the <hi>only begotten of the Father</hi> in his Eternal Generation, his Essence being infinite, took up the whole Nature of <hi>Divine Filiation</hi>; so that it is impossible that with respect thereunto, there should be any more Sons of God. But <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or <hi>first-born,</hi> is used in relation unto others; and yet, as I shewed before, it doth not require that he who is so should have any other brethren in the same kind of <hi>Sonship.</hi> But because this is by some asserted, namely that Christ has many <hi>Brethren</hi> in the same kind of <hi>sonship</hi> whereby he is himself the Son of God, and is on that account called the <hi>first-born,</hi> (which is an assertion greatly derogatory to his Glory and Honour) I shall in our passage remove it, as a stumbling-block, out of the way.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Schliclingius</hi> on the place, <hi>Primogenitum eum nomine Dei Filium appellat, innuens hoc pacto plures Dei esse Filios etiam ad Christum respectu habito; scilicet ut ostenderet non ita Christum esse Dei Filium, quin alii etiam eodem filiationis genere contineantur, quanquam filiationis perfectione &amp; gradu Christo multò inferiores.</hi> And again, <hi>Primogenitus dicitur Christus quod eum Deus ante omnes Filios, eos nimirum qui Christi fratres appellantur ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuerit; eo scilicet modo quo Deus Filios gignere solet; eos autem gignit quos sibi similes efficit: primus est Christus qui Deo ea sanctitate similis fuit, qualem in novo faedere praecipit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But these things agree neither with the <hi>truth,</hi> nor with the <hi>design</hi> of the Apostle in this place, nor with the <hi>Principles</hi> of them by whom they are asserted. It is acknowledg'd that God hath <hi>other sons</hi> besides <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and that with respect unto him; for in him we are <hi>adopted,</hi> the only way whereby any one may attain unto the priviledge of Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; but that we are sons of God, with, or in the <hi>same kind of sonship</hi> with Jesus Christ, is,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>False</hi>; because, 1. Christ in his Sonship is <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> is impossible that God should have any more sons in the <hi>same kind</hi>

with him; for if he had, certainly the Lord Christ could not be <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son.</hi> 2. The only way of <hi>Filiation,</hi> the only kind of <hi>Sonship,</hi> that Believers share in, is that of <hi>Adoption</hi>; in any other kind of <hi>sonship</hi> they are not partakers. Now if Christ be the Son of God in this kind, he must of necessity antecedently unto his Adoption be a Member of another Family, that is, of the Family of Sathan and the World, as we are by Nature, and from thence be transplanted by <hi>Adoption</hi> into the Family of God; which is Blasphemy to imagine. So that neither can Believers be the sons of God with that kind of <hi>sonship</hi> which is proper to Christ, he being the <hi>only begotten</hi> of the Father; nor can the Lord Christ be the Son of God with the same kind of <hi>Sonship</hi> as Believers are, which is only by <hi>Adoption,</hi> and their translation out of one Family into another. So that either to exalt Believers into the <hi>same kind of Sonship</hi> with Christ, or to depress him into the same rank with them, is wholly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, and Principles of the Gospel. 3. If this were so, that the Lord Christ and Believers were the Sons of God by the same kind of Sonship, only differing <hi>in degrees,</hi> (which also are imaginary, for the formal Reason of the same kind of Sonship is not capable of variation by degrees) what great matter is in the condescension mentioned by the Apostle, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.11. that <hi>he is not ashamed to call them brethren</hi>; which yet he compares with the condescension of God, in being called their God, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.16.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This conceit, as it is <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntrue,</hi> so it is contrary to the design of the Apostle. For to assert the <hi>Messiah</hi> to be the <hi>Son of God</hi> in the same way with men, doth not tend at all to prove him <hi>more excellent than the Angels,</hi> but rather leaves us just ground of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting their preference above him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is contrary unto other declared Principles of the Authors of this Assertion. They else-where affirm, that the Lord Christ was the Son of God on many accounts, as first and principally, because he was <hi>conceived and born of a Virgin by the power of God</hi>; now surely all Believers are not partakers with him in <hi>this kind</hi> of Sonship. Again, they say, he is the Son of God because God <hi>raised him from the dead,</hi> to confirm the Doctrine that he had taught; which is not so with Believers. Also they say he is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and so called, upon the account of his sitting at the Right Hand of God, which is no less his peculiar priviledge than the former. So that this is but an unhappy attempt to lay hold of a word for an advantage, which yields nothing in the issue but trouble and perplexity.</p>
                        <p>Nor can the Lord Christ (which is affirmed in the last place) be called the Son of God, and the first-born, because in him was that <hi>Holiness which is required in the new Covenant</hi>; for both all Believers under the Old Testament had that Holiness and likeness unto God in their degrees, and that Holines consists principally in <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or being born again by the Word and Spirit out of a corrupted estate of death and sin, which the Lord Christ was not capable of. Yea, the truth is, the Holiness and Image of God in Christ was in the <hi>kind</hi> of it that which was required under the <hi>first Covenant</hi>; an Holiness of perfect Innocency and perfect Righteousness in Obedience. So that this last invention hath no better success than the former.</p>
                        <p>It appeareth then, that the Lord Christ is not called the <hi>first-begotten,</hi> or the <hi>first-born,</hi> with any such respect unto others, as should include him and them in the same kind of <hi>Filiation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To give therefore a direct account of this <hi>Appellation</hi> of Christ, we may observe, that indeed the Lord Christ is never absolutely called the <hi>first-begotten,</hi> or <hi>first-born,</hi> with respect either to his Eternal Generation, or to the Conception and Nativity of his Humane Nature. In respect of the <hi>former</hi> he is called the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>only begotten Son of God</hi>; but no where the <hi>first-born,</hi> or <hi>first-begotten</hi>: and in respect of the <hi>latter,</hi> indeed he is called the <hi>first-begotten Son of the Virgin,</hi> because she had none <hi>before</hi> him, but not absolutely the first-born, or first-begotten, which Title is here and else-where ascribed unto him in the Scripture. It is not therefore the thing it self, of <hi>being the first-born,</hi> but the Dignity and Priviledge that attended it, which are designed in this Appellation. So <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. he is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>the first-born of the creation</hi>; which is no more, but he that hath Power and Authority over all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God.</p>
                        <p>The word which the Apostle intends to express is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which oft-times is used in the sense now pleaded for, namely to denote not the <hi>birth</hi> in the first place, but the <hi>priviledge</hi> that belonged thereunto. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.27. God is said to make <hi>David</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, his <hi>first-born</hi>; which is expounded in the next words, <hi>higher than the Kings of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50110:220"/>
the earth.</hi> So that the Lord Christ being the <hi>first-born,</hi> is but the same which we have insisted on, of his being <hi>Heir of all,</hi> which was the priviledge of the <hi>first-born.</hi> And this priviledge was sometimes transmitted unto others that were not the first-born, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the natural course of their nativity could not be changed: <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10. <hi>chap.</hi> 49. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 8. The Lord Christ then, by the appointment of the Father, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the whole Inheritance of Heaven and Earth, and Authority to dispose of it, that he might give out portions to all the rest of God's family is, and is called the <hi>first-born</hi> thereof.</p>
                        <p>There remains now but one word more to be considered for the opening of this Introduction of the ensuing Testimony; and that is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>he saith</hi>; that is, <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self saith</hi>; they are <hi>His words</hi> which shall be produced. What ever is spoken in the Scripture in his name, it is <hi>his speaking,</hi> and he continueth to speak it unto this day. He speaks in the Scripture unto the end of the world. This is the foundation of our faith, that which it riseth from, and that which it is r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>solved into; <hi>God speaketh,</hi> and I suppose we need no interposition of Church or Tradition to give Authority or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit unto what he <hi>says</hi> or <hi>speaks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This then is the sum of these words of the Apostle, <hi>Again, in another place, where the Holy Ghost fore-tells the bringing forth into the world, and amongst men, him that is the Lord and Heir of all, to undertake his work, and to enter into his Kingdom and Glory, the Lord speaks to this purpose, Let all the Angels of God worship him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To manifest this testimony to be apposite unto the confirmation of the Apostles assertion, three things are required.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That it is the <hi>Son</hi> who is intended and spoken of in the place from whence the words are taken, and so designed as the Person to be worshipped.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That they are <hi>Angels</hi> that are spoken unto, and commanded to worship him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That on these suppositions, the words prove the <hi>Preheminence</hi> of Christ above the Angels.</p>
                        <p>For the two former, with them that acknowledge the Divine Authority of this Epistle, it is sufficient in general to give them satisfaction. The place is applied unto Christ, and this passage unto the <hi>ministring Angels,</hi> by the same Spirit who first wrote that Scripture. But yet there is room left for our enquiry how these things may be evidenced, whereby the strength of the Apostles Reasonings with them who were not yet convinced of the infallibility of his Assertions, any farther than they were confirmed by testimonies out of the Old Testament, and the faith of the Antient Church of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in this matter, may be made to appear; as also a check given to their boldness, who upon pretence of the <hi>impropriety</hi> of these Allegations have que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned the Authority of the whole Epistle.</p>
                        <p>And our first enquiry must be, <hi>whence</hi> this testimony is taken. Many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, as <hi>Epiphanius, Theodoret, Euthymius, Procopius,</hi> and <hi>Anselm,</hi> conceive the words to be cited from <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.42. where they expresly occur in the Translation of the <hi>LXX.</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; <hi>Rejoyce ye Heavens with him, and let all the Angels of God worship him.</hi> But there are two conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that put it beyond all pretensions that the words are not taken from this place of the <hi>LXX.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because indeed there are <hi>no such words</hi> in the Original Text, nor any thing spoken that might give occasion to the sense expressed in them; but that <hi>whole Verse</hi> is inserted in the <hi>Greek Version</hi> quite besides the scope of the place. Now though it may perhaps be safely granted, that the Apostles in citing the Scripture of the Old Testament, did sometimes use the words of the <hi>Greek Translation</hi> then in use, yea, though not exact according to the <hi>Original</hi> whilst the sense and meaning of the Holy Ghost was retained in them; yet to cite that from the Scripture as the word and testimony of God, which indeed is not therein, nor was ever spoken by God, but by humane failure and corruption crept into the <hi>Greek Version,</hi> is not to be imputed unto them. And indeed I no way question, but that this addition unto the <hi>Greek Text</hi> in that place, was made after the Apostle had used this testimony. For it is not unlikely, but that some considering of it, and not considering from whence it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, because the words occur not absolutely and exactly in the <hi>Greek</hi> any where, inserted it into that place of <hi>Moses,</hi> amidst other words of an alike sound, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what an alike importante; such as immediately precede and follow the clause inserted.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is not treating in that place about the Introduction of the First-born
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50110:220"/>
into the world, but quite of another matter, as is evident upon the first view of the Text; so that this testimony is evidently not taken from this place; nor would, nor could the Apostle make use of a testimony liable unto such just exceptions.</p>
                        <p>Later <hi>Expositors</hi> generally agree, that the words are taken out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 97. <hi>v.</hi> 7. where the <hi>Original</hi> is rendred by the <hi>LXX,</hi>

                           </gap>; which with a very small variation in the words, and none at all in the sense, is here expressed by the Apostle, <hi>And let all the Angels of God worship him.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Psalm</hi> hath no <hi>Title</hi> at all in the <hi>Original,</hi> which the <hi>Greek Version</hi> noteth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that it is <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>A Psalm of David, when his land was restored.</hi> Hence it is referred by some to the time of his return unto <hi>Hierusale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And unquestionably in it, the Kingdom of God was shadowed out under the Type of the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi>; which Kingdom of God was none other but that of the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is evident that this <hi>Psalm</hi> is of the same Nature with that which goes before, yea a part of it, or an <hi>Appendix</hi> unto it. The first words of this take up and carrie on what is affirmed in the tenth verse, or close of that: so that both of them are but one continued <hi>Psalm</hi> of Praise. Now the <hi>Title</hi> of that Psalm, and consequently this is <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Some of the Antients, I confess, charge them with corrupting this Psalm in the version of the 10 verse, affirming that the words sometimes were <gap reason="foreign">

It is then evident, that the <hi>Antient Church of the Jews,</hi> whose Tradition is herein followed by the <hi>Modern,</hi> acknowledged this Psalm to contain a description of the Kingdom of God in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and on their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent doth the Apostle proceed.

A Kingdom is described, wherein <hi>God would reign,</hi> which should destroy Idolatry and false-worship; a Kingdom wherein the <hi>Isles of the Gentiles</hi> should rejoyce, being called to an interest therein; a Kingdom that was to be preached, proclaimed, declared, unto the encrease of Light and Holiness in the world, with the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the glory of God unto the ends of the earth; every part whereof declareth the Kingdom of Christ to be intended in the Psalm, and consequently that it is a Prophesie of the <hi>bringing in of the first-begotten into the world.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>First, Magistrates</hi> are somewhere called <hi>Elohim,</hi> because of the Representation they make of God in his Power, and their peculiar subordination unto him in their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

And these alone are they whom the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks unto. Having called on the whole Creation to rejoyce in the bringing forth of the Kingdom of God, and pressed his Exhortation upon things on the Earth, he turns unto the <hi>ministring Angels,</hi> and calls on them to the discharge of their duty unto the <hi>King</hi> of that Kingdom. Hence the <hi>Targumist</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Psal.</hi> 96. which is indeed in the beginning of this, expresly mentioneth <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, his <hi>high Angels,</hi> joyning in his praise and worship, using the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, for distinction sake; as on the same account it often occurs in the <hi>Targum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have thus evinced that the <hi>Psalm</hi> treats about the <hi>bringing in of the first-born into the world</hi>; as also that they are the <hi>ministring Angels</hi> who are here commanded to worship him.</p>
                        <p>For the command it self, and the nature of it, it consisted in these two things. 1. A declaration of the state and condition of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which is such, as that he is a meet Object of Religious Adoration unto the <hi>Angels,</hi> and attended with peculiar motives unto the discharge of their duty. The former he hath from his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> the latter from his <hi>Work</hi> with his State and Dignity that ensued thereon. 2. An inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the pleasure of God unto the Angels, not that <hi>Divine Worship</hi> was absolutely due unto the Son of God, which they knew from the first instant of their Creation; but that all Honour and Glory were due unto him on the account of his Work and Office, as Mediator and King of his Church.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It remaineth only that we shew, that this testimony thus explained was <hi>suitable</hi> unto the <hi>Apostles</hi> design and purpose, and did prove the Assertion in the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof it is produced. Now this is a matter of so full and clear an evidence, that it will not at all detain us. For it is impossible that there should be any more clear or full demonstration of this truth, That the Lord Christ hath an unspeakable <hi>Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> above the Angels than this; that they are all appointed and commanded by God himself to <hi>adore</hi> him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Divine and Religious Worship. We may now therefore consider what Observations the words will afford us for our own instruction. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears then from hence.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Authority of God speaking in the Scripture is that alone which Divine Faith rests upon, and is to be resolved into. He saith.</hi> It was the begetting of faith in some of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the increase or establishment of it in others, that the Apostle aimed at. That which he proposeth to them as the Object of their faith, that which they were to believe, was that Excellency of the Person and Kingly Authority of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> wherein they had not as yet been instructed. And hereof he endeavours not to beget an <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> in them, but that Faith which cannot deceive, or be deceived. To this end he
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50110:221"/>
proposeth that unto them, which they ought to submit unto, and which they may safely rest in. For as Faith is an Act of Religious Obedience, it respects the Authority of God requiring it, and as it is a Religious infallible assent of the mind, it regards the Truth and Veracity of God as its Object. On this alone it rests, <hi>God saith.</hi> And in what ever God speaks in the Scripture, his Truth and Authority manifest themselves to the satisfaction of faith, and no where else doth it find rest.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. <hi>That for the begetting, increasing, and strengthning of faith, it is useful to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant fundamental Truths confirmed by many testimonies of Scripture. Again he saith.</hi> Any one word of God is sufficient to establish the most important Truth to Eternity, so as to hang the salvation of all mankind thereon; neither can any thing impeach or weaken what is so confirmed. No more is required in any case to make <hi>Faith</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary on our part as a <hi>Duty</hi> of Obedience, and infallible as to the <hi>Event,</hi> but that God hath by any means, by any <hi>one word</hi> revealed that which he requires our assent unto. But God dealeth not upon strict terms. Infinite Condescension lies at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of all wherein he hath to deal with us. He respects not what the nature of the thing strictly requires, but what is needful unto our infirmity and weakness. Hence he multiplies his Commands and Promises, and confirms all by his <hi>Oath,</hi> swearing to his Truth <hi>by himself,</hi> to take away all pretence of distrust and unbelief. For this cause he multiplies Testimonies to the Truths wherein the concernments of his Glory and our Obedience do lie; as might be manifested by the consideration of instances innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable. Thus in his name deals the Apostle in this place. And this is useful to Faith. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. What is it may be <hi>obscure</hi> in one, is cleared in another; and so what <hi>doubts and fears</hi> remain on the consideration of one Testimony, are removed by another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the souls of Believers are carried on unto a <hi>full Assurance.</hi> And therefore because such is our <hi>weakness</hi> that there is <hi>need</hi> hereof in our selves, such is the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God that there is no <hi>want</hi> of it in the Word.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Faith discerns hereby the <hi>weight</hi> that God lays upon its embracing of the Truth so testified unto. He knows our concernment in it, and thereon urgeth us with its acceptance. This awakens and excites Faith unto Attention and Consideration, the eminent means of its growth and increase. It knows that it is not for nothing that the Holy Ghost thus presseth his Truth upon it, and attends the more diligently upon his urgency.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Every testimony hath something <hi>single</hi> in it, and <hi>peculiar</hi> unto it. Though many bear witness to the same truth, yet such is the <hi>fulness of the Scripture,</hi> and such the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God laid up therein, that every one of them hath also somewhat of its <hi>own,</hi> somewhat singular, tending to the enlightning and establishment of our minds. This Faith makes a discovery of, and so receives peculiar profit and advantage thereby.</p>
                        <p>And this should teach us to abound in the <hi>study</hi> and search of the Scriptures, that we may thereby come to establishment in the truth. God hath thus left us <hi>many testimonies</hi> to each important Truth, and he hath not done it in vain; he knows our need of it; and his Condescension in so doing, when he might have bound us up to the strictest terms of closing with the least intimation of his will, is for ever to be admired. For us to neglect this great effect and product of the Wisdom Grace and Love of God, is <hi>unspeakable folly.</hi> If we think we need it not, we make our selves wiser than God; if we think we do, and neglect our duty herein, we are really as <hi>unwise</hi> as the Beasts that perish. Want of this fortifying of faith by a diligent search after the testimonies given unto the truth proposed unto it to be believed, is the cause that so many every day turn away from it, and therewithall make <hi>shipwrack of faith and a good conscience.</hi> Let us then never think our selves safe in the knowledge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of any truth, but whilst we continue sincerely in the <hi>investigation</hi> of all the confirmation that God hath given it in his Word. The Opposition made to every Truth is so various, and from so many hands, that not the least contribution of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence unto it can be neglected with safety.</p>
                        <p n="iii">III. <hi>The whole Creation of God hath a great concernment in God's bringing forth Christ into the world, and his Exaltation in his Kingdom.</hi> Hence in the <hi>Psalm</hi> from whence these words are taken, all the principal parts of it are called on to <hi>triumph</hi> and rejoyce therein; <hi>The Earth, and the multitude of the Isles, the Heaven, and all People,</hi> are invited unto this congratulation; neither is any thing excluded but <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi>
                           <pb n="98" facs="tcp:50110:222"/>
whose ruine God intends in the Erection of the Kingdom of Christ. And this they have ground for.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because, in that <hi>Work</hi> consisted the principal manifestation of the Wisdom Power and Goodness of God. The whole Creation is concerned in the Glory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. In his Exaltation doth their honour interest and blessedness consist. For this End were they made, that God might be glorified. The more that is done by any means, the more is their <hi>End</hi> attained.</p>
                        <p>Hence the very <hi>inanimate parts</hi> of it are introduced by a <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>rejoycing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting shouting and clapping their hands,</hi> when the Glory of God is manifested; in all which, their suitableness and propensity to their proper End is declared; as also by their <hi>being burdened and groaning</hi> under such an Estate and Condition of things, as doth any way eclipse the Glory of their Maker. Now in this work of <hi>bringing forth the first-born</hi> is the Glory of God principally and eminently exalted. For the Lord Christ is the <hi>Brightness of his Glory,</hi> and in him all the Treasures of Wisdom Grace and Goodness, are laid up and hid. What ever God had any other wayes before <hi>parcelled</hi> out, of and concerning his Glory by the works of his hands, is all, and altogether, and with an unspeakable Addition of Beauty and Excellency, repeated in Christ.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The whole Creation receiveth a <hi>real Advancement and honour</hi> in the Sons being made the <hi>first-born of every creature,</hi> that is the especial <hi>Heir and Lord of them all.</hi> Their being brought into a new <hi>dependance</hi> on the Lord Christ, is their Honour, and they are exalted by becoming his Possession. For after that they had lost their first Original Dependance on God, and their respect unto him grounded on his pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of them <hi>exceeding good,</hi> that is such as became his Wisdom and Power to have made, they fell under the power of the <hi>Devil,</hi> who became <hi>Prince of this world</hi> by sin. Herein consisted the vanity and debasement of the Creature, which it was never <hi>willingly,</hi> or of <hi>its own accord</hi> subject unto. But God setting up the Kingdom of Christ, and making <hi>him the first-born,</hi> the whole Creation hath a right unto a new glorious Lord and Master. And however any part of it be violently for a season de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under its <hi>old bondage,</hi> yet it hath grounds of an earnest Expectation of a full and total Deliverance into Liberty, by vertue of this <hi>Primogeniture</hi> of Christ Jesus.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> the Inhabitants of Heaven and Earth, the principal parts of the Creation, on whom God hath in an especial manner estamped his own likeness and Image, are hereby made partakers of such inestimable Benefits, as indispensably call for <hi>rejoycing</hi> in a way of Thankfulness and Gratitude. This the whole Gospel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, and therefore it needs not our particular improvement in this place.</p>
                        <p>And if this be the duty of the whole Creation, it is easie to discern in what a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner it is incumbent on <hi>them that believe,</hi> whose Benefit Advantage and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was principally intended in this whole work of God. Should they be found wanting in this Duty, God might as of old call Heaven and Earth to witness against them. Yea, Thankfulness to God, for the <hi>bringing forth of the first-born</hi> into the world, is the summ and substance of all that Obedience which God requires at the hands of believers.</p>
                        <p n="iv">IV. <hi>The Command of God is the ground and Reason of all Religious Worship.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are to worship the Lord Christ the Mediator, and the ground of their so doing is Gods command: he saith, <hi>Worship him all ye Angels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the command of God is twofold: (1.) <hi>Formal</hi> and <hi>vocal</hi>; when God gives out a Law or Precept unto any creature superadded to the Law of its Creation: Such was the Command given unto our first Parents in the Garden, concerning the Tree of the <hi>knowledge of Good and Evil</hi>; and such were all the Laws, Precepts, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, which he afterwards gave unto his Church, with those which to this day continue as the Rule and Reason of their Obedience. (2.) <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>interpretative</hi>; consisting in an impression of the Mind and Will of God upon the nature of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with respect unto that Obedience which their state condition and dependance on him requireth. The very nature of an <hi>intellectual Creature</hi> made for the Glory of God, and placed in a <hi>moral</hi> dependance upon him, and subjection unto him, hath in it the force of a <hi>Command,</hi> as to the Worship and Service that God requireth at their hands. But this Law in man, being blotted, weakned, impaired through sin, God hath in mercy unto us collected, drawn forth, and disposed all the Directions and Commands of it in <hi>vocal formal</hi> Precepts recorded in his Word; whereunto he hath
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50110:222"/>
superadded sundry new Commands in the Institutions of his Worship. Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h <hi>Angels</hi> it is otherwise. The ingrafted <hi>Law of their Creation</hi> requiring of them the Worship of God and Obedience to his whole Will, is kept and preserved entire; so that they have no need to have it repeated and expressed in <hi>vocal formal</hi> Commands. And by vertue of this Law, were they obliged to constant and everlasting Worship of the Eternal Son of God, as being created and upheld in an universal dependance upon him. But now when God <hi>brings forth his Son into the world,</hi> and placeth him in a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of being <hi>incarnate,</hi> and becoming so the Head of his Church, there is a new <hi>Modification of the Worship</hi> that is due to him brought in, and a <hi>new respect</hi> unto things not considered in the first creation. With reference hereunto God gives a <hi>new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> unto the Angels, for that peculiar kind of Worship and Honour, which is due unto him in that state and condition which he had taken upon himself.</p>
                        <p>This the Law of their Creation in <hi>general</hi> directed them unto; but in <hi>particular</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not of them. It enjoyned the Worship of the Son of God in every condition, but that condition was not expressed. This God supplies by a <hi>new Command</hi>; That is such an Intimation of his Mind and Will unto them, as answers unto a <hi>vocal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> given unto men, who by that means only may come to know the Will of God. Thus in one way or other, <hi>Command</hi> is the Ground and Cause of all Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. All Worship is <hi>Obedience</hi>; Obedience respects Authority; and Authority exerts it self in Commands. And if this Authority be not the <hi>Authority of God,</hi> the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship performed in Obedience unto it, is not the Worship of God, but of him or them whose Commands and Authority are the Reason and cause of it. It is the <hi>Authority of God alone</hi> that can make any Worship to be <hi>religious,</hi> or the performance of it to be an Act of Obedience unto him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God would never allow that the Will and Wisdom of any of his Creatures should be the rise, <hi>Rule,</hi> or measure of his Worship, or any part of it, or any thing that belongs unto it: This Honour he hath reserved unto himself, neither will he <hi>part with it</hi> unto any other. He alone knows what becomes his own Greatness and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and what tends to the Advancement of his Glory. Hence the Scripture abounds with severe Interdictions and Comminations against them, who shall presume to do or appoint any thing in his Worship besides or beyond his own Institution.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. All Prescriptions of Worship are <hi>vain,</hi> where men have not <hi>strength</hi> to perform it in a due manner, nor Assurance of Acceptance when it is performed. Now both these are, and must be from God alone; nor doth he give <hi>strength</hi> and ability for any thing in his Worship but what himself commands; nor doth he promise to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept any thing but what is of his own Appointment; so that it is the greatest folly imaginable to undertake any thing in his Worship and Service, but what his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment gives warrant for.</p>
                        <p>And this should teach us in all that we have to do in the Worship of God carefully to look after his word of Command and Institution. Without this, all that we do is lost, as being no Obedience unto God. Yea, it is an open setting up of our own Wills and Wisdom against him, and that in things of his own especial concernment, which is intolerable boldness and presumption. Let us deal thus with our Rulers amongst men, and obey them not according to their Laws but our own fancies, and see whether they will accept our persons? And is the Great and Holy God less to be regarded? besides, what we have our own <hi>Inventions,</hi> or the <hi>Commands</hi> of other men as the ground and reason of our doing it, we have nothing but our own or their warranty for its Acceptance with God; and how far this will secure us, is easie to judge.</p>
                        <p>We might hence also farther observe,</p>
                        <p n="v">V. <hi>That the Mediator of the New Covenant is in his own Person God blessed for ever, to whom Divine or Religious Worship is due from the Angels themselves.</hi> As also that,</p>
                        <p n="vi">VI. <hi>The Father upon the account of the Work of Christ in the World, and his Kingdom that ensued it, gives a new Commandment unto the Angels to Worship him, his Glory being greatly concerned therein.</hi> And that,</p>
                        <p n="vii">VII. <hi>Great is the Churches security and Honour, when the Head of it is worshipped by all the Angels in Heaven</hi>; as also that,</p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:50110:223"/>VIII. <hi>It can be no duty of the Saints of the New Testament to worship Angels, who are their fellow servants in the worship of Jesus Christ.</hi>

                        <p>The Apostle here entereth upon his <hi>Third</hi> Argument to prove the Preheminence of the Lord Christ above Angels, and that by comparing them together, either as to their <hi>Natures,</hi> or as to their <hi>Employments,</hi> according as the one and the other is set forth declared and testified unto in the Scriptures of the Old Testament. And this first Place which he refers unto Angels, we shall now explain and vindicate. And in so doing enquire, both <hi>Who</hi> they are of whom the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, and <hi>what</hi> it is that he affirmeth of them.</p>
                        <p>There is a <hi>threefold sense</hi> given of the words of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> as they lye in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Text.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. The First is that of the <hi>Modern Jews,</hi> who deny that there is any mention made of <hi>Angels</hi>: affirming the Subject that the <hi>Psalmist</hi> treats of to be the <hi>Winds,</hi> with <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning,</hi> which God employes as his <hi>Messengers</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> to accomplish his Will and Pleasure. So he made the <hi>Winds</hi> his <hi>Messengers</hi> when he sent
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50110:223"/>
them to raise a storm on <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he fled from his Presence; and a <hi>flaming fire his Minister,</hi> when by it he consumed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi>; and this Opinion makes <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, which it interprets <hi>Winds,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, a <hi>flaming fire</hi> to be the <hi>Subject</hi> of the Proposition, of whom it is affirmed that God employes them as his <hi>Messengers</hi> and <hi>Ministers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That this Opinion which is directly contradictory to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Apostle, is so also to the <hi>Design</hi> of the Psalmist, sense of the Words, Consent of the Antient <hi>Jews,</hi> and so no way to be admitted, shall afterwards be made to appear.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Some averr that the <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Meteors</hi> are principally intended, but yet so, as that God affirming that he makes the <hi>Winds his Messengers,</hi> doth also intimate that it is the Work and Employment of his <hi>Angels</hi> above to be his Messengers also; and that because he maketh use of their <hi>Ministry</hi> to cause those <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Fires,</hi> whereby he accomplisheth his Will; And this they illustrate by the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Winds</hi> caused by them on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> at the giving of the Law.</p>
                        <p>But this Interpretation, whatever is pretended to the contrary, doth not really differ from the <hi>former,</hi> denying <hi>Angels</hi> to be intentionally spoken of, only <hi>hooking</hi> in a respect unto them, not to be seen to contradict the Apostle, and therefore will be disproved together with that which went before.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Others grant, that it is the <hi>Angels</hi> of whom the Apostle treats, but as to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the words, they are of two Opinions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Some make <hi>Spirits</hi> to be the <hi>subject</hi> of what is affirmed, and <hi>Angels</hi> to be the <hi>Predicate.</hi> In this sense, God is said to make those spiritual Substances Inhabitants of Heaven his <hi>Messengers,</hi> employing them in his service, and them whose nature is a <hi>flaming fire,</hi> that is, the <hi>Seraphims</hi> to be his <hi>Ministers,</hi> and to accomplish his pleasure. And this way, after <hi>Austin,</hi> go many Expositors, making the Term, <hi>Angels,</hi> here meerly to denote an Employment, and not the <hi>Persons</hi> employed. But as this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation also takes off from the Efficacy and Evidence of the Apostles Argument, so we shall see that there is nothing in the words themselves, leading to the Embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
                        <p>It remains therefore, that it is the <hi>Angels</hi> that are here spoken of, as also that they are intended and designed by that <hi>name,</hi> which denotes their <hi>Persons</hi> and not their employment.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That <hi>Angels</hi> are primarily intended by the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> contrary to the first Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Modern Jews,</hi> and the <hi>second</hi> mentioned, leaning thereunto: appears,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the scope and design of the <hi>Psalmist.</hi> For designing to set out the Glory of God in his works of Creation and Providence, after he had declared the framing of all things by his Power, which come under the name of <hi>Heaven, v.</hi> 2, 3. before he proceeds to the Creation of the Earth, passing over, with <hi>Moses,</hi> the creation of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> or couching it with him under the <hi>production of Light,</hi> or of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> as they are called in <hi>Job,</hi> he declareth his Providence and Soveraignty in employing his Angels between Heaven and Earth, as his servants for the accomplishment of his pleasure. Neither doth it at all suit his method or design, in his Enumeration of the works of God, to make mention of the Winds and Tempests, and their use in the <hi>Earth,</hi> before he had mentioned the <hi>Creation</hi> of the Earth its self; which follows in the next Verse unto this; so that these senses are excluded by the Context of the Psalm.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The consent of the <hi>Antient Jews</hi> lyes against the sentiments of the <hi>Modern</hi>; both the old <hi>Translations</hi> either made, or embraced by them, expresly refer the words unto <hi>Angels.</hi> So doth that of the <hi>LXX.</hi> as is evident from the words; and so doth the <hi>Targum</hi> thus rendring the place, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>who maketh his</hi> Messengers, <hi>or Angels swift as Spirits, and his Ministers strong</hi> or powerful, <hi>as a flaming fire.</hi> The supply of the <hi>note of similitude</hi> makes it evident that they understood the Text of <hi>Angels,</hi> and not Winds; and of making Angels as Spirits, and not of making <hi>Winds to be Angels</hi> or Messengers which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with their Words.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, doth usually denote the <hi>Angels</hi> themselves, and no reason can be given why it should not do so in this place.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Moreover it appears that that Term is the <hi>Subject</hi> of the Proposition. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Apostle, and the <hi>LXX.</hi> fixing the <hi>Articles</hi> before <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> do plainly determine the Subject spoken of. For although it may be, some variety may be observed in the use of <hi>Articles</hi> in other places, so that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50110:224"/>
they do not alwayes determine the <hi>subject</hi> of the Proposition, as sometimes confessedly they do, as <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>John</hi> 4.24. Yet in this place, where in the <hi>Original</hi> all the words are left indefinitely without any <hi>prefix</hi> to direct the <hi>Emphasis</hi> unto any one of them, the fixing of them in the <hi>Translation</hi> of the Apostle, and <hi>LXX.</hi> must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily design the <hi>subject</hi> of them or else by the addition of the <hi>Article,</hi> they leave the sense much more ambiguous than before, and give occasion to a great mistake in the Interpretation of the words.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Apostle speaks of <hi>Angels; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Angels he saith</hi>; and in all other Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies produced by him, that whereof he treats, hath the place of the <hi>subject</hi> spoken of, and not of that which is <hi>attributed</hi> unto any thing else. Neither can the words be freed from <hi>equivocation,</hi> if <hi>Angels</hi> in the first place denote the <hi>Persons</hi> of the Angels, and in the latter their <hi>employment</hi> only.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Design</hi> and scope of the Apostle requires this Construction of the words; for his intention is to prove by this Testimony, that the <hi>Angels</hi> are employed in <hi>such Works and Services,</hi> and in such a manner as that they are no way to be compared to the Son of God, in respect of that Office which as Mediator he hath undertaken; which the sense and construction contended for alone doth prove.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The <hi>Original Text</hi> requires this sense; for according to the common use of that Language, among words indefinitely used, the <hi>first</hi> denotes the <hi>subject</hi> spoken of, which is Angels here; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>making his Angels Spirits</hi>; and in such Propositions oft times some <hi>note of similitude</hi> is to be understood, without which the sense is not compleat; and which as I have shewed the <hi>Targum</hi> supplyeth in this place.</p>
                        <p>From what hath been said, I suppose it is made evident, both that the <hi>Psalmist</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly treats of <hi>Angels,</hi> and that that the <hi>subject</hi> spoken of by the Apostle is expressed in that word; and that following, of Ministers.</p>
                        <p>Our next enquiry is after what is affirmed concerning these <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> spoken of; And that is, that <hi>God makes them Spirits, and a flame of fire.</hi> And concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaning of these words there are two Opinions.</p>
                        <p>First, That the <hi>Creation of Angels</hi> is intended in the words; and the Nature whereof they were made is expressed in them. <hi>He made them Spirits</hi>; that is of a <hi>spiritual substance</hi>; and his Heavenly Ministers, quick, powerful, agile, as a <hi>flaming fire</hi>; Some carry this sense farther, and affirm that two sorts of <hi>Angels</hi> are intimated; one of an <hi>aerial substance</hi> like the Wind, and the other <hi>igneal</hi> or <hi>fiery,</hi> denying all pure intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences without mixture of matter, as the product of the <hi>School of Aristotle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this seems not to be the intention of the words; nor is the Creation of the Angels, or the substance whereof they consist, here expressed. For,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Analysis</hi> of the Psalm formerly touched on requires the referring of these words to the <hi>Providence</hi> of God employing of the Angels, and not to his <hi>Power</hi> in making them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Apostle in this place hath nothing to do with the <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of the Angels, but with their Dignity, Honour and Employment, on which accounts he preferreth the Lord Christ before them. Wherefore,</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Providence of God in disposing and employing of <hi>Angels</hi> in his service is intended in these words; and so they may have a double sense;</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That God employeth his Angels and Heavenly Ministers in the Production of those <hi>Winds,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and <hi>Fire,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> Thunder and Lightning, whereby he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth many Judgements in the world.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A note of <hi>similitude</hi> may be understood to compleat the sense; which is expressed in the <hi>Targum</hi> on the <hi>Psalm</hi>; he <hi>maketh,</hi> or sendeth <hi>his Angels like the Winds, or like a flaming fire,</hi> maketh them speedy, spiritual, agil, powerful, quickly and effectually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing the work that is appointed unto them.</p>
                        <p>Either way this is the plain intendment of the <hi>Psalm</hi>; that God useth and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Angels in effecting the Works of his Providence here below, and they were made to serve the Providence of God in that way and manner. This saith the Apostle is the Testimony which the Holy Ghost gives concerning them, their Nature, Duty and Work wherein they serve the Providence of God; But now saith he, consider what the Scripture saith concerning the Son, how it calls him <hi>God,</hi> how it ascribes a <hi>Throne</hi> and a <hi>Kingdom</hi> unto him, (Testimonies whereof he produceth in the next Verses) and you will easily discern his Preheminence above them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="103" facs="tcp:50110:224"/>But before we proceed to the consideration of the ensuing Testimonies we may make some Observations on that which we have already passed through: as,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Our conceptions of the Angels, their Nature, Office and Work is to be regulated by the Scripture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Jews of old had many curious speculations about Angels, wherein they greatly <hi>pleased,</hi> and greatly <hi>deceived</hi> themselves. Wherefore the Apostle in his dealing with them calls them off from all their foolish imaginations, to attend unto those things which God hath revealed in his word concerning them. This the <hi>Holy Ghost saith of them,</hi> and therefore this we are to receive and believe, and this alone: For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This will keep us unto that <hi>becoming Sobriety</hi> in things above us, which both the Scripture greatly commends, and is exceedingly suited unto Right Reason. The Scripture minds us, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>To keep our selves within the bounds of Modesty, and to be wise to sobriety.</hi> And the Rule of that Sobriety is given us for ever, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.28. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Secret things belong to the Lord our God, but revealed things to us and our Children.</hi> Divine Revelation is the <hi>Rule</hi> and measure of our knowledge in these things, and that bounds and determines our sobriety. And hence the Apostle condemning the Curiosity of men in this very subject about Angels, makes the nature of their sin to consist in <hi>exceeding these bounds,</hi> by an enquiry into things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed, and the rise of that evil to lye in Pride, Vanity and Fleshliness, and the tendency of it to be unto <hi>false Worship,</hi> Superstition and Idolatry, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. Neither is there any thing more averse from Right Reason, nor more condemned by wise men of former times, than a <hi>curious humour</hi> of prying into those things wherein we are not concerned; and for whose investigation we have no certain, honest, lawful Rule or <hi>medium.</hi> And this evil is encreased where God himself hath given bounds to our enquiries, as in this case he hath.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This alone will bring us unto any <hi>Certainty and Truth.</hi> Whilest men indulge to their own imaginations and fancies, as too many in this matter have been apt to do, it is sad to consider how they have wandered up and down, and with what fond Conceits they have deceived themselves and others. The world hath been filled with monstrous Opinions and Doctrines about Angels, their Nature, Offices and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; some have <hi>Worshipped</hi> them, others pretended I know not what <hi>Communion</hi> and entercourse with them, in all which conceits there hath been <hi>little</hi> of Truth, and <hi>nothing</hi> at all of Certainty. Whereas if men according to the Example of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, would keep themselves to the word of God, as they would know enough in this matter for the discharging of their own Duty, so they would have Assurance and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth in their conceptions, without which pretended high and raised noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are but a <hi>shadow of a dream,</hi> worse then professed ignorance.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. We may hence observe, <hi>That the Glory, Honour and Exaltation of Angels lyes in their subserviency to the Povidence of God</hi>; It lyes not so much in their Nature, as in their work and service. The intention of the Apostle is to shew the Glory of Angels and their Exaltation, which he doth by the induction of this Testimony, reporting their serviceableness in the works wherein of God they are employed. God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed the Angels with a very <hi>Excellent Nature</hi>; furnished them with many eminent properties of Wisdom, Power, Agility, Perpetuity; but yet what is hereby glorious and honourable herein, consists not <hi>meerly in their nature it self,</hi> and its Essential Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, all which abide in the horridest and most to be detested Part of the <hi>whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> namely, the <hi>Devils</hi>; but in their conformity and answerableness unto the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of God, that is in their <hi>moral,</hi> not meerly <hi>natural</hi> Endowments; These make them amiable, glorious, excellent. Unto this their Readiness for, and compliance with the will of God, that God having made them for his service, and employing them in his work, their discharge of their Duty therein, with Cheerfulness, Alacrity, Readiness and Ability, is that which renders them truly honourable and glorious. Their Readiness and Ability to serve the Providence of God is their Glory. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The greatest <hi>Glory</hi> that any Creature can be made partaker of is to serve the Will, and set forth the Praise of its Creator. That is its Order and Tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its Principal End, in which <hi>two</hi> all true Honour consists. It is glorious even in the Angels to serve the God of Glory; what is there above this for a creature
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50110:225"/>
to aspire unto? what that its nature is capable of? Those among the Angels, who as it seems attempted <hi>somewhat farther,</hi> somewhat <hi>higher,</hi> attained nothing but an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Ruine in shame and misery. Men are ready to fancy strange things about the Glory of Angels, and do little consider, that all the difference in Glory that is in any parts of Gods Creation, lyes meerly in Willingness, Ability and Readiness to serve God their Creator.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The works wherein God employes them in a subservience unto his Providence, are in an especial manner glorious works. For the service of Angels as it is intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us in the Scripture, it may be reduced unto two Heads. For they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed either in the communication of Protection and Blessings to the Church, or in the Execution of the <hi>Vengeance</hi> and Judgements of God against his Enemies. Instances to both these purposes may be multiplyed; but they are commonly known. Now these are glorious works. God in them eminently exalts his Mercy and Justice, the two properties of his Nature, in the Execution whereof he is most eminently exalted; and from these works ariseth all that Revenue of Glory and Praise which God is pleased to reserve to himself from the world; so that it must needs be very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be employed in these works.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They perform their Duty in their service in a very <hi>glorious manner</hi>; with great Power, Wisdom, and uncontroulable Efficacy. Thus <hi>one</hi> of them flew 145000. of the Enemies of God in a night; <hi>Another</hi> set fire on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> from Heaven; of the like Power and Expedition are they in all their services; in all things to the utmost capacity of creatures answering the Will of God. God himself, it is true, sees <hi>that</hi> in them and their Works, which keeps them short of absolute Purity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; which are his own Properties; but as to the capacity of <hi>meer Creatures,</hi> and for their state and condition, there is a perfection in their Obedience, and that is their Glory.</p>
                        <p>Now if this be the great <hi>Glory of Angels,</hi> and we poor worms of the earth are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited as we are, into a <hi>Participation</hi> with them therein, what unspeakable folly will it be in us, if we be found negligent in labouring to attain thereunto. Our <hi>future</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry consists in this, that we shall be made <hi>like unto Angels</hi>; and our Way towards it is to do the Will of our <hi>Father on Earth,</hi> as it is <hi>done by them in Heaven.</hi> Oh in how many Vanities doth <hi>vain man</hi> place his Glory; nothing so shamefull that one or other hath not gloried in; whilest the true and only glory of doing the will of God is neglected by almost all. But we must treat again of these things upon the last <hi>Verse</hi> of this Chapter.</p>

                        <p>This <hi>testimony</hi> is produced by the Apostle in answer unto that fore-going concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels. <hi>Those</hi> words, saith he, were spoken by the Holy Ghost of the Angels, wherein their Office and Employment under the Providence of God is described. <hi>These</hi> are spoken by the <hi>same Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> or spoken to him; denoting his <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence</hi> unto the Prophesies themselves.</p>
                        <p>There is little or no difficulty to prove that this <hi>Testimony</hi> belongs properly unto him by whom it is applied by the Apostle. The antient <hi>Jews</hi> granted it, and the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50110:226"/>
present <hi>Doctors</hi> cannot deny it: One of them sayes indeed, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, this <hi>Psalm</hi> is <hi>spoken of David or the Messiah.</hi> These are the words, and this is the opinion of <hi>Aben-Ezra,</hi> who accordingly endeavours to give a double sense of the chief passages in this <hi>Psalm</hi>; one as applied unto <hi>David,</hi> another as applied unto the <hi>Messiah</hi> which he enclines unto. <hi>Jarchi</hi> turns it into an <hi>Allegory,</hi> without any tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sense throughout his discourse. But though it might respect them both, yet there is no pretence to make <hi>David</hi> the subject of it; the Title and whole Contexture of it excluding such an Application.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Targum</hi> wholly applies the Psalm to the <hi>Messiah</hi>; which is somewhat a better evidence of the Conception of the <hi>antient Jews,</hi> than the private Opinion of any later Writer can give us. And the <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Psalm</hi> in that <hi>Paraphrase,</hi> would make it a Prophesie given out in the days of <hi>Moses,</hi> for the use of the <hi>Sanedrin</hi>; which manifests what account it had of old in their <hi>Creed</hi> concerning the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some <hi>Christian Interpreters</hi> have so far assented unto the latter <hi>Rabbins,</hi> as to grant that <hi>Solomon</hi> was primarily intended in this Psalm as a Type of Christ; and that the whole was an <hi>Epithalamium</hi> or Marriage-song, composed upon his <hi>Nuptials with the Daughter of Pharaoh.</hi> But there want not important Reasons against this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is not probable that the Holy Ghost should so celebrate <hi>that Marriage,</hi> which as it was antecedently <hi>forbidden</hi> by God, so it was never consequently blessed by him, she being among the number of <hi>those strange women which tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ned his heart from God,</hi> and was cursed with barrenness; the first forreign breach that came upon his Family and all his <hi>Magnificence</hi> being also from <hi>Egypt,</hi> where his transgression began.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There is scarce any thing in the <hi>Psalm</hi> that can with propriety of speech be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto <hi>Solomon.</hi> Two things are especially insisted on in the former part of the <hi>Psalm</hi>; first, the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of the Person spoken of in all his ways and administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and then the perpetuity of his Kingdom. How the <hi>first</hi> of these can be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto him, whose transgressions and sins were so publick and notorious; or the <hi>latter</hi> to him who reigned but forty years, and then left his <hi>Kingdom</hi> broken and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to a <hi>wicked foolish son,</hi> is hard to conceive.</p>
                        <p>As all then grant that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is <hi>principally,</hi> so there is no cogent reason to prove that he is not <hi>solely</hi> intended in this Psalm. I will not contend, but that sundry things treated of in it might be obscurely typified in the Kingdom and <hi>Magnificence</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi>; yet it is certain, that most of the things mentioned, and expressions of them, do so <hi>immediately</hi> and directly belong unto the Lord Christ, as that they can in no sense be applied unto the person of <hi>Solomon</hi>; and such are the words insisted on in this place by our Apostle, as will be made evident in the ensuing explication of them.</p>
                        <p>We must then in the <hi>next place</hi> consider what it is that the Apostle intends to prove and confirm by this testimony, whereby we shall discover its suitableness unto his design. Now this is not, as some have supposed, the <hi>Deity of Christ</hi>; nor doth he make use of that directly in this place, though he do in the next verse, as a <hi>medium</hi> to prove his Preheminence above the Angels, although the testimonies which he produceth do eminently mention his <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> But that which he designs to evince is this only, that He whom they saw for a time made <hi>lower than the Angels, chap.</hi> 2.10. was yet in his <hi>whole Person,</hi> and as he discharged the Office committed unto him, so far <hi>above</hi> them, as that he had Power to alter and change those Institutions which were given out by the <hi>ministery of Angels.</hi> And this he doth undeniably by the testimonies alledged, as they are compared together. For whereas the Scripture testifies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels, that they are <hi>all servants,</hi> and that their chiefest Glory consists in the discharge of their Duty as servants; unto Him a Throne, Rule, and Everlasting Dominion, administred with Glory, Power, Righteousness and Equity are ascribed: whence it is evident, that he is exceedingly exalted above them, as is a <hi>King on his Throne</hi> above the servants that attend him and do his pleasure.</p>
                        <p>And this is sufficient to manifest the design of the Apostle, as also the evidence of his <hi>Argument</hi> from this testimony. The Exposition of the words belongs properly to the place from whence they are taken. But yet that we may not leave the <hi>Reader</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied as to any particular difficulty that may seem to occur in them, this Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be here also attended.</p>

Which places <hi>Jarchi</hi> produceth in his Comment, to countenance this sense but in vain.</p>
                        <p>It is then the <hi>True God</hi> that is spoken unto in this <hi>Apostrophe, Elohim, O God.</hi> This being granted, <hi>Erasmus</hi> starts a new Interpretation of the whole words, though he seemeth not to approve of his own invention: <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>It is uncertain,</hi> saith he, <hi>whether the meaning be, Thy throne, O God, or God is thy throne for ever:</hi> in the first way, the word is an <hi>Apostrophe</hi> to the Son, in the latter it expresseth the Person of the Father. And this Interpretation is embraced and improved by <hi>Grotius,</hi> who granting that the word <hi>Elohim</hi> used absolutely signifieth as much as <hi>Elohe Elohim,</hi> the God of Gods, would not allow that it should be spoken of Christ, and therefore renders the words, <hi>God shall be thy seat for ever,</hi> that is, shall establish thee in thy Throne. And this Evasion is also fixed on by <hi>Aben-Ezra,</hi> from <hi>Hagaon,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; <hi>God shall establish thy throne.</hi> May men be allowed thus to thrust in what words they please into the Text, leading to another sense than what it self expresseth, there will not much be left <hi>certain</hi> in the whole Book of God. However, in this present <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> we have light enough to rebuke the boldness of this attempt. For, 1. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation insisted on is contrary to all old <hi>Translations,</hi> whose language would bear a difference in the word, expressing it in the <hi>Vocative Case, O God.</hi> 2. Contrary to the <hi>received sense</hi> of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> of old, and in especial of the <hi>Targum</hi> on the Psalm, rendring the words, <hi>Thy throne, O God, is in heaven, for ever.</hi> 3. Contrary to the <hi>conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xture and design</hi> of the Apostles discourses, as may appear from the consideration of the preceding Enarration of them. 4. Leaves no tollerable sense unto the words; neither can they who embrace it declare in what sense <hi>God is the throne of Christ.</hi> 5. Is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the universally constant use of the expression in Scripture; for where ever there is mention of the <hi>Throne of Christ,</hi> somewhat else, and not God, is intended thereby. 6. The word supplied by <hi>Grotius</hi> from <hi>Saadias</hi> and <hi>Aben-Ezra,</hi> to induce a sense unto his Exposition, <hi>[shall establish]</hi> makes a new Text, or leads the old utterly from the intention of the words. For whereas it cannot be said, that <hi>God is the throne of Christ,</hi> nor was there any need to say, that God <hi>was for ever and ever,</hi> which two things must take up the whole intendment of the words, if God the Father be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, the adding of, <hi>shall establish,</hi> or confirm, into the Text, gives it an arbitrary sense, and such as by the like suggestion of any other word, (as <hi>shall destroy</hi>) may be rendred quite of another importance.</p>
                        <p>It is Christ then, the Son, that is spoken to and denoted by that name <hi>Elohim, O God,</hi> as being the true God by Nature, though what is here affirmed of him be not <hi>as God,</hi> but as the King of his Church and People; as in another place, <hi>God is said to redeem his Church with his own bloud.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may consider what is assigned unto him, which is his Kingdom; and that is described, 1. By the <hi>Insignia regalia,</hi> the Royal Ensigns of it, namely his Throne and Scepter. 2. By its duration, <hi>it is for ever.</hi> 3. His manner of Administration, it is with Righteousness; his <hi>Scepter is a Scepter of righteousness.</hi> 4. His furniture or prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for this Administration, he <hi>loved righteousness and hated iniquity.</hi> 5. By an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct priviledge, <hi>unction with the Oil of gladness</hi>: Which, 6. is exemplified by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with <hi>others,</hi> it is so with him, <hi>above his fellows.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first <hi>insigne regium</hi> mentioned, is his Throne, whereunto the Attribute of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity is annexed, <hi>it is for ever.</hi> And this <hi>Throne</hi> denotes the Kingdom it self. A Throne is the seat of a King in his Kingdom, and is frequently used <hi>metonymically</hi> for the Kingdom it self, and that applied unto God and man. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.2, 7. Angels indeed are called <hi>Thrones, Col.</hi> 1.16. But that is either <hi>metaphorically</hi> only, or else in respect of some especial service allotted unto them; as they are also called
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50110:227"/>
                           <hi>Princes, Dan.</hi> 10.13. yet being indeed <hi>servants, Rev.</hi> 22.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. These are no where said to <hi>have Thrones</hi>; the Kingdom is not theirs, but the Sons. And whereas our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ</hi> promiseth his Apostles that they shall at the last day <hi>sit on Thrones judging the Tribes of Israel</hi>: as it proves their participation with Christ in his Kingly Power, being made <hi>Kings unto God, Rev.</hi> 1.5. and their interest in the Kingdom which it is his pleasure to give them, so it proves not absolutely that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> is theirs, but his on whose Throne theirs do attend.</p>
                        <p>Neither doth the Throne simply denote the Kingdom of Christ, or his supream Rule and Dominion; but the Glory also of his Kingdom, being on his Throne, is in the <hi>height</hi> of his Glory. And thus because God manifests his Glory in Heaven, he calls that his <hi>Throne,</hi> as the Earth is his footstool, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.1. So that the Throne of Christ is his Glorious Kingdom elsewhere expressed by his <hi>sitting down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> To this Throne <hi>Eternity</hi> is attributed; it is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>for ever and ever.</hi> So is the Throne of Christ said to be in Opposition unto the frail mutable Kingdoms of the earth. <hi>Of the increase of his Government and Peace there shall be no end, upon the Throne of</hi> David, <hi>and upon his Kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgement and with justice from henceforth and for ever,</hi> Isa. 9.7. <hi>His Dominion is an everlasting Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which shall not pass away, and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, Dan,</hi> 7.14. <hi>Micah</hi> 4.7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.7, 17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.13. It shall neither decay of it self, nor fail through the Opposition of its Enemies: for he must reign untill <hi>all his enemies are made his footstool,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 25, 26, 27. Nor is it any impeachment of the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of the Kingdom of Christ, that at the <hi>last day he shall deliver it up to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. Seeing that then shall be an end of all Rule. It is enough that it continue untill all the <hi>Ends of Rule</hi> be perfectly accomplished; that is, untill all the enemies of it be subdued, and all the Church be saved, and the Righteousness Grace and Patience of God be fully glorified; whereof afterwards.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The second <hi>insigne Regium,</hi> is his <hi>Scepter.</hi> And this though it sometimes also denote the Kingdom it self, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.17. <hi>Isa.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Zech.</hi> 10.11. Yet here it denotes the actual Administration of Rule, as is evident from the <hi>Adjunct of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightness</hi> annexed unto it. And thus the Scepter denotes both the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Kingdom, and the Efficacy of the Government it self. So that which we call a <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Government,</hi> is here called a Scepter of Uprightness.</p>
                        <p>Now the Means whereby Christ carrieth on his Kingdom, are his Word and Spirit, with a <hi>subserviency of Power</hi> in the works of his Providence, to make way for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of his Word to avenge its Contempt. So the Gospel is called, <hi>The rod of his strength, Psalm</hi> 110.2. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. <hi>He smites the earth with the rod of his mouth, and slayes the wicked with the breath of his lips, Isa.</hi> 11.4. And these are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the sword of his Power and Providence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.3. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.15. or <hi>his rod, Psal.</hi> 2.8. or <hi>sickle, Revel.</hi> 14.18. In these things consists the Scepter of Christs Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Concerning this <hi>Scepter</hi> it is affirmed, that it is a <hi>Scepter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightness.</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, denotes either the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Scepter, that it is <hi>straight</hi> and right, or the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>se</hi> of it, that it is lifted up or stretched out, as was shewed in the opening of the words. In the <hi>first</hi> sense it denoteth Righteousness, in the <hi>latter</hi> Mercy. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>first</hi> sense, the following words, <hi>thou hast loved Righteousness,</hi> discover the <hi>habitual</hi> root of his <hi>actual</hi> Righteous Administration. According to the <hi>latter,</hi> there is a progress made in them to a farther qualification of the Rule of Christ, or of Christ in his Rule. But the former sense is rather to be embraced; the latter <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor</hi> being more strained and sounded only in one instance that I remember in the Scripture, and that not taken from among the people of God, but Strangers and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors, <hi>Esther</hi> 5.2.</p>
                        <p>The Scepter then of the Kingdom of Christ is a <hi>Scepter of Righteousness,</hi> because all the Laws of his Gospel are Righteous, Holy, Just, full of Benignity and Truth, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12. And all his Administration of Grace, Mercy, Justice, Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according to the Rules, Promises and Threats of it, in the Conversion, Pardon, Sanctification, Trials, Afflictions, Chastisements, and Preservation of <hi>his Elect,</hi> in his convincing, hardening, and destruction of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> are all <hi>Righteous,</hi> holy, unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and good, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.4, 5, 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 32.7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.34. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.5. and as such will they be gloriously manifested at the last day, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.10. though in this present world they are reproached and despised.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="109" facs="tcp:50110:227"/>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Habitual Frame of the Heart of Christ</hi> in his Regal Administrations. <hi>He loveth Righteousness and hateth Iniquity.</hi> This shews the absolute compleatness of the Righteousness of Christs Kingdom, and of his Righteousness in his Kingdom. The Laws of his Rule are righteous, and his Administrations are righteous, and they all proceed from an habitual love to Righteousness, and hatred of Iniquity in his own person. Among the Governments of this world, oft times the very Laws are <hi>tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,</hi> unjust and oppressive; and if the Laws are good and equal, yet oft times their Administration is unjust, partial and wicked; or when men do abstain from such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancies, yet frequently they do so upon the account of some self-interest and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, like <hi>Jehu,</hi> and not out of a constant, equal, unchangeable <hi>love of Righteousness and hatred of iniquity</hi>; but all these are absolutely compleat in the Kingdom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. For whereas the expression both in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> seems to regard the time past, <hi>thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity,</hi> yet the constant present frame of the heart of Christ in his Rule is denoted thereby; for the <hi>Greek</hi> Translation exactly followeth and expresseth the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Now there being no <hi>form of Verbs</hi> in that Language expressing the <hi>present time,</hi> there is nothing more frequent in it than to denote that which is present and abiding, by the <hi>Praeterperfect Tense,</hi> as it doth in this place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Consequence of this Righteous Rule in Christ is, his <hi>Anointing with the Oyle of Gladness</hi>; wherein we may consider, (1.) The <hi>Author</hi> of the Priviledge conferred on him; that is, <hi>God, his God.</hi> (2.) The <hi>Priviledge it self,</hi> Unction with the oyle of gladness. (3.) The <hi>Connection</hi> of the collation of this priviledge unto what went before; <hi>wherefore,</hi> or for which cause.</p>

The name <hi>God,</hi> in the first place, denotes him <hi>absolutely</hi> who conferred this priviledge on the Lord Christ, that <hi>is God</hi>; and in the second place, a reason is intimated of the coll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion its self, by an Appropriation of <hi>God to be his God</hi> in a peculiar manner.</p>
                        <p>God is said to be the <hi>God of the Son,</hi> upon a threefold account; 1. In respect of his <hi>Divine Nature</hi>; as he is his <hi>Father,</hi> so <hi>his God,</hi> whence he is said to be <hi>God of God</hi>; as having his nature communicated unto him by vertue of his Eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. 2. In respect of his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> as he was <hi>made of a Woman made under the Law</hi>; so God also was his God; as he is the God of all creatures: <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.1. 3. In respect of his whole person, God and Man, as he was designed by his Father to the work of Mediation; In which sense he calls him <hi>his God and his Father, John</hi> 20.17. And in this last sense is it, that God is here said to be <hi>his God</hi>; that is, <hi>his God</hi> in especial Covenant, as he was designed and appointed to be the Head and King of his Church: For therein did God the Father undertake to be with him, to stand by him, to carry him through with his work, and in the End to crown him with Glory. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> 50.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Priviledge</hi> it self, it is <hi>Vnction with the Oyle of Gladness.</hi> There may be a double Allusion in these words. 1. To the <hi>common use</hi> of Oyle, and anointing, which was to <hi>exhilerate</hi> and make the countenance appear chearful at Feasts and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Solemnities, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.15. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.37. 2. To the <hi>especial use</hi> of it in the Unction of Kings, Priests and Prophets, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. That the <hi>Ceremony</hi> was typical, is evident from <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.1. and it denoted the collation of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost, whereby the <hi>Person anointed</hi> was enabled for the discharge of the Office he was called unto. And in this sense there is commonly assigned a threefold Unction of Christ. 1. At his <hi>Conception,</hi> when his Humane Nature was sanctified by the Holy Spirit, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. and radically endowed with Wisdom and Grace which he grew up in <hi>Luke</hi> 2.40, 52. 2. At his <hi>Baptism</hi> and entrance into his publick Ministry, when he was in an especial manner furnished with those Gifts of the Spirit which were needful for the discharge of his Prophetical Office, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. At his <hi>Ascension,</hi> when he received of the Father the Promise of the Spirit, to pour him forth upon his Disciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50110:228"/>
Now though I acknowledge the Lord Christ to have been thus <hi>anointed,</hi> and that the communication of the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit unto him in fulness, is called his <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi>; yet I cannot grant that any of them are here directly intended. But that which the Apostle seems here to express with the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> is the Glorious Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jesus Christ, when he was solemnly enstated in his Kingdom: This is that which is called the making of him both Lord and Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. When God raised him from the dead, and gave him <hi>glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. He is called <hi>Christ</hi> from the Unction of the Spirit; and yet here in his Exaltation, he is said in especial manner to be made Christ; that is, taken gloriously into the Possession of all the Offices and their full Administration, whereunto he was anointed and fitted by the communication of the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit unto him.

                           </gap>, (the third thing considerable in this last clause of the Testimony) doth plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it. The Lord Christs Love to Righteousness and Hatred to Iniquity, proceeded from his <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> with the Graces and Gifts of the Spirit; and yet they are plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated here to go before this anointing <hi>with the Oyle of gladness</hi>; which is therefore mentioned, as the Consequent of his discharge of his Office in this world, in like manner as his Exaltation every where is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. And if this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing denote the <hi>first Vnction</hi> of Christ, then must he be supposed to have the Love to Righteousness mentioned, from elsewhere, as antecedent thereunto, which is not so. Wherefore these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, do declare at least a Relation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruency and Conveniency unto an antecedent discharge of Office in the Lord Christ, and are of the same importance with <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.9. and so can respect nothing but his glorious Exaltation, which is thus expressed.</p>
                        <p>The last thing considerable in the words, is the Prerogative of the Lord Christ in this Priviledge; <hi>He is anointed above his fellows.</hi> Now these <hi>Fellows, Companions,</hi> or Associates of the Lord Christ, may be considered either <hi>generally,</hi> for all those that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with him in this Unction, which are all Believers, who are <hi>Co-heirs</hi> with him, and thereby <hi>heirs of God, Rom.</hi> 8.17. or more <hi>especially</hi> for those who were employed by God, in the Service Building and Rule of his Church in their subordination unto him; such as were the <hi>Prophets</hi> of old, and afterwards the <hi>Apostles, Ephes.</hi> 2.20. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto both sorts the Lord Christ is <hi>anointed with the Oyle of gladness above them</hi>; but the latter sort are especially intended; concerning whom the Apostle gives an especial instance in <hi>Moses, Ch.</hi> 3. affirming the Lord Christ in his work about the Church to be made partaker of more Glory than he. In a word, he is incomprehensibly exalted above Angels and Men.</p>
                        <p>And this is the <hi>first Testimony</hi> whereby the Apostle confirms his Assertion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of the Lord Christ above Angels, in that comparison which he makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; which also will afford the ensuing Observations.</p>
                        <p n="i">I. <hi>The conferring and comparing of Scriptures is an excellent means of coming to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Mind and Will of God in them.</hi> Thus dealeth the Apostle in this place; he compareth what is spoken of <hi>Angels</hi> in one place, and what of the <hi>Son</hi> in another, and from thence manifesteth what is the mind of God concerning them. This duty lyes in the command we have to <hi>search the Scriptures, John</hi> 5.39. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, make a diligent Investigation of the <hi>Mind of God</hi> in them, <hi>comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</hi> What God hath declared of the <hi>mind of the Spirit</hi> in one place, with what in like manner he hath manifested in another. God to try our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to exercise our Diligence, unto a study in his Word <hi>day and night, Psal.</hi> 1.2. and our continual <hi>Meditation</hi> thereon, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15. (<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on these things, be wholly in them</hi>) hath planted his Truths with great Variety up and down his Word; yea, here one part, and there another of the same Truth, which cannot be throughly learned, unless we gather them together into one view. For instance, In one place, God commands us to <hi>circumcise our Hearts,</hi> and to make
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50110:228"/>
unto our selves <hi>new hearts,</hi> that we may fear him; which at first consideration seems so to represent it not only as our Duty, but also within our Power, as though we had no need of any help from Grace for its Accomplishment. In another he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth absolutely to <hi>circumcise our hearts,</hi> and to <hi>give us new hearts</hi> to fear him, as though it were so his work, as not to be our concernment to attempt it. But now these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places being <hi>spiritually</hi> compared together, make it evident, that as it is our Duty to have <hi>new and circumcised hearts,</hi> so it is the Effectual Grace of God that must work and create them in us. And the like may be observed in all the important Truths that are of Divine Revelation. And this,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Discovers the Root of almost all the Errors and Heresies that are in the World. Men whose hearts are not subdued by Faith and Humility unto the Obedience of the Truth, <hi>lighting</hi> on some Expressions in the Scripture, that singly considered seem to give countenance to some such Opinion as they are willing to embrace; without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther search they fix it on their minds and imagination, untill it is too late to oppose any thing unto it. For when they are once fixed in their perswasions, those other places of Scripture which they should with Humility have <hi>compared</hi> with that whose seeming sense they cleave unto, and from thence have learned the <hi>mind of the Holy Ghost</hi> in them all, are considered by them to no other End, but only how they may <hi>pervert them,</hi> and free themselves from the Authority of them. This I say, seems to be the way of the most of them, who pertinaciously cleave unto false and foolish Opinions. They rashly take up a seeming sense of some particular places, and then obstinately make that sense the Rule of interpreting all other Scriptures what ever. Thus in our own dayes, we have many who from the <hi>outward sound</hi> of those words, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>He is the true light which lighteneth every man that comes into the world,</hi> having taken up a rash, foolish and false imagination that Christ is that <hi>Light which is remaining in all men,</hi> and therein their Guide and Rule, do from thence either wrest the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to make it suit and answer that supposal, or else utterly slight and despise it; when if they had compared it with other Scriptures which clearly explain and declare the mind of God in the things which concern the Person and Mediation of the Lord Christ, with the Nature and Works of <hi>natural,</hi> and <hi>saving spiritual light,</hi> and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Authority and Wisdom of God in them, they might have been preserved from their delusion. It shews also,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Danger that there is unto men unskilled and unexercised in the Word of Truth: when without the Advice, Assistance, or Directions of others who are able to guide them and instruct their Enquiry after the mind of God. They <hi>hastily</hi> embrace Opinions, which it may be some one Text or other of Scripture doth <hi>seemingly</hi> give countenance unto. By this means do men run themselves into the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Danger every day; especially where any <hi>seducing Spirit</hi> applyes himself unto them, with <hi>swelling words of vanity,</hi> boasting of some misunderstood word or other. Thus have we seen multitudes lead by some general Expressions in two or three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places of Scripture, into an Opinion about a general Redemption of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and every Individual thereof; when if they had been wise, and able to have searched those other Scriptures innumerable, setting forth the <hi>Eternal Love of God to his Elect,</hi> his purpose to save them by Jesus Christ, the nature and end of his Oblation and ransom, and compared them with others, they would have understood the vanity of their hasty Conceptions.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From these things it appears, what Diligence, Patience, Waiting, Wisdom is required of all men in searching of the Scriptures, who intend to come unto the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Truth thereby. And unto this end, and because of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our concernment therein, doth the Scripture it self abound with Precepts, Rules, Directions, to enable us unto a <hi>right and profitable discharging</hi> of our Duty. They are too many here to be inserted. I shall only add, that the <hi>Diligence</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens will rise up in judgement and condemn the <hi>sloth</hi> of many that are called Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in this matter. For whereas they had no <hi>certain Rule,</hi> Way, or means to come to the knowledge of the Truth, yet they ceased not with indefatigable diligence and industry to enquire after it, and to trace the <hi>obscure footsteps</hi> of what was left in their own natures, or implanted on the works of Creation. But many, the most of those unto whom God hath granted the <hi>inestimable benefit</hi> and priviledge of his Word, as a sure and <hi>infallible Guide</hi> to lead them into the knowledge of all useful and saving Truth, do openly neglect it, not accounting it worthy their <hi>searching,</hi> study, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Examination. How wofully will this rise up in Judgement against them at the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50110:229"/>
last day, is not difficult to conceive. And how much greater will be their misery, who under various pretences for their own corrupt ends, do deter, yea and <hi>drive</hi> others from the study of it.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. <hi>It is the duty of all Believers to rejoyce in the Glory, Honour and Dominion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> The Church in the <hi>Psalm</hi> takes by faith a prospect at a great distance of his Coming and Glory; and breaks out thereon in a way of Exultation and Triumph in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those words; <hi>Thy Throne O God is for ever.</hi> And if this were a matter of such joy unto them, who had only an <hi>obscure Vision</hi> and Representation of the glory which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages after was to follow, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11.12. what ought the full Accomplishment and manifestation of it, be unto them that believe now in the dayes of the the Gospel. This made them of old rejoyce with <hi>joy unspeakable and full of Glory,</hi> even because they saw and heard the things which <hi>Kings Wise men and Prophets</hi> desired to see, and saw them not; <hi>God having prepared some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect, Chap.</hi> 11.40. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Herein God is glorified</hi>: The Kingdom of Christ is the glory of God; thereby is his Name and Praise exalted in the world; and therefore upon the Erection and setting of it up, are all his People so earnestly invited to rejoyce and triumph therein, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.1, 2, 3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 96.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I say is a cause of Eternal Joy unto all his Saints, that God is pleased to glorifie himself, and all the infinite Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his Nature in the Kingdom and Rule of Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Herein doth the Honour and Glory of Christ as <hi>Mediator</hi> consist, which is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great rejoycing unto all that love him in sincerity. He tells his Disciples, <hi>John</hi> 14.28. <hi>That if they loved him, they would rejoyce because he said he went unto the Father.</hi> They considered only their own present condition and distres, being <hi>filled with sorrow,</hi> because he had told them of his Departure from them: but saith he, Where is your Love to me? Ought you not to have that in your hearts as well as care of your selves? for your Condition I shall take care, and provide for your <hi>securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; and if you love me, you cannot but rejoyce <hi>because I go to my Father</hi> to receive my Kingdom. That he <hi>who loved us,</hi> that gave himself for us, that underwent every thing that is reproachful or miserable for our sakes, is now exalted, glorified, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned in an everlasting immoveable Kingdom, above all his Enemies, secure from all Opposition, is a matter of inexpressible Joy, if we have any love unto him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Our own concernment, security, safety, present and future happiness lyes herein. Our <hi>All</hi> depends upon the Kingdom and Throne of Christ. He is our King if we are Believers; our King to Rule, Govern, Protect and Save us; to uphold us against Opposition, to <hi>supply</hi> us with strength, to <hi>guide</hi> us with Counsel, to <hi>subdue</hi> our Enemies, to give us our Inheritance and Reward, and therefore our principal interest lyes in his <hi>Throne,</hi> the Glory and Stability thereof. Whilest he <hi>reigneth</hi> we are <hi>safe,</hi> and in our way to Glory. To see by faith this <hi>King in his Beauty,</hi> upon his Throne, <hi>high and lifted up, and his train filling the Temple,</hi> to see all Power committed unto him, all things given into his hands, and <hi>herein</hi> disposing of all and ruling all things for the Advantage of his Church, must needs cause them to rejoyce, whose whole interest and concernment lyes therein.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The whole world, all the Creation of God are concerned in this Kingdom of Christ. Setting aside his <hi>cursed Enemies</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> and the whole Creation is benefited by this Rule and Dominion; for as some men are made partakers of <hi>saving Grace</hi> and salvation thereby, so the <hi>residue of that race,</hi> by and with them, do receive unspeakable Advantages in the Patience and Forbearance of God; and the very <hi>creature it self</hi> is raised as it were into an Hope and Expectation thereby of Deliverance from that state of <hi>Vanity</hi> whereunto now it is subjected, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20, 21. So that if we are moved with the Glory of God, the Honour of Jesus Christ, our own only and eternal interest, with the Advantage of the whole Creation, we have cause rejoyce in this Throne and Kingdom of the Son.</p>
                        <p n="iii">III. <hi>It is the Divine Nature of the Lord Christ, that gives Eternity, Stability and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableness to his Throne and Kingdom. Thy Throne O God is for ever.</hi> Concerning this see what hath formerly been delivered about the Kingdom of Christ.</p>
                        <p n="iv">IV. <hi>All the Laws, and the whole Administration of the Kingdom of Christ by his Word and Spirit, are all equal, righteous and holy. His Scepter is a Scepter of Righteousness</hi> The world indeed likes them not; all things in his Rule seem unto it, weak, absurd, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50110:229"/>
foolish, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20, 21. but they are otherwise, the Holy Ghost being judge, and such they appear unto them that do believe; yea whatever is requisite to make Laws and Administrations righteous, it doth all concurr in those of the Lord Jesus Christ. As</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Authority,</hi> a just and full Authority for enacting is requisite to make Laws <hi>righteous.</hi> Without this, Rules and Precepts may be good <hi>materially,</hi> but they cannot have the <hi>formality</hi> of Law, which depends on the just Authority of the <hi>Legislator</hi>; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which nothing can become a <hi>righteous Law.</hi> Now the Lord Christ is vested with suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Authority</hi> for the enacting of Laws and Rules of Administration in his Kingdom; All Authority, all <hi>Power in Heaven and Earth,</hi> is committed unto him, as we have before proved at large. And hence those that will not see the Equity of his Rule, shall be forced at last to bow under the Excellency of his Authority. And it were to be wished, that those who undertake to make Laws and Constitutions in the Kingdom of Christ, would look well to their Warrant. For it seems that the Lord Christ unto whom all Power is committed, hath not delegated <hi>any</hi> to the sons of men, but only that whereby they may <hi>teach others to do and observe what he hath commanded, Matth.</hi> 28.20. If moreover they shall command or appoint ought of their own, they may do well to consider by <hi>what Authority</hi> they do so; seeing that is of indispensible necessity unto the Righteousness of any Law whatever.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Wisdom</hi> is required to the making of Righteous Laws. This is the <hi>eye</hi> of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without which it can act nothing rightly or equally. Effects of Power without Wisdom are commonly unjust and <hi>Tyranical,</hi> alwayes useless and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som. The Wisdom of Law-makers is that which hath principally given them their renown. So <hi>Moses</hi> tells the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that all Nations would admire them when they perceived the <hi>Wisdom of their Laws, Deut.</hi> 4. Now the Lord Christ is abundantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with <hi>Wisdom</hi> for this purpose. He is the <hi>foundation stone</hi> of the Church, that hath <hi>seven eyes upon him, Zech.</hi> 3.9. A perfection of Wisdom and Understanding in all Affairs of it; being anointed with the Spirit unto that purpose, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.3, 4. Yea, in him are hid all the <hi>Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge, Col.</hi> 2.3. it having pleased the Father, that <hi>in him all fulness should dwell, Col.</hi> 1.19. So that there can be no defect in his Laws and Administrations on this account. He is <hi>Wise of heart,</hi> and knows per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly what Rules and Actings are suited to the Glory of God, and the condition of the subjects of his Kingdom; and what tendeth to their spiritual and eternal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. He knows how to order all things unto the <hi>great end</hi> which in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he aimeth at. And thence do all his Laws and Administrations become righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And this also well deserves their consideration, who take upon them to appoint Laws and Rules within his Dominion unto his Subjects, for the ends of his Rule, and substance of his Worship. Have they <hi>Wisdom</hi> sufficient to enable them so to do? doth the <hi>Spirit of the Lord Christ rest upon them,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o make them of <hi>quick understanding</hi> in the fear of the Lord? Are they acquainted with the state and condition, the Weakness, Temptations, Graces of all the people of Christ? If they are not, how know they but that they may command and appoint them things greatly to their disadvantage, when they think to profit them? It seems a great <hi>self-assuming,</hi> for men to suppose themselves wise enough to give Laws to the Subjects of Christ, in things directly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They are <hi>Righteous,</hi> because they are <hi>Easie, gentle,</hi> and not <hi>burdensome.</hi> The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and uprightness here mentioned, doth not denote <hi>strict, rigid,</hi> severe Justice, extending its self unto the utmost of what can be required of the subjects to be ruled; but <hi>Equity</hi> mixed with Gentleness, tenderness and condescension; which if it be absent from Laws, and they breath nothing but severity, rigor and arbitrary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, though they may not be absolutely <hi>unjust,</hi> yet they are grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densom: Thus <hi>Peter</hi> calls the Law of commandments contained in the Ordinances of old, <hi>a yoke which neither their Fathers nor themselves were able to bear, Acts</hi> 15.10. that is could never obtain rest or peace in the precise rigid observation required of them. But now for the Rule of Christ, he tells us, that his <hi>yoke is easie, and his burden light, Matth.</hi> 11.30. and that his <hi>commandments are not grievous,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. And this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness and easiness of the rule of Christ consisteth in these three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That his Commands are all of them <hi>Reasonable,</hi> and suited unto the principles of that <hi>natural Obedience</hi> we owe to God; and so not <hi>grievous</hi> unto any thing in us, but that principle of sin and darkness which is to be destroyed. He hath not <hi>multiplied</hi> Precepts meerly arbitrary, and to express his Authority; but given us only such as are in themselves <hi>Good,</hi> and suitable unto the Principles of Reason; as might be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50110:230"/>
evinced by the particular considerations of his Institutions. Hence our Obedience unto them is called our <hi>reasonable service, Rom.</hi> 12.1.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. His <hi>commands are easie,</hi> because all of them are suited to that principle of the <hi>new Nature,</hi> or <hi>new Creature</hi> which he worketh in the hearts of all his Disciples. It likes them, loves them, delights in them, which makes them <hi>easie</hi> unto it. The Lord Christ rules, as we said, by his Word and Spirit, these go together in the Covenant of the Redeemer, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.20, 21. And their work is suited and commensurate one to the other. The Spirit creates a new Nature fitted for Obedience according to the Word; and the Word gives out <hi>Laws</hi> and Precepts suited unto the inclination and disposition of that Nature: and in these two consist the <hi>Scepter</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of Christ. This <hi>suitableness</hi> of Principle and Rule one to the other makes his <hi>Government easie,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and righteous.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. His <hi>commands are easie,</hi> becauses he continually gives out <hi>supplies of his Spirit,</hi> to make his subjects to yield obedience unto them. This is that which above all other things sets a <hi>lustre</hi> upon his Rule. The Law was <hi>holy</hi> just and good of old; but whereas it exhibited not <hi>strength</hi> unto men to enable them unto Obedience, it became unto them altogether <hi>useless and unprofitable,</hi> as to the end they aimed at in its obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It is otherwise in the Kingdom of Christ; what ever he requires to have done of his subjects, he gives them <hi>strength by his Spirit and grace</hi> to perform it; which makes his rule <hi>easie, righteous, equal,</hi> and altogether lovely. Neither can any of the sons of men pretend to the least share or interest in this priviledge.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This Rule and Administration of Christs Kingdom is righteous, because <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>profitable.</hi> Then are Laws good, wholesome and equal, when they lead unto the benefit and advantage of them that do observe them. Laws about <hi>slight and trivial things,</hi> or such as men have no benefit or advantage by their observation, are justly esteemed grievous and burdensome. But now all the Laws, and whole Rule of the Lord Christ, are every way <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>advantagious</hi> to his subjects. They make them <hi>holy, righteous,</hi> such as please God and are useful to mankind. This is their nature, this their tendency. <hi>Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report,</hi> they are all ingenerated in the soul, by and in the observance of these Laws of Christ's Rule. They <hi>free</hi> the soul from the power of lust, the service of sin, fear of death hell and the world, guide it in the truth, make it fruitful amongst mankind, and amiable unto God himself.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Their <hi>end</hi> manifests them to be <hi>righteous.</hi> The worth and equity of Laws is taken off, when low and unworthy ends are proposed unto their observation: But these of the Lord Christ direct unto the <hi>highest</hi> end, propose and promise the most <hi>glorious</hi> reward; so that whatsoever may be done or suffered in an adherence unto them, bears no <hi>proportion</hi> to that exceeding rich and eternal reward which they are attended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which renders them highly <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>glorious.</hi> And many other considerations of the like nature may be added. And hence a three-fold <hi>Corolary</hi> may be taken.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That our <hi>submission to this Scepter</hi> of the Lord Christ, our obedience to the Laws of his Kingdom, and the Administration thereof, is very <hi>righteous,</hi> equal and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. What can be farther desired to <hi>render</hi> it so, or to provoke us unto it?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the condemnation of those that refuse the Reign of Christ over them, that will not yield obedience unto his <hi>Laws,</hi> is most just and righteous. On these accounts will their mouthes be stopped for ever, when he comes to deal with them, who <hi>know not God, and obey not the Gospel.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>There is no question but that these words do sufficiently prove the <hi>Preheminence</hi> of him of whom they are spoken, <hi>incomparably</hi> above all Creatures what ever. Two things therefore are questioned by the Enemies of the Truth contained in them: 1. Whether they were <hi>originally</hi> spoken <hi>at all</hi> of Christ, which the present <hi>Jews</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 2. Whether they are spoken <hi>all</hi> of Christ, which is questioned by the <hi>Socinians.</hi> These Enquiries being first satisfied, the words shall be opened, and the force of the Apostles <hi>Argument</hi> from thence declared.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That what is spoken in this <hi>Psalm</hi> doth properly respect the <hi>Messiah</hi> is denied by the present <hi>Jews.</hi> That it was owned by the antient <hi>Hebrews</hi> is sufficiently evident from hence, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> dealing with them on their own Principles, urgeth them with the testimony of it. The <hi>Psalm</hi> also it self-gives us light enough into the same instruction. It is partly <hi>Euctical,</hi> partly <hi>Prophetical</hi>; both parts suited unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church when the Temple was <hi>wasted,</hi> and <hi>Sion</hi> lay in the dust during the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity. In the <hi>Prophetical</hi> part there are three things signal.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Redemption</hi> of the people, with the Re-edification of the Temple, as a Type of that Spiritual Temple and Worship which was afterwards to be erected. As <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Sion, for the time to favour her, yea the set time is come.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>When the Lord shall build Sion, he shall appear in his glory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Calling of the Gentiles</hi> to the Church and Worship of God, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then shall fear the name of the Lord, and all the Kings of the earth thy glory.</hi> V. 21, 22. <hi>To declare the name of the Lord in Sion, and his praise in Jerusalem, when the people are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and the kingdoms to serve the Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Hereby the <hi>creation</hi> of a <hi>new people,</hi> a new world, is brought in: <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>This shall be written for the generation to come,</hi> (the world to come) <hi>and the people that shall be created</hi> (the new creation of Jews and Gentiles) <hi>shall praise the Lord.</hi> These are the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50110:231"/>
heads of the <hi>Prophetical</hi> part of the Psalm, and they all respect things every where pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly assigned unto the <hi>Son</hi> who was to be incarnate; or the days of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which is all one. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Redemption</hi> and deliverance of the Church out of trouble is his proper work. Where ever it is mentioned, it is he who is intended. <hi>Psal.</hi> 98.18. so signally, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. and other places innumerable.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>bringing in of the Gentiles</hi> is acknowledged by all the <hi>Jews</hi> to respect the time of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> it being he who was to be <hi>a light unto the Gentiles; and the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God unto the ends of the earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Also the Generation to come, and people to be <hi>created,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret of the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>world to come,</hi> or the <hi>new state of the Church</hi> under the <hi>Messiah.</hi> These two last put together, the <hi>gathering of the people,</hi> and the <hi>world to come, created for the praise of God,</hi> makes it evident that it is the <hi>Son</hi> whom the <hi>Psalmist</hi> hath respect unto.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Grotius</hi> in this place affirms, that <hi>the Apostle accommodates unto the Messiah what was spoken of God.</hi> And he thinks it a sufficient argument to prove, the words were not spoken of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> because they were spoken of God: whereas they are produced by the Apostle to prove his <hi>Excellency</hi> from the properties and works of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. And he addes, as the sense of the words, as accommodated unto Christ, <hi>Thou hast laid the foundation of the earth,</hi> that is, <hi>the world was made for thy sake.</hi> But this <hi>Interpretation,</hi> or violent detortion of the words destroys it self. For if they are spoken of <hi>God absolutely,</hi> and not of the <hi>Messiah</hi> to whom they are <hi>accommodated,</hi> how can it be said that the <hi>world was made for his sake,</hi> and <hi>not by him?</hi> both senses of the words cannot be true. But this is indeed plainly to deny the Authority of the Apostle.</p>
                        <p>It appeareth then, that many things in this <hi>Psalm</hi> are spoken directly and <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately of the Son</hi>; though it be probable also that sundry things in it are affirmed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly of the <hi>Person of the Father.</hi> And hence it may be are those frequent <hi>variations</hi> of speech from the <hi>Second</hi> to the <hi>Third</hi> Person, that occur in this Psalm.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As to the second Enquiry, the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who grant the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of this Epistle, and therefore cannot deny but that <hi>these words</hi> some way or other belong unto the Lord Christ, yet plainly perceiving that if they are wholly understood of him, that there is an <hi>end of all their Religion</hi>; (the <hi>creation,</hi> not of a <hi>new,</hi> but of that <hi>world which was made of old,</hi> and which shall <hi>perish at the last day,</hi> being here ascribed unto him) fix here upon a new and peculiar Evasion. <hi>Some words,</hi> they say, <hi>of this testimony belong unto Christ,</hi> (so much they will yield to the authority of the Apostle) but not all of them; whereby they hope to secure their own errour. Now because if this <hi>pretence</hi> hold not, this <hi>testimony</hi> is fatal to their perswasion, I hope it will not be unacceptable, if in our passage we do consider the <hi>distribution</hi> they make of the words according to their supposition, and the Arguments they produce for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their Exposition, as they are managed by <hi>Crellius</hi> or <hi>Schlictingius</hi> in their <hi>Comment</hi> on this place.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He says, that <hi>this testimony doth so far belong unto Christ, as it pertaineth unto the scope of the Writer of the Epistle. This Scripture,</hi> saith he, <hi>as appears from v.</hi> 4. <hi>is to prove, that after Christ sate down at the right hand of God, he was made more excellent than the Angels; whereto the affirming that he made heaven and earth, doth no way conduce.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Suppose that to be the <hi>scope of the Apostle</hi> which is intimated; how doth this Author know that it suits not his purpose to shew that the Lord Christ is God, by whom Heaven and Earth were made, seeing it is manifest that himself thought otherwise, or he had not produced <hi>this testimony thereof.</hi> 2. The Testimony is not unsuited unto the <hi>scope pretended.</hi> For whereas in the Administration of his <hi>Office</hi> the Son was apparently for a <hi>while made lower than the Angels,</hi> he may in these words dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>equity</hi> of his after Exaltation above them, in that in his <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and Works he was so much more excellent than they. 3. The true and <hi>proper design</hi> of the Apostle we have before evinced, which is to prove the <hi>Excellency of the Person</hi> by whom the Gospel was revealed, and his Preheminence above Men and Angels, which nothing doth more unquestionably <hi>demonstrate</hi> than this, that by him the world was created; whence the Assignation of a <hi>Divine Nature</hi> unto him doth undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ensue.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To promote this <hi>Observation,</hi> he addes a large discourse about the use and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of testimonies out of the Old Testament in the New, and says, <hi>That they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50110:232"/>
are made use of by the writers of it, either because of some agreement and likeness between the things intended in the one and the other, or because of some subordination. In the former way, that which is spoken of the Type, is applied unto the Anti-type; and sometimes for likeness sake, that which was spoken of one thing is applied unto another, as</hi> Matth. 15.7, 8. <hi>our Saviour applies those words of Isaiah to the present Jews, which were spoken of their fore-fathers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> That which is spoken in the first place of an <hi>instituted Type,</hi> is also spoken of the <hi>Anti-type</hi> or things pre-figured by it, so far as it is represented by the <hi>Type</hi>; so that one thing <hi>teaches another,</hi> and thereon the words have a double application; <hi>first</hi> to the <hi>Type; ultimately</hi> to the <hi>Anti-type.</hi> But herein such testimonies as this have no concernment. 2. The Scripture sometimes makes use of <hi>Allegories,</hi> illustrating one thing by another, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21, 22, 23, 24. Neither hath this any place here. 3. That what is spoken of one, should because of some <hi>similitude</hi> be affirmed to be spoken of another, and nothing agree properly unto him, is untrue, and not to be exemplified with any seeming instance. 4. The words of <hi>Isaiah, chap.</hi> 29.13. which our Saviour makes use of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.7, 8, 9. were a Prophesie of the <hi>Jews</hi> who then lived, as both our Saviour expresly affirms, and the <hi>Context</hi> in the Prophet doth plainly declare.</p>
                        <p>Some things he addes, <hi>Are applied unto others than they are spoken of, because of their subordination to him or them of whom they are spoken. Thus things that are spoken of God are applied unto Christ, because of his subordination to him; and of this,</hi> saith he, <hi>we have an instance in</hi> Acts 13.47. <hi>where the words spoken of the Lord Christ,</hi> Isa. 49.6. I have set thee to be a light to the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the ends of the earth; <hi>are applied unto the Apostles because of their subordination unto Christ. And in this case the words have but one sense, and belong primarily unto him of whom they are first spoken, and are secondarily applied unto the other.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> According to this <hi>Rule,</hi> there is nothing that ever was spoken of God, but it may be spoken of and applied unto <hi>any</hi> of his Creatures: All things being in <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination</hi> unto him. At least it may be so in that wherein they act <hi>under</hi> him, and are in a peculiar <hi>subordination</hi> to him. And yet neither can such a <hi>subordination,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this mans <hi>Opinion,</hi> be applied unto Christ, who in the Creation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth was in no other <hi>subordination</hi> to God, than any other things not yet made or existing; so that this Rule, that <hi>what is spoken of God is applied unto them who are in subordination unto him,</hi> as it is <hi>false</hi> in it self, so it is no way <hi>suited</hi> to the present business; Christ being in this man's judgment in no <hi>subordination</hi> to God when the world was made, being absolutely in all respects in the condition of things that <hi>were not.</hi> Nor doth the instance given at all prove or <hi>illustrate</hi> what is pretended. The Apostle in the citing of those words to the <hi>Jews,</hi> doth not in the least <hi>apply them to himself,</hi> but only declares the ground of his going to <hi>preach the Gospel unto the Gentiles</hi>; which was, that God had promised to make <hi>Him whom he preached</hi> to be a <hi>Light, and to bring salvation unto them also.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wherefore he addes, 3. what is direct to his pretension, <hi>That all the words, or things signified by them in any testimony, which are firstly spoken of one, and then are for some of the causes mentioned,</hi> (that is, conveniency, similitude or subordination) <hi>applied unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, are not to be looked on as proper to him to whom they are so applied; but so much of them is to be admitted as agrees to the scope of him by whom the testimony is used: as in the testimony produced,</hi> v. 7. I will be unto him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son; <hi>the words immediately following are,</hi> If he shall offend against me, I will chastise him with the rod of men; <hi>which words being spoken of</hi> Solomon, <hi>can no way be applied unto Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> What is spoken of any <hi>Type</hi> and of Christ <hi>jointly,</hi> is not so spoken for any <hi>natural conveniency, similitude</hi> or <hi>subordination,</hi> but because of <hi>Gods institution,</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Type</hi> so to represent and shadow out the Lord Christ, that what he would teach concerning him should be spoken of the Type whereby he was represented. Now no person that was appointed to be a <hi>Type</hi> of that, being in <hi>all things a Type,</hi> it is not necessary that what ever was spoken of him was also spoken of Christ, but only what was spoken of him under that <hi>formal consideration</hi> of an <hi>instituted Type.</hi> This we shewed the case to have been with <hi>Solomon,</hi> of whom the words mentioned were spoken, as he bare the Person of Christ: Other things being added in the same place, that belonged unto him in his own <hi>personally moral capacity.</hi> And therefore those things (as that, <hi>if he offend against me</hi>) are not at all mentioned by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> as not being spoken of him as a <hi>Type.</hi> And this plainly over-throws the pretension of our <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator.</hi>
                           <pb n="119" facs="tcp:50110:232"/>
For if the Apostle would not produce the <hi>very next words</hi> to the testimony by by him brought, because they did <hi>not belong</hi> unto him of whom he spake, it proves undeniably that all those which he doth so <hi>urge</hi> and <hi>produce</hi> were properly spoken of him. And I cannot reach the <hi>strength</hi> of this inference, because in a place where all that was <hi>spoken</hi> was not <hi>spoken</hi> of Christ, the Apostle makes use of what was <hi>so spoken</hi> of him, and omits that which was not; therefore of that which he doth <hi>produce</hi> in the next place, somewhat does belong to him, and somewhat does not. If any thing be offered to this purpose, it must be in an <hi>instance</hi> of a testimony produced, in the words whereof, which are produced, and not in what may follow in the same <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter</hi> and <hi>Psalm,</hi> there is that affirmed, which doth now no more belong unto Christ, than the <hi>making of heaven or earth belongeth</hi> to this Writer, which is the case in hand.</p>
                        <p>Having premised these <hi>general considerations,</hi> he makes <hi>Application</hi> of them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to his Interpretation of this <hi>Testimony</hi> used by the Apostle.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>These words,</hi> saith he, <hi>being first expresly spoken of God, and here by this Writer referred unto Christ, we must consider what in them makes to his scope and purpose, what is agreeable to the nature and condition of Christ, who certainly was a man; and such certainly is not He which the Psalm speaks of, about the Creation of heaven and earth. And this was well known to them with whom the Apostle had to do.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But any one may perceive that these things are spoken <hi>gratis,</hi> and upon the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition that Christ was a <hi>meer Man,</hi> and <hi>not God by Nature.</hi> When the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ascribing a <hi>prae-existence to the World,</hi> and <hi>Omnipotency</hi> unto him, do prove the contrary. What is the <hi>scope</hi> of the Apostle in the whole discourse under consideration, hath been shewed; as also how directly this <hi>whole Testimony</hi> tends to the proof of what he had proposed. It is true, that the words are spoken of him <hi>who is God,</hi> but no less true, the Apostle being judge, that it is the <hi>Son of God</hi> who is that God. It is true, that he also <hi>was Man,</hi> and nothing is ascribed unto him but what belongs unto him, <hi>who was Man,</hi> but not <hi>as he was man.</hi> And such was the Creation of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                        <p>The opinion of these men is, that whereas <hi>two things</hi> are mentioned in the words, the <hi>Creation of the world,</hi> which was past; and the <hi>dissolution or destruction of it,</hi> which was to come, that the <hi>latter</hi> is assigned unto Christ, but not the <hi>former</hi>: and for this division of the words, which confessedly is not in the least intimated by the Apostle, he gives these reasons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>All the words of the Psalm being manifestly spoken of the high God, and no word in the Psalm declaring Christ to be that God, yet of necessity if these words be applied unto Christ, he must be supposed to be the high God there spoken of. But if this Divine Writer had taken this for granted, he had been eminently foolish to go about to prove by Arguments and Testimonies, that the Creator does excel all creatures. He should use in a matter no way doubtful witnesses no way necessary.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the <hi>first Reason</hi> whereby he would prove that the Apostle did not apply the words to Christ, though himself say plainly that he does; for his Preface to them is, <hi>But to the Son he said</hi>: Or that if he doth so, he doth it <hi>wondrous foolishly</hi>; for such <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> do poor worms take to themselves. That the <hi>Psalm</hi> so speaketh of the <hi>high God,</hi> that it directly and peculiarly intends Christ <hi>the Son of God,</hi> hath been in part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and shall farther afterwards be evinced. And the <hi>Elogium</hi> in these words given unto him proves him to be so. And though he affirm that it was <hi>a foolish thing in the Apostle</hi> to prove from the works of him that is God, that he is <hi>above the Angels,</hi> the most glorious of made creatures, yet God himself most frequently from <hi>these his works,</hi> his Omniscience, Omnipresence, and other Attributes declared in them, proves his excellency in comparison of Idols, which have no existence but in the <hi>imagination</hi> of men. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 41.20, 21, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>By this <hi>testimony</hi> then, the Holy Ghost with <hi>infinite Wisdom</hi> proves, that he who was made <hi>less for a little while than the Angels,</hi> in one respect, was absolutely and in his <hi>own person</hi> infinitely <hi>above them,</hi> as being the Creator of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                        <p>He addes, <hi>Secondly, Those Hebrews to whom he wrote were either perswaded that Christ was God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, or they were not; if they were, what need of all these Arguments and Testimonies? one word might have dispatched this whole controversie, by affirming that Christ was the Creator, Angels creatures, between whom there could be no comparison; nor any reason to fear that the Law given by the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Angels should be preferred to the Gospel whereof he was the Author: if we
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50110:233"/>
shall say the latter, that they did not yet believe it; how do we suppose that he takes a great deal of pains to little purpose? for he assures and takes for granted, that that was true which was alone in question. What need He then to prove by so many Arguments that Christ was more excellent than the Angels, and to take that for granted which would have put it out of question, namely that he was God who made heaven and earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> This <hi>Dilemma</hi> hath as much force against the <hi>other testimonies</hi> produced in this Chapter or else-where by the Apostle, as it hath against this; so that the using of it doth scarce argue that <hi>Reverence</hi> to the Holy Word of God which is required of us. But the truth is, grant whether of the <hi>suppositions</hi> you please, nothing of <hi>inconveniency</hi> as unto the Apostles argumentation will ensue. Let it be granted that they <hi>did believe,</hi> and that expresly Christ to be God; Have Believers no need to have their <hi>faith confirmed</hi> by testimonies out of the Word, that may not so readily occur to themselves? Have they no need to be strengthned in the faith, especially in such points as were in those days <hi>greatly opposed,</hi> as was this of the Eternal Glory of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> concerning which the believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> had to do with learned and stubborn Adversaries continually. And if the Apostle might have ended the <hi>whole controversie,</hi> by plainly affirming that he was the <hi>Creator of all things,</hi> and the <hi>Angels creatures</hi>; might he not as well have ended the dispute about his <hi>Preheminence above Angels</hi> with one word, without cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many testimonies to prove it? But had he then unfolded the <hi>mysteries of the Old Testament</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which was his design? Had he manifested that he taught nothing but what was before revealed (though obscurely) to <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which he aimed to do, thereby to strengthen and confirm in the faith those that did believe, and convince gain-sayers? Again, suppose some of them to whom he wrote did not yet <hi>expresly believe</hi> the <hi>Deity of Christ,</hi> as the Apostles themselves did not for a while <hi>believe his Resurrection</hi>; could any more convincing way be fixed on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them thereunto, than by minding them of those testimonies of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> wherein the <hi>Attributes</hi> and Works of God are ascribed unto him? Nor was it now in question whether Christ was God or no; but whether he were more <hi>Excellent than the Angels</hi> that gave the Law: And what more effectual course could be taken to put an <hi>end to that Enquiry,</hi> than by proving that he made the Heaven and Earth; that is, producing a testimony, <hi>wherein the creation of all things is assigned unto him,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the wisdom of man to invent.</p>

If as God, how could he be said to be made above the Angels?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the answer is easie; Christ is said to be <hi>made above,</hi> and <hi>more excellent than the Angels,</hi> neither absolutely <hi>as God,</hi> nor absolutely <hi>as man,</hi> but as he was <hi>God-Man,</hi> the <hi>Mediator between</hi> God and man; in which respect <hi>as Mediator</hi> for the discharge of one part of his Office, he <hi>was a little while made lower than they</hi>; and so the Creation of Heaven and earth does demonstrate the <hi>Dignity</hi> of his Person, and the Equity of his being <hi>made more</hi> excellent than the Angels in his Office. And this fully removes his following exceptions, that the <hi>remembring of his Deity could be no argument to prove that the Humanity was exalted above the Angels:</hi> for it is not an argument of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of his Humanity, but the demonstration of the <hi>Excellency of his Person</hi> that the Apostle hath in hand.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. He alledgeth, <hi>That it is contrary to the perpetual use of the Scripture, to affirm abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of Christ that he created any thing. When any creation is ascribed unto him, it is still applied to him as the immediate cause, and said to be made by him, or in him; he is no where absolutely said to create. And if he created the world, why did not</hi> Moses <hi>as plainly attribute that unto him, as the Writers of the New Testament do the new Creation?</hi>
                        </p>

Besides, we have shewed already the vanity of that distinction, of God's making things by Christ, as though it denoted any <hi>subordination</hi> in <hi>causality</hi>; nor will the <hi>Socinians</hi> themselves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any such thing, but confute that notion in the <hi>Arians.</hi> But this is not the only place wherein it is affirmed that Christ made all things that are in the Heaven and the

Earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>v.</hi> 3. of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> with sundry other places affirm the same. For what they exact of <hi>Moses,</hi> did we not believe that God knew what Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of himself became that <hi>dark dispensation</hi> better than they, we might consider it. But yet there are even in <hi>Moses</hi> himself <hi>many,</hi> and his <hi>Expositors the Prophets more Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> of the Creation of the world by the <hi>Word,</hi> that is, the Son of God, which have elsewhere been opened and vindicated.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. He concludes; <hi>That the Order and Method of the Apostles procedure do evince, that this Creation of Heaven and Earth is not attributed unto him. For we see that he proves the excellency of Christ above Angels from his name that he is by the way of eminency called the Son of God; and then he proceeds to his adoration by Angels; and in the third place, he goes on to the Kingly Honour and Throne of Christ; after which he produceth the testimony we insist upon, and then adds the end of that Kingdom which Christ now administreth in the Earth; to what end in this discourse should he mention the Creation of Heaven and Earth; when if that be omitted all the series of the discourse agrees and hangs well together? For having declared the Kingdom of Christ, with the continuance of his person for ever, he asserts an eminent effect of the Kingdom in the abolition of Heaven and Earth, and then the end of that Kingdom it self.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this <hi>Analysis</hi> of the Apostles discourse, agreeth not to the <hi>mind</hi> of the Apostle, or his <hi>Design</hi> in the place; nor to the <hi>Principles</hi> of the men that formed it, nor is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any thing but <hi>vain words,</hi> to perswade us that the Apostle <hi>did not say</hi> that <hi>which he did say,</hi> and which is written for our instruction: It is not first agreeable to their <hi>own Principles</hi>; For it placeth the naming of Christ, the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and his <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the Angels,</hi> as <hi>antecedent</hi> to his being raised to his <hi>Kingly Throne,</hi> both which, especially the latter, they constantly make consequent unto it, and effects of it. Nor is it at all agreeable to the <hi>Apostles design,</hi> which is not to prove by these Testimonies <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> that Christ was exalted above Angels; but to shew the Dignity and Excellency of his person who was so <hi>exalted,</hi> and how reasonable it is that it should be so; which is eminently proved by the Testimonie under consideration. For the proof of this Excellency, the Apostle produceth those <hi>Testimonies</hi> that are given unto him in the <hi>Old Testament</hi>; and that as to his <hi>Name,</hi> his <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and his <hi>Works</hi> in this place. Neither is there any Reason of ascribing the <hi>Destruction of Heaven and Earth</hi> unto the Kingly Power of Christ, excluding his <hi>Divine Power</hi> in their Creation; for the Abolition of the world, (if such it is to be) or the <hi>change</hi> of it, is no less an effect of <hi>Infinite Power</hi> than the Creation of it; nor doth it directly appertain to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> but by <hi>accident,</hi> as do other works of the Providence of God.</p>
                        <p>These Exceptions then being <hi>removed,</hi> before we proceed to the Interpretation of the words, we shall see what Evidence may be added unto what we have already of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from the <hi>Psalm,</hi> to evince and prove, that this <hi>whole Testimony</hi> doth belong unto him, which were there no other, (as there are very many) Testimonies to this purpose, were abundantly sufficient to determine this Controversie.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We have the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Apostle for it, ascribing it unto him; the word <hi>And,</hi> in the beginning of the Verse relates confessedly unto; <hi>but unto the Son he saith, v.</hi> 8. as if he had said: but <hi>unto the Son he saith, thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever</hi>; and to the Son he said, <hi>Thou O God, in the beginning hast founded the earth.</hi> Again, the <hi>whole Testimony</hi> speaks of the same person: there being no colour of thrusting <hi>another person</hi> into the Text not intended in the beginning: so that if <hi>any part</hi> of what is spoken do belong to Christ, the <hi>whole</hi> of necessity must do so. To suppose that in this sentence, thou hast laid the <hi>Foundation of the earth,</hi> and thou <hi>shalt fold them up as a garment,</hi> that <hi>one person</hi> is understood in the first place, <hi>another</hi> in the latter, no such thing being intimated by the <hi>Psalmist</hi> or the Apostle, is to suppose <hi>what we please,</hi> that we may attain what we have a mind unto. One person is here certainly and <hi>only</hi> spoken unto; if this be the <hi>Father,</hi> the words concern not Christ at all, and the <hi>Apostle</hi> was deceived in his <hi>Allegation</hi> of them; if the <hi>Son,</hi> the whole is spoken of him, as the Apostle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms. Nor 3. Can any <hi>Reason</hi> be assigned why the <hi>latter words</hi> should be attributed to Christ, and not the former. They say it is because God by him <hi>shall destroy the world,</hi> which is the thing in the last words spoken of; but where is it written that God <hi>shall destroy the world by Christ?</hi> If they say in this place; I say then Christ is spoken to, and of in this place; and if so, he is spoken of in the first words and <hi>thou Lord,</hi> or not at all; Besides, to whom do those <hi>closing</hi> words belong, <hi>but thou a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50110:234"/>
Eternity is opposed to the <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>temporary duration</hi> of the world. If they say, that they belong unto the <hi>Father primarily, but are attributed unto Christ,</hi> as that of changing or abolishing the world, because the <hi>Father doth it by him,</hi> I desire to know what is the meaning of these words, <hi>thou art the same by Christ? and thy years fail not by Christ?</hi> Is not the Father Eternal but in the man Christ Jesus? If they say, that they belong not at all to Christ; then this is the summ of what they say; the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words, and the close of them, if spoken of Christ would prove his <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> Power, Eternity and Divine Nature; One passage there is in the words which we suppose will <hi>not do so,</hi> therefore we will grant, that that <hi>passage</hi> concerneth him, but not the beginning, nor end of the testimony, though spoken undeniably of the same person; which whether it becomes men professing a <hi>Reverence of the Word of God</hi> is left to themselves to judge. Besides, should we grant all these <hi>suggestions to be true,</hi> the Apostle by his <hi>citing</hi> of this Testimony would prove nothing at all to his purpose, no not any thing toward that which they affirm him to aim at; namely, that he was <hi>made more excellent than</hi> the Angels: For whence out of <hi>these words</hi> shall any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be made to appear? they say in that by him God will <hi>fold up the Heavens as a Vesture</hi>; but First, No such thing is mentioned nor intimated. He who made them, is said to <hi>fold them</hi>; and if they say that from other places it may be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that it shall be done by <hi>Christ</hi>; then as this place must be laid aside as of no use to the Apostle, so indeed there is nothing ascribed to Christ, but what the Angels shall have a share in, and that probably the most principal; namely in <hi>folding up the Creation as a garment,</hi> which is a work that <hi>servants</hi> are employed in, and not the King, or Lord himself.

                        <p>TWo things are observable in this Expression of the <hi>Creation of all things</hi>: (1.) The <hi>Distribution</hi> made of them into Heaven and Earth; being distinctly mentioned. In the consideration of the works of God, to admire his Greatness Power and Wisdom <hi>in them,</hi> or to set forth his praise <hi>for them,</hi> it is usual in the Scripture to <hi>distribute</hi> them into <hi>parts,</hi> the more to fix the Contemplation of the mind upon them, and to excite it unto Faith Admiration and Praise. So dealeth the <hi>Psalmist</hi> with the works of Gods <hi>Providence</hi> in bringing the <hi>Children of Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt, Psal.</hi> 136. He takes as it were, that whole curious work into its <hi>several pieces,</hi> and subjoyns that Inference of praise to every one of them, <hi>for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> And so he dealeth with the works of Creation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. and in sundry other places. (2.) What is <hi>peculiar</hi> in the Expressions with respect unto each of them. Of the <hi>Earth</hi> it is said, <hi>he founded it</hi>; because of its <hi>stability</hi> and <hi>unmoveableness</hi>; which is the <hi>Language</hi> of the Scripture; <hi>He set it fast,</hi> he established it, that it should not be moved for ever. It may be also the whole Fabrick of Heaven and Earth is compared to an <hi>Aedifice</hi> or <hi>Building</hi>; whereof the <hi>Earth</hi> as the lowest and most <hi>depressed</hi> part is looked on as the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the whole; but the <hi>stability,</hi> unmoveableness and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it, is that which the word expresseth, and which is most properly intended. (2.) Of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> that they are the <hi>Works of his hands</hi>; alluding to the <hi>curious frame</hi> and <hi>garnishing</hi> of them with all their Host or Glorious Lights wherewith they are adorned. The <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, (<hi>Job</hi> 26.13.) the <hi>beautifulness,</hi> adorning, or <hi>garnishing</hi> of the Heavens, in the Curious Glorious forming and fashioning of them, is that which in a way of Distinction the <hi>Psalmist</hi> aims to express in these words, <hi>the Heavens are the works of thy hands</hi>; that which thy Hands, thy Power with infinite Wisdom hath <hi>framed</hi> so as to set off, and give lustre and beauty to the <hi>whole Fabrick</hi>; as a Master-Workman doth the <hi>upper</hi> and more <hi>noble parts</hi> of his building; This is the first thing assigned to the <hi>Lord</hi> in this Testimony of his Glory.</p>
                        <p>The second is in the <hi>Change</hi> or <hi>Abolition</hi> of them. Most suppose that the Heavens and the Earth at the last day shall only be <hi>changed,</hi> altered, or renewed, as to their <hi>quality</hi> and beauty; some that they shall be <hi>utterly destroyed,</hi> consumed and abolished. The discussing of that <hi>doubt</hi> belongs not directly to the Interpretation or Exposition of this place; neither sense of the words conducing particularly to the Apostles pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and design in reciting this Testimony. It is enough to his Argument, that the work which <hi>was of old</hi> in the Creation of the world, and that which shall be in the <hi>mutation</hi> or <hi>abolition</hi> of it, which is no less an effect of Infinite Power then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is ascribed unto the Lord Christ. What ever the work be, he compares them to a <hi>Garment</hi> no <hi>more to be used,</hi> or at least not <hi>to be used in the same kind</hi> wherein it was before; and the <hi>work</hi> it self to the <hi>folding up,</hi> or <hi>rolling up of such a garment,</hi> intimating the Greatness of him by whom this work shall be performed, and the <hi>facility</hi> of the work unto him. The whole Creation is as a <hi>Garment,</hi> wherein he shews his Power cloathed unto men. Whence in particular he is said to <hi>cloath himself with Light as with a Garment.</hi> And in it, is the <hi>hiding of his power: hid it is,</hi> as a man is <hi>hid with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; not that he should not be seen at all, but that he should not be seen perfectly, and as he is; it <hi>shews</hi> the man, and he is known by it; but also it <hi>hides</hi> him that he is not perfectly or fully seen. So are the works of Creation unto God; he so far makes them his <hi>garment or cloathing,</hi> as in them to give out some <hi>instances</hi> of his Power and Wisdom; but He is also <hi>hid in them,</hi> in that by them no creatures can come to the full and perfect knowledge of him. Now when this work shall cease, and God shall
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50110:235"/>
                           <hi>uncloath or unvail all his glory to his Saints,</hi> and they shall know him perfectly, see him as he is, so far as a created nature is capable of that comprehension, then will he lay them aside, and <hi>fold them up,</hi> at least as to that use, as easily as a man layes aside <hi>a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that he will wear or use no more. This lyes in the <hi>Metaphor.</hi>
                        </p>

The <hi>gradual Decay</hi> of the Heavens and Earth <hi>waxing old, worse,</hi> and <hi>decaying</hi> in their worth and use; 2. A near <hi>Approximation,</hi> or drawing nigh to their End and Period. In this sense, the Apostle in this <hi>Epistle</hi> affirms that the Dispensation of the Covenant which established the <hi>Judaical Worship</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> did <hi>wax old and decay, Chap.</hi> 8.13. Not that it had lost any thing of its <hi>first Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi> Power and Efficacy before its Abolition. The strict Observation of all the <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of it by our Saviour himself, manifests its Power and Obligation to have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its full force. And this was <hi>typified</hi> by the continuance of <hi>Moses</hi> in his full strength and vigour, untill the very day of his death. But he sayes, it <hi>was old and decayed,</hi> when it was <gap reason="foreign">

And in <hi>this,</hi> not the <hi>former</hi> sense are the Heavens and Earth said to <hi>wax old,</hi> because of their <hi>tendency</hi> to that period, which either in themselves, or as to their use, they shall receive; which is sufficient to manifest them to be of a <hi>changeable</hi> perishing nature. And it may be, that it shall be with these <hi>Heavens and Earth</hi> at the last day, as it was with the Heavens and Earth of <hi>Judaical Institutions</hi> (for so are they frequently called, especially when their <hi>dissolution</hi> or <hi>abolition</hi> is spoken of) in the <hi>day of Gods creating the new Heavens and the Earth</hi> in the Gospel according to his promise. For though the <hi>use</hi> of them and their <hi>power</hi> of obliging to their Observation was taken away and abolished, yet are they <hi>kept in the world,</hi> as abiding monuments of the <hi>Goodness and Wisdom</hi> of God in teaching his Church of old. So may it be with the <hi>Heavens and Earth</hi> of the old creation; though they shall be <hi>laid aside</hi> at the last day from their use, as a Garment to cloath and teach the Power and Wisdom of God to men, yet may they be preserved as <hi>eternal monuments</hi> of them.</p>
                        <p>In opposition hereunto it is said of Christ, that <hi>he abideth, he is the same, and his years fail not.</hi> One and the same thing is intended in all these Expressions; even his <hi>Eternal</hi> and absolutely immutable <hi>Existence. Eternity</hi> is not amiss called a <hi>nunc stans</hi>; a present existence wherein, or whereunto, nothing is past or future; it being alwayes <hi>wholly present</hi> in and to its self.

all things created therein; it is said, <hi>his years fail not</hi>; that is, theirs do and come to an end; of his <hi>Being and Existence</hi> there is none.</p>
                        <p>How the Apostle proves his <hi>Intendment</hi> by this Testimony hath been declared in the <hi>opening</hi> of the words, and the force of it unto his purpose lyes open to all; we may now divert unto those <hi>Doctrinal Observations</hi> which the words offer unto us. As,</p>
                        <p n="i">I. <hi>All the Properties of God, considered in the Person of the Son the head of the Church, are suited to give Relief Consolation and supportment unto Believers in all their distresses.</hi> This Truth presents it self unto us from the <hi>use</hi> of the words in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> and their <hi>Connection</hi> in the design of the <hi>Psalmist.</hi> Under the consideration of his own <hi>mortality</hi> and frailty, he relieves himself with thoughts of the <hi>Omnipotency</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi> of Christ; and takes Arguments from thence to plead for relief.</p>
                        <p>And this may a little further be unfolded for our <hi>use</hi> in the ensuing Observations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The Properties of God are those whereby God makes known himself to us</hi>; and declares both what he is, and what we shall find him to be in all that we have to deal with him: He is <hi>infinitely</hi> Holy, Just, Wise, Good, Powerful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by our Apprehension of <hi>these things,</hi> are we lead to that Acquaintance with the Nature of God which in this <hi>life</hi> we may attain, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.5, 6, 7.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>God oftentimes declares and proposeth these properties of his nature unto us for our sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment</hi> Consolation and Relief in our Troubles, Distresses and endeavours after Peace and Rest to our souls. <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.27, 28, 29, 30, 31.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That since the Entrance of sin, these Properties of God absolutely considered <hi>will not yield that Relief and satisfaction unto the souls of men,</hi> which they would have done and did, whilest man continued obedient unto God according to the Law of his Creation. Hence <hi>Adam</hi> upon his sin knew nothing that should encourage him to expect any help pity or relief from him, and therefore <hi>fled from his presence and hid himself.</hi> The <hi>Righteousness,</hi> Holiness, Purity and Power of God all infinite, eternal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, considered <hi>absolutely,</hi> are no way suited to the Advantage of sinners in any <hi>condition, Rom.</hi> 1.32. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. These <hi>Properties</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> are in every person of the Trinity <hi>entirely</hi>; so that each Person is so infinitely holy, just, wise, good and powerful, because each person is <hi>equally partaker</hi> of the whole Divine Nature and Being.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>The Person of the Word, or the Eternal Son of God,</hi> may be considered either <hi>absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> as such, or as <hi>designed</hi> in the Counsel, Wisdom and Will of the Father, by and with his own Will and Consent, unto the work of Mediation between God and Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. And in him as <hi>such,</hi> it is that the <hi>Properties</hi> of the nature of God are suited to <hi>yield relief</hi> unto Believers in every condition: For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It was the <hi>Design</hi> of God in the Appointment of his Son to be Mediator to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve the <hi>communion</hi> between himself and his creature that was lost by sin. Now man was so created <hi>at first,</hi> as that every thing in God was suited to be a Reward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and in all things to give him satisfaction. This being <hi>wholly lost</hi> by sin, and the whole Representation of God to man becoming <hi>full of dread</hi> and terror, all graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intercourse in a way of <hi>special love</hi> on the part of God, and <hi>spiritual willing Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> on the part of man was intercepted and cut off. God designing again to take <hi>sinners</hi> into a communion of Love and Obedience with himself, it must be by <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting unto them his blessed Properties</hi> as suited to their encouragement, satisfaction and reward. And this he doth in the <hi>Person of his Son,</hi> as designed to be our Mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2, 3. For,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The Son is designed to be our Mediator, and the Head of his Church, in a way of Covenant,</hi> wherein there is an Engagement for the exerting of all the <hi>Divine Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the nature of God for the Good and Advantage of them, for whom he hath undertaken, and whom he designed to bring again into favour and communion with God. Hence Believers do no more consider the <hi>Properties of God</hi> in the Person of the Son <hi>absolutely,</hi> but as engaged in a <hi>way of Covenant</hi> for their Good, and as proposed unto them for an everlasting satisfactory Reward. This is the ground of his calling upon them so often to <hi>behold see</hi> and <hi>consider him</hi>; and thereby to be refreshed. They consider his Power, as he is <hi>mighty to save</hi>: His Eternity, as he is an <hi>everlasting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>; his Righteousness, as faithful to <hi>justifie them</hi>: All his Properties, as engaged in <hi>Covenant</hi> for their Good and Advantage. What ever he is <hi>in himself,</hi> that he will <hi>be to them</hi> in a way of Mercy. Thus do the holy Properties of the Divine
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50110:236"/>
Nature become a means of supportment unto us, as considered in the Person of the Son of God. And this is,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A great <hi>encouragement</hi> unto <hi>Believing</hi>; The Lord Christ as the Wisdom of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting sinners to come in unto him, and to be made partakers of him, layes down all his <hi>Divine Excellencies</hi> as a motive thereunto, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, he assures us that we may find <hi>Rest Satisfaction</hi> and an abundant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in him. And the like invitation doth he give to poor sinners, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.22. <hi>Look unto me, and be saved all the ends of the Earth, for I am God, and there is none else.</hi> They may justly expect <hi>Salvation</hi> in him who is God, and in <hi>whom</hi> all Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are proposed to their Benefit; as <hi>they</hi> find who come unto him, <hi>v.</hi> 24.25. The consideration hereof prevents all the <hi>Fears,</hi> and answers all the Doubts of them that <hi>look up unto him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. An <hi>instruction</hi> how to consider the <hi>Properties of God</hi> by faith for our Advantage, that is, as engaged in the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>the Son of God</hi> for our Good. Absolutely conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they may fill us with dread and terror, as they did them of old, who concluded when they thought they had <hi>seen God,</hi> or <hi>heard his voyce,</hi> that they <hi>should dye.</hi> Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as <hi>his Properties,</hi> who is our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> they are alwayes relieying and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.4, 5.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. <hi>The whole Old Creation, even the most glorious parts of it, hastening unto its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, at least of our present interest in it, and use of it, calls upon us not to fix our hearts on the small perishing shares which we have therein, especially since we have him who is Omnipotent and Eternal for our Inheritance.</hi> The <hi>Figure or fashion of this world,</hi> the Apostle tells us, is passing away; that lovely Appearance which it hath at present unto us; it is <hi>hastening</hi> unto its period, it is a fading dying thing, that can yield us no true satisfaction.</p>
                        <p n="iii">III. <hi>The Lord Christ the Mediator, the Head and Spouse of the Church; is infinitely exalted above all creatures whatever, in that he is God over all, Omnipotent and Eternal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="iv">IV. <hi>The whole World, the Heavens and Earth, being made by the Lord Christ, and being to be dissolved by him, is wholly at his disposal, to be ordered for the good of them that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> And therefore,</p>
                        <p n="v">V. <hi>There is no just cause of fear unto Believers, from any thing in Heaven or Earth, seeing they are all of the making, and at the disposal of Jesus Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="vi">VI. <hi>Whatever our changes may be, inward or outward, yet Christ changing not, our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condition is secured, and relief provided against all present troubles and miseries.</hi> The Immutability and Eternity of Christ is the spring of our consolation and security in every condition.</p>
                        <p>The summ of all is, that,</p>
                        <p n="vii">VII. <hi>Such is the frailty of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the nature of man, and such the perishing condition of all created things, that none can ever obtain the least stable consolation, but what ariseth from an interest in the Omnipotency Soveraignty and Eternity of the Lord Christ.</hi> This I say is that which the words insisted on as they are used in the <hi>Psalm</hi> do instruct us in; and this therefore we may a little farther improve.</p>
                        <p>This is that which we are instructed in by the <hi>Ministry of</hi> John Baptist, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.6, 7, 8. <hi>The voyce cryed, all flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field; the grass withereth, and the flower fadeth, because the Spirit of God bloweth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; surely the People is grass: The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, but the word of our God shall stand for ever.</hi> All is grass, fading grass; though it bloom and appear <hi>goodly</hi> for a little season, yet there is no continuance, no consistency in it. Every <hi>Wind</hi> that passeth over it, causeth it to wither: This is the best <hi>of flesh</hi>; of all that in and by our selves, we are, we do, we enjoy, or hope for. The <hi>Crown of the Pride of man,</hi> and his <hi>glorious Beauty,</hi> is but <hi>a fading flower, Isa.</hi> 28.1. What Joy, what Peace, what Rest can be taken in things that are <hi>dying away in our hands,</hi> that perish before every breath of Wind that passeth over them? Where then shall this poor Creature, so <hi>frail</hi> in its self, in its Actings, in its Enjoyments, seek for <hi>Rest,</hi> Consolation and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? in this alone, that the <hi>Word of the Lord abides for ever</hi>; in the <hi>eternally abiding
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50110:236"/>
Word</hi> of God; that is, the Lord Jesus Christ as preached in the Gospel: so <hi>Peter</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes these words, 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 1.25. By an <hi>Interest</hi> in him alone, his Eternity and Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness, may relief be obtained against the consideration of this <hi>perishing</hi> dying state and condition of all things. Thus the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us, that <hi>verily every man living in his best estate is altogether vanity, Psal.</hi> 39.5. and thence takes the Conclusion now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>And now Lord, seeing it is thus</hi>: Seeing this is the condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, what is thence to be looked after? What is to be expected? nothing at all; not the least of use or comfort? <hi>What wait I for? My hope is in thee</hi>; from thee alone as a God Eternal, <hi>pardoning</hi> and <hi>saving,</hi> do I look for Relief.</p>
                        <p>Man indeed in this Condition seeks oftentimes for <hi>satisfaction</hi> from himself, from what he is, and doth, and enjoyes; and what he shall leave after him; comforting himself against his own <hi>frailty</hi> with an <hi>Eternity</hi> that he fancieth to himself in his <hi>Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and their Enjoyment of his Goods and Inheritance; So the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.11. <hi>Their inward thought is, that their Houses shall continue for ever, and their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling places unto all generations; and they call their Lands after their own names.</hi> They see indeed <hi>that all men dye, Wise men and Fools, v.</hi> 10. and cannot but from thence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their own <hi>frailty.</hi> Wherefore they are resolved to make <hi>provision</hi> against it; they will perpetuate their Posterity, and their Inheritance. This they make use of to relieve them in their <hi>inmost Imaginations.</hi> But what censure doth the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> pass upon this Contrivance, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Nevertheless,</hi> saith he, notwithstanding all these imaginations, <hi>Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in honour abideth not, he is like the Beasts that perish</hi>; which he farther proves, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20. shewing fully that he himself is no <hi>way concerned</hi> in the imaginary perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of his Possessions; which as they are all of them <hi>perishing things,</hi> so himself <hi>dyes and fades away,</hi> whilest he is in the contemplation of their <hi>Endurance.</hi> And the Truth proposed may be farther evidenced by the ensuing considerations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Man was made for Eternity.</hi> He was not called out of <hi>nothing,</hi> to return unto it again. When he once is, he is for ever; not as to his present state, that is <hi>frail and changeable</hi>; but as to his <hi>Existence</hi> in one condition or other. God made him for his <hi>Eternal Glory,</hi> and gave him therefore a <hi>subsistence without End.</hi> Had he been created to continue a <hi>day,</hi> a <hi>moneth,</hi> an <hi>year,</hi> a <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>usand years,</hi> things commensurate unto that space of time might have afforded him satisfaction. <hi>But he is made for ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>He is sensible of his Condition.</hi> Many indeed endeavour to cast off the thoughts of it: They would faign hope that they <hi>shall be,</hi> no longer than they are here. In that case they could find enough as they suppose to satisfie them, in the things that are <hi>like themselves.</hi> But this will not be; They find a <hi>Witness</hi> in themselves to the contrary; somewhat that assures them of an <hi>after-reckoning</hi>; and that the things which now they do, will be called over in another world. Besides the conviction of the Word with them that enjoy it, puts the matter out of question. They cannot evade the Testimony it gives unto their <hi>eternal subsistence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Hence men are <hi>exposed to double trouble and perplexity.</hi> First, That whereas their <hi>Eternal subsistence,</hi> as to the Enjoyment of good or bad, depends upon their present Life, that that is <hi>frail, fading,</hi> perishing. They are here now, <hi>but when a few dayes are come and gone,</hi> they must go to the place from whence they shall not return. They find their <hi>subsistence</hi> divided into two very <hi>unequal parts,</hi> a <hi>few dayes</hi> and Eternity; and the <hi>latter</hi> to be regulated by the <hi>former.</hi> This fills them with Anxiety, and makes them sometimes <hi>weary</hi> of life, sometimes <hi>hate</hi> it, alwayes almost solicitous about it, and to bewail the <hi>frailty</hi> of it. Secondly, That <hi>no perishing thing</hi> will afford them Relief or supportment in this Condition. How should it? They and these are <hi>parting every moment,</hi> and that for Eternity. There is no comfort in a <hi>perpetual taking leave of things that are beloved.</hi> Such is the life of man as unto all earthly Enjoyments. It is but a <hi>parting</hi> with what a man hath; and the longer a man is <hi>about it,</hi> the more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he hath with it. The things of this Creation will not <hi>continue our lives</hi> here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of <hi>our frailty</hi>; they will not <hi>accompany us unto Eternity,</hi> because of their <hi>own frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; we change, and they change; we are <hi>Vanity,</hi> and they are no better.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. An interest in the <hi>Omnipotency Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Eternity of the Lord Christ will yield a soul relief and satisfaction in this Condition.</hi> There is that in them, which is suited to relieve us under our <hi>present frailty,</hi> and to give satisfaction unto our <hi>future Eternity.</hi> For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. What we have not in <hi>our selves,</hi> by an interest in Christ we have in <hi>another.</hi> In him we have <hi>Stability</hi> and Unchangeableness: For what he is in himself he is unto us,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50110:237"/>
and for us. All our concernments are wrapped up and secured in him. He is <hi>ours,</hi> and though we in our own persons change, yet he changeth not, nor our <hi>interest</hi> in him which is our life, our All. Though we dye, yet he dyeth not; and <hi>because he liveth, we shall live also.</hi> Though all other things <hi>perish</hi> and pass away, that we here make use of, yet he <hi>abideth</hi> a blessed and satisfying portion unto a believing soul. For as we are <hi>his,</hi> so all his is <hi>ours</hi>; only laid up in him, and kept for us in him. So that under all Disconsolations that may befall us from our own <hi>frailty</hi> and misery, and the <hi>perishing</hi> condition of outward things, we have sweet relief tendered us in this, that we have all good things <hi>treasured up</hi> for us in him. And Faith knows how to make use of <hi>all that is in Christ,</hi> to the comfort and supportment of the soul.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When our <hi>frailty</hi> and <hi>changeableness</hi> have had their utmost effect upon us; when they have done their <hi>worst</hi> upon us, they only bring us to the full Enjoyment of what the Lord Christ is unto us, that is an <hi>exceeding great</hi> Reward, and a full satisfaction unto Eternity. Then shall we live for ever <hi>in that</hi> which we now <hi>live upon</hi>; being present with him, beholding his Glory, and made partakers of it. So that both <hi>here,</hi> and <hi>hereafter,</hi> there is relief, comfort and satisfaction for <hi>Believers</hi> laid up in the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the Person of Jesus Christ. And this should teach us,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>misery of those who have no interest in him</hi>; and have therefore nothing to relieve themselves against the evils of any condition. All their hopes are in this life; and from the Enjoyments of it. When these are <hi>once past,</hi> they will be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and in <hi>all things</hi> miserable; miserable beyond our Expression, or their Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And what is this life? <hi>a vapour that appeareth for a little while</hi>: What are the enjoyments of this life? dying perishing things, and unto them, fuell to Lust, and so to Hell. Suppose they live twenty, thirty, forty, sixty years; yet every day they <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>ought to fear,</hi> that it will be their last. Some <hi>dye ost</hi> every day from the first to last, of the utmost extent of the life of man: so that every day may be the last to any one; and whose then will be all their treasures of earthly things. And the <hi>Relief</hi> which men have against the <hi>tormenting fears</hi> that the frailty of their condition doth expose them unto, is no whit better than their troubles. It is <hi>sinful security,</hi> which gives the fulness of their misery an advantage to <hi>surprize them,</hi> and themselves an advantage to aggravate that misery, by the increase of their sin. In the mean time <hi>spes sibi quisque; every ones hope is in himself alone</hi>; which makes it perpetually like <hi>the giving up of the ghost.</hi> Surely the contentment that <hi>dying man</hi> can take in <hi>dying things,</hi> is very contemptible. We must not stay to discover the <hi>miseries</hi> of the life of man, and the weakness of the comforts and joyes of it: But what ever they be, what becomes of them, when they have serious thoughts of their <hi>present frailty,</hi> and <hi>future Eternity?</hi> This following <hi>Eternity</hi> is <hi>like Pharaohs lean kine,</hi> which immediately devours all the <hi>fat pleasures</hi> of this <hi>present life,</hi> and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues as <hi>lean</hi> and miserable as ever. The <hi>Eternal misery</hi> of men will not be in the least <hi>eased,</hi> yea, it will be <hi>greatned</hi> by the Enjoyments of this life, when once it hath devoured them. And this is the portion of them that have no <hi>interest</hi> in the <hi>Eternity</hi> and Immutability of the Son of God. Their <hi>present frailty</hi> makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <hi>fear Eternity,</hi> and their <hi>fear of Eternity</hi> embitters all things that they should use for the relief of their <hi>frailty</hi>; and that <hi>security</hi> which they provide against both, encreaseth <hi>their misery,</hi> by <hi>sin</hi> here, and <hi>suffering</hi> hereafter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This also will teach us how to use these <hi>earthly things</hi>; how dying Persons should use dying creatures. That is, to use them for our <hi>present service</hi> and necessity, but not as those that look after <hi>rest or satisfaction</hi> in them, which they will not afford us. <hi>Vse</hi> the world, but <hi>live</hi> on Christ.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Not to despond under a sense of our <hi>present frailty</hi>; we see what blessed relief is provided against our <hi>fainting</hi> on that account.</p>

                        <p>The usefulness of this testimony for the confirmation of the Dignity and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is evidenced by the <hi>frequent quotation</hi> of it in the <hi>New Testament</hi>; as by our Saviour himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.42. by <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2.34, 35. and twice by our Apostle in this place, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28.</p>
                        <p>As the words are here used we may consider the <hi>Introduction</hi> of the Testimony, and the <hi>Testimony</hi> it self.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Introduction</hi> of the Testimony is by way of <hi>Interrogation; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels said he at any time?</hi> And herein three things may be observed.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That in the <hi>Interrogation,</hi> a vehement <hi>negation</hi> is included; <hi>He said not at any time to any Angels</hi>; he never spake <hi>these words</hi> or the like concerning them: there is no testimony unto that purpose recorded in the whole Book of God. The way of Expression puts an <hi>emphasis</hi> upon the denial. And the speaking here relates unto what is spoken in the Scripture, which is the <hi>only means</hi> of our knowledge, and rule of our faith in these things.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That he makes application of this testimony to <hi>every Angel</hi> in heaven severally considered. For whereas he had before sufficiently proved the <hi>Preheminence</hi> of the <hi>Messiah</hi> above the Angels in general, to obviate their thoughts about the especial <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of any <hi>one</hi> or more Angels, or Angels in a singular manner, such as indeed they conceived, he applies the present testimony to <hi>every one of them singly</hi> and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually considered. <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which of the Angels said he at any time?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. A <hi>tacit Application</hi> of this testimony unto the Son, or the Messiah; unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels he said not, but unto the Son he said, <hi>Sit thou on my right hand.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the testimony it self doth clearly prove the intendment of the Apostle, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the words were <hi>originally</hi> spoken of him, or to him, unto whom they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, is beyond all exceptions. For they contain an <hi>Elogium</hi> of him of whom they are spoken, and an assignation of Honour and Glory to him, beyond what ever was or can be ascribed unto any <hi>Angel</hi> what ever. It remains therefore that this be first proved, and then the importance of the testimony it self explained.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For those that <hi>believe the Gospel,</hi> the Authority of the Lord Christ and his Apostles applying this testimony unto him, is sufficient for their conviction. By our Saviour as was observed it is applied unto the <hi>Messiah</hi> in <hi>Thesi, Matth.</hi> 22.42, 43, 44. And had not this been generally acknowledged by the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> and whole Church of the Jews, as it had not been to his purpose to have mentioned it, so they had not been reduced unto that <hi>conviction</hi> and shame by it as they were. The <hi>Apostles</hi> apply it unto the true <hi>Messiah</hi> in <hi>Hypothesi</hi>; and herein doth our faith rest.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But a considerable part of the controversie which we have with the <hi>Jews</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating much unto this <hi>Psalm,</hi> we must yet farther clear the application of it unto the <hi>Messiah</hi> from their exceptions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="130" facs="tcp:50110:238"/>Of the <hi>Targum</hi> or <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase</hi> there are two Copies, one printed in <hi>Arias Bible,</hi> the other in the <hi>Basil Edition</hi> by <hi>Buxtorf.</hi> The Title of the Psalm in both of them is, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>A song by the hand of David.</hi> And the beginning of it is thus rendred by the former of them, <hi>The Lord said by his word that he would give me the Kingdom, because I studied the doctrine of the Law of his right hand; wait thou until I make thine enemies thy foot-stool.</hi> By the other thus, <hi>The Lord said by his word, that he would appoint me the Lord of all Israel; but he said unto me again, Stay for Saul who is of the Tribe of Benjamin until he die, for a Kingdom will not admit of a Companion; and after that I will make thine enemies thy foot-stool.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides what appears from other considerations, it is hence sufficiently evident, that this <hi>Targum</hi> was made after the <hi>Jews</hi> began to be exercised in the controversie with Christians, and had learned to corrupt by their glosses all the testimonies given in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> unto the Lord Christ, especially such as they sound to be made use of in the <hi>New.</hi> Their corrupting of the sense of the Holy Ghost in this place by a <hi>pretended Translation,</hi> is openly <hi>malitious</hi> against evident light and conviction. The <hi>Psalm</hi> they own from the Title to be written by <hi>David,</hi> but they would have him also to be the <hi>subject</hi> of it, to be spoken of in it. And therefore those words, <hi>The Lord said unto my Lord,</hi> they translate, <hi>The Lord said unto me</hi>; which assertion is <hi>contrary</hi> to the Text, and <hi>false</hi> in it self; for who ever were the Pen-man of the <hi>Psalm,</hi> he speaks of <hi>another person. The Lord said unto my Lord</hi>; say they, <hi>The Lord said unto me.</hi> And thereunto are annexed those imaginations about <hi>studying the Law,</hi> and waiting for the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> which in no case belongs to the <hi>Text</hi> or matter in hand.</p>
                        <p>Others therefore to avoid this Rock affirm, that the <hi>Psalm</hi> speaks of <hi>David,</hi> but was not composed by him, being the work of some other who calls him <hi>Lord.</hi> So <hi>David Kimchi</hi> on the place. And this he endeavours to prove from the inscription of the Psalm, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that is saith he, <hi>A Psalm spoken to David</hi>; for it denotes the <hi>third,</hi> and not the <hi>second Case</hi> or variation of <hi>Nouns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this is contrary to the use of that <hi>Prefix</hi> throughout the whole Book of <hi>Psalms</hi>; and if this observation might be allowed, all <hi>Psalms</hi> with this <hi>Title,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>le David,</hi> which are the greatest part of those composed by him, must be adjudged <hi>from him,</hi> contrary to the received sense and consent of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians.</hi> But fully to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the folly of this pretence and that the <hi>Author</hi> of it contradicted his own light out of hatred unto the Gospel, there are sundry <hi>Psalms</hi> with this Title, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>le David,</hi> which are expresly affirmed to be composed and <hi>sung</hi> by him unto the Lord; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. whose Title is, <hi>To the chief Musician,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Evident then it is that <hi>David</hi> is not treated of in this <hi>Psalm,</hi> in that he being the <hi>Pen-man</hi> of it, calleth him <hi>his Lord</hi>; concerning whom he treats. Besides, to omit other instances of alike cogency, how or when did God swear unto <hi>David</hi> that he <hi>should be a Priest,</hi> and <hi>that for ever after the order of Melchisedeck?</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> knew well enough that <hi>David</hi> had nothing to do with the <hi>Priesthood.</hi> So that <hi>David</hi> had no concernment in this <hi>Psalm,</hi> but only as he was the <hi>Pen-man</hi> of it. He was not herein so much as a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but speaks of him as his <hi>Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wherefore others of them, as <hi>Jarchi,</hi> and <hi>Lipman,</hi> and <hi>Nizzachon</hi> affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is <hi>Abraham</hi> who is spoken of in this Psalm, of <hi>whom</hi> the one says it was composed by <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> the other by his servant <hi>Eliezer of Damascus.</hi> But the fondness of these presumptuous figments is evident. <hi>Melchiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Eliezer</hi> did so, being his servant, but how could he ascribe unto him the <hi>sitting at the Right Hand of God?</hi> how the sending forth the <hi>rod of his power from Sion?</hi> how being a <hi>Priest for ever</hi> after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> or indeed any one thing mentioned in the Psalm? These things deserve not to be insisted on, but only to manifest the woful pretences of the present <hi>Judaical</hi> infidelity.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the Dialogue of <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> with <hi>Trypho,</hi> that some of them of old applied this <hi>Psalm</hi> to <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> But not <hi>one word</hi> in it can rationally be conceived to respect him, especially that Which is spoken about the <hi>Priesthood</hi> utterly excludes him; seeing his <hi>Great Grand-father</hi> a man of more power than himself, was smitten with <hi>Leprosie,</hi> and lost the Administration of his Kingdom for one single attempt to invade that Office, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="131" facs="tcp:50110:238"/>It remains then that this <hi>Psalm</hi> was written concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi> and him alone, for no other subject of it can be assigned. And this use in our passage we may make of the <hi>Targum,</hi> that whereas those words, <hi>The Lord said,</hi> do not intend a <hi>word spoken,</hi> but the stable purpose or decree of God; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7. its Author hath rendred them, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>It remaineth only that we consider the Objections of the <hi>Jews</hi> against our Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Psalm</hi> unto the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And these are summed up by <hi>Kimchi</hi> in his Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Text. <hi>The Hereticks,</hi> saith he, <hi>expound this Psalm of Jesus; and in the first verse they say the Father and Son are designed; and they read</hi> Adonai <hi>with</hi> Camets <hi>under</hi> Nun, <hi>in which use the true God is signified by that Name.

But in all Copies that are found,</hi> from the rising of the Sun to the going down of it, Chiric <hi>is with</hi> Nun <hi>in</hi> Adoni, <hi>and</hi> Patha <hi>with</hi> Ain <hi>in</hi> Hammeka. <hi>And</hi> Gerolmus (Hierom) <hi>erred in his Translation. And for the errour, if the Father and Son be the God-head, how doth one stand in need of the other? and how can he say unto him,</hi> Thou art a Priest? <hi>He is a Priest who offers sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but God doth not.</hi> Of the like nature are the rest of his exceptions unto the end of his <hi>Notes</hi> on that Psalm.

But the words are rightly rendred, <hi>The dew of thy birth is from the womb of the morning</hi>; and express the rise and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> These things prove indeed that it is dangerous to interpret the Scripture without heedful attending unto the <hi>Original</hi> Text; but that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is not intended in this <hi>Psalm,</hi> they prove not.</p>
                        <p>For what they farther object on our supposition of the Divine Nature of Christ, <hi>That there was no need that God should promise God his assistance,</hi> it is but an open effect of their ignorance or malice.

                        <p>Thus setting aside the mixture of their follies and impieties wherein we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, we have a sufficient suffrage from the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves unto our assignation of this <hi>Prophetical Psalm</hi> to the <hi>Messiah</hi>; which is enough to stop the mouths of their modern <hi>gain-sayers,</hi> who neither are able to assign any other <hi>Person</hi> unto whom it should belong. Having then removed their Objections we may return unto the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the words.</p>
                        <p>The matter intended in the first part of these words, or <hi>sitting at the right hand of God,</hi> hath been somewhat spoken unto already, and I shall adde but little in the further Explanation of it in this place.</p>
                        <p>Some things controverted on these words we may well omit the consideration of; as whether were the more honourable place of old the <hi>right hand</hi> or the left: besides they have been sufficiently spoken unto already on <hi>verse</hi> 3. For whereas there is no mention made any where of sitting at <hi>the left hand of God,</hi> as was observed, there is no comparison to be feigned between the one and the other. Besides the pretence of the left hand to have been the most <hi>honourable place of old,</hi> is most vain; insisted on by some who had a desire to vent <hi>new</hi> observations of <hi>old</hi> matters to little purpose. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> shews what good leisure he had in managing of Controversies, when he spent more time and labour in answering an Objection against the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> from <hi>Peters</hi> being placed in <hi>old Seals</hi> on the <hi>left hand of Paul,</hi> than of many Texts of Scripture plainly overthrowing his pretensions.</p>
                        <p>Neither shall we consider their claim unto this <hi>testimony,</hi> who understanding the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature</hi> of Christ to be to be only intended and spoken to, affirm that its <hi>sitting at the right hand of God</hi> consists in a <hi>real communication of all Divine Properties</hi> and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes unto that Nature; a pretence very remote from the Apostles design and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the words.</p>

God <hi>said this</hi> in the Eternal Purpose of his Will, to and concerning his Son. 2. The <hi>Covenant and Compact</hi> that was between the Father and Son about and concerning the Work of Mediation, is expressed also in this saying. That there was such a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the nature of it, I have else-where declared. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12. <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6; In this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, God said unto him, Sit thou at my right hand</hi>; which he also pleaded in and upon the discharge of his work, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. 3. There is also in it the <hi>Declaration</hi> of this Decree and Covenant, in the <hi>Prophesies</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> given out concerning their accomplishment and execution from the foundation of the world, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 40. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11, 12. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>He said it by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began.</hi> And in this sense <hi>David</hi> only <hi>recounts the prophesies and promises</hi> that went before, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26, 27. And all these are comprised in this <hi>speaking</hi> here mentioned, <hi>Thus the Lord said unto him.</hi> And all these were past, when recorded by <hi>David.</hi> But he yet looks <hi>forward</hi> by a Spirit of prophesie into the actual accomplishment of them all, when upon the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ, and the fulfilling of his work of Humiliation, God <hi>actually invested him</hi> with the promised Glory; which is the <hi>fourth thing</hi> intended in the expression, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 33.36. <hi>chap.</hi> 5.33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. All these <hi>four things</hi> center in a new <hi>Revelation</hi> now made to <hi>David</hi> by the Spirit of Prophesie. This he here declares as the stable <hi>Purpose Covenant</hi> and Promise of God the Father, revealed unto him: <hi>The Lord said.</hi>

                        <p>And this also gives us an account of the <hi>manner</hi> of this Expression, as to its <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Enunciation, Sit thou:</hi> It hath in it the force of a <hi>promise,</hi> that he should do so, as it respected the <hi>Decree</hi> Covenant and Declaration thereof from the foundation of the world; God engaging his Faithfulness and Power for the effecting of it in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed season, speaks concerning it as a thing instantly to be done. And as those words respect the glorious accomplishment of the thing it self, so they denote the <hi>acquiescence</hi> of God in the work of Christ, and his Authority in his glorious <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. The thing spoken about is <hi>Christ's sitting at the right hand of God</hi>; wherein that consists hath been declared on <hi>verse</hi> 3. In brief, it is the <hi>Exaltation of Christ</hi> into the

glorious Administration of the Kingdom granted unto him, with Honour, Security and Power, or as in one word our Apostle calls it, his <hi>Reigning,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which we have treated already at large.</p>
                        <p>And herein we shall <hi>acquisce,</hi> and not trouble our selves with the needless curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and speculation of some about these words. Such is that of <hi>Maldonat</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. before remarked on <hi>verse</hi> 3. saith he, <hi>Cum filius dicitur sedere ad dextram Patris, denota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur comparatio virtutis filii &amp; Patris, &amp; potentia filii major dicitur ratione functionis Officii &amp; administrationis Ecclesiae.

For there is not in the <hi>words</hi> the least intimation of any comparison between the Power of the Father and the Son, but only the Father's Exaltation of the Son unto Power and Glory expressed. But, as was said, these things have been already considered.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. There is in the words the <hi>End</hi> aimed at in this <hi>sitting down at the right hand of God,</hi> and that is, the making of his <hi>Enemies the foot-stool of his feet.</hi> This is that which is <hi>promised</hi> unto him in the state and condition whereunto he is exalted. For the opening of these words we must enquire,

                        <p>For the first, we have shewed that it is the <hi>glorious Exaltation</hi> of Christ in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is here spoken of; and therefore the <hi>Enemies</hi> intended must be the <hi>Enemies</hi> of his Kingdom, or <hi>Enemies unto him</hi> in his Kingdom; that is, as he <hi>sits on his Throne</hi> carrying on the work designed, and ends of it. Now the Kingdom of Christ may be considered two ways. First, in respect of the <hi>Internal Spiritual</hi> Power and Efficacy of it, in the hearts of his subjects. Secondly, with respect unto the outward <hi>glorious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration</hi> of it in the world. And in both these respects it hath enemies in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: all and every one whereof must be made his <hi>foot-stool.</hi> We shall consider them apart.</p>
                        <p>The Kingdom, Rule or Reigning of Christ in the <hi>first sense,</hi> is the <hi>Authority and Power</hi> which he puts forth for the conversion sanctification and salvation of his Elect.

In this work the Lord Christ hath <hi>many enemies</hi>; as the <hi>Law, Sin, Sathan,</hi> the <hi>World, Death,</hi> the <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi>: all these are enemies to the <hi>Work and Kingdom</hi> of Christ, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to his Person, as having undertaken that work.</p>

The <hi>Law</hi> is an <hi>enemy</hi> unto Christ in his Kingdom; not absolutely, but by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and by reason of the consequents that attend it, where his subjects are obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto it. It <hi>slays</hi> them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11. which is the work of an <hi>enemy</hi>; is <hi>against them,</hi> and <hi>contrary unto them, Col.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 14. and contributes strength to their other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 56. which discovers the <hi>nature</hi> of an enemy.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Sin</hi> is universally and in its whole nature an <hi>enemy</hi> unto Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and <hi>enemies</hi> are the same, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 21. It is that which makes special direct and immediate opposition to the <hi>quickning sanctifying</hi> and <hi>saving</hi> of his his people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 21, 23. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Sathan</hi> is the sworn <hi>enemy</hi> of Christ, the adversary that openly, constantly, avowedly opposeth him in his Throne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. And he exerts his enmity by <hi>temptations,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 5. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>accusations, Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>persecutions, Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 10. All which are the <hi>works</hi> of an enemy.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The <hi>World</hi> is also a professed <hi>enemy</hi> of the Kingdom of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 18. in the <hi>Things</hi> of it, the <hi>Men</hi> of it, the <hi>Rule</hi> of it, it sets it self against the work of the Lord Christ on his Throne. The <hi>things of it</hi> as under the curse and subject to vanity, are suited to alienate the hearts of men from Christ, and so act an <hi>enmity</hi> against him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 4. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 22: The <hi>men of the world</hi> act the same part, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>chap.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 9. By examples, by temptations, by reproaches, by persecutions, by allurements, they make it their <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness</hi> to oppose the Kingdom of Christ. And to that end is the <hi>Rule</hi> of it for the most part directed or over-ruled, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Death</hi> is also an <hi>enemy,</hi> so it is expresly called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. it designs exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50110:240"/>
of the <hi>first Curse</hi> against all believers; and therein contributes aid and Assistance unto all other Adversaries; giving up its self to the <hi>service</hi> of Satan, and therefore said <hi>to be in his power, Chap.</hi> 2.14. of this <hi>Epistle</hi>; and borrows a <hi>sting of sin,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. to make its self the more terrible and sharp.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The <hi>Grave</hi> is an <hi>Adversary</hi> also; It fights against the faith of the Subjects of Christ; by reducing their <hi>Mortality</hi> into Corruption, and holding <hi>fast the dead</hi> untill they are powerfully rescued from the jaws of it.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Lastly, <hi>Hell</hi> is that <hi>Enemy</hi> in a subordination whereunto all these others do act. They all aim to bring men into <hi>Hell</hi>; which is an <hi>Eternal Enemy</hi> where it prevails. This attends the workings and <hi>successes</hi> of those other Adversaries to consume and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, <hi>if it were possible,</hi> the whole Inheritance of Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.8. All these are <hi>Enemies</hi> to Christ in his Work and Kingdom, with every thing that contributes aid or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance unto them, every thing that they make <hi>use</hi> of in the pursuit of their <hi>Enmity</hi> against him.</p>
                        <p>Now all these <hi>Enemies</hi> as far as they oppose the spiritual internal carrying on of the work of Christ, must be made the <hi>footstool of his feet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Expression is <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> and is to be interpreted and applyed <hi>variously,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature and Condition of the <hi>Enemies</hi> with whom he hath to do. The Allusion in general is taken from what was done by <hi>Joshua</hi> his <hi>Type,</hi> towards the <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> of his <hi>people, Josh.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 24. To shew the ruine of their power, and his absolute prevalency against them, he caused the people to set their <hi>feet upon their necks</hi>: See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.39. <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.6. To have his Enemies <hi>then brought under his feet,</hi> is to have an absolute compleat <hi>conquest</hi> over them; And their being made his <hi>footstool,</hi> their perpetual and <hi>unchangeable Duration</hi> in that condition, under the <hi>weight</hi> of what ever burden he shall be pleased to lay upon them.</p>
                        <p>This being that which is to be done, we may consider how it is accomplished; now this whole work of conquest and prevalency over all his enemies is done,

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Meritoriously</hi>; By his Death and blood-shedding he hath procured the <hi>sentence of Condemnation</hi> in the Cause depending between him and them, to be pronounced against them: so that they shall have no more Right to exert their <hi>Enmity</hi> against him or his. He hath given them all their deaths wounds, and leaves them to dye at his pleasure. So hath he prevailed against the <hi>Law, Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. He hath removed that <hi>strength</hi> which it gave to sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56. So that it hath no right to disquiet or <hi>condemn</hi> any of his <hi>Subjects</hi> for the future; And (2.) Against <hi>sin, Rom.</hi> 8.2, 3. So that it should not <hi>reign</hi> in, nor condemn his any more: And (3.) <hi>Satan</hi> also; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. as to all pretence of Liberty or <hi>Right</hi> unto any part of his cursed work.

They are all <hi>meritoriously</hi> conquered in his death and <hi>Resurrection.</hi> And all this hath he done for his Church.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Exemplarily</hi>: All these Adversaries peculiarly exercised their <hi>Enmity</hi> against, and tryed their strength and power upon his <hi>own person.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> brought its <hi>curse</hi> upon him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.

And he was not unas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by the <hi>pains of Hell</hi> when he bare our Iniquities, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.5, 6, 10. Now all of them did he absolutely <hi>conquer</hi> in his own person.

                        <p n="3">3. It is done <hi>Efficiently</hi> in, by and for his whole Church; and this in three instances. (1.) <hi>Initially</hi> in their <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with himself. When, and as he unites any of them unto himself, he begins the conquest of all <hi>Enemies</hi> in them, and for them, giving them a <hi>Right</hi> to the compleat total and final Victory over them all. (2.) <hi>Gradualy</hi> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them on in their several seasons towards perfections, treading down their <hi>Enemies</hi>
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:50110:241"/>
by degrees under them. And (3.) <hi>Perfectly</hi> at the last day; when having freed them from the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>sin,</hi> trodden down <hi>Satan,</hi> prevailed against the <hi>World,</hi> recovered them from <hi>death,</hi> rescued them from the <hi>Grave,</hi> and delivered them from <hi>Hell,</hi> he shall be himself perfectly victorious <hi>in them,</hi> and they made compleatly sharers in his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; wherein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the making of all his <hi>Enemies his Footstool</hi> consisteth.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Kingdom of Christ respects his <hi>Administration</hi> of it visibly in this world, in the <hi>Profession</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> of his Subjects unto him; and this also with the Opposition made unto it, is respected in this Expression. God the Father in the Exaltation of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath given unto him <hi>all Nations for his Inheritance, and the utmost parts of the Earth for his Possession, Psal.</hi> 2.8. Upon this grant a twofold Right ensued. (1.) A Right to <hi>call</hi> gather and erect his <hi>Church,</hi> in any Nation, in any part of the World; to give unto it his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Worship, to be owned and observed by them in a <hi>visible</hi> and peaceable manner, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. (2.) A Right, Power and <hi>Authority</hi> to dispose of and Order all Nations and Persons, for the Good Benefit and <hi>Advantage</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> In pursuit of this Grant and Right, erecting his Church, and therein his <hi>visible Kingdom</hi> in the world, great <hi>Opposition</hi> is made unto him by all sorts of persons stirred, excited and instigated thereunto by <hi>Satan.</hi> And as this Enmity was first acted against <hi>himself</hi> in his <hi>own Person, Psal.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. So it hath continued <hi>against him</hi> in his Church in all Ages and Places, and will do so unto the End of the world. The world <hi>understands</hi> not his Right, <hi>hates</hi> his Government, and would not have him to reign. Hence hath been all that <hi>Rage</hi> which hath been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon the Professors of his name. Kings, Rulers, Potentates, Counsellors, the multitude have set themselves against him. They are many of them, and have been his <hi>Enemies.</hi> Great havock and Destruction have they made of his subjects all the world over, and <hi>continue</hi> to do so in most places unto this very day. Especially in these <hi>latter Ages</hi> after other means failed him, <hi>Satan</hi> hath stirred up a fierce, cruel, subtle <hi>Adversary</hi> unto him, who he hath foretold his Disciples of under the name of <hi>Anti-christ,</hi> the <hi>Beast,</hi> and <hi>false Prophet.</hi> After the ruine of many other, this <hi>Enemy</hi> by various subtilties and pretences hath drawn the world into a new <hi>combination</hi> against him; and is at this day become the greatest and most <hi>pernicious Adversary</hi> that he hath in this world. Now the aym and design of all these, is to <hi>dethrone</hi> him by the ruine of his Kingdom which he hath set up in the world. And this in <hi>every Age</hi> they have hoped to accomplish, and continue to do so unto this day; but <hi>in vain</hi>; For as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, his Kingdom and Interest in the world hath been <hi>maintained</hi> against all their <hi>enmity</hi> and opposition, themselves been frustrated and brought to destruction one after another; so by vertue of this Promise he shall reign in Security and Glory, until all their <hi>hearts be broken,</hi> their strength ruined, their <hi>Opposition</hi> finished, and themselves brought under <hi>his feet</hi> unto all Eternity, as our Apostle declares, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 25. And this may suffice to declare the meaning of these words.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, We are to consider by <hi>whom</hi> these <hi>Enemies</hi> of Christ shall be made thus his <hi>footstool: I will make them,</hi> saith God the Father unto him. And this Expression want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not its difficulty. For is it not the work of <hi>Christ himself,</hi> to <hi>subdue and conquer</hi> his Enemies? Is it not said, that he shall do so? So doing is he described in the <hi>Revelation</hi> with Glory and Power, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.11, 12, 13, 14. From <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Who should this work more become, or belong unto than <hi>him,</hi> who was persecuted and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by them? And doth it not directly belong unto his <hi>Kingly power?</hi> Whence is it then, that he is here described as one <hi>resting in glory and security</hi> at his Fathers Right Hand, whilest <hi>he</hi> subdues his Enemies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answer,</hi> There is no doubt but that the Work of subduing the <hi>Enemies</hi> of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation and Kingdom of Christ, is <hi>immediately</hi> wrought by himself. All <hi>Prophecies</hi> of him, all <hi>Promises</hi> made unto him, the nature of his Office, do all require that so it should be; and so the Apostle directly expresseth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. But yet there are sundry Reasons why that Work which is <hi>immediately</hi> wrought by the <hi>Son,</hi> may by the way of <hi>Eminency</hi> be ascrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d unto the <hi>Father,</hi> as we see this to be.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>Power and Authority</hi> to subdue and conquer all his Enemies, is <hi>given</hi> unto the Lord Christ by the Father in the way of Reward; and it is therefore said to be <hi>his work,</hi> because the <hi>Authority</hi> for it is from him. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. This <hi>Power</hi> then I say of <hi>subduing</hi> all his Enemies, being granted unto the Lord Christ in the love of the Father, as a <hi>Reward</hi> of the Travail of his soul which he underwent in his work on the earth, is ascribed unto the <hi>Father</hi> as his. And this Expression signifies no more, but that as God hath given him <hi>Authority</hi> for it, so he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50110:241"/>
will <hi>abide</hi> by him in it, until it be accomplished: And on this account he takes it on himself as his own.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The <hi>Work of subduing Enemies</hi> is a work of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> Now in the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> among the works that outwardly are of God, those of <hi>Power and Authority</hi> are peculiarly ascribed unto the Father; as those of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or Wisdom in the works of God, is unto the Son, who is the <hi>Eternal Wisdom</hi> of the Father. And on this account the same works are ascribed unto the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> Not as though the <hi>Father</hi> did them <hi>first,</hi> or only used the Son as an <hi>immediate instrumental cause</hi> of them; but that he worketh by him as his own Eternal and Essential Wisdom, <hi>John</hi> 5.17, 19. But there is also more in it as the Son is considered as <hi>Mediator,</hi> God and man, for so he receives and holds his <hi>especial Kingdom</hi> by grant from his Father, and therefore the works of it may be said to be his.</p>
                        <p n="vi">VI. The last thing remaining for the <hi>Exposition</hi> of these words, is the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the appearing <hi>Limitation</hi> of this <hi>Administration</hi> of the Kingdom of Christ, in his <hi>sitting at the right hand of God.</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>untill; untill I make thine enemies, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, It is confessed, and may be proved by <hi>Instances,</hi> that those <hi>Particles</hi> thus used, are sometimes <hi>exclusive</hi> of all things to the contrary before the time designed in them, but not <hi>assertive</hi> of any such thing afterwards. In that sense no <hi>limitation</hi> of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Kingdom of Christ is here intimated; but only his secure and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reign unto the accomplishment of his work in the subduing of his <hi>Enemies</hi> is asserted. The only time of <hi>Danger</hi> is, whilest there is Opposition; but <hi>this</hi> saith God, I will carry it through unto the end. And this sense is embraced by many, to secure thereby the Promises that are made unto the Lord Christ of the Perpetuity of his Kingdom. So <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Of the increase of his Government there shall be no end, upon the Throne of</hi> David <hi>and his Kingdom, to order it, and to establish it, with judgement and justice, from henceforth even for ever.</hi> His Kingdom shall not be destroyed, <hi>but stand for ever, Dan.</hi> 2.24, it is an <hi>everlasting Kingdom, Chap.</hi> 7.27.</p>
                        <p>Others suppose that this <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of the Kingdom of Christ is not absolutely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of all <hi>Limitation,</hi> but that these two things only are intimated in those <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> and Promises.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That his Kingdom shall not be like the Kingdoms of the earth, <hi>obnoxious to change and mutation,</hi> by intestine divisions, or outward force, or secret decayes, by which means all the <hi>Kingdoms of the earth</hi> have been ruined and brought to nought. In Opposition hereunto, the Kingdom of Christ is asserted to be <hi>perpetual,</hi> as that which <hi>no Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> shall ever prevail against, no means ever impair; which yet hinders not, but that a <hi>day</hi> may be prefixed unto its end.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Continuance of it unto the <hi>total full Accomplishment</hi> of all that is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in it or by it in the Eternal Salvation of all his subjects, and final Destruction of all his Enemies, is in these and the like places foretold; but yet when that <hi>work is done,</hi> that Kingdom and Rule of his may have an <hi>end.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in this sense, the <hi>Term of Limitation</hi> here expressed seems to be expounded by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. <hi>At the end, he shall deliver up the Kingdom unto God the Father.</hi> For although those words may admit of <hi>another Interpretation,</hi> namely, that he shall <hi>give up an account unto the Father</hi> of the accomplishment of the whole work committed unto him as <hi>King of his Church,</hi> which he may do and not cease from hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Kingdom still; yet as they are further interpreted by the Sons coming into a <hi>new subjection</hi> unto the Father, that <hi>God may be all in all,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 28. They seem to imply directly the <hi>ceasing</hi> of his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Though this matter be not indeed without its <hi>Difficulty,</hi> yet the different Opinions about it seem capable of a fair <hi>Reconciliation</hi>; which we shall attempt in the ensuing Proposals.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Lord Christ <hi>as the Son of God</hi> shall unto all Eternity continue in the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and <hi>Natural Dominion</hi> over all Creatures, and they in their dependance upon him, and subjection unto him. He can no more divest himself of <hi>that Dominion</hi> and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than he can cease to be God. Suppose the <hi>being</hi> of any creatures, and that subjection unto him which is the Rise of this Kingdom is <hi>natural</hi> and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensible.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Oeconomical</hi> Kingdom of Christ over the Church, and all things in order

unto the protection and salvation thereof, <hi>the immediate Ends of it</hi> will cease. All his Saints being <hi>saved,</hi> all his Sons brought <hi>unto Glory,</hi> all his Enemies <hi>subdued,</hi> the End of that Rule which consisted in the Guidance and Preservation of the one, in the Restraint and Ruine of the other, must necessarily cease.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Lord Christ shall not so leave his Kingdom at the last day, as that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> should <hi>take upon himself</hi> the Administration of it. Upon the <hi>giving up of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> what ever it be, the Apostle doth not say, the <hi>Father shall Rule, or raign,</hi> as though he should exercise the <hi>same Kingdom</hi>; but that God <hi>shall be all in all</hi>; that is, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son and Holy Ghost without the use or intervention of such <hi>wayes or means</hi> as were in use before, during the full continuance of the <hi>dispensatory Kingdom</hi> of Christ, shall fill and satisfie all his Saints, support and dispose of the remnant Creation.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This <hi>ceasing of the Kingdom of Christ</hi> is no way derogatory unto his Glory, or the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of his Kingdom; no more than his ceasing to <hi>intercede</hi> for his people is to that <hi>perpetuty</hi> of his Priesthood, which he hath by <hi>Oath</hi> confirmed unto him. His <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical</hi> Office also seems to <hi>cease,</hi> when he shall teach his people no more by his Word and Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In three respects the Kingdom of Christ may be said to <hi>abide unto Eternity.</hi> First, In that all his Saints and Angels shall <hi>eternally</hi> adore and worship him on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Glory which he hath received as the <hi>King and Head of the Church,</hi> and be filled with joy in beholding of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.22, 24. Secondly, In that all the Saints shall abide in their state of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion unto God,</hi> through him as their Head; God communicating of his fulness to them, through him; which will be his eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when all his <hi>Enemies</hi> shall be his Footstool. Thirdly, In that as the Righteous Judge of all, he shall to all Eternity continue the <hi>punishment</hi> of his Adversaries.</p>
                        <p>And this is the <hi>last Testimony</hi> insisted on by the Apostle to prove the preheminence of Christ <hi>above Angels,</hi> and consequently <hi>above</hi> all that were used or employed of old in the <hi>Disposition</hi> and Administration of the Law; which was the thing he had undertaken to make good. And therefore in the close of <hi>this Chapter,</hi> having denyed that any of these things are spoken concerning Angels, he shuts up all with a Description of their <hi>Nature</hi> and Office, such as was then known and received among the <hi>Jewes</hi>; before the consideration whereof, we must draw out from what hath been insisted on, some <hi>Observations</hi> for our own Instruction, which are these that follow.</p>
                        <p n="i">I. <hi>The Authority of God the Father in the Exaltation of Jesus Christ as the Head and Mediator of the Church, is greatly to be regarded by Believers. He</hi> sayes unto him, <hi>sit thou at my right hand.</hi> Much of the consolation and security of the Church depends on this consideration.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. <hi>The Exaltation of Christ is the great pledge of the Acceptation of the work of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation performed in the behalf of the Church. Now,</hi> saith God, <hi>sit thou at my right hand</hi>; the Work is done wherein my soul is well pleased.</p>
                        <p n="iii">III. <hi>Christ hath many Enemies unto his Kingdom</hi>; saith God, I will deal with all of them.</p>
                        <p n="iv">IV. <hi>The Kingdom and Rule of Christ is perpetual and abiding, notwithstanding all the Opposition that is made against it.</hi> His Enemies rage indeed, as though they would <hi>pull him</hi> out of his Throne; but altogether in vain; He hath the Faithfulness and Power, the Word and Right hand of God, for the security of his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="v">V. <hi>The end whereunto the Lord Jesus Christ will assuredly bring all his Enemies, let them bluster whilest they please, shall be unto them miserable and shameful, to the Saints joyful, to himself victorious and triumphant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is the <hi>Administration</hi> of the Kingdom of Christ in the world that this Truth principally respects. Great is the <hi>enmity</hi> of this world against it; great the <hi>Opposition</hi> that is and hath alwayes been made unto it: But this will be the assured issue of it, Ruine to the Enemies, Joy to the Saints, Glory to Christ. This is that which is <hi>typed</hi> unto us in the Prophesie of <hi>Gog.</hi> That Prophesie is a Recapitulation of all the <hi>Enmity</hi> that is acted in the world against the interest of Christ. What his Counsel is, the Prophet declares, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.11. <hi>I will go up to the Land of unwalled Villages; I
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50110:242"/>
will go up to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates.</hi> They look upon the Church of Christ as a <hi>feeble people,</hi> that hath no <hi>visible</hi> Power or Defence, and therefore easie to be destroyed; this encourageth them to their work; who or what can deliver them out of their hand? With this Resolution they come upon the <hi>breadth of the earth,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass the <hi>Camp of the Saints, and the beloved City, Rev.</hi> 20.9. They go about their work with Glory and <hi>Terror,</hi> as if they would do it in a day. So they have done in all Ages, so they continue to do to this day; and what is the issue? This <hi>City</hi> which they look on as an <hi>unwalled Town,</hi> no way defensible or tenable, is not yet <hi>taken</hi> by them, nor ever shall be; but there they fall before it, one after another, and their bones lye under the walls of the <hi>City</hi> they oppose. They fall upon the <hi>Mountains of Israel,</hi> and leave a stink behind them, the shame and reproach of their Names unto <hi>Eternity.</hi> Sometimes they seem to have prevailed, and to have done their work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but still the issue is, that they <hi>dye,</hi> or are destroyed and go down to the Pit, and come under the <hi>feet</hi> of Christ, leaving the <hi>City untaken.</hi> Disappointment, shame and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting punishment is their Portion. And they find at last by experience that this <hi>feeble folk</hi> whom they so despise, are <hi>Wise,</hi> and have their Habitation in a Rock. This pledge we have already of the Truth proposed; that all who have formerly risen up in Enmity to the Kingdom of Christ, are dead, gone, perished, <hi>under his feet,</hi> and have left their work undone; as far from Accomplishment as the first day they undertook it; The same shall be the <hi>Lot</hi> of those that <hi>are,</hi> and those that <hi>foll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>w,</hi> to the end of the world. And when they have all done their utmost, then shall the end be; Then shall all their misery be compleated, the Joy of the Saints filled, and the Glory of Christ exalted.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Enemies</hi> themselves; What can be <hi>more shameful</hi> unto them, than to be so <hi>stupid,</hi> as not to learn from the <hi>Experience</hi> of so many <hi>hundred of years</hi> to give over a work wherein never any prospered? <hi>more miserable</hi> than to engage in that design, wherein they must necessarily fall and be ruined? <hi>More woful</hi> than to work out their own Eternal Destruction under the Wrath of Christ, in a business wherein they had no success? And what <hi>profit</hi> is it if for the present they grow a little <hi>rich</hi> with the gain of Oppression, if there be a <hi>Worm</hi> in it that will devour both it and them? What <hi>Advantage</hi> if they drink a little precious blood and find sweetness in it, if it make them <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>swell</hi> and dye. The beloved <hi>City</hi> still abides, and their misery shall never end.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Saints</hi>; what <hi>more joyful</hi> thing can there be, than for them to take a view of these things; to look backwards and see all the <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the earth that have opposed the Kingdom of Christ, lying in shame and misery with their necks under the <hi>footstool of his feet?</hi> There they may see <hi>Pharaoh</hi> lie, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Nero, Domitian, Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> with all their multitudes, and all that have walked in their steps, brought down to the sides of the Pit, in shame and Eternal Misery, for their Opposition to the Kingdom of Christ; There are they fallen and <hi>perished all of them, who laid their sword<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                        </p>
                        <p>And the like Prospect may they take of what is <hi>to come</hi>; They may by faith see <hi>Babylon</hi> fallen, the whole Conspiracy that is in the world against them and their Lord disappointed, and all his <hi>Enemies</hi> that shall arise even to the Consummation of all things, brought to ruine. How may they triumph in a glorious Prospect of this certain and unavoidable Issue of the Opposition that is made to the Kingdom of their Redeemer? And this must be the issue of these things. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. God hath <hi>promised unto the Lord Christ</hi> from the foundation of the world, that so it should be. It was part of his Eternal Covenant and Compact with him, as hath been declared. And after the first promise of breaking the <hi>Serpents head,</hi> and prevailing therein against the <hi>Enmity</hi> of his seed; no season of the Church passed, wherein the promises of the same success and issue were not renewed; and hereunto do the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Psalms</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> bear witness. And hereof it was that <hi>Enoch</hi> the seventh from <hi>Adam</hi> prophesied so expresly unto the <hi>Old world</hi> before the flood, <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 14, 15. other Prophecies and Promises to the same purpose occurr every wherein the Scripture. And this God also in several Ages for the greater pledge of his <hi>veracity,</hi> typed out; as in the Victory of <hi>Abraham</hi> over the <hi>four Kings,</hi> representing the great <hi>Monarchies</hi> of the world; wherein he had a pledge, that he should be Heir of the World in his seed: in the Conquest of <hi>Canaan</hi> the seat and inheritance of the Church by <hi>Joshua</hi>; in the Successes and Victories of <hi>David,</hi> and by many signal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50110:243"/>
given in the Visible ruine of the most potent Opposers of his interest in the world. And it cannot be that this Word of God should be of none effect.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Lord Christ <hi>expects</hi> this Issue and Event of all things, and shall not be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated in his <hi>Expectation.</hi> Having received the Ingagement and <hi>faithful Promises</hi> of his Father, he rests in the foresight of its accomplishment. And thence it is that he bears all the <hi>Affronts</hi> that are put upon him, all the <hi>Opposition</hi> that is made unto him and his Kingdom, with Patience Long-suffering and Forbearance. When we consider the injuries, reproaches, oppressions, persecutions, blasphemies, that he is exposed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in his Wayes, his Servants, his Spirit and Worship, we are ready to admire at his patience (as we ought to do) that he breaks not forth against his enemies as a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming fire.</hi> But he knows the <hi>time and season</hi> that is allotted for the Execution of Vengeance upon them; and nothing of their Pride, Rage, boasting or triumphing against him shall ever provoke him to <hi>anticipate</hi> their ruine; so secure he is of their Destruction in the appointed season, and so certain of their Day that is coming.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. He is himself furnished with <hi>Authority and Power</hi> for the accomplishment of this Work; when and how he pleaseth. He hath not only Assurance of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Concurrence, but is himself also throughly armed and furnished with Power to destroy all his Enemies even in a moment. And he will not fail to put forth his power in the appointed season; he <hi>will bruise them all with a rod of Iron, and dash them in pieces like a Potters vessel.</hi> If all his Enemies should at once combine themselves against him, should the world receive the utmost contribution of craft subtilty and strength that Hell is able to afford unto it, what is it all to stand before the incomprehensible power of Jesus Christ? See <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.16.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. His Glory and Honour require that it should be so: This is a thing that he is very tender in. God hath raised him up, and given him <hi>Glory and Honour,</hi> and care must be taken that it be not lost or impaired. Now if his Enemies should <hi>go free,</hi> if they could by any means <hi>subduct themselves</hi> from under his Power, or be delivered from his Wrath, where would be his Glory, where his Honour? Here they reproach him, blaspheme him, despise him, persecute him, shall they escape and go free? Shall they alwayes prosper? What then would he do to his great name? The Glory of Christ indispensibly requires that there be a <hi>season, a day</hi> appointed for the Eternal Ruine of all his stubborn Adversaries.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. His <hi>Saints</hi> pray that it may be so; and that both upon <hi>his</hi> account and <hi>their own.</hi> Upon <hi>his,</hi> that his Glory which is dearer to them than their lives may be vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and exalted; <hi>their own,</hi> that their Miseries may be ended, that the Blood of their <hi>fellow servants</hi> may be revenged, that the whole Church may be delivered, and all Promises fulfilled. Now he will not disappoint their Prayers, nor frustrate their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations in any thing, much less in those that are of so great importance. He will avenge his Elect, he will avenge them speedily.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. His <hi>Enemies</hi> deserve it unto the utmost; so that as well his Justice as his Glory and Interest and People are concerned in their destruction. In the <hi>most of them</hi> their <hi>Outrage</hi> against him is notorious, and visible in the eyes of men and Angels; in <hi>all of them</hi> there is a cruel, <hi>old,</hi> lasting Enmity and hatred, which he will lay open and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover at the <hi>last day,</hi> that all shall see the Righteousness of his Judgements against them; God hath given him <hi>a Kingdom,</hi> appointed him to <hi>reign</hi>; they declare that he shall not do so, and endeavour their utmost to keep him from his Throne, and that with scorn despight and malice; so that whilest God is Righteous, and the <hi>Scepter</hi> of Christs Kingdom a <hi>Scepter of Righteousness,</hi> themselves call aloud for their own Destruction.</p>

Yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh not of them as <hi>Elect,</hi> nor yet absolutely as <hi>Believers</hi>; but as of <hi>Heirs,</hi> which they obtain by the priviledge of Adoption. This gives them <hi>Heirship</hi> and an interest in the <hi>Family</hi> of God. And the ministery of the <hi>superiour part</hi> of the Family in behalf of the <hi>lower,</hi> respects them as such, that is, as <hi>Adopted,</hi> as Children, as Heirs, as Co-heirs with Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17.

                        <p>It is true, that the ministery of Angels is not always absolutely restrained unto the <hi>Church</hi> or Family of God; they are employed also in the government of the world. So the Angel that was sent unto <hi>Daniel</hi> affirms, <hi>That in the first year of Darius he stood to confirm and strengthen him, Dan.</hi> 11.1. that is, to <hi>assist</hi> him in the weilding of his new
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50110:244"/>
gotten Empire. As also <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 20, 21. he declares how he acted in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Prince of <hi>Persia,</hi> and stirred up the Prince of <hi>Grecia</hi>; that is, how he should do so in the appointed time. And so also doubtless are they employed about other Affairs in the world, from whence much good redounds unto many who yet belong not unto the <hi>Family</hi> of God. But yet two things we may here observe: <hi>First,</hi> That though this <hi>Ministery</hi> of theirs was not <hi>immediately,</hi> yet it was <hi>ultimately</hi> for the Church. For their sakes were those mighty Empires first <hi>raised,</hi> and afterwards <hi>razed</hi> to the ground. And this is that which they consider in their ministery. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10, 11. And thence it appears that the Prince of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the Angel, was not any <hi>Angel of God</hi> but the <hi>King of Persia</hi> himself, who laboured to obstruct the work committed unto him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Apostle treats in this place of that immediate respect which the <hi>ministery of the Angels</hi> had unto the Church, because in that regard alone he carries on his <hi>comparison</hi> between them and the Son, that only being unto his purpose in hand.</p>
                        <p>But it may be objected, that this their <hi>Ministery will not clearly evince their inferiority</hi> and subordination unto Christ, seeing he himself also was <hi>sent,</hi> and that for <hi>the good of them who shall inherit salvation</hi>; and is thence called the <hi>Apostle of our profession.</hi> But the differences between him and them in their being <hi>sent</hi> are so great and manifest, that his <hi>superiority</hi> unto them, and preheminence above them, is not in the least thereby impeached. He was <hi>sent</hi> by his own <hi>voluntary</hi> previous choice and condescension; they are so, in pursuit of the state and condition of their creation. He was <hi>sent</hi> to minister in the <hi>form of a servant,</hi> only for a short season, in the days of his flesh; they continue to be so from the Beginning to the End of the world. He was <hi>sent</hi> unto that great and mighty work of <hi>Mediation</hi> which none was worthy to undertake, none able to go through withall but himself alone, the <hi>only begotten Son of God</hi>; they are <hi>sent</hi> about the ordinary concernments of the Saints. He as the Son; they as servants. He as the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of the whole work of the Redemption and Salvation of the Church; they as <hi>subordinate assistants</hi> in the particular promotion of it. The general Agreement then of his and their being <hi>sent</hi> for the good of the Church, hath so many and so great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the Mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And with this Demonstration the Apostle closeth the Argument he had so long insist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d on.</p>
                        <p>Of the nature of this <hi>Ministery of Angels</hi> for the good of them that shall inherit sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, because it belongs not directly unto the present design of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> and would in the full consideration of it cause a long diversion from the work in hand, I shall not treat, although it be a matter singularly deserving our meditation. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it may suffice us to observe, <hi>That in the government and protection of his Saints here below, both as to the dispensation of Grace and Providence, God is pleased to make use of the Ministery of Angels, wherein much of their Honour and our Safety doth consist.</hi> For a close of the whole, we may only observe the <hi>Way and Manner</hi> whereby the Apostle propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth this doctrine of the Ministery of Angels unto the <hi>Hebrews; Are they not?</hi> saith he; he speaks of it as a matter <hi>well known</hi> unto them, and acknowledged by them. Their Nature, their Dignity, their Office was declared in the Old Testament. Thence were they instructed, that as to their <hi>Nature</hi> they were Spirits; in <hi>Dignity,</hi> Thrones Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers; in <hi>Office,</hi> Ministers unto God, sent out for the good of his Church. And therefore these things the Apostle in sundry places takes for granted, as those that were already known and received in the Church of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 16. This Doctrine then I say was propagated from the <hi>Jews</hi> unto the <hi>Christians.</hi> And from them also came forth much of that <hi>curiosity and superstition</hi> about Angels, which afterwards infected the minds of many in the Christian Church. For after they were forsaken of God, and began to give up themselves unto <hi>vain speculations,</hi> there was not any thing wherein the vanity of their minds did more early manifest it self, than in their imaginations about <hi>Angels,</hi> wherein they exercise themselves unto this day. For to omit their <hi>monstrous figments</hi> about the <hi>Original</hi> of Devils, most of whom they affirm to have been begotten by <hi>Adam</hi> on <hi>Lilith</hi> before God formed <hi>Eve,</hi> and many to have issued from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> severally whilst they lived <hi>separate</hi> an 150 <hi>years</hi> after the death of <hi>Abel,</hi> as later follies; it is certain that some of them began to vent <hi>curiosities about Angels</hi> in the Apostles time, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. and to express their fancies about their Names, Orders, Degrees and Employments. And this they continue yet to do, although they peremptorily deny that they are to be <hi>invocated</hi> or <hi>prayed</hi> unto, wherein they are out-done by others. <hi>Names</hi> they have
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50110:245"/>
invented for them innumerable, and those many of them <hi>uncouth</hi> and insignificant. <hi>Orders</hi> also or Degrees they assign unto them, some four, some five, some seven, some nine, some thirteen, according as it hath seemed good unto this or that <hi>Great Master</hi> among them. From them the <hi>Pseudodionysius</hi> about the <hi>fourth or fifth Century</hi> after Christ, took the occasion and rise of his <hi>operous figment</hi> about the <hi>Celestial Hierarchy,</hi> though he mixed their inventions with many <hi>Peripatetical</hi> and <hi>Pythagorean</hi> notions. <hi>Aristotle</hi> proportioned the number of the <hi>Intelligencies</hi> unto the Spheres of the Heavens, more he granted not. The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Platonicks</hi> asserted all things here below to be influenced by the <hi>Planets</hi> in their Orbs, the <hi>inferiour</hi> receiving a communication of vertue from the higher, and imparting it unto them beneath. So they interpreted the <hi>Exsection</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as that of <hi>Coelum</hi> by <hi>Saturn</hi> to be the interception of their <hi>procreative influence,</hi> that it should not immediately be communicated unto things below but by them. Out of all these fancies did <hi>Dionysius</hi> raise his <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> From the <hi>Jews</hi> he took the Disposition of his Angels into <hi>Orders of Superiority</hi> and Rule; from <hi>Aristotle</hi> their number, placing an Order instead of a <hi>single Intelligence,</hi> to answer what is taught in the Scripture concerning their multitude; and from the <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean Platonicks</hi> the communication of <hi>Light</hi> Knowledge and Illumination from God by the <hi>highest</hi> to the lowest <hi>Series</hi> or Order, and from them to <hi>Men</hi> on earth. And on this foundation, such as it is, are built the Discourses of many Commentators on this place; in their Enquiries, whether Angels of the <hi>Superiour Orders</hi> are <hi>sent</hi> forth to minister for the good of Believers; which is denied by many, though by some later Expositors, as <hi>Estius, Ribera, Tena, A Lapide</hi> granted, and proved not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ado. So hard is it sometimes for men to cast down <hi>sear-crows</hi> of their own setting up.</p>
                        <p>It remaineth only that we close our whose discourses on this Chapter with some <hi>Observations</hi> for our own <hi>use and instruction</hi> from this last Verse; as,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The highest Honour of the most glorious Spirits in Heaven, is to minister unto the Lord in the service whereunto he appoints them.</hi> This is the Office, this the work of Angels; and this is their Honour and Glory. For what greater Honour can a <hi>Creature</hi> be more partaker of, than to be emploied in the service of his <hi>Creator?</hi> What greater glory than to stand in the Presence, and to do the Will of the King of Heaven? If it be an Honour on earth <hi>to stand before Princes,</hi> dying perishing men, and that unto men in nature and kind <hi>equal</hi> unto those before whom they stand, what is it for them, who by nature are at an infinite distance from the Glory of God, to stand before him who lives for ever and ever? And surely it will be unconceivably woful unto poor souls at the last day, to find how they despised in this world a share and interest in that service, which is and ever was the Glory and Honour of Angels.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Such is the love and care of God towards his Saints labouring here below, that he sends the most glorious Attendants on his Throne to minister unto him, in taking care of them.</hi> He who gave his <hi>only Son</hi> for them, will not spare to send his <hi>holy Angels unto them.</hi> Heaven and earth shall be witnesses of his care of them, and the value that he puts upon them.</p>
                        <p>Now this being a matter of so great importance as it is unto the <hi>Churches consolation,</hi> and the Doctrine directly taught in the <hi>Text,</hi> we may a little <hi>farther enquire</hi> into it, in answer unto these two Questions.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>Wherefore God is pleased to use the Ministry of Angels in the dispensation of his care and good will unto the Church, the Heirs of salvation,</hi> seeing he can by an Almighty facility exert all the effects of it by his own immediate Power?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what especial end and purpose doth God make use of the Ministery of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for the good of them that believe?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the <hi>first</hi> of these, the principal account of it is to be resolved into his own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Will Wisdom and Pleasure. Thus are we always to live in an holy Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, when ever we consider any of his works or ways, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 33. Herein are we to <hi>rest,</hi> and to put a stop unto all our enquiries: <hi>So it pleased him, Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 25. And <hi>he giveth no account of his matters, Job</hi> 33. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. This we are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in as the great <hi>Reason</hi> of all God's dispensations and ways, even his own infinite Wisdom and sovereign Pleasure. He alone knows what becomes his own Goodness and Greatness, and of creatures not <hi>one,</hi> but as he is pleased to reveal it. For <hi>can we find out the Almighty unto perfection? can we by searching find out God? Job</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 7. How shall poor <hi>limited finite</hi> creatures come to know what beseems the Infinite Holy One to do, any otherwise but as himself declareth that he hath done it? And then
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50110:245"/>
we know the work is <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>wise,</hi> and such as becometh Infinite Perfection, because he hath done it. Herein then we principally <hi>rest,</hi> as to the meetness and <hi>condecency</hi> of the <hi>ministery</hi> of Angels; God hath appointed it. Whereunto we may adde those other Reasons which the Scripture suggests unto us, as,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. God doth it for the preserving and manifestation of the Glorious <hi>Order</hi> of his Kingdom. God is pleased to rule his Creation as a Supreme Lord and King. Hence there is so often mention made in the Scripture, that he is the <hi>King,</hi> the only <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Lords and King of Kings</hi>; as also of his <hi>Throne,</hi> his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> Dominion, <hi>Reign</hi> and Government. And God doth this, that he might thereby give an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of his <hi>Sovereignty</hi> unto his creatures, and make way thereby for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of his Glory. Now unto a <hi>Kingdom</hi> there are <hi>three things</hi> essential; Rule, Obedience, and Order. In this Kingdom, the Sovereign <hi>Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>e</hi> is in the hand of God alone, the Kingdom or <hi>Monarchy</hi> is his. <hi>Obedience</hi> is the work and duty of the whole Creation, every thing according to its nature capacity and condition. The Glory of both these lies in Order. Hereof there are two parts: first, that which respects the <hi>Being</hi> of the Creatures in their dependance on God: secondly, that which respects their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Operation</hi> in Obedience unto him. God hath in infinite Wisdom endowed the works of his hands with such <hi>various natures,</hi> whereon their uses do depend, as that they are placed thereby in several ranks <hi>series</hi> and Orders, in an useful subserviency unto one another, so far as they are advantaged thereby in their <hi>common</hi> and absolute subjection to himself. This is the <hi>Order</hi> of their <hi>Being</hi>; the <hi>Order</hi> of their <hi>Operation</hi> is such as they are fitted for by their natures, and whereby they set out the Glory of this Kingdom of God. Thus he takes the Angels, being <hi>fitted</hi> thereunto in that place which they hold in the Order of Nature and Being, unto the next and immediate attendance upon the <hi>Throne of his Kingdom.</hi> There they wait upon him, to receive and execute his commands in all the affairs of his Kingdom. So are they every where described in the Scripture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. and 103. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. and else-where. And by this <hi>Ministery of Angels</hi> doth God insinuate unto us the Glory and Order of his Kingdom. His glorious and fiery Throne being attended with <hi>millions</hi> of these <hi>mighty Angels</hi> ready to accomplish his will. And whereas God hath erected <hi>imperium in imperio,</hi> a Kingdom in a Kingdom, like the <hi>wheels within the wheels</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel's Vision</hi>; namely the <hi>Oeconomical Dispensatory</hi> Kingdom of Christ in his <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Kingdom over the whole Creation; and hath annexed thereunto the principal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of his Glory Rule and Dominion, those blessed <hi>Ministers</hi> do principally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Affairs thereof. And thus, though God can govern and dispose of all things, <hi>solo nutu,</hi> by the Almighty immediate <hi>Emanations</hi> of his own Power, yet for the manifestation of the glory of his Kingdom, especially of that Rule which is committed unto the Lord Christ, he useth the <hi>ministery</hi> of his creatures, in that Order which his infinite Wisdom had disposed them unto at the first Creation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God is pleased to do <hi>this to exercise the Obedience of the Angels themselves</hi>; and that upon a three-fold account. First, to keep preserve and rule them <hi>fitly</hi> to their state and condition. Being Creatures, they have a <hi>natural</hi> and necessary <hi>dependance</hi> on God their Creator; and being <hi>Intellectual creatures</hi> they have a <hi>moral dependance</hi> on him according to a Law and Rule, with reference unto the utmost End whereunto they were created. This requires their constant Obedience unto the Will of God, without which they leave and forsake the <hi>Law of their Creation</hi> and Condition, and also deviate from the End for which they were made. Wherefore to exercise them unto and in this their Obedience, God makes use of their <hi>ministery</hi> and service in his Government of the Church. And this they shall continue to do unto the end of the world, when the course of their Obedience being accomplished, they shall be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly satiated with the contemplation of God's infinite Excellencies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him as their Reward. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in them he might give an <hi>Example</hi> of ready Obedience unto the Church. These Angels of God being in their nature <hi>excellent,</hi> and <hi>great</hi> in power, always ready, watchful, and free from all Diversions or Avocations, eminent in Light and Holiness as always <hi>beholding the face of God,</hi> and filled with his Grace, are proposed unto us in their Obedience and readiness to do the Will of God, as an <hi>Example</hi> and pattern which we are to <hi>imitate</hi> unto our utmost, though we are never able perfectly to express. And thence are we directed by our Saviour to pray, that we <hi>may do the will of God on earth, as it is done by them in heaven. Thirdly,</hi> That they themselves may be made partakers of this singular Honour and Glory to serve the <hi>most High God</hi> in his most glorious work; the preservation and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50110:246"/>
salvation of his Church; for that this is their Honour was before declared.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. God emploieth them in an especial manner in this <hi>ministery</hi> for the <hi>good of them that are Heirs of salvation,</hi> to manifest unto them the Greatness and Glory of the work of the gathering, preserving and redemption of his Church, with the value that he puts upon all the fruits of the Death and Concernments of the Mediation of his Son Jesus Christ. For as of themselves they desire to look <hi>particularly</hi> into these things, which in <hi>general</hi> appear so glorious unto them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 12. that their delight in the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Love of God may be more and more encreased; so by God's dealings with his Church, in whose behalf they are employed, they <hi>learn therein the manifold Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and riches of his grace, Ephes.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 10. And thus in all their employment about the <hi>Saints</hi> wherein they are sent out to <hi>minister for their good,</hi> they learn much of the Wisdom and Love of God, and are thereby excited to honour, applaud, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him and praise him. Somewhat of this they shall see in the <hi>least and meanest work</hi> toward any Believer that is committed unto them. And they eternally rejoyce in the over-flowings of the Love and Grace of God, taking care of all the concernments of the poorest and meanest of his servants.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This is done, that God may in an especial manner <hi>give glory and honour unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> thereby. <hi>This is his will, that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh.</hi> 5.23. He hath therefore raised him up, and <hi>given him Honour and Glory</hi>; and in particular exalted him <hi>far above the Angels,</hi> putting them in <hi>subjection</hi> unto him as their Head, Prince, Ruler and Governour, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. Neither is it a <hi>shew of Glory,</hi> or a <hi>titular Kingdom</hi> and Dominion that he hath given to Jesus Christ, but a <hi>real and absolute Sovereignty,</hi> wherein all things subject unto him are at his absolute disposal: and therefore must the <hi>Angels themselves</hi> be at his <hi>service</hi> in the affairs of his Kingdom, and so they acknowledge themselves to be, and the <hi>fellow-servants</hi> of them that keep his testimonie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.9. Now the <hi>Heart</hi> and Love of Jesus Christ is greatly upon that part of his Church and People which are labouring with Sin, Affliction and Persecution here below, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.15. It is then greatly for his <hi>honour and glory</hi> (which in all things the Father aimeth at, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18, 19.) that the <hi>gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>rious Angels</hi> should be employed for the good and in the behalf of all his poor labouring Saints. This honour is done to Jesus Christ in heaven, when all the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of the Throne of God do see that <hi>care</hi> that is taken about the meanest that believe in him.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>The Love, and Care, and Condescension of God unto his Saints</hi> is hereby manifested unto the <hi>Saints</hi> themselves. God emploieth the Angels for their good, that they may know how he careth for them, and be comforted thereby, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.10. The Saints of God have mean and low thoughts of themselves, as it <hi>becomes</hi> them to have. They know and confess that they are <hi>less than all the mercies of God,</hi> and unworthy that he should have any regard of them. Such thoughts as these their mean <hi>terrene</hi> condition, and their <hi>manifold sins</hi> and failings do fill them withall. Of the glorious Angels, their thoughts and apprehensions are <hi>high and honourable.</hi> Their Nature, their State and condition, their Power and Greatness, their Holiness, and Enjoyment of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, do all present them unto their minds under a notion of much <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> and Glory. Hence some weak, superstitious, and curious minds have been drawn to <hi>adore them</hi> with Religious Worship and Adoration; the Saints know suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the <hi>folly</hi> hereof. But yet when they consider that God is pleased to use employ and send out these <hi>glorious spirits</hi> to take <hi>care of them,</hi> to do them good, to watch over them, and round about them, to keep them from evil: this fills them as with an <hi>holy Admiration</hi> of the infinite Love and Condescension of God towards them, so also of the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the Mediation of the <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> who hath brought them into this condition of favour, from both which much spiritual comfort and rejoycing in the Lord doe arise. And for this end also doth God choose to do that <hi>mediately</hi> by the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery</hi> of Angels, which otherwise by an <hi>inconceivable facility</hi> he could do by his own immediate Power.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. A blessed <hi>Entercourse, Society, Communion and Fellowship is hereby maintained and kept up between the several parts of the Family of God</hi>; that of Angels above, and this of Believers below. It hath been formerly declared, how the Angels in Heaven, and all elect Believers were reduced into <hi>one Family,</hi> when God reconciled the <hi>things in heaven and earth</hi> unto himself, and brought them all into subjection unto and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon one common Head <hi>Christ Jesus, Ephes.</hi> 1.10. From hence are Angels and Men reduced into <hi>one Family</hi>; the <hi>Family in heaven and earth</hi>; the Angels by <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi>
                           <pb n="147" facs="tcp:50110:246"/>
Men by <hi>Adoption.</hi> Now it is the will of God, that for the Honour of our Lord Jesus Christ, the immediate Head of this Family, that there should be an <hi>Entercourse</hi> and an helpful communion between the <hi>several parts</hi> of it; for to this end are we brought into the <hi>society of the innumerable company of Angels, Heb.</hi> 12.22. Now because our <hi>Goodness,</hi> our Usefulness, our Helpfulness is confined and limited unto the <hi>Saints that are in the earth, Psal.</hi> 16.3. not extending it self unto God, or any of his <hi>holy ones above,</hi> we cannot help, assist, counsel nor advise the Angels, nor do they in any thing <hi>stand in need of our aid</hi> or assistance. And since the <hi>communication of our minds</hi> unto them by way of Religious Subjection, Adoration, Faith, Trust, Affiance, is absolutely forbidden unto us; it remaineth that this <hi>fellowship and society</hi> must be maintained by the <hi>aid</hi> help and assistance which they are able to afford unto us, and which we <hi>stand in need of.</hi> And on this account doth God <hi>employ</hi> them about the affairs and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Believers, that so a becoming <hi>fellowship</hi> may be kept up in the <hi>Family</hi> of Christ, and an usefulness between the several parts thereof.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. God makes <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>ministery of Angels</hi> in the service of the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>reproach, awe, restrain and torment the Devil.</hi> It is a continual reproach cast upon <hi>Sathan,</hi> when he sees those unto whom he is <hi>like</hi> in Nature, and with whom he was sometimes a <hi>Companion</hi> in Glory, willingly, cheerfully, triumphantly obeying the will of God in the service of Christ, having by his <hi>wickedness</hi> cast out himself from the same honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Employment, and mancipated himself to the vilest services that any part of the <hi>Creation</hi> of God is cast down unto. The whole work of the Angels is a continual <hi>reproach</hi> unto <hi>Sathan,</hi> for his sin and folly. It cries unto him, This might have been <hi>thy work,</hi> this might have been thy condition; the <hi>gnawing</hi> of which consideration is no small part of his torment and present restless vexation. They also put an awe upon him in all his Attempts. He knows well their Power, their Authority, their Commission, and that it is not for him to contend with them. With <hi>one word</hi> they can at any time defeat him: <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, Sathan; the Lord rebuke thee.</hi> And he knows not where he may meet with them in his <hi>Attempts.</hi> And this keeps him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>awe,</hi> and perpetual uncertainties of success in all that he undertakes or goes about. And hereby God also in many things <hi>frustrates</hi> his endeavours, <hi>restrains</hi> his power, and <hi>disappoints</hi> his malice. It is inconceivable what havock he would make of the <hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Estates</hi> of the Saints, did not these <hi>Watchers from the Holy One</hi> disappoint him. And all these things adde to his torment. Much of his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent punishment</hi> consists in the endless workings of Wrath, Envy, Malice, Blood-thirsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Rage; Now as these where ever they are found but in the <hi>least degree</hi> are <hi>tormenting passions,</hi> so where they are all in their height rage and fury, and are not by any considerable vent abated or slacked, what can be worse in hell it self but only the <hi>immediate wrath of God?</hi> But thus is it with <hi>Sathan</hi> from this <hi>ministery of Angels.</hi> He sees the Church and every Member of it, all whom he seeks to devour, <hi>encamped about,</hi> protected and defended by this Heavenly Host, so that he cannot in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure have his will at them; nay, that he cannot touch the <hi>soul</hi> of any one of them, nor cause an <hi>hair of the head</hi> of any one of them to <hi>perish.</hi> This fills him with self-devouring <hi>rage</hi> envy and wrath. And thus doth God by this way accomplish his judgment upon him. And these are <hi>some</hi> of the Reasons which the Scripture intimates unto us, why the Lord is pleased thus to make use of the <hi>ministery of Angels</hi>; which may suffice for an <hi>Answer</hi> to the first <hi>Question</hi> before proposed.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. The second is, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what Ends and Purposes doth God make use of the ministery of Angels, for the good of them that do believe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The thing it self we suppose in both these Questions. It is so directly asserted in the words of the Apostle, and so many instances are given of it <hi>else-where</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that it needs not any especial confirmation. It will also be farther declared in our <hi>annumeration</hi> of the ends and purposes of it ensuing. As,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In general, God doth it to communitate by them the <hi>Effects of his Care and Love</hi> unto the Church by Jesus Christ. This God represented unto <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Vision that he gave him of the <hi>Ladder which stood upon the earth, and whose top reached unto heaven, Gen.</hi> 28.12, 13. For although the <hi>Jews</hi> say somewhat to the purpose, when they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this <hi>Ladder</hi> to have denoted the dependance of all things <hi>here below</hi> on <hi>them above</hi> under the Rule of the Providence of God, yet they say not <hi>all</hi> that was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thereby. Our Saviour tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.52. <hi>That from thence his disciples should see heaven opened, and Angels ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</hi> Plainly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50110:247"/>
unto this Vision of <hi>Jacob.</hi> For those words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>upon the son of man,</hi> cannot denote meerly the <hi>Object</hi> of Angelical ministration, that they should be exercised in their work about his Person, but also that <hi>by him, by means of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation</hi> the Angels <hi>ascend and descend</hi> in the work of ministring unto the Saints. It is true, the great <hi>instance</hi> of their <hi>ministery</hi> was given in and about the Person of Christ as Head of the Church. They declared his <hi>Conception</hi> and <hi>Nativity, Matth.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>Luke</hi> 2 11, 12. They <hi>ministred</hi> unto him after his <hi>temptation, Matth.</hi> 4.11. They <hi>strengthned</hi> him in his <hi>Agony, Luke</hi> 22.43. They were <hi>Witnesses</hi> of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension, Luke</hi> 24.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10, 11. But by him and on his account they perform the <hi>Offices</hi> of their <hi>mission</hi> towards others also, even all the <hi>Heirs of salvation</hi>; but this still upon the account of Christ. They <hi>ascend and descend</hi> on his mediation, <hi>sent</hi> by his Authority, <hi>aiming</hi> at his glory, <hi>doing</hi> his work, <hi>carrying</hi> on his interest, as in the following particulars will appear: For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They are sent in an <hi>extraordinary manner to make Revelations</hi> of the Will of God, about things tending unto the obedience and spiritual advantage of them that do believe. Hereof we have many instances in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> especially in God's dealing with the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the giving of the Law. For although the <hi>Second Person of the Trinity</hi> the Son of God himself did <hi>often appear</hi> unto them, as to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.1, 2. with <hi>chap.</hi> 19.24. and unto <hi>Jacob, chap.</hi> 32.24. whom he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16. yet God also made frequent use of <hi>created Angels</hi> in the revelation and discovery of his Mind and Will unto them, as is evident from many passages in their story. That he used their <hi>ministration</hi> in the <hi>giving of the Law,</hi> we have before abundantly shewed, the Holy Ghost declaring and affirming of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.17, 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.63. The like also he continued to do in the <hi>Visions</hi> of them grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the Prophets that ensued unto the end of that Dispensation, especially unto <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Zechariah.</hi> So also the same was done under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> as to omit others, we have an especial instance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.1. How far God is pleased to continue this <hi>ministration of Angels</hi> unto this day is hard to determine. For as many have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto <hi>Revelations by Angels,</hi> which have been meer <hi>delusions of Sathan,</hi> or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of their own brains: So to say that God doth not, or may not <hi>send his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> unto any of his Saints to communicate his mind unto them, as to some <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of their own duty</hi> according unto his word, or to <hi>fore-shew</hi> unto them somewhat of his own <hi>approaching work,</hi> seems in my judgment to be unwarrantably to <hi>limit the Holy One of Israel.</hi> Howbeit such things in particular are to be duly weighed with sobriety and reverence.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God by them <hi>suggests good motions into the minds of his Saints.</hi> As the devil sets himself on work to <hi>tempt them</hi> unto evil, by <hi>suggestions</hi> suited unto the <hi>principle of sin</hi> within them; so God employs his holy Angels to provoke them to that which is <hi>good,</hi> by suggesting that unto them which is suitable unto the <hi>principle of spiritual life</hi> and grace that is in them. And as it is difficult to discover the <hi>suggestions of Sathan</hi> in most cases from the <hi>workings of our own minds,</hi> and our unbelief in them, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their <hi>connaturalness</hi> one to the other, and partly because his <hi>impressions</hi> are not sensible nor produce any effects but as they <hi>mix themselves</hi> with our own darkness and lusts; so it is <hi>no less difficult</hi> distinctly to take notice of these <hi>Angelical motions</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like account on the other hand. For being suitable unto the <hi>inclinations of that principle of Grace</hi> which is in the hearts of believers, and producing no effect but by them, they are hardly discerned. So that we may have the benefit of many <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical suggestions</hi> of good things, which we our selves take no notice of. And if it be enquired how these <hi>good motions</hi> from Angels are or may be distinguished from the <hi>motions of the holy Ghost,</hi> and his actings in Believers; I answer, that they are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced sundry ways; as, 1. These <hi>Angelical</hi> are <hi>ab extra,</hi> from without; Angels have no <hi>inbeing</hi> in us, no residence in our souls, but work upon us as an <hi>external principle.</hi> whereas the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> abideth with us, and <hi>dwelleth</hi> in us, and works <hi>ab intra,</hi> from within the very principles of our souls and minds. Whence it follows, 2. That these <hi>Angelical motions</hi> consist in occasional impressions on the <hi>mind phancy</hi> and imagination, by advantages taken from outward objects and present disposition of the <hi>mind,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it meet to receive such impressions; and so disposing it to affect the Heart, the Will and the Affections, whereas the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> closeth in his Operations with all the facultie, of the soul, really and immediately exciting every one of them to <hi>gracious actings</hi> according to their nature and quality. Whence also it appears, 3. That <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical motions communicate no strength</hi> power or ability unto men to act do or perform
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50110:247"/>
the <hi>Good</hi> which they guide and direct unto. Only they provoke and stir up men to act and exert the strength which they have, in the duties that they are minded of. But the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in his <hi>motions</hi> doth really communicate spiritual Grace <hi>strength and power</hi> unto the faculties of the soul, enabling them unto a <hi>right perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> of the duties proposed unto them: And 4. Whereas <hi>Angelical impressions</hi> are <hi>transient,</hi> and abide not at all in themselves, but only in the Effects which the Mind <hi>warned</hi> and excited by them doth produce; there is a <hi>constant,</hi> abiding, <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Work</hi> of the Holy Ghost in the hearts of Believers, enabling them to <hi>will and to do, according unto his good pleasure.</hi> And this is a <hi>second part</hi> of the <hi>Ministry of Angels</hi> in particular, the benefit whereof we are oftner made partakers of than perhaps we are aware. And these <hi>motions</hi> which are an <hi>Effect of their Ministry,</hi> the <hi>Sadducees</hi> of old took to be <hi>Angels,</hi> denying all <hi>spiritual subsistences</hi> from whom they should proceed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. God sends forth his Angels unto this Ministry for the good of Believers, to <hi>preserve them from many dangers,</hi> and ruinous casualties, that would otherwise befall them. Much of the Design of <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. is to acquaint us therewithal; for though the <hi>charge</hi> of Angels is expressed only in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. &amp; 12. yet as the Expression there, <hi>of keeping us in all our wayes, that we stumble not,</hi> is comprehensive of all the <hi>Dangers</hi> which we are or may be exposed unto, so the same work of theirs respects all the <hi>evils and casualties</hi> enumerated in the beginning of the <hi>Psalm.</hi> And to this purpose also is it said, that the Angel of the Lord <hi>encampeth about them that fear him,</hi> as they did about <hi>Elisha</hi> of old; namely, to preserve them from the <hi>Dangers</hi> that they are exposed unto. Nor is this impeached by the observations of the <hi>Evils, Troubles, Calamities</hi> and miseries that befall the people of God; for God hath not given his Angels a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to act <hi>ad ultimum virium,</hi> to the utmost of their strength, <hi>viis &amp; modis</hi> for the preservation of his; but only to act according to his <hi>especial Good Pleasure</hi>; and this they alwayes do. Now it is the Will of God, that his Saints should be exercised with various <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>calamities,</hi> for the trial of their Faith and Obedience. But yet in the ordering and management of these <hi>calamitous Accidents</hi> or troubles, they have no less benefit by the <hi>Ministry of Angels,</hi> than they have in respect of those from which they are preserved by them. For inasmuch as they also are designed and ordered for their Good, their <hi>exposing to them</hi> in their seasons, supportment under them during their continuance, and deliverance from them in the appointed time thereof, are all <hi>signal mercies</hi> which they receive by the <hi>Ministry of Angels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. By this <hi>Ministry of Angels,</hi> doth God in particular <hi>preserve us from the suddain and violent incursions of Satan.</hi> Satan in the Scripture is called a <hi>Serpent</hi> from his <hi>subtilty</hi> and lying in wait to do mischief; and a <hi>Lyon,</hi> from his <hi>rage</hi> and fury and spoiling from his lurking places. And as the one, and the other, he continually seeks the <hi>harm, mischief,</hi> and ruine of the whole man; not only of our <hi>souls</hi> in sin and desert of punishment, but of our <hi>bodies</hi> in our lives health and welfare. Hence we find so many in the Gospel troubled with <hi>bodily infirmities</hi> from the assaults and <hi>impressions of Satan.</hi> And what he prevails to do against <hi>any one,</hi> that he is continually attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against all the whole seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Hereunto also belong all those hurtful Terrors, Affrightments and Surprizals, which he endeavoureth by himself and his Agents to cast upon us. Had he his Liberty, he would make our whole Lives to be filled with Disappointments, Horrors, vain Fear and perplexities, if he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther. Now in all these designs it is <hi>more probable</hi> that he is prevented by the <hi>Ministry of Angels.</hi> We find in the first of <hi>Job,</hi> that in all the Devils walks in the earth for the executing of his malice, the Angels still observe him, and are ready to answer him when he comes with his Accusations against the Saints into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord. And hereon depends the safety and security of our lives; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which <hi>Satan</hi> would by all means continually attempt to fill them with Terrors, Vexations, Losses and Troubles. Not one of us should escape him any better than <hi>Job</hi> did, when God for a season suspended his Protection over his Relations Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Enjoyments.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. They are in their Ministry appointed to be <hi>Witnesses</hi> of the Obedience, Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and Worship of the Disciples of Christ; that they may give <hi>Testimony</hi> unto them before God, and in the great Assembly of the last day, so glorifying God for the Grace bestowed upon them, and the assistance afforded unto them. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that the Apostles in their Preaching and Sufferings, were made <hi>a spectacle unto Angels,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. The Holy Angels of God looked on, rejoycing to behold how
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50110:248"/>
gloriously they acquitted themselves in the work and <hi>Ministry</hi> committed unto them. And to this end doth he charge <hi>Timothy before the elect Angels,</hi> to look unto and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge aright the <hi>Work of an Evangelist,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21. because they were appointed of God to be <hi>Witnesses</hi> of his faithfulness and diligence therein. And it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable but he hath respect unto the <hi>presence of Angels</hi> in the assemblies of the Saints for the Worship of God, where he enjoyns <hi>Modesty and Sobriety unto Women</hi> in them on their account, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. And from that particular instance, a general Rule may be drawn, for the Observation of <hi>Comeliness</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> in all our Assemblies; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the presence of these <hi>holy Witnesses</hi> at all our solemn Worship. For Church-Assemblies are the Court, the dwelling place, the Throne of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in them he is in an especial manner attended by these <hi>glorious Ministers</hi> of his presence. And therefore although an holy regard unto God and our Lord Jesus Christ himself be the first and principal <hi>motive</hi> unto a right and holy acquitment of our selves in all our Obedience Sufferings and Worship; yet in subordination thereunto, we may have also respect unto the Angels, as those who are employed by him to be <hi>Witnesses</hi> of our wayes and carriage. Such a respect I mean, as may administer Occasion unto them to glorifie God in Christ on our behalf; that so all the Honour may finally redound unto him alone.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. God useth the <hi>Ministry of Angels,</hi> to <hi>avenge his Elect of their enemies</hi> and Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to render unto them a Recompence and Vengeance even in this world, in the due and appointed season. Thus by an Angel he destroyed the <hi>Army of Sennacherib</hi> when he intended and threatned the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And by an Angel he smote <hi>Herod</hi> in the midst of his pride and persecution, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. And this <hi>Ministry of theirs</hi> is in an especial manner pointed unto in several places of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where the Judgements of God are foretold to be executed on the persecution of the world. And this work they wait for in an holy Admiration of the Patience of God towards many a provoking Generation; and are in a continual readiness to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it unto the uttermost, when they shall receive their <hi>Commission</hi> so to do, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. They carry the <hi>souls departed</hi> into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Lastly, The Ministry of Angels respects the <hi>general Resurrection</hi> and Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Lord Christ is every where described coming to Judgement at the last day, <hi>attended with all his holy and glorious Angels, Matth.</hi> 24.31. <hi>Chap.</hi> 25.31. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>Jude</hi> 14.15. And great shall be their work towards the Elect in that day, when the Lord Christ shall be <hi>admired</hi> even by them, <hi>in all those that do believe.</hi> For although the work of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> like that of the <hi>Creation,</hi> is to be effected by the immediate Operation of Almighty Power, without the interveniency of any <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary finite Agents</hi> limited in their Power and operation; yet many things p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory thereunto, and consequents thereof, shall be committed unto the <hi>Ministry of Angels.</hi> By them are the <hi>signs</hi> and tokens of it to be proclaimed unto the world, to them is the <hi>sounding of the last Trumpet,</hi> and general summons given out unto <hi>all flesh</hi> to appear before Jesus Christ committed, with all the glorious solemnity of the Judgement it self. And as they bear and accompany the departing souls of the Saints into the <hi>receptacles</hi> of their rest in Heaven, so doubtless also shall they accompany them in their <hi>joyful return</hi> unto their beloved old Habitations. By them also will the Lord Christ gather them together from all parts wherein their <hi>redeemed bodies</hi> have been reduced into dust; and so also at length by them bring all the <hi>heirs of salvation</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly into the full Possession of their inheritance.</p>
                        <p>And thus much may suffice to have spoken about the <hi>Ministry of Angels</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Apostle; by all which it farther appears, how neither in their Nature, nor their Office they are any way to be compared with the <hi>Son of God</hi> in his Ministry towards the Church. Some deductions also for our especial Use and Instruction may here be added from what hath been spoken. As,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That we ought to be very <hi>careful to use sobriety</hi> in our Speculations and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about this matter. Herein doth the <hi>Caution</hi> of the Apostle take place in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, that we should be <hi>wise unto sobriety, Rom.</hi> 12.3. and <hi>not to think our selves wise above that which is written.</hi> This some neglecting of old, and endeavouring to <hi>intrude themselves into the things which they had not seen, Col.</hi> 2.18. that is boasting of the <hi>knowledge and acquaintance with Angels,</hi> which they had no ground for, nor any safe Instruction in, fell into Pride, Curiosity, Superstition and Idolatry, as the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50110:248"/>
Apostle in that place declareth. And almost in all Ages of the Church, men have failed on this account. The Curiosity of the <hi>Jews</hi> we did in some measure before manifest. To them in their Imaginations succeeded the <hi>Gnosticks</hi>; whose portentous <hi>Aeones</hi> and <hi>Genealogies</hi> of inferiour Deities, recounted by <hi>Irenaeus, Origen, Tertullian, Epiphanius</hi> and others of the Antients, were nothing but wicked and foolish Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations about Angels. Unto them succeeded those about the beginning of the <hi>fourth Century</hi>; who flatly <hi>Worshipped Angels,</hi> and had <hi>Conventicles,</hi> or private meetings for that purpose, who are expresly condemned in the thirty fifth Canon of the <hi>Councel of Laodicea, An.</hi> 364. in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; wherein they plainly adjudge, that practice to be <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Apostasie</hi> from Jesus Christ. After these, about the end of the fourth, or beginning of the fifth <hi>Century,</hi> He vented his curious spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations about their <hi>Hierarchy Orders</hi> and <hi>Operations,</hi> who personated <hi>Dionysius the Areopagite,</hi> of whom we spake before. From them all did that sink of Idolatry Superstition and Heresies the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> derive her present Speculations, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Invocation</hi> of Angels. But as these things are all of them without, besides and against the Word in general, so they are in particular expresly <hi>prejudged</hi> and condemned by the Apostle in the place to the <hi>Colossians</hi> before mentioned: And of such kind of needless, useless, unprofitable, dangerous <hi>Speculations</hi> we are to beware; and many of them I could in particular recite, but that I would not teach them unto <hi>any,</hi> by condemning them before <hi>all</hi>; but yet,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Danger should not deter us from Duty.</hi> Because some have miscarried in this matter, we ought not therefore wholly to <hi>neglect</hi> it; there being so great a concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the glory of God, and our own good enwrapped therein. Had others erred or wandred indeed, because they had neither <hi>Way</hi> to walk in, or Guide to attend unto, it had been sufficient to restrain us from <hi>attempting</hi> any thing in this matter: but whereas it is evident, that they wilfully neglected the <hi>Way,</hi> or pressed farther than the paths of it lead them, and despised their Guide, following their <hi>own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi> instead thereof, shall others be discouraged in their Duty, whereas they may avoid their miscarriages? <hi>Wary</hi> indeed this may and ought to make us in our <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,</hi> but not <hi>neglective</hi> of our <hi>duties.</hi> We have the Word of God for our Way and Guide; if we go not <hi>besides it,</hi> if we go not <hi>beyond it,</hi> we are as safe when we treat of <hi>Angels,</hi> as if we treated of <hi>Worms.</hi> We have seen in part of what signal use their <hi>Ministry</hi> is as unto our good, and the glory of Jesus Christ. And it is pride to the height, not to enquire after <hi>what may be known,</hi> because there are many things that we may not know nor comprehend. If that take place it will debar us from all search into the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Gospel. For upon our utmost Attainments we know but in part. Gods Revelation is the Object of our knowledge. So far as that is made and given, so far we may enquire and learn. Besides it is the height of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude</hi> not to search after what may be known of this great Priviledge and Mercy whereof we are made partakers in the Ministry of Angels. God hath neither appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor revealed it for nothing. He expects a reverence of Praise and Glory for it: and how can we bless him for it, when we know nothing of it? This <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi> then of Angels is that which with sobriety we are in a way of Duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Let us on this account <hi>glorifie God and be thankful.</hi> Great is the Priviledge, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold are the Blessings and Benefits that we are made partakers of by this <hi>Ministry of Angels.</hi> Some of them have been before recounted. What shall we render for them, and to whom? Shall we go and <hi>bow our selves down to the Angels</hi> themselves, and pay our homage of Obedience unto them? They all cry out with one accord, <hi>see you do it not, we are your fellow servants</hi>: What shall we then do? Why say they, <hi>Worship God</hi>: Glorifie and praise <hi>him,</hi> who is the God of all Angels; who sends them, who employes them, unto whom they Minister in all that they do for us. <hi>Let us bless God I say for the Ministry of Angels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, these words afford us other Instructions, which I shall only name, and put a close unto our Discourses on this Chapter: as,</p>

admitted a real impeachment of the Consolation of Believers, so a great inducement unto Superstition and Idolatry.</hi> The further evidencing of this truth, I remit unto what hath been already delivered about the Ministry of Angels in general.</p>
                        <p n="iv">IV. <hi>Believers obtain Heaven by inheritance, and free gift of their Father, and not by any merit of their own.</hi> Heirs among men claim their inheritance <hi>jure nascendi,</hi> because they are born unto it, not because they deserve it better than others. Believers look for theirs <hi>jure adoptionis,</hi> by right of Adoption, whereby they become Sons, Heirs of God, and Co-heirs with Jesus Christ.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Second <hi>Chapter</hi> the Apostle declares his <hi>Design,</hi> and what his <hi>especial</hi> Aim was, with respect unto them to whom he wrote. It was not meerly their <hi>Instruction,</hi> or the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of their Minds and Judgements that he intended; though that also was in his eye, and necessary unto his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Purpose. They had by their <hi>Instability</hi> and fainting in Trials administred Occasion unto him of other Discourse. Besides, he foresaw that they had great <hi>Difficulties</hi> and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to contend withal; and was <hi>jealous</hi> lest they should miscarry under them; as he also was over <hi>other Professors,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34. His principal <hi>End</hi> therefore in this whole <hi>Epistle</hi> (as hath been declared) was to prevail with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> unto <hi>Stedfastness</hi> in the faith of the Gospel, and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi> in attendance unto all those Wayes and Means whereby they might be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>Foundation</hi> of his Exhortations unto this Purpose, he layes in the <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Excellency</hi> of the Author of the Gospel. Hence just and cogent Inferences unto <hi>constancy</hi> in the Profession of his Doctrine, and Obedience unto him, both <hi>absolutely</hi> and in respect of the Competition set up against it by <hi>Mosaical Institutions,</hi> do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flow. And these Considerations doth the Apostle divide into several parts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing in <hi>great Wisdom</hi> between the handling of them, those <hi>Exhortations</hi> which pressed towards his especial End before mentioned. And this course he proceeds in for several Reasons. For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> He minds them and us in general, that in handling of the Doctrines of the Gospel concerning the Person and Offices of Jesus Christ, we should not satisfie our selves in a bare <hi>Notional Speculation</hi> of them; but endeavour to get our Hearts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by them unto <hi>Faith, Love, Obedience</hi> and <hi>Stedfastness</hi> in our Profession. This doth he immediately apply them unto. Instances unto this purpose doth he give us in this <hi>Chapter</hi> upon his foregoing Declaration of the Excellencies of Christ, and the Glory of his Kingdom; that so his Hearers might not be <hi>barren and unfruitful in the knowledge of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in particular, he had as it were so <hi>overwhelmed</hi> them with that flood of Divine Testimonies which he had powred out in the <hi>Beginning of his Epistle,</hi> and that heavenly glorious Declaration which he had made of the <hi>Person of the Messiah,</hi> that he thought it needful to give them time to consider what was the <hi>Tendency</hi> of that <hi>sublime Discourse,</hi> and what was their especial concernment therein.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Apostle interposeth his <hi>Exhortation</hi> in this place, as to be an <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of what was before delivered, so to lead them on thereby unto the <hi>Consideration</hi> of Arguments of another nature, (though of the same use and tendency) taken from the <hi>Sacerdotal or Priestly Office of Christ,</hi> and the Works or effects thereof. And herein doth a great part of the <hi>Apostolical Wisdom,</hi> in the various Intertexture of Doctrines and Exhortations in this Epistle consist; that as every <hi>Exhortation</hi> flows naturally from
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50110:250"/>
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that doth precede it; so alwayes the principal matter of it <hi>leads</hi> directly unto some other <hi>Doctrinal Argument,</hi> which he intends nextly to insist upon. And this we shall see evidenced in the <hi>Transition</hi> that he makes from the Exhortation laid down in the <hi>beginning of this Chapter,</hi> unto the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Office of Christ, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</p>
                     <p>The first Verses then of this <hi>Chapter</hi> are purely <hi>Paraenetical,</hi> or <hi>Hortatory,</hi> with a mixture of some Considerations serving to make the Exhortation <hi>weighty</hi> and cogent.</p>

And this the <hi>meaning of the word</hi> agrees unto, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we take it <hi>absolutely,</hi> (for so, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> observes, it may be taken, though of it self it be of <hi>another</hi> form) or <hi>comparatively,</hi> in which <hi>form</hi> it is. Take it <hi>absolutely,</hi> and the Apostle informs them that they have <hi>abundant cause</hi> to attend unto the things <hi>spoken or heard,</hi> because of <hi>him</hi> that spake them; for concerning him alone came that Voice from the excellent glory, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him.</hi> So also in the other sense, the Apostle is not comparing the <hi>manner</hi> of their attending unto the Doctrine of the Law, (which certainly they ought to have done with all diligence) and their attendance unto the Gospel, but shews the <hi>reasons</hi> which they had to attend unto the one and the other, as the <hi>following verses</hi> clearly manifest. This then may be that which the Apostle intimates in this word, namely that they had more <hi>abundant cause</hi> and a more <hi>excellent reason</hi> for their <hi>attending</hi> unto the Doctrine of the Gospel, than they had unto that of the Law; on this account that <hi>he</hi> by whom the Gospel was immediately preached unto us, was the <hi>Son of God</hi> himself.

The effect of which attention is expressed by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17.

This sense of the word is embraced by <hi>few Expositors,</hi> yet hath it great countenance given unto it by the ensuing discourse, <hi>verse</hi> 2, and 3. and for that reason is not unworthy our consideration. For the design of the Apostle in <hi>those verses</hi> is to prove, that they shall <hi>deservedly and assuredly perish</hi> who should neglect the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50110:251"/>
Gospel. And the following particles, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>But the truth is,<note place="margin">

                           </gap> prefixed will not be well reconciled unto this sense and interpretation; unless we should suppose it to be <hi>redundant</hi> and insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative, and so <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <hi>absolutely, that we fall not.</hi> But there is no just reason to render that word so useless. Allow it therefore <hi>significative,</hi> and it may have a double sense; 1. To denote an <hi>uncertain time; quando, aliquando,</hi> at any time. 2. A <hi>conditional event; fortè, ne fortè,</hi> lest it should happen. In neither of these senses will it allow the words to be expounded of the <hi>Punishment</hi> that shall befall Unbelievers, which is most certain both as to the <hi>Time,</hi> and the <hi>Event.</hi> Neither doth the Apostle in the next Verses threaten them that neglect the Gospel, that at <hi>some time or other they may perish</hi>; but lets them know that their <hi>destruction is certain,</hi> and that from the Lord.</p>
                        <p>It is then our <hi>sinful losing of the Word</hi> and the benefits thereof which the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth. And in the <hi>next verses</hi> he doth not proceed to prove what he had asserted in <hi>this verse,</hi> but goes on to other Arguments to the same purpose, taken from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable event of our neglect of the Word, and losing the benefits thereof. The especial reason therefore why the Apostle thus expresseth our <hi>losing of the doctrine of the Gospel</hi> by want of diligent attendance unto it, is to be enquired after. Generally the expression is looked on as an allusion <hi>unto leaking vessels,</hi> which suffer the water that is poured into them one way, to run out many. As he speaks in the <hi>Comedian,</hi> who denied that he could keep secret some things if they were communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. <hi>Plenus rimarum sum, huc atque illuc effluo: I am full of chinks, and flow out on every side.</hi> And the word relates unto the <hi>persons,</hi> not to the <hi>things,</hi> because it contains a <hi>crime.</hi> It is <hi>our duty</hi> to retain the word which we have heard; and therefore it is not said that the <hi>Word flows out,</hi> but that we as it were <hi>pour it out.</hi> And this crime is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted by the addition of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> to <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. For as the <hi>simple Verb</hi> denotes the <hi>passing away</hi> of any thing as <hi>water,</hi> whether it deserve to be retained or no; so the <hi>compound</hi> doth the <hi>losing</hi> of that perversly which we ought to have retained.</p>
                        <p>But we may yet enquire a little farther into the reason and nature of the <hi>Allegory.</hi> The Word or <hi>Doctrine of the Scripture</hi> is compared to <hi>showers</hi> and <hi>rain; Deut.</hi> 32.2. <hi>My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, as the showers upon the grass.</hi> Hence the same word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> signifies a <hi>Teacher,</hi> and <hi>Rain</hi>; so that Translators do often doubt of its special sense, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.7. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>the rain filleth the pools,</hi> as in our Translation; others, as <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> render them, <hi>Benedictionibus operietur docens, The Teacher shall be covered with blessings</hi>; both the words being ambiguous. So also <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.20. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which we translate <hi>thy Teachers,</hi> is by others rendred thy <hi>showers</hi> or rain. So those words, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.23. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which our Translators render in the Text, <hi>He hath given you the former rain moderately</hi>; in the <hi>Margin</hi> they render, <hi>a Teacher of righteousness.</hi> And the like ambiguity is in other places. And there is an <hi>elegant metaphor</hi> in the word. For as the <hi>drops of rain</hi> falling on the earth do water it and make it fruitful, whilst it takes no notice of it, so doth the Doctrine of the Word insensibly make <hi>fruitful</hi> unto God the souls of men, upon whom it doth descend. And in respect unto the Word of the Gospel it is, that the Lord Christ is said to <hi>come down as the showers on the mowen grass, Psal,</hi> 72. So the Apostle calls the preaching of the Gospel unto men, the <hi>watering of them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7. And compares them unto whom it is preached unto <hi>the earth that drinketh in the rain, Heb.</hi> 6.7. In pursuit of this <hi>Metaphor</hi> it is, that men are said to <hi>pour out</hi> the Word preached unto them, when by their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence they lose all the benefits thereof. So when our Saviour had compared the <hi>same Word</hi> unto <hi>seed,</hi> he sets out mens falling from it by all the ways and means whereby <hi>seed cast into the earth</hi> may be lost, or become unprofitable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. And as he shews that there are various ways and means whereby the seed that is sown may be lost and perish, so there are many times and seasons, ways and means, wherein and whereby we may <hi>lose</hi> and pour out the Water or Rain of the Word which we have received. And these the Apostle regards in that expression, <hi>lest at any time.</hi>

The profession of most of the world is a meer <hi>not renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the Gospel</hi> in words, whilst in their hearts and lives they deny the power of it every day. A <hi>saving profession</hi> is that which expresseth the efficacy of the Word unto salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. This will never be the effect of a lifeless attendance unto the Word. And therefore we shall <hi>first</hi> consider what is required unto the <hi>giving beed</hi> to the Gospel here commended unto us; and there are in it (amongst others) the things that follow.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A due <hi>valuation</hi> of the grace tendred in it, and of the Word it self on that account. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> denotes such an <hi>attendance</hi> unto any thing, as proceeds from an estimation and valuation of it <hi>answerable</hi> unto its worth. If we have not such <hi>thoughts</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, we can never <hi>attend</hi> unto it as we ought. And if we consider it not as that wherein our <hi>chief concernment</hi> lies, we consider it not as we ought at all. The <hi>field</hi> wherein is the <hi>Pearl of price</hi> is so to be heeded, as to be <hi>valued</hi> above all other Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions whatsoever, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.45, 46. They who <hi>esteemed</hi> not the <hi>Marriage-feast of the King</hi> above all Avocations and worldly Occasions, were shut out as unworthy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.7. If the Gospel be not <hi>more</hi> unto us than all the world besides, we shall never continue in an <hi>useful</hi> profession of it. Fathers and Mothers, Brothers and Sisters, Wives and Children, must all be <hi>despised</hi> in comparison of it, and competition with it. When men hear the Word, as that which <hi>puts it self</hi> upon them, whose attendance unto they cannot decline without present or future inconveniencies, without considering that all the <hi>concernments</hi> of their souls lie bound up in it, they will easily be won ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to neglect it. According as our <hi>esteem and valuation</hi> of it is, so is our heeding of it, and attendance unto it, and no otherwise. Hearkning unto the Word as unto a <hi>song of him that hath a pleasant voice,</hi> which may please or satisfie for the present, is that which profits not men, and which God abhors, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.34. If the <hi>ministration</hi> of the Gospel be not looked on as that which is full of glory, it will never be attended unto. This the Apostle presseth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8, 9. Constant high thoughts then of the necessity, worth, glory and excellency of the Gospel, as on other accounts, so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the <hi>Author</hi> of it, and the grace dispensed in it, is the first step in that <hi>diligent heeding</hi> of it which is required of us. Want of this was that which ruined many of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to whom the Apostle wrote. And without it we shall never keep our faith <hi>firm unto the End.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Diligent study of it,</hi> and searching into the mind of God in it, that so we may grow wise in the mysteries thereof, is <hi>another part</hi> of this Duty. The Gospel is the <hi>wisdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. In it are laid up all the <hi>stores and treasures of that wisdom of God,</hi> which ever any of the sons of men shall come to an acquaintance with in this world, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2, 3. And this <hi>wisdom</hi> is to be sought for <hi>as silver,</hi> and <hi>to be searched after as hid treasures, Prov.</hi> 2.4. that is, with pains and diligence like unto that of those who are employed in that enquiry. Men with indesatigable pains and danger pierce into the <hi>bowels of the earth,</hi> in the search of those hid treasures that are wrapt up in the vast womb of it. <hi>Silver</hi> and treasures are not gathered by every lazie passenger on the <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> of the earth; they must <hi>dig</hi> seek and search who intend to be made partakers of them, and they do so accordingly: And so must we do for these treasures of heavenly wisdom. The mystery of the grace of the Gospel is <hi>great and deep,</hi> such as the <hi>Angels desire to bow down and look into,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. which the <hi>Prophets of old,</hi> notwithstanding the advantage of their own especial Revelations, <hi>enquired diligently after, verse</hi> 11. Whereas now if any pretend, though falsly, to a <hi>Revelation,</hi> they have immediately done with the Word, as that which by the deceit of their imaginations they think <hi>beneath</hi> them, when indeed it is only <hi>distant</hi> from them, and is <hi>really above</hi> them. As if a man should stand on <hi>tip-toe</hi> on a <hi>mole-hill,</hi> and despise the <hi>Sun</hi> appearing newly above the <hi>Horizon</hi> as one beneath him. Diligent <hi>sedulous searching</hi> into the Word belongs unto this <hi>heeding of it, Psal.</hi> 1.1. Or a labouring by all appointed means to become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, wise in the mystery of it, and skilled in its doctrine. Without
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50110:252"/>
this, no man will <hi>hold fast his profession.</hi> Nor doth any man <hi>neglect</hi> the Gospel, but he that <hi>knows it</hi> not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. This is the great principle of <hi>Apostasie</hi> in the world, men have <hi>owned</hi> the Gospel but never <hi>knew what it was,</hi> and therefore <hi>leave</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it <hi>foolishly,</hi> as they <hi>took</hi> it up <hi>lightly.</hi> Studying of the Word is the security of our faith.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Mixing the Word with faith</hi> is required in this attention. See <hi>chap.</hi> 4.2. As good not hear as not believe. Believing is the end of hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.11. And therefore <hi>Lydia's faith</hi> is called her attention, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. This is the <hi>life of heeding the Word,</hi> without which all other exercise about it is but a <hi>dead carcase.</hi> To hear and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is in <hi>spiritual life,</hi> what to <hi>see meat</hi> and <hi>not to eat</hi> is in the <hi>natural</hi>; it will <hi>please</hi> the fancy, but will never <hi>nourish</hi> the soul. Faith alone <hi>realizeth</hi> the things spoken unto the heart, and gives them subsistence in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. without which, as to us, they flow up and down in loose and <hi>uncertain</hi> notions. This then is the principal part of our duty in <hi>heeding the things spoken,</hi> for it gives entrance to them into the soul, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they are <hi>poured</hi> upon it as water upon a stick that is fully dry.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Labouring to express the Word received in a conformity of heart and life unto it,</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part of this <hi>Attention.</hi> This is the next proper end of <hi>our hearing.</hi> And to do a thing appointed unto an <hi>End,</hi> without aiming at that <hi>End,</hi> is no better than the not doing it at all, in some cases much worse. The Apostle says of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they were <hi>cast into the mould of the doctrine of the Gospel, chap.</hi> 6.13. It left upon their hearts an impression of its own <hi>likeness,</hi> or produced in them the <hi>express image</hi> of that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Purity and Wisdom which it revealeth. This is to <hi>behold with open face the glory of the Lord in a glass, and to be changed into the same image,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. that is, the <hi>image</hi> of the Lord Christ, manifested unto us and reflected upon us by and in <hi>the glass of the Gospel.</hi> When the heart of the hearer is quickned, enlivened, spirited with Gospel truths, and by them is moulded and fashioned into their likeness, and expresseth that <hi>likeness</hi> in its fruits, or a <hi>Conversation becoming the Gospel,</hi> then is the Word attended unto in a right manner. This will secure the Word a station in our hearts, and give it a <hi>permanent</hi> abode in us. This is the <hi>Indwelling of the Word,</hi> whereof there are many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and we ought to aim that it should be <hi>plentiful.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Watchfulness against all opposition</hi> that is made either against the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> of the Word in us, belongs also unto this duty. And as these <hi>Oppositions</hi> are many, so ought this <hi>Watchfulness</hi> to be great and diligent. And these things have we added for the further Explication of the <hi>Duty</hi> that is pressed on us by the Apostle; the necessity whereof, for the preservation of the truth in our hearts and minds, will further appear in the ensuing Observation.</p>

And this the experience of all Times and Ages confirmeth. Yea, few there are at any time who keep the <hi>Word heard</hi> as they ought. We may briefly name the <hi>Seasons</hi> wherein, and the <hi>Ways</hi> whereby the hearts and minds of men are made as <hi>leaking vessels,</hi> to <hi>pour out</hi> and lose the Word that they have heard.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Some <hi>lose</hi> it in a time of Peace and Prosperity. That is a season which <hi>slays the foolish. Jesurun</hi> waxes sat and kicks.

They feed their lusts high, until they loath the Word. <hi>Quails</hi> often make a <hi>lean soul.</hi> A <hi>prosperous outward estate</hi> hath ruined many a Conviction from the Word, yea and <hi>weakened</hi> faith and obedience in many of the Saints themselves.

And he doth it that his <hi>own</hi> thereby may be made conformable unto their Head Jesus Christ, who had his especial <hi>hour of temptation.</hi> Now in such a season temptation worketh <hi>variously,</hi> according as men are exposed unto it, or as God seeth meet that they should be tried by it. Every thing that such days abound withall shall have in it the force of a temptation. And the usual effect of this work is, that it brings <hi>Professors</hi> into a <hi>slumber, Matth,</hi> 25.5. In this state, many utterly <hi>lose the Word.</hi> They have been cast into a <hi>negligent slumber</hi> by the secret power and efficacy of <hi>temptation</hi>; and when they <hi>awake</hi> and look about them, the whole power of the Word is lost and departed from them. With reference unto these and the <hi>like seasons</hi> it is, that the Apostle gives us this caution, to take heed <hi>lest at any time</hi> the word which we have heard <hi>do slip out.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>means</hi> also whereby this wretched effect is produced are various, yea innumerable: some of them only I shall mention, whereunto the rest may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. As, 1. <hi>Love of this present world.</hi> This made <hi>Demas a leaking vessel,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. and choaks one <hi>fourth part</hi> of the seed in the Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. Many might have been <hi>rich</hi> in grace, had they not made it their end and business to be <hi>rich</hi> in this world, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. But this is <hi>too well known,</hi> as well as <hi>too little regarded.</hi> 2. <hi>Love of sin.</hi> A secret lust cherished in the heart will make it <hi>plenum remarum, full of chinks,</hi> that it will never retain the showers of the Word; and it will assuredly open them as fast as convictions stop them. 3. <hi>False Doctrines,</hi> Errors, Heresies, false Worship, Superstition and Idolatries will do the same. I place these things together, as those which work in the same kind upon the Curiosity Vanity and Darkness of the minds of men. These <hi>break the vessel,</hi> and at <hi>once</hi> pour out all the benefits of the Word that ever were received. And many the like instances might be given.</p>
                        <p>And this gives us the reason of the <hi>necessity</hi> of that <hi>heeding</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore insisted on. Without it, at one time or other, by one means or other, we shall <hi>lose</hi> all the design of the Word upon our souls. That alone will preserve us, and carrie us through the course and difficulties of our Profession. The <hi>Duty</hi> mentioned then is of no less concernment unto us than our souls, for without it we perish. Let us not deceive our selves, <hi>a slothful negligent hearing of the Word</hi> will bring no man to life. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands we have to <hi>watch, pray, strive, labour</hi> and <hi>fight,</hi> are not in vain. The warnings given us of the Opposition that is made to our faith, by indwelling sin Sathan and the world, are not left on <hi>record</hi> for nothing: no more are the sad examples which we have of many, who beginning a good <hi>Profession</hi> have utterly turned aside to sin and folly.</p>
                        <p>All these things, I say, teach us the <hi>necessity of the Duty</hi> which the Apostle enjoyneth, and which we have explained.</p>

                           </note>III. <hi>The Word heard is not lost without the great sin as well as the inevitable ruine of the souls of men.</hi> Lost it is when it is not <hi>mixed with faith,</hi> when we receive it not in <hi>good and honest hearts,</hi> when the <hi>end</hi> of it is not accomplished in us, and towards us. And this befalls us not without our sin, and <hi>woful neglect of duty.</hi> The Word of its own nature is apt to <hi>abide,</hi> to incorporate it self with us, and to take root: but we cast it out, we <hi>pour it forth</hi> from us.

                        <p n="iv">IV. <hi>It is in the nature of the Word of the Gospel to water barren hearts, and to make them fruitful unto God.</hi> Hence, as was shewed, was it compared to <hi>Water, Dews</hi> and <hi>Rain,</hi> which is the foundation of the <hi>Metaphorical</hi> expression here used.

                              </note> is a powerful motive unto that diligent attendance unto it, which we have before described.</hi> This is the inference that the Apostle makes from the Proposition that he had made of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Son of God. <hi>Therefore.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this is that which in the greatest part of the ensuing <hi>Chapter</hi> he doth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue. This is that which God declares, that he might so justly expect and look for, namely that when he sent his <hi>Son to the Vineyard,</hi> he should be regarded and attended unto.</p>
                        <p>And this is <hi>most reasonable</hi> upon many accounts.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because of the <hi>Authority</hi> wherewith he spake the word. Others spake and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their message <hi>as servants,</hi> he as the <hi>Lord over his own house, chap.</hi> 3.6. The Father himself gave him all his Authority for the revealing of his Mind, and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from heaven, that if any one would have any thing to do with God, they <hi>were to hear him, Matth.</hi> 17.10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. The whole Authority of God was with him, for him did God the <hi>Father seal,</hi> or put the stamp of all his Authority upon him; and he spake accordingly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.29. And therefore he spake both in his <hi>own Name,</hi> and the Name of his Father; so that this <hi>Authority</hi> sprung partly from the Dignity of his Person, for being God and Man, though he <hi>spake on the earth,</hi> yet he who was the Son of man <hi>was in heaven still, Joh.</hi> 3.13. and therefore is said to <hi>speak from heaven, Heb.</hi> 12.21. and coming from heaven was still <hi>above all, Joh.</hi> 3.31. hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power and authority over all: And partly from his Commission that he had from his Father, which, as we said before, gave all Authority into his hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. Being then in himself the Son of God, and being peculiarly designed to reveal the Mind and Will of the Father, (which the Prophet calls his <hi>standing and feeding in the strength of the Lord, in the Majesty of the Name of the Lord his God, Mic.</hi> 5.4.) All the Authority of God over the souls and consciences of men is exerted in this Revelation of the Gospel by him. It cannot then be <hi>neglected</hi> without the contempt of <hi>all the Authority</hi> of God. And this will be a sore aggravation of the sin of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> and <hi>Apostates</hi> at the last day. If we <hi>attend</hi> not unto the word on this account, we shall <hi>suffer</hi> on it. He that despiseth the word despiseth him, and he that despiseth him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth him also who sent him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because of the <hi>Love</hi> that is in it. There is in it the <hi>love of the Father</hi> in sending the Son, for the revealing of himself and his mind unto the children of men. There is also in it the <hi>love of the Son himself,</hi> condescending to teach and instruct the sons of men, who by their own fault were cast into error and darkness. Greater love could not God nor his Eternal Son manifest unto us, than that he should undertake in his own Person to become our Instructer. See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. He that shall consider the bruitish stupidity and blindness of the generality of mankind in the things of God, the miserable fluctuating and endless uncertainties of the <hi>more enquiring</hi> part of them; and withall the greatness of their concernment in being brought unto the knowledge of the truth, cannot but in some measure see the greatness of this <hi>love of Christ</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing unto us the whole counsel of God. Hence his words and speech are said to be <hi>gracious, Luke</hi> 4.22. and <hi>grace to be poured into his lips, Psal.</hi> 45.2. And this is no small motive unto our <hi>attention</hi> unto the word.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>fulness of the Revelation it self</hi> by him made unto us, is of the same importance. He came not to declare a <hi>part</hi> or parcel, but the <hi>whole will of God,</hi> all that we are to know, all that we are to do, all that we are to believe. <hi>In him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, Col.</hi> 2.3. He opened all the dark sentences of the will of God hidden from the foundation of the world. There is in his Doctrine <hi>all wisdom,</hi> all knowledge, as all light is in the Sun, and all water in the Sea; there being nothing of the one or the other in any other thing but by a <hi>communication</hi> from them. Now <hi>if every word of God</hi> be excellent, if every part and parcel of it delivered by any of his servants of old, was to be attended unto on the penalty of extermination out of the number of his people; how much more will our condition be miserable, is our blindness and obstinacy so, if we have not an heart to attend unto this full Revelation of himself and his will.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Because it is <hi>final. Last of all he sent his Son,</hi> and hath spoken unto us by him. Never more in this world will he speak with that kind of speaking. No <hi>new,</hi> no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revelation of God is to be expected in this world, but what is made by Jesus Christ. To this we must attend or we are lost for ever.</p>

                        <p>The design of the Apostle in these three <hi>Verses,</hi> is to confirm and enforce the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Exhortation laid down in the <hi>first</hi>; as that which arose from the Discourse of the former Chapter. The way he proceeds in for this end, is by interposing after his usual manner in this. <hi>Epistle, subservient Motives,</hi> Arguments, and Considerations, tending directly to his principal end, and <hi>connatural</hi> unto the subject treated on. Thus the main Argument wherewith he presseth his preceding Exhortation unto attendance and Obedience unto the Word, is taken <hi>ab incommodo,</hi> or <hi>ab eventu perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oso,</hi> from the <hi>pernitious end and event</hi> of their disobedience thereunto. The chief proof of this is taken from another Argument <hi>à minori,</hi> and that is the confessed Event of <hi>disobedience unto the Law, v.</hi> 2. To confirm and strengthen which reasoning, he gives us a summary <hi>comparison</hi> of the Law and the Gospel; whence it might appear, that if <hi>a disregard unto the Law</hi> was attended with a sure and sore revenge, that much more must and would the Neglect of the Gospel be so. And this comparison on the part of the Gospel, is expressed; (1.) In the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, it is <hi>Great Salvation:</hi> (2.) The <hi>Author</hi> of it; it <hi>was spoken by the Lord</hi>: (3.) The <hi>manner</hi> of its Tradition; <hi>being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed unto us by them that heard them</hi>; and the <hi>Testimony</hi> given to it, and them; by <hi>signs and wonders and distributions of the Holy Ghost</hi>; from all which he infers his purpose, of the <hi>pernitious Event</hi> of disobedience unto it, or disregarding of it. This is the summ of the Apostles Reasoning, which we shall further open as the words present it unto us in the Text.</p>
                        <p>The first thing we meet with in the word; is his <hi>subservient</hi> Argument <hi>à minori, v.</hi> 2. wherein three things occur. (1.) The <hi>Description</hi> that he gives us of the Law which he compares the Gospel withal; it was <hi>the word spoken by Angels.</hi> (2.) An Adjunct of it, which ensued upon its being spoken by them; <hi>it was firm and stedfast.</hi> (3.) The Event of disobedience unto it; <hi>every transgression of it, and stubborn disobedience, had a just recompence of reward.</hi> How from hence he confirms his Assertion of the perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Consequence of <hi>neglecting the Gospel,</hi> we shall see afterwards.</p>
                        <p>The first thing in the words is the <hi>Description of the Law,</hi> by that <hi>Periphrasis</hi>

                        <p>Two things we may observe in this <hi>Periphrasis</hi> of the Law. (1.) That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle principally intends that part of the <hi>Mosaical Dispensation</hi> which was given on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>; and which as such was the <hi>Covenant</hi> between God and that people, as unto the priviledge of the promised Land. (2.) That he fixed on this Description of it, rather than any other, or meerly to have expressed it, by <hi>the Law</hi>; (1.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Ministry of Angels,</hi> in the giving of the Law by <hi>Moses,</hi> was that by which all the prodigious Effects wherewith it was attended, (which kept the people in such a durable Reverence unto it) were wrought. This therefore he mentions, that he might appear not to <hi>undervalue</hi> it, but to speak of it with Reverence unto that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of its Administration which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> even boasted in. (2.) Because having newly insisted on a comparison between Christ and the Angels; his Argument is much strengthened, when it shall be considered, that the Law was the <hi>Word spoken by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> the Gospel was <hi>delivered by the Son,</hi> so far exalted above them. But the manner how this was done, must be a little farther enquired into.</p>
                        <p>That the Law was given by the <hi>Ministry of Angels,</hi> the Jews alwayes confessed, yea and boasted. So saith <hi>Josephus,</hi> one much <hi>antiente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. <hi>We learned the most excellent and most holy constitutions of the Law from God by Angels.</hi> The same was generally acknowledged by them of old. This <hi>Stephen</hi> treating with them, takes for granted, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.53. <hi>You received the Law by the disposition of Angels.</hi> And our Apostle affirms the same, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>It was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator</hi>; a word of the same Original and sense is used in both places, though by ours variously rendered: <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. This then is certain; but the manner of it is yet to be considered.</p>
                        <p>First then, nothing is more unquestionable, than that the Law was given from <hi>God himself.</hi> He was the <hi>Author</hi> of it. This the whole Scripture declares and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims. And it was the impious Abomination of the <hi>Valentinians</hi> and <hi>Marcionites</hi> of old, to ascribe the Original of it unto any other Author.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, He who spake in the name of God on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> was no other than <hi>God himself,</hi> the <hi>second Person</hi> in the Trinity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.17, 18, 19. Him Stephen <hi>calls the Angel, Acts</hi> 7.30, 38. Even the <hi>Angel of the Covenant, the Lord</hi> whom the people sought, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1, 2. Some would have it to be a <hi>Created Angel,</hi> delegated unto that work who thereon took on him the Presence and Name of God, as if he himself had spoken. But this is wholly contrary to the nature of all Ministerial work. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did <hi>Embassador</hi> speak in his own name, as if he were the <hi>King himself</hi> whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he doth represent. The Apostle tells us, that the Preachers of the Gospel were Gods <hi>Embassadors,</hi> and that God by them doth perswade men <hi>to be reconciled in Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. But yet if any on that account, should take on him to <hi>personate God,</hi> and to speak of himself as God, he would be highly <hi>blasphemous.</hi> Nor can this be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined in this place; where not only he that speaks, speaks in the Name of God, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> but also elsewhere it is frequently affirmed, that <hi>Jehovah</hi> himself did give that Law; which is made unto the people an Argument unto Obedience. And the things done on <hi>Sinai</hi> are alwayes ascribed unto God himself.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It remains then to consider, how notwithstanding this, the Law is said to be the <hi>Word spoken by Angels.</hi> It is no where affirmed, that the <hi>Law was given by Angels</hi>; but that the <hi>people received it by the disposition of Angels</hi>; and that it was <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Angels,</hi> and here <hi>spoken by them.</hi> From hence it is evident, that not the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Authoritative giving of the Law,</hi> but the <hi>Ministerial ordering</hi> of things in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation, is that which is ascribed to Angels. They raised the <hi>fire and smoke,</hi> they <hi>shook and rent the rock</hi>; they framed the <hi>sound of the Trumpet</hi>; they effected the <hi>Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Voyces</hi> which conveyed the words of the Law to the ears of the people; and therein proclaimed and published the Law; whereby it became <hi>the Word spoken by Angels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Grotius</hi> on this place contends, that it was a <hi>created Angel</hi> who represented the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50110:255"/>
of God on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>; and in the confirmation of his conjecture, after he hath made use of the imagination before rejected; he adds, <hi>that if the Law had been given out by God in his own person</hi> (as he speaks) <hi>then upon that account, it would have been preferred above the Gospel.</hi> But as the Apostle grants in the first words of his Epistle, that the Law no less than the Gospel was primitively and originally from God; so we say not, that God gave the Law <hi>immediately</hi> without the Ministry of Angels; And the <hi>Comparison</hi> which the Apostle is pursuing, respects not the <hi>first Author</hi> of Law or Gospel, but the principal Ministerial Publishers of them, which of the <hi>one,</hi> was Angels, of the <hi>other,</hi> the Son himself.</p>
                        <p>And in these words lyes the spring of the Apostles Argument; as is manifest in those <hi>Interrogatory Particles,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>This the Apostle layes down, as a thing well known unto the <hi>Hebrews</hi>; namely, that the Law which was delivered unto them by Angels, received such a <hi>Sanction</hi> from God, after it was established as the Covenant between him and the people, that the Transgression of it, so as to disannul the terms and conditions of it, had by Divine Constitution the punishment of <hi>death temporal,</hi> or Excision appointed unto it.

                        </p>
                        <p>There is an <hi>Antithesis</hi> expressed in one branch as we observed before between the Law and the Gospel; namely, that the Law was the <hi>Word spoken by Angels</hi>; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel being <hi>revealed by the Lord himself</hi>: But there are also other differences intimated between them, though expressed only on the part of the Gospel; as that it is in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Effects, <hi>Great Salvation</hi>; that is not absolutely only, but <hi>comparatively</hi> unto the benefit exhibited to their fore Fathers by the Law, as given on Mount <hi>Horeb.</hi> The confirmation also of the Gospel by the <hi>Testimony of God,</hi> is tacitely opposed unto the confirmation of the Law by the like Witness; and from all these considerations doth the Apostle enforce his Argument, proving the <hi>Punishment</hi> that shall befall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel neglecters.</p>
                        <p>In the words as was in part before observed, there occurrs: (1.) The <hi>Subject matter</hi> spoken of; <hi>so great salvation.</hi> (2) A further Description of it; 1.

Secondly, In an immediate <hi>Preparation,</hi> and so it began to be declared in and by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of <hi>John the Baptist; Mark</hi> 1.1, 2. Thirdly, In its open, clear, actual full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; so this work was begun by the Lord himself, and carried on to perfection by those who were appointed and enabled by him thereunto, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17, 18. Thus was it by him declared in his <hi>own person,</hi> as the Law was by Angels.</p>
                        <p>And herein lyes the stress of the Apostles Reasonings, with reference unto what he had before discoursed concerning the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and his Preheminence above them. The great Reason why the <hi>Hebrews</hi> so pertinaciously adhered unto the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Law, was the glorious Publication of it. It was the <hi>word spoken by Angels</hi>; they received it by the <hi>disposition of Angels.</hi> If saith the Apostle, that were a sufficient cause, why the <hi>Law</hi> should be attended unto, and that the <hi>neglect</hi> of it should be so sorely revenged as it was, though in it self but the <hi>Ministry of death</hi> and condemnation; Then consider what is your Duty in reference unto the Gospel, which as it was in its self a <hi>Word of life and great salvation,</hi> so it was spoken, declared, and delivered by the <hi>Lord himself,</hi> whom we have manifested to be so exceedingly exalted above all Angels whatever.</p>

And herein also he prevents an Objection that might arise in the minds of the <hi>Hebrews</hi>; inasmuch as they, at least the greatest part of them, were not acquainted with the <hi>Personal Ministry</hi> of the Lord; they heard not the word spoken by him. For hereunto the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes; that though they <hi>themselves heard him not,</hi> yet the same word which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was not only declared, but <hi>confirmed</hi> unto them, by <hi>those that heard him.</hi> And herein he doth not intend all of them, who at any time heard him teaching; but those whom in an especial manner he made choice of, to employ them in that work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, the <hi>Apostles.</hi> So that this expression, <hi>those that heard him,</hi> is a <hi>Periphrasis of the Apostles,</hi> from that great priviledge of hearing <hi>immediately</hi> all things that our Lord taught in his own person. For neither did the Church of the <hi>Jews hear the Law</hi> as it was pronounced on <hi>Horeb</hi> by Angels, but had it confirmed unto them by the wayes and means of Gods appointment.

What this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is, see <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16. <hi>chap.</hi> 25.46. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.8. The <hi>manner</hi> of ascertaining the <hi>punishment</hi> intimated, is by an <hi>Interrogation, How shall we escape?</hi> wherein three things are intended. 1. A <hi>denial</hi> of any ways or means for escape or deliverance. There is none that can <hi>deliver us,</hi> no way whereby we may escape. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18. And, 2. the <hi>certainty</hi> of the punishment it self, it will as to the event assuredly befall us: And, 3. the <hi>inexpressible greatness</hi> of this unavoidable evil. <hi>How shall escape?</hi> We shall not, there is no way for it, nor ability to bear what we are liable unto, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18.</p>
                        <p>This is the <hi>scope</hi> of the Apostle in these Verses, this the importance of the several things contained in them. His main design and intendment is, to prevail with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> unto a diligent attendance unto the Gospel that was preached unto them; which he urgeth by an argument taken from the <hi>danger,</hi> yea certain ruine that will undoubtedly ensue on the neglect of it; whose Certainty, Unavoidableness, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Righteousness he manifests, by the consideration of the <hi>punishment</hi> assigned unto the transgressions of the Law, which the Gospel on many accounts doth excel.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Observations</hi> for our own instruction which these Verses offer unto us, are these that follow.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Motives unto a due valuation of the Gospel, and perseverance in the prosession of it, taken from the penalties annexed unto the neglect of it, are Evangelical, and of singular use in the preaching of the Word. How shall we escape if we neglect?</hi> This consideration is here managed by the Apostle, and that when he had newly set forth the glory of Christ, and the greatness of the <hi>salvation</hi> tendred in the Gospel, in the most <hi>perswading</hi> and <hi>attractive</hi> manner. Some would <hi>fancy,</hi> that all <hi>comminations</hi> and threatnings do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the Law; as though Jesus Christ had left himself and his Gospel to be <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely despised</hi> by profane and impenitent sinners; but as they will find the contrary to their eternal ruine, so it is the will of Christ that we should let them <hi>know</hi> so, and thereby warn others to take heed of their sins and their plagues.</p>
                        <p>Now these <hi>Motives</hi> from <hi>Comminations</hi> and threatnings I call <hi>Evangelical:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because they are <hi>recorded</hi> in the Gospel: there we are taught them, and by it commanded to make use of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>chap.</hi> 24.50. <hi>chap.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 16. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.8, 9. and in other places innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And to this end are they <hi>recorded,</hi> that they may be <hi>preached</hi> and declared as part of the Gospel. And if the <hi>Dispencers</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> insist not on them, they deal deceitfully with the souls of men, and detain from them the <hi>counsel of God.</hi> And as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50110:258"/>
such persons will find themselves to have as weak and an <hi>enervous</hi> Ministery here, so also that they will have a <hi>sad account</hi> of their <hi>partiality</hi> in the Word to give here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Let not men think themselves more <hi>Evangelical</hi> than the Author of the Gospel, more skilled in the mystery of the <hi>Conversion</hi> and Edification of the souls of men than the Apostles; in a word, more <hi>wise</hi> than God himself, which they must do if they neglect this part of his Ordinance.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because they <hi>become</hi> the Gospel. It is <hi>meet</hi> the Gospel should be armed with <hi>Threatnings,</hi> as well as attended with <hi>Promises</hi>: and that,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. On the part of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, the Author of it. However the world persecuted and despised him whilst he was on the earth, and he threatned not, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. on his own account; however they continue to contemn and blaspheme his Ways, and Salvation, yet he lets them know that he is <hi>armed with power</hi> to revenge their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. And it belongs unto his <hi>Honour</hi> to have it declared unto them. A <hi>Scepter</hi> in a Kingdom without a <hi>Sword,</hi> a <hi>Crown</hi> without a <hi>Rod of Iron,</hi> will quickly be trampled on. Both are therefore given into the hand of Christ, that the Glory and Honour of his Domi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>on may be known, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They become the Gospel on the <hi>part of sinners,</hi> yea, of all to whom the Gospel is preached. And those are of two sorts.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Unbelievers, <hi>Hypocrites, Apostates,</hi> impenitent Neglecters of the great salvation declared in it. It is meet on this account that the Dispensation of the Gospel be attended with <hi>Threatnings</hi> and comminations of punishments. And that,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To keep them here in <hi>awe</hi> and fear, that they may not boldly and openly break out in contempt of Christ. These are his <hi>Arrows</hi> that are sharp in the hearts of his adversaries, whereby he <hi>aws them,</hi> galls them, and in the midst of all their pride makes them to tremble sometimes at their future condition. Christ never suffers them to be so <hi>secure,</hi> but that his terrors in these <hi>Threatnings</hi> visit them ever and anon. And hereby also doth he keep them within some <hi>bounds,</hi> bridles their rage, and overpowers many of them unto some useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the world, with many other blessed ends not now to be insisted on.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That they may be left <hi>inexcusable,</hi> and the Lord Christ be <hi>justified</hi> in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against them at the last day. If they should be <hi>surprized</hi> with <hi>fiery indignation</hi> and everlasting burnings at the last day, how might they plead, that if they had been <hi>warned</hi> of these things, they would have endeavoured to have fled from the wrath to come. And how apt might they be to <hi>repine</hi> against his Justice in the <hi>amazing Greatness</hi> of their destruction. But now by taking order to have the <hi>Penalty of their disobedience</hi> in the threatnings of the Gospel declared unto them, they are left without excuse, and himself is glorified in taking vengeance. He hath told them before-hand plainly what they are to look for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They are so on the part of <hi>Believers</hi> themselves. Even they stand in need to be minded of the <hi>terrour of the Lord</hi>; and what a <hi>fearful thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God; and that even our God is a consuming fire.</hi> And this,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To keep up in their hearts a constant <hi>Reverence</hi> of the Majesty of Jesus Christ, with whom they have to do. The threatning sanction of the Gospel bespeaks the Greatness, Holiness and Terrour of its Author, and insinuates into the hearts of <hi>Believers</hi> thoughts becoming of them. It lets them know that he will be <hi>sanctified in all that draw nigh unto him,</hi> and so calls upon them for a due reverential preparation for the performance of his Worship, and unto all duties wherein they walk before him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28, 29. This <hi>influenceth</hi> them also into a diligent attendance unto every <hi>particular Duty</hi> incumbent on them, as the Apostle declares, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They tend unto their <hi>Consolation</hi> and supportment under all their afflictions and sufferings for the Gospel. This relieves their hearts in all their <hi>sorrows,</hi> when they consider the sore <hi>vengeance</hi> that the Lord Jesus Christ will one day take of all his stubborn adversaries, <hi>who know not God, nor will obey the Gospel,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. For the Lord Jesus is no less faithful in his <hi>Threatnings</hi> than in his <hi>Promises,</hi> and no less able to inflict the one, than
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50110:258"/>
to accomplish the other. And he is glorious unto them therein, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 11, 12, 13.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They give them constant <hi>matter of praise thankfulness,</hi> when they see in them, as in a <hi>Glass</hi> that will neither flatter nor causelesly terrifie, a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of that <hi>wrath which they are delivered from by Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.10. For in this way every <hi>Threatning</hi> of the Gospel proclaims the <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ unto their souls. And when they hear them explained in all their terrour, they can rejoyce in the hope of the glory that shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. And,</p>
                        <p n="4">4. They are needful unto them to <hi>ingenerate that fear</hi> which may give check unto the <hi>remainder of their lusts</hi> and corruptions; with that <hi>security</hi> and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in attending to the Gospel which by their means is apt to grow upon them. To this purpose is the punishment of <hi>despisers and back-sliders</hi> here made use of, and urged by our Apostle. The hearts of Believers are like <hi>Gardens,</hi> wherein there are not only <hi>flowers,</hi> but <hi>weeds</hi> also; and as the former must be <hi>watered</hi> and <hi>cherished,</hi> so the latter must be <hi>curbed</hi> and <hi>nipped.</hi> If nothing but <hi>dews</hi> and <hi>showers</hi> of Promises should fall upon the heart, though they seem to tend to the cherishing of their Graces, yet the <hi>weeds</hi> of corruption will be apt to grow up with them, and in the end to choak them, unless they are nipped and blasted by the severity of the threatnings. And although their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> in the use of means shall be secured from falling under the final execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Comminations,</hi> yet they know there is an infallible connexion signified in them between <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>destruction,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. and that they must avoid the <hi>one,</hi> if they will escape the <hi>other.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Hence they have in a readiness wherewith to <hi>ballance Temptations,</hi> especially such as accompany sufferings for Christ and the Gospel. Great <hi>reasonings</hi> are apt to rise in the hearts of Believers themselves in such a season: and they are byassed by their <hi>infirmities</hi> to attend unto them. <hi>Liberty</hi> would be spared, <hi>Life</hi> would be spared; it is hard to <hi>suffer,</hi> and to <hi>die</hi>: How many have been betrayed by their <hi>fears</hi> at such a season to forsake the Lord Christ and the Gospel? But now in these <hi>Gospel threatnings</hi> we have that in a <hi>readiness,</hi> which we may <hi>oppose</hi> unto all these reasonings and the efficacy of them. Are we afraid of a <hi>man that shall die?</hi> Have we not much more reason to be afraid of the <hi>Living God?</hi> Shall we, to avoid the anger of a Worm, cast our selves into his wrath who is a consuming fire? Shall we, to avoid a little <hi>momentary trouble,</hi> to preserve a perishing life, which a <hi>sickness</hi> may take away the next day, run our selves into eternal ruine? Man <hi>threatens</hi> me if I forsake not the Gospel, but God <hi>threatens</hi> if I do. Man threatens <hi>death temporal,</hi> which yet it may be he shall not have power to inflict; God threatens <hi>death eternal,</hi> which no back-slider in heart shall avoid. On these and the like accounts are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations useful unto <hi>Believers</hi> themselves.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. These declarations of <hi>eternal punishment</hi> unto <hi>Gospel neglecters,</hi> do <hi>become</hi> the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel with respect unto them that are <hi>the Preachers</hi> and dispensers of it, that their mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage be not slighted, nor their persons despised. God would have even <hi>them</hi> to have in a readiness wherewith to <hi>revenge the disobedience</hi> of men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. not with <hi>carnal weapons,</hi> killing and destroying the bodies of men; but by such a <hi>denunciation</hi> of the vengeance that will ensue on their disobedience, as shall undoubtedly take hold upon them, and end in their everlasting ruine. Thus are they armed for the warfare, wherein by the Lord Christ they are engaged; that no may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to <hi>despise</hi> them, or contend with them. They authorized to denounce the <hi>eternal wrath of God</hi> against disobedient sinners; and whomsoever they <hi>bind</hi> under the sentence of it on <hi>earth,</hi> they are <hi>bound</hi> in <hi>heaven</hi> unto the judgment of the Great Day.</p>
                        <p>On these grounds it is that we say, that the <hi>threatnings</hi> and denunciations of future punishments unto all sorts of persons are becoming of the Gospel; and therefore the using of them as <hi>motives</hi> unto the <hi>end</hi> for which they are designed is <hi>Evangelical.</hi> And this will farther appear if we shall yet consider,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That <hi>threatnings</hi> of future <hi>Penalties</hi> on the disobedient, are far more clear and express in the Gospel than in the Law. The <hi>Curse</hi> indeed was threatned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced under the Law; and a pledge and instance of its execution were given in

The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>judgment to come,</hi> the <hi>duration</hi> of the penalties to be inflicted on unbelievers, with such intimations of the <hi>nature</hi> and kind of them as our understandings are able to receive, are fully and frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on in the New Testament, whereas they are very <hi>obscurely</hi> only gathered out of the <hi>Writings</hi> of the Old.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The punishment <hi>threatned</hi> in the Gospel is, as unto degrees, <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>more sore</hi> than that which was annexed to the meer transgression of the first Covenant. Hence the Apostle calls it. <hi>death unto death,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. by reason of the sore aggravations which the first sentence of <hi>death</hi> will receive from the wrath due unto the contempt of the Gospel. Separation from God under eternal punishment was unquestionably due to the <hi>sin of Adam,</hi> and so consequently unto every transgression against the <hi>first Covenant, Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 13, 14. But yet this hinders not, but that the same <hi>penalty for the nature and kind</hi> of it may receive many and great aggravations, upon mens sinning against that great <hi>Remedy</hi> provided against the first guilt and prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which it also doth, as shall farther afterwards be declared.</p>

And <hi>they</hi> have been observed to have had an <hi>effectual ministery,</hi> both unto Conversion and Edification, who have been made wise and <hi>dextrous</hi> in managing Gospel Comminations towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of their hearers.

(A meet recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.)</hi> What it is, the Apostle doth not declare, but he doth that it is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>equal,</hi> which depends on the Justice of God appointing and designing of it. Foolish men have always had tumultuating thoughts about the judgments of God. Some have disputed with him about the equity and <hi>equality</hi> of his ways in judgments temporal, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. and some about those that shall be eternal. Hence was the vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them of old, who <hi>dreamed</hi> that an <hi>end</hi> should be put after some season, unto the punishment of <hi>Devils</hi> and wicked men; so turning hell into a kind of Purgatory. Others have disputed in our days, that there <hi>shall be no hell at all,</hi> but a meer <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of ungodly men at the last day. These things being so expresly contrary to the Scripture can have no other rise, but the <hi>corrupt minds</hi> and affections of men, not conceiving the <hi>reasons</hi> of God's judgments, nor acquiescing in his <hi>Sovereignty.</hi> That which they seem principally to have stumbled at, is the assignation of a punishment <hi>infinite</hi> as to its <hi>duration,</hi> as well as in its <hi>nature</hi> extended unto the utmost capacity of the subject, unto a fault <hi>temporary, finite</hi> and transient. Now that we may justifie God herein, and the more clearly discern that the punishment <hi>inflicted finally</hi> on sin, is but a <hi>meet recompence of reward,</hi> we must consider,</p>
                        <p>First, That God's Justice <hi>constituting,</hi> and in the end <hi>inflicting</hi> the reward of sin, is <hi>essential</hi> unto him. Is God <hi>unjust?</hi> saith the Apostle, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, anger or wrath is not that <hi>from whence</hi> punishment proceedeth, but punishment it self: God inflicteth wrath <hi>anger</hi> or vengeance. And therefore when we read of the <hi>anger</hi> or wrath of God against sin or sinners, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. the expression is <hi>metonymical,</hi> the cause being designed by the effect. The true fountain and cause of the punishment of sin is the <hi>Justice</hi> of God, which is an Essential property of his Nature, natural unto him, and inseparable from any of his works. And this abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely is the same with his <hi>Holiness,</hi> or the infinite Purity of his Nature. So that God doth not assign the punishment of sin <hi>arbitrarily,</hi> that he might do so or otherwise,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50110:259"/>
without any impeachment of his Glory; but his Justice and his Holiness indispensibly require, that it should be punished, even as it is indispensibly necessary that God in all things should be <hi>just</hi> and holy. <hi>The holy God will do no iniquity</hi>: the Judge of all the earth will do right, and will by no means acquit the guilty? This is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>the judgement of God,</hi> that which his Justice requireth, <hi>that they which commit sin are worthy of death, Rom.</hi> 1.32. And God cannot but do that, which it is <hi>just</hi> that he should do. See 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.6. We have no more Reason then to quarrel with the <hi>Punishment</hi> of sin, than we have to repine that God is Holy and Just; that is, that he is God; for the <hi>one</hi> naturally and necessarily followeth upon the other. Now there is no Principle of a more uncontrolable and Soveraign Truth, written in the hearts of all men than this; that <hi>what the Nature of God, or any of his Essential Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties require to be, is holy, meet, equal, just and good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, That this Righteousness or Justice of God, is in the Exercise of it, insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably accompanied with <hi>infinite Wisdom.</hi> These things are not <hi>diverse</hi> in God, but are <hi>distinguished</hi> with respect unto the various manners of his actings, and the variety of the <hi>Objects</hi> which he acteth towards; and so denote a different <hi>Habitude</hi> of the Divine Nature, not <hi>diverse things</hi> in God. They are therefore inseparable in all the works of God. Now from this <hi>Infinite Wisdom</hi> of God which his Righteousness in the constitution of the punishment of sin is eternally accompanied withal; two things ensue.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That He <hi>alone</hi> knoweth what is the true desert and demerit of sin; and but from his Declaration of creatures not any. And how shall we judge of what we know nothing but from him, but only by what he doth? We see amongst men, that the guilt of crimes is aggravated according to the Dignity of the Persons against whom they are committed. Now no creature knowing him perfectly, against whom all sin is committed, none can truly and perfectly know what is the desert and demerit of sin; but by his Revelation who is perfectly known unto himself. And what a <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is it to judge otherwise of that we do no otherwise understand? Shall we make our selves Judges of what <hi>sin against God</hi> doth deserve? Let us first by <hi>searching find out the Almighty unto Perfection,</hi> and then we may know of our selves what it is <hi>to sin</hi> against him. Besides we know not what is the <hi>Opposition</hi> that is made by sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Holiness,</hi> the Nature, and very Being of God. As we cannot know him <hi>perfectly</hi> against whom we sin, so we know not <hi>perfectly</hi> what we do when we sin. It is the least part of the malignity and poyson that is in sin, which we are able to discern. We see not the depth of that <hi>malicious</hi> respect which it hath unto God; and are we capable to judge aright of what is its <hi>Demerit?</hi> But all these things <hi>are open and naked</hi> before that Infinite Wisdom of God, which accompanieth his Righteousness in all his Works. He knows <hi>himself</hi> against whom sin is; he knows the <hi>Condition</hi> of the sinner; He knows what contrariety and <hi>Opposition</hi> there is in sin unto himself: in a word, what it is for a finite, limited, dependent creature, to subduct it self from under the <hi>Government,</hi> and oppose it self unto the Authority and <hi>Being</hi> of the Holy Creator, Ruler and Governour of all things; all absolutely and perfectly, and so alone knows what sin deserves.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From this Infinite Wisdom is the proportioning of the <hi>several degrees</hi> in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment that shall be inflicted on sin. For although his Righteousness require, that the final punishment of all sin, should be an <hi>Eternal separation</hi> of the sinner from the enjoyment of him, and that in a <hi>state of Wrath</hi> and misery; yet by his Wisdom, he hath constituted <hi>Degrees</hi> of that wrath, according unto the Variety of Provocations that are found among sinners. And by nothing else could this be done. What else is able to look through the Unconceivable variety of <hi>Aggravating Circumstances</hi> which is required hereunto? For the most part, we know not what is so; and when we know any thing of its <hi>being,</hi> we know nothing almost of the <hi>true nature of its deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> And this is another thing from whence we may learn, that Divine Punishment of sin is alwayes a <hi>meet Recompence of Reward.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, In the <hi>final</hi> punishment of sin, there is no mixture of mercy; nothing to <hi>alleviate,</hi> or to take off from the uttermost of its desert. This world is the time and place for mercy. Here God causeth his <hi>Sun to shine,</hi> and <hi>his rain to fall on the worst of men, filling their hearts with food and gladness.</hi> Here he <hi>endures them with much patience</hi> and forbearance, doing them Good in unspeakable variety, and to many of them making a daily tender of that mercy, which might make them blessed to Eternity. But the season of these things is past in the Day of Recompence. Sinners
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50110:260"/>
shall then hear nothing, but <hi>go ye cursed.</hi> They shall not have the least effect of Mercy shewed unto them unto all Eternity. They shall then <hi>have judgement without mercy, who shewed no mercy.</hi> The Grace, Goodness, Love and Mercy of God shall be glorified unto the utmost in his <hi>Elect</hi>; without the least mixture of allay from his displeasure; and so shall his Wrath, Severity and <hi>Vindictive Justice,</hi> in them that perish without any <hi>temperature</hi> of pity or compassion. He shall rain upon them <hi>snares, and fire and brimstone, this shall be their portion for ever.</hi> Wonder then not at the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Duration of that Punishment, which shall exhaust the whole wrath of God without the least mitigation.</p>
                        <p>And this will discover unto us the nature of sin, especially of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> and <hi>neglect of the Gospel.</hi> Men are apt now to have <hi>slight thoughts</hi> of these things; but when they shall find them revenged with the <hi>whole Wrath</hi> of God, they will change their minds. What a folly, what a madness is it to make <hi>light</hi> of Christ, unto which an Eternity of punishment is but a meet Recompence of Reward. It is good then, to learn the nature of sin from the Threatnings of God, rather than from the common <hi>Presumptions</hi> that pass among secure perishing sinners: Consider what the Righteousness, what the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, what the Wisdom of God hath determined to be due unto sin, and then make a Judgement of the <hi>nature</hi> of it; that you be not overtaken with a woful <hi>surprizal,</hi> when all means of relief are gone and past. As also know that,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This <hi>World alone</hi> is the time and place wherein you are to look and seek for mercy. <hi>Cryes</hi> will do nothing at the last day: not obtain the <hi>least drop of water</hi> to cool the tongue in its torment. Some men doubtless have secret reserves, that things will not go at the last day, as by others they they are made to believe. They hope to meet with better <hi>Quarter</hi> than is talked of; that God will not be inexorable as is pretended. Were not these their <hi>inward thoughts,</hi> it were not possible they should so neglect the season of Grace, as they do. But alas, how will they be deceived? God indeed is <hi>gracious, merciful,</hi> and full of Compassion; but <hi>this world</hi> is the time wherein he will exercise them. They will be for ever shut up towards unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers at the last day. This is <hi>the acceptable day,</hi> this is the <hi>day of salvation</hi>; if this be despised, if this be neglected, expect no more to hear of mercy unto Eternity.</p>
                        <p n="iii">III. <hi>Every concernment of the Law and Gospel, both as to their nature and promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to be weighed and considered by Believers, to beget in their hearts a right and due valuation of them.</hi> To this end are they here so distinctly proposed; as of the <hi>Law,</hi> that it was <hi>spoken by Angels</hi>; and of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that it is <hi>great salvation,</hi> the word <hi>spoken by the Lord,</hi> confirmed with <hi>signs and miracles</hi>; all which the Apostle would have us to weigh and distinctly consider. Our Interest lyes in them, and our Good is intended by them. And to stir up our attention unto them, we may observe.</p>
                        <p>First, That God doth <hi>nothing in vain,</hi> nor speaks any thing in vain, especially in the things of his Law and Gospel, wherein the great concernments of his own Glory, and the souls of men are enwrapped. And therefore our <hi>Saviour</hi> lets us know, that there is a worth in the least <hi>apex</hi> and <hi>iota</hi> of the word, and that it must have its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment. An End it hath, and that End shall be fulfilled. The <hi>Jews</hi> have a <hi>foolish curiosity</hi> in reckoning all the <hi>letters</hi> of the Scripture, and casting up how often every one doth occurr. But yet this <hi>curiosity</hi> of theirs, vain and needless as it is, will condemn our negligence, if we omit a <hi>diligent enquiry</hi> into all the Things and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of it, that are of real importance. God hath an holy and wise End in all that he doth. As nothing can be <hi>added</hi> unto his Word or Work; so nothing can be <hi>taken from</hi> it, it is every way perfect. And this in general is enough to quicken us unto a <hi>diligent search</hi> into all the Circumstances and <hi>Adjuncts</hi> both of Law and Gospel; and of the way and manner, whereby he was pleased to communicate them unto us.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, There is in all those <hi>Concernments</hi> of the Law and Gospel, a mixture of Divine Wisdom and Grace. From this fountain they all proceed, and the <hi>living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of it run through them all. The Times, the Seasons, the Authors, the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the manner of their Delivery, were all ordered by the <hi>manifold Wisdom of God,</hi> which especially appears in the dispensation of the Gospel, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.9, 10. The Apostle placeth not the Wisdom of God only in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the Gospel, but also in the <hi>season</hi> of its promulgation. <hi>It was hid,</hi> saith he, <hi>in God, v.</hi> 9. that is, in the <hi>purpose of God, v.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>From the Ages past, but now is made manifest</hi>; and herein doth the <hi>manifold Wisdom of God appear.</hi> Were we able to look into the depth of any <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance</hi>
                           <pb n="175" facs="tcp:50110:260"/>
that concerns the Institutions of God, we should see it full of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and Grace; and the <hi>neglect</hi> of a due consideration thereof hath God sometime severely revenged, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.1, 2.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, There is in them all a <hi>Gracious Condescension</hi> unto our weakness. God knows that we stand in need of an <hi>especial remark</hi> to be set on every one of them. Such is our <hi>weakness,</hi> our <hi>slowness to believe,</hi> that we have need that the Word should be unto us, <hi>line upon line, and precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little.</hi> As God told <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 4.8. That if the children of <hi>Israel</hi> would not believe on the <hi>first sign,</hi> they would on the <hi>second.</hi> So it is with us; one consideration of the Law or the Gospel oftentimes proves <hi>ineffectual,</hi> when another over-powres the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to obedience. And therefore hath God thus graciously condescended unto our weakness, in proposing unto us the <hi>several considerations</hi> mentioned of his Law and Gospel; that by some of them we may be laid hold upon, and bowed unto his mind and will in them. Accordingly,</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, They have had their various <hi>Influences</hi> and <hi>Successes</hi> on the souls of men. Some have been wrought upon by <hi>one consideration,</hi> some by another. In some the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the Law, in others the <hi>manner</hi> of its Administration have been effectual. Some have fixed their hearts principally on the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Gospel; some on the <hi>Person</hi> of its Author. And the same persons at <hi>several times</hi> have had help and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, from these <hi>several considerations</hi> of the one and the other. So that in these things, God doth nothing in vain; nothing is in vain towards believers. <hi>Infinite Wisdom</hi> is in all; and <hi>infinite Glory</hi> will arise out of all.</p>
                        <p>And this should stir us up unto a diligent <hi>search into the Word,</hi> wherein God hath recorded all the concernments of his Law and Gospel, that are for our use and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. That is the <hi>Cabinet</hi> wherein all these <hi>Jewels</hi> are laid up and disposed, according to his Wisdom and the counsel of his Will. A general view of it will but little sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, and not at all <hi>enrich</hi> our souls. This is the <hi>Mine</hi> wherein we must <hi>digg</hi> as for hid treasures. One main reason why we <hi>believe</hi> no more, why we <hi>obey</hi> no more, why we <hi>love</hi> no more, is because we are no more diligent in searching the Word, for <hi>substantial Motives</hi> unto them all. A very <hi>little insight</hi> into the Word is apt to make men think that they see enough: But the Reason of it is, because they like not what they see. As men will not like to look farther into a <hi>Shop of Wares,</hi> when they like nothing, which is at first presented unto them. But if indeed we find sweetness, benefit, profit, life, in the discoveries that are made unto us in the Word about the Law and Gospel, we shall be continually reaching after a farther Acquaintance with them. It may be we know somewhat of those things; but how know we, that there is not <hi>some especial concernment</hi> of the Gospel, which God in an <hi>holy condescension</hi> hath designed for our good in particular, that we are not as yet arrived unto a clear and distinct knowledge of? Here if we search for it with <hi>all diligence,</hi> may we find it; and if we go maimed in our Faith and Obedience all our dayes, we may thank our own sloth for it.</p>
                        <p>Again, whereas God hath <hi>distinctly proposed those things unto us,</hi> they should have our <hi>distinct consideration.</hi> We should severally and distinctly meditate upon them; that so in them all we may admire the <hi>Wisdom of God</hi>; and receive the effectual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of them all upon our own souls. Thus may we sometimes converse in our hearts with the <hi>Author</hi> of the Gospel; sometimes with the <hi>manner</hi> of its delivery; sometimes with the <hi>Grace</hi> of it; and from every one of these <hi>heavenly flowers,</hi> draw nourishment and refreshment unto our own souls. Oh that we could take care to gather up <hi>these fragments,</hi> that nothing might be lost unto us; as in themselves they shall never perish.</p>
                        <p n="iv">IV. <hi>What means soever God is pleased to use in the Revelation of his Will; he gives it a Certainty, Stedfastness, Assurance and Evidence, which our faith may rest in, and which cannot be neglected without the greatest Sin.</hi> (<hi>The word spoken was stedfast.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>.</note>) Every word spoken from God, by his Appointment, is stedfast; and that because spoken from him, and by his Appointment. And there are two things that belong unto this <hi>stedfastness</hi> of the Word spoken.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That in respect of <hi>them unto whom it is spoken,</hi> it is the <hi>foundation</hi> of Faith and Obedience; The <hi>formal Reason</hi> of them, and <hi>last Ground</hi> whereunto they are resolved.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That on the part of God, it is a stable and sufficient <hi>ground of Righteousness</hi> in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50110:261"/>
proceeding to take vengeance on them by whom it is neglected. The punishment of transgressors is <hi>a meet Recompence of Reward,</hi> because the word spoken unto them is <hi>stedfast.</hi> And this latter follows upon the former: For if the word be not a <hi>stable firm foundation</hi> for the Faith and Obedience of men, they cannot be justly punished for the neglect of it. That therefore must be briefly spoken unto, and this will naturally ensue, as a consequent thereof.</p>
                        <p>God hath, as we saw on the <hi>first Verse of this Epistle, by various wayes and means,</hi> declared and revealed his mind unto men. That Declaration, what means or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments so ever he is pleased to make use of therein, is called <hi>his Word.</hi> And that because <hi>originally,</hi> it is <hi>his,</hi> proceeds from him, is delivered in his name and Authority, reveals his mind, and tends to his Glory. Thus sometimes he spake by <hi>Angels,</hi> using their Ministry, either in delivering his Messages, by <hi>words of an outward sound,</hi> or by Representation of things in <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Dreams</hi>; and sometimes by the <hi>Inspiration</hi> of the Holy Ghost, enabling them so inspired, to give out the word which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, purely and entirely; all remaining <hi>his Word</hi> still. Now what <hi>wayes</hi> soever God is pleased to use, in the Communication of his Mind and Will unto men for their Obedience, there is <hi>that stedfastness</hi> in the Word it self, that Evidence to be from him, as make it the duty of men to believe in it, with <hi>faith divine and supernatural</hi>; and that <hi>stability</hi> which will never deceive them. It is, I say thus <hi>stedfast</hi> upon the account of its being <hi>spoken from God,</hi> and stands in no need of the contribution of any strength, Authority or Testimony from men, <hi>Church, Tradition,</hi> or ought else that is extrinsecal unto it. The Testimonies given hereunto in the Scripture it self, which are very many, with the general Grounds and Reasons hereof, I shall not here insist upon; and that because I have done it elsewhere. I shall only mention that <hi>one consideration,</hi> which this place of the Apostle suggests unto us; and which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our second <hi>Observation</hi> from the word <hi>stedfast.</hi> Take this word as spoken from God, without the help of any other Advantages, and the <hi>stedfastness</hi> of it, is the Ground of Gods <hi>inflicting Vengeance</hi> on them that receive it not, that obey it not. Because it is <hi>his Word,</hi> because it is cloathed with his <hi>Authority</hi>; if men believe it not, they must perish. But now if this be not <hi>sufficiently evidenced</hi> unto them, namely that it is <hi>his Word,</hi> God could not be <hi>just</hi> in taking vengeance of them; for he should pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them for not believing that, which they had <hi>no sufficient Reason</hi> to believe, which suits not with the Holiness and Justice of God. The Evidence then that this <hi>Word is from God,</hi> that it is his, being the foundation of the Justice of God in his proceeding against them that do not believe it, it is of indispensible necessity that he himself also do give that Evidence unto it. For whence also should it have it? from the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Church,</hi> or from <hi>Tradition,</hi> or from <hi>probable moral inducements,</hi> that men can tender one to another; Then these two things will inevitably follow. 1. That if men should <hi>neglect their duty</hi> in giving Testimony unto the Word, as they may do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are but men, then God cannot <hi>justly condemn</hi> any man in the world, for the <hi>neglect of his Word,</hi> in not believing it, or not yielding obedience unto it. And the Reason is evident; because if they have <hi>not sufficient Grounds</hi> to believe it to be his, without such Testimonies as are not given unto it, it is the <hi>highest Injustice</hi> to condemn them for not believing it; and they should <hi>perish without a cause.</hi> For what can be more unjust, than to punish a man, especially <hi>eternally,</hi> for not doing that which he had no just or sufficient Reason to do? This be far from God, to destroy the innocent with the wicked. (2.) Suppose all men aright to discharge their duty; and that there be a full <hi>Tradition</hi> concerning the Word of God; that the <hi>Church</hi> give Testimony unto it, and <hi>Learned</hi> men produce their Arguments for it; if this, all, or any part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, be esteemed as the sufficient Proposition of the Scripture to be the Word of God, then is the Execution of <hi>infinite divine Justice</hi> built upon the Testimony of men, which is not <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>infallible,</hi> but such as might deceive. For God on this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal must condemn men for not believing with <hi>faith divine and infallible,</hi> that which is proposed unto them by Testimonies and Arguments, <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>fallible; quod absit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It remaineth then that the Righteousness of the Act of God in condemning unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is built upon the <hi>Evidence,</hi> that the Object of Faith or Word to be believed is from him.</p>
                        <p>And this he gives unto it, both by the <hi>Impression</hi> of his Majesty and Authority upon it, and by the <hi>Power</hi> and Efficacy wherewith by his Spirit it is accompanied. Thus is every Word of God <hi>stedfast</hi> as <hi>a Declaration of his Will</hi> unto us; by what means so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is made known unto us.</p>

                        <p n="xi">XI. <hi>The neglecters of the Gospel shall unavoidably perish the wrath of God: (How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These last Observations may be cast into one Proposition, and so be considered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, namely, <hi>That the Gospel is great Salvation, which who so neglecteth, shall therefore unavoidably perish without remedy.</hi> We shall first enquire how the <hi>Gospel is said to be Salvation,</hi> and that <hi>Great Salvation</hi>; and then shew the equity and unavoidable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Destruction by whom it is <hi>neglected</hi>; and therein the vanity of their hopes, who look for an <hi>escaping</hi> in the contempt of it.</p>
                        <p>By the <hi>Gospel,</hi> we understand with the Apostle the <hi>Word preached</hi> or spoken by Christ and his Apostles, and now recorded for our use in the <hi>Books</hi> of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not <hi>exclusively</hi> unto what was declared of it in the Types and Promises of the Old Testament. But by the way of <hi>Eminency</hi> we appropriate the whole name and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Gospel</hi> unto that delivery of the Mind and Will of God, by Jesus Christ, which included and perfected all that had preceded unto that purpose. Now the Gospel is <hi>salvation</hi> upon a double account.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>Declaratively,</hi> In that the Salvation of God by Christ, is <hi>declared,</hi> taught and revealed thereby. So the Apostle informs us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>It is the power of God unto salvation, because therein the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith</hi>; that is the Righteousness of God in Christ, whereby Believers shall be saved. And therefore it is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11. the <hi>saving,</hi> or salvation bringing, <hi>Grace of God.</hi> The Grace of God, as that which <hi>teacheth</hi> and revealeth his Grace. And thence they that abuse it to their lusts, are said to <hi>turn the grace of God into lasciviousness, Jude</hi> 4. that is, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it, which is the Gospel. And therefore under the Old Testament, it is called the Preaching or declaring of <hi>glad tydings, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of peace,</hi> and salvation, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Isa.</hi> 52.7. and is described as a <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Mercy, Peace, Pardon and Salvation unto sinners: <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.1, 2. <hi>And life and immortality</hi> are said <hi>to be brought to light thereby,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. It is true; God had from all Eternity in his infinite Grace <hi>contrived</hi> the salvation of sinners; but this Contrivance, and the Purpose of it, lay <hi>hid</hi> in his own Will and Wisdom, as in an infinite <hi>Abysse</hi> of darkness, utterly imperceptible unto Angels and men, untill it was <hi>brought to light,</hi> or manifested and declared by the Gospel, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1.25, 26, 27. There is nothing more vain, than the supposals of some, that there are <hi>other wayes</hi> whereby this Salvation might be discovered and made known. The Works of <hi>Nature</hi> or Creation and Providence, the <hi>Sun, Moon and Stars,</hi> showres from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with fruitful seasons, are in their judgement <hi>Preachers of the salvation of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> I know not what also they say, that the <hi>Reason</hi> of man, by the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these things may find out, of I know not what <hi>Placability</hi> in God, that may incite sinners to go unto him, and enable them to find Acceptance with him. But we see what <hi>success</hi> all the world, and all the Wise men of it, had in the use and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of these means of the salvation of sinners. The Apostle tells us not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that by their <hi>Wisdom they knew not God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. but also, that the more they searched the greater <hi>loss</hi> they were at, untill they <hi>waxed vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts were darkned, Rom.</hi> 1.21. And indeed whatever they had amongst
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50110:262"/>
them, which had any semblance of an obscure Apprehension of some way of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Atonement and Intercession, as in their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Mediations</hi> of <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Deities</hi>; which the Apostle alludes unto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5, 6; as they had it by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> from those who were somewhat instructed in the Will of God by <hi>Revelation,</hi> so they turned it into horrible Idolatries, and the utmost contempt of God. And this was the issue of their disquisitions, who were no less <hi>wise</hi> in the principles of inbred Reason, and the knowledge of the works of nature, than those who now contend for their <hi>Ability</hi> to have done better. Besides, the <hi>salvation of sinners</hi> is a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,</hi> as the Scripture every where declareth, a blessed, a <hi>glorious Mysterie, Rom.</hi> 16.25. <hi>The Wisdom of God in a Mysterie,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25, 26. That is, not only a thing <hi>secret and marvellous</hi>; but such as hath no dependance on any Causes that come naturally within <hi>our Cognizance.</hi> Now what ever men can find out, by the <hi>Principles of Reason,</hi> and the contemplation of the works of God, in Creation and Providence, it is by natural <hi>scientifical conclusions</hi>; and what is so discovered, can be no <hi>heavenly, spiritual, glorious Mysterie</hi>; such as this <hi>salvation</hi> is. What ever men may so find out, if they may find out any thing looking this way, it is but <hi>natural sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> it is not a <hi>Mysterie,</hi> and so is of no use in this matter, what ever it be. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is not only said to be a <hi>Mysterie,</hi> but an <hi>hidden Mysterie</hi>; and that <hi>hid in God himself</hi>; as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25, 26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 8. That is, in the Wisdom, Purpose, and Will of God. Now it is very strange that men should be able by the the natural means fore-mentioned; to discover an <hi>heavenly, supernatural Wisdom,</hi> and that hidden on purpose from their finding by any such enquiry, and that <hi>in God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; so coming unto the knowledge of it, as it were whether he would or no. But we may pass over these Imaginations; and accept of the Gospel, as the <hi>only way and means of declaring</hi> the salvation of God. And therefore every Word and Promise in the whole Book of God, that intimateth or revealeth any thing belonging unto this <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> is it self a part of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and so to be esteemed. And as this is the work of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> so is it in an especial manner, its proper and <hi>peculiar</hi> work with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto the Law. The Law speaks nothing of the <hi>salvation of sinners</hi>; and is therefore called the <hi>Ministry of death and condemnation,</hi> as the Gospel is of <hi>life and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9, 10. And thus the Gospel is salvation <hi>declaratively.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is Salvation <hi>Efficiently</hi>; in that it is the great Instrument which God is pleased to use, in, and for the <hi>Collation</hi> and bestowing salvation upon his Elect. Hence the Apostle calls it the <hi>Power of God unto salvation, Rom.</hi> 1.16. Because God in and by it exerts his <hi>mighty Power</hi> in the saving of them that believe; as it is again called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. Whence there is a saving Power ascribed unto the Word it self. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> commits believers unto the <hi>Word of grace, as that which is able to build them up, and give them an inheritance among all them that are sanctified, Acts</hi> 20.32. And <hi>James</hi> calls it, the <hi>ingrafted Word, which is able to save our souls, Chap.</hi> 1.21. The mighty Power of Christ being put forth in it, and accompanying of it, for that purpose. But this will the better appear, if we consider the several principal parts of this Salvation, and the <hi>Efficiency</hi> of the Word as the Instrument of God in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of it unto us. As<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <p>First, In the <hi>Regeneration</hi> and Sanctification of the Elect, the first <hi>external Act</hi> of this Salvation. This is wrought by the <hi>Word,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>We are born again, not of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the Word of God.</hi> Wherein not only the thing it self, of our <hi>Regeneration by the Word,</hi> but the <hi>manner</hi> of it also is declared. It is by the <hi>Collation</hi> of a <hi>new spiritual life</hi> upon us, whereof the Word is the <hi>seed.</hi> As every life proceeds from <hi>some seed,</hi> that hath in its self <hi>virtually</hi> the whole life to be educed from it by natural wayes and means, so the <hi>Word</hi> in the hearts of men is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>vital principle,</hi> that cherished by <hi>suitable means</hi> puts forth vital acts and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. By this means are <hi>we born of God</hi> and quickned, who by <hi>nature are children of wrath, dead in trespasses and sins.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he had <hi>begotten them in Jesus Christ by the Gospel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. I confess, it doth not do this work by any <hi>Power resident</hi> in its self, and alwayes necessarily accompanying its Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For then all would be so <hi>regenerated</hi> unto whom it is preached, and there would be no <hi>neglecters</hi> of it. But it is the <hi>Instrument</hi> of God for this end; and mighty and <hi>powerful through God</hi> it is for the accomplishment of it. And this gives us our first real Interest in the <hi>Salvation</hi> which it doth declare. Of the same Use and <hi>Efficacy</hi> is it in the progress of this work in our <hi>Sanctification</hi>; by which we are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on towards the full <hi>Enjoyment of this salvation.</hi> So our Saviour prayes for his
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50110:262"/>
Disciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19. <hi>Sanctifie them by thy Word</hi>; as the means and instrument of their Sanctification. And he tells his Apostles, that they were <hi>clean through the word that he had spoken unto them, Chap.</hi> 15.3. For it is the <hi>food and nourishment</hi> whereby the spiritual Principle of Life, which we revive in our Regeneration is cherished and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. and so able to build us up; untill it give <hi>us an inheritance among them that are sanctified.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is so in the <hi>Communication of the Spirit</hi> unto them that do believe, to furnish them with the Gifts and Graces of the Kingdom of Heaven, and to interest them in all those Priviledges of <hi>this salvation,</hi> which God is pleased in this life to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part unto us, and to entrust us withal. So the Apostle dealing with the <hi>Galatians</hi> about their backsliding from the Gospel, asketh them, <hi>wither they received the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the Word of Faith, Chap.</hi> 3.2. that is, the Gospel. That was the Way and means whereby God communicated unto them <hi>his Spirit,</hi> by whom among many other Priviledges, <hi>we are sealed unto the day of Redemption.</hi> This is the Covenant of God, that his <hi>Spirit and the Word of the Gospel</hi> shall go, and shall abide together with his <hi>Elect, Isa.</hi> 59.1. And he is given unto us by the Gospel on many accounts.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) Because he is the <hi>gift and grant of the Author of the Gospel,</hi> as to all the espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Ends and concernments of salvation. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Spirit was not given when Jesus was not as yet glorified, Chap.</hi> 7.39. that is, not in <hi>that manner,</hi> as God hath annexed unto this salvation: and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that <hi>when the Lord Christ ascended up on high, he received of the Father the Promise of the Spirit, and poured him forth on them which did believe, Acts</hi> 2.33. And this he did, according to his own great Promise and Prediction, whilest he conversed with his Disciples in the dayes of his flesh. There was not any thing that he more supported and encouraged them withal, nor more raised their hearts to an Expectation of, than this, that he would send unto them, and bestow upon them the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> for many blessed ends and purposes, and that to <hi>abide with them for ever,</hi> as we may see, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15, 16. And this is the great priviledge of the Gospel, that the Author of it, is alone the <hi>donor</hi> and bestower of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>; which of what concernment it is in the business of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> all men know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have any acquaintance with these things:</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) He is <hi>promised in the Gospel,</hi> and therein alone. All the Promises of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, whither in the <hi>Old</hi> Testament or <hi>New,</hi> whose subject is the Spirit, are <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi>; they all belong unto, and are parts of the Gospel. For the <hi>Law</hi> had no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Spirit, or any Priviledge by him annexed unto it. And hence he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>holy Spirit of promise, Ephes.</hi> 1.13. Who next unto the Person of Christ, was the great subject of Promises from the foundation of the world.</p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) By these Promises are Believers actually and really <hi>made partakers of the Spirit,</hi> They are <hi>vehicula Spiritus</hi>; the Chariots that bring this <hi>holy Spirit</hi> into our Souls, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. By these <hi>great and precious Promises is the Divine Nature communicated unto us,</hi> so far forth as unto the <hi>indwelling of this blessed Spirit.</hi> Every Evangelical Promise is unto a Believer, but as it were the <hi>cloathing of the Spirit</hi>; in receiving whereof he receives the Spirit himself, for some of the blessed Ends of this <hi>great salvation.</hi> God makes use of the Word of the Gospel, and of no other means, to this purpose. So that herein also it is the <hi>grace of God that bringeth salvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, In our <hi>Justification.</hi> And this hath so great a share in this <hi>salvation,</hi> that it is often called salvation it self; And they that are <hi>justified,</hi> are said to be <hi>saved</hi>; as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.8. And this is by the <hi>Gospel alone</hi>; which is a point of such importance, that it is the main subject of some of <hi>Pauls Epistles,</hi> and is fully taught in them all. And in sundry respects it is by the Gospel.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) Because therein, and thereby is appointed and constituted the <hi>New Law of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> whereby even a <hi>sinner</hi> may come to be justified before God. The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Justification</hi> was, that <hi>he that did the Works of the Law should live in them, Rom.</hi> 10.5. But this became <hi>weak</hi> and unprofitable by reason of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7, 8, 9. That any <hi>sinner,</hi> (and we have <hi>all sinned and come short of the glory of God</hi>) should be justified by this <hi>Law</hi> or Rule, implyes a <hi>contradiction,</hi> and is utterly impossible. Wherefore God by the Gospel hath constituted a <hi>new Law of Justification,</hi> even the <hi>Law of faith, Rom.</hi> 3.27. which is the holy Declaration of his Will and Grace, that <hi>sinners</hi> shall be <hi>justified</hi> and accepted with him by faith in the blood of Christ, <hi>without the Works of the Law</hi>; that <hi>he that believeth shall be saved.</hi> This is equally constituted
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50110:263"/>
and appointed in the Law of faith to be proposed unto <hi>all</hi> that shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. And on the account hereof, the Gospel is <hi>salvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) Because in every Justification there must be a <hi>Righteousness</hi> before God, on the account whereof, the Person to be justified is to be pronounced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared righteous, this is tendered, proposed, and exhibited unto us in and by the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>This is no other but the Lord Christ himself and his Righteousness, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.21, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14. Now Christ with his whole Righteousness, and all the benefits thereof, are <hi>tendered</hi> unto us, and given unto, or bestowed on them that do believe, by the Promise of the Gospel. Therein is he preached and proposed as crucified before our eyes, and we are invited to accept of him, which the souls of Believers through the Gospel do accordingly.</p>
                        <p>And (3.) <hi>Faith it self</hi> whereby we receive the Lord Christ for all the <hi>Ends</hi> for which he is tendered unto us, and become <hi>actually interested</hi> in all the fruits and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his Mediation, is wrought in us by the Word of the Gospel. For as we have declared, it is the <hi>seed of all Grace</hi> whatever; and in especial, <hi>faith cometh by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing by this word of God, Rom.</hi> 10.17. Conviction of sin is by the Law: but faith is by the Gospel. And this is the <hi>Way</hi> and means which God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on our part, for the giving us an actual interest in <hi>Justification</hi>; as established in the Law of the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. Again,</p>
                        <p n="4">(4.) The <hi>Promise of the Gospel</hi> conveyed unto the soul by the Holy Spirit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by faith, compleats the <hi>justification</hi> of a believer in his own conscience, and gives him <hi>assured Peace</hi> with God. And then the whole work of this main <hi>branch of our salvation</hi> is wrought by the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, There is in <hi>this salvation</hi> an instruction and growth in <hi>spiritual Wisdom,</hi> and an Acquaintance with the Mysterie of God, <hi>even of the Father and the Son,</hi> which also is an Effect of the Gospel. Of our selves we are not only <hi>dark</hi> and ignorant of heavenly things, but <hi>darkness it self</hi>; that is, utterly blind, and <hi>incomprehensive</hi> of spiritual Divine Mysteries, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.8. and so under the <hi>Power of darkness, Col.</hi> 1.13. as that we should no less than the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves be holden under the <hi>chains of it</hi> unto the Judgement of the great Day. <hi>Darkness</hi> and ignorance as to the <hi>things of God themselves,</hi> in respect of the Revelation of them, and Darkness in the <hi>Mind</hi> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of them in a right manner, being revealed, is upon the whole world. And no heart is able to conceive, no tongue to express the greatness and misery of this <hi>Darkness.</hi> The removal hereof is a mercy unexpressible, the beginning of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Heaven, the Kingdom of Light and <hi>Glory,</hi> and an especial part of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: For God is <hi>light, and in him there is no darkness at all</hi>; so that whilest we are under the power of it, we can have no entercourse with him; <hi>For what commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath light with Darkness?</hi> Now the removal hereof is by the Gospel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. God <hi>who commands light to shine out of darkness, shines in our hearts to give us the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Glory in the face of his Son</hi>; and he doth it by the <hi>Illumination of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gospel of Christ, v.</hi> 4. For not only is the <hi>Object</hi> revealed hereby, <hi>Life and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity being brought to light by the Gospel,</hi> but also the <hi>Eyes of our understandings</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by it, savingly to discern the Truths by it revealed. For by it, it is, that both <hi>the eyes of the blind are opened, and light shineth unto them that sit in darkness</hi>; whence we are said to be called <hi>out of darkness into marvelous light,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. And our <hi>Calling</hi> is no otherwise but by the Word of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And as the implanting of this <hi>heavenly Light</hi> in us is by the Word, so the <hi>growth</hi> and encrease of it in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wisdom is no otherwise wrought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. And this spiritual Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintance with God in Christ, this <hi>saving Wisdom</hi> in the Mysterie of Grace, this holy Knowledge and Understanding of the Mind of God, this growing Light and insight into Heavenly things, which is begun, encreased, and carryed on by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, is an especial dawning of that Glory and <hi>immortality,</hi> which this salvation tendeth ultimately unto.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, There belongs unto it also that <hi>Joy and Consolation,</hi> which believers are made partakers of by the Holy Ghost in this world. Oft times their <hi>Tryals</hi> are many, their <hi>troubles</hi> great, and their <hi>temptations</hi> abound in the course of their obedience. And these things are ready to fill them with Cares, Fears, Sorrows and Disconsolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now though our Lord Jesus Christ hath foretold his Disciples of all the <hi>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and sorrows</hi> that should attend them in this world, and taught them to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and support their spirits with the thoughts and hopes of the glory that shall
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50110:263"/>
be revealed; yet in the <hi>salvation</hi> that he hath purchased for them there is provision of <hi>comfort, with joy unspeakable and full of glory,</hi> even during their pilgrimage here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Such joy indeed it is as the <hi>world knoweth not,</hi> nor can know. The principles and causes of it, its Nature and Effects, are all hidden unto them. Yet such it is, that all the contentments and enjoyments of this world are no way to be compared with it; and such do all that have tasted of it esteem it to be. Now this also is wrought in us and communicated unto us by the <hi>Gospel.</hi> It is the Word of Promise whereby God gives <hi>strong consolation unto the heirs of salvation, Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. And upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of this Word by faith it is, that <hi>Believers rejoyce with unspeakable and full of glory.</hi> Not only supportment and comfort in the bearing of troubles, but <hi>glorious Exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and Extasies of joy are oft-times wrought in the hearts of Believers by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. Now they can <hi>endure,</hi> now they can <hi>suffer,</hi> now they can <hi>die</hi>; joy is upon their heads, and in their hearts, <hi>and sorrow and sighing flie away.</hi> Here is Rest, here is Peace, here are Refreshments, here are Pleasures, here is Life to be desired. The good Lord sweeten and season all our hearts with all these <hi>Consolations,</hi> these joys of his Kingdom, and that by the blessed <hi>Word of his Grace.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, to instance in no more particulars, the Gospel is the Word of Salvation, and the instrument in the hand of God for <hi>the conferring of it upon Believers,</hi> because they shall be taken into the full <hi>possession</hi> and enjoyment of it at the last day, by and according unto the word and sentence of it. It is the <hi>Symbol</hi> and <hi>Tessera</hi> that gives men final admission into glory. The secrets of <hi>all hearts shall be judged according to the Gospel, Rom.</hi> 2.6. And by the word of it shall the <hi>Elect</hi> receive their Crown. And in these respects <hi>is the Gospel a word of salvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But secondly, it is said in our <hi>Proposition</hi> as in the <hi>Text,</hi> to be <hi>great salvation.</hi> Now we have seen that the Gospel is called salvation <hi>metonymically,</hi> the <hi>Cause</hi> being called by the name of the <hi>Effect.</hi> But in this adjunct of <hi>Great, so great,</hi> the Effect it self, <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it self,</hi> preached and tendred by the Gospel is principally intended. That then in the next place we are to declare, namely that this <hi>Salvation preached in the Gospel is great salvation.</hi> Neither is it absolutely said to be <hi>great salvation,</hi> but <hi>such,</hi> or <hi>so great salvation.</hi> And it is usual in the Scripture, where it would suggest unto our minds and thoughts an <hi>inconceivable greatness,</hi> to use some such <hi>expressions</hi> as plainly intimate somewhat <hi>more than can be expressed.</hi> See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>So great,</hi> that is <hi>absolutely</hi> so, and <hi>comparatively</hi> so, with respect unto the benefits received by the <hi>Law</hi>; and <hi>inconceivably</hi> so, beyond what we can conceive or express. There ought then to be no expectation that we should declare the <hi>real greatness</hi> of this sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which the Apostle intimates to be <hi>inexpressible</hi>; we shall only point at some of those considerations wherein the <hi>greatness</hi> of it doth most principally consist and appear.</p>
                        <p>First, it is great in the <hi>Eternal contrivance of it.</hi> When sin had defaced the glory of the first Creation, and the Honour of God seemed to be at a stand, no way remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to carry it on unto that End which all things at first tended unto; all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were, and for ever would have been ignorant of a way for the <hi>retrievment of things</hi> into the former, or a better Order, or the bringing forth a <hi>salvation</hi> for that which was lost. For besides that there were such horrible <hi>confusions,</hi> and such inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable intanglements brought upon the <hi>Creation</hi> and the several parts of it, which none could discern how they might be <hi>joynted</hi> and set in order again; there appeared a repugnancy in the very properties of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> unto any relief or salvation of sinners. Let <hi>sinners be saved,</hi> and what shall become of the <hi>Justice,</hi> Holiness, and Wrath of God, all which are engaged to see a <hi>meet recompence of reward</hi> rendred unto every transgression? And this was enough <hi>eternally</hi> to silence the whole Creation, by reason of that indispensible Obligation which is on them always, and in all things to prefer the Honour and Glory of their Maker, before the <hi>Being</hi> or well-being of any creatures what ever. Should the holy <hi>Angels</hi> have set upon a <hi>contrivance</hi> for the salvation of sinners; upon the first discovery that it would interfere and clash with the Glory of God, (as every contrivance of Wisdom <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> would have done undoubtedly, yea rise up against his very Blessedness and Being) they would instantly have cast it from them as an <hi>abominable thing,</hi> and have rested eternally in the Contemplation of his Excellencies, for which end they were created. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>infinite</hi> Wisdom, <hi>infinite</hi> Grace, <hi>infinite</hi> Goodness, and <hi>infinite</hi> Holiness discover themselves in that <hi>contrivance of salvation,</hi> which solves all those difficulties and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contradictions, keeps entire the Glory of God's Attributes, repairs the Honour
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50110:264"/>
lost by sin, and reduceth the whole <hi>Creation</hi> into a new <hi>Order</hi> and subserviency to the Glory of its Maker. Hence this great <hi>Projection</hi> and design is called <hi>the Wisdom of God,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; as that wherein he was pleased principally to lay open the fountain and spring of his <hi>eternal Wisdom, Rom.</hi> 11.33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. And not only so, but the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold wisdom of God, Ephes.</hi>3.10. That is, infinite Wisdom, exerting it self in great and <hi>unspeakable variety</hi> of means and ways for the accomplishment of the end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed. Yea all the <hi>Treasures of wisdom</hi> are said to be <hi>laid out</hi> in this matter, and <hi>laid up in Christ Jesus, Col.</hi> 2.3. As if he had said, that the whole store of <hi>infinite wisdom</hi> was <hi>laid out herein.</hi> And thus, though God made all things in wisdom, yet that which he principally proposeth unto our consideration in the creation of all things, is his <hi>Sovereign Will and Pleasure,</hi> joyned with infinite Power. For his will or <hi>pleasure were all things created, Rev.</hi> 5.11. But in this work of contriving the salvation of sinners, he minds us of the <hi>counsel of his will, Ephes.</hi> 1.11. that is, the <hi>infinite wisdom,</hi> wherewith the Holy Acts of his Will concerning it were accompanied. And the <hi>mystery of his good pleasure, wherein he designed to gather up all things into one head by Jesus Christ, verse</hi> 10. Certainly the product of <hi>infinite and eternal Wisdom,</hi> of the Counsel of the Will of the most Holy, wherein the <hi>Treasures</hi> of it were laidout, with a design to display it in <hi>manifold variety,</hi> must needs be <hi>Great,</hi> very <hi>Great,</hi> so great as cannot be conceived or expressed. Might we here stay to contemplate and admire in our <hi>dim and dawning light,</hi> in our weakness, according to the meanness of our apprehensions of the reflections of it in the <hi>Glass of the Gospel,</hi> the <hi>Eternity</hi> of this contrivance, the transactions between Father and Son about it, the Retrievment of the lost Glory of God by sin, and ruined creation in it, the security of the Holiness, Righteousness, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity and <hi>Vindictive Justice</hi> of God provided for in it, with the abundant over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of Grace, Goodness, Love, Mercy and Patience that are the life of it, we might manifest that there is enough in this <hi>Fountain</hi> to render the <hi>streams</hi> flowing from it <hi>great</hi> and glorious. And yet alass, what a <hi>little,</hi> what a <hi>small portion</hi> of its Glory, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, Beauty, Riches, is it, that we are able in this world to attain unto? How weak and mean are the conceptions and thoughts of <hi>little children</hi> about the designs and counsels of the <hi>wise men</hi> of the earth? and yet there is a Proportion between the Understandings of the one and the other; but there is none at all between <hi>ours</hi> and the <hi>infinite depths</hi> of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God which are laid out in this matter; we think as <hi>children,</hi> we speak as <hi>children,</hi> we see <hi>darkly</hi> as in a glass, and the best acting of our faith in this business is, <hi>humble Admiration and holy Thankfulness.</hi> Now certainly it is not in the capacity of a creature to cast greater contempt on God, than to suppose he would set all his glorious Properties on work, and draw forth all the Treasures of his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> to produce or effect that which should be <hi>low, mean,</hi> not <hi>every way admirable.</hi> And yet unto that height of impiety hath <hi>unbelief</hi> arrived amongst many of them unto whom theGospel is and hath been preached, as to reject and contemn the <hi>whole mystery of it</hi> as meer <hi>folly,</hi> as an <hi>empty notion,</hi> fit to be neglected and despised. So hath the <hi>god of this world blinded the eyes of men,</hi> that the light of the glorious Gospel should not shine into their minds. But when God shall come to be <hi>admired in all them thatbelieve,</hi> on the account of this design of his Grace and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> they will with <hi>astonishment</hi> see the glory of it in others, when it shall be too late for to obtain any benefit by it unto themselves.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Salvation preached in the Gospel is <hi>Great</hi> upon the account of the <hi>way</hi> and means whereby it was wrought and accomplished; or the great effect of the infinite Wisdom and Grace of God in the Incarnation Mediation and Suffering of his Son. Thus was it wrought, and no otherwise could it be effected. <hi>We were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with silver and gold, and corruptible things,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. No such price would be accepted with God; Salvation is more <hi>precious</hi> than to be so purchased, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.6, 7. But it may be it might be effected and brought about by <hi>the Law,</hi> which was God's own Institution; either its Precepts or its Sacrifices might effect this work, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation may be attained by the works of the Law? But yet neither will this suffice. <hi>For the Law is weak and insufficient</hi> as to any such purpose, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. nor would the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of it be accepted unto that end,<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, 8. How then shall it be wrought? is there none worthy in heaven or earth to undertake this work, and must it cease for ever? No, the <hi>Eternal Son</hi> of God himself, the Word Power and Wisdom of the Father, <hi>the brightness of his Glory, and the express image of his Person,</hi> he hath undertaken this work. This renders it <hi>Great</hi> and glorious, that the Son of God in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should perform it; it must assuredly be <hi>great salvation</hi> which he came himself to

work out. And how doth he do it, by the <hi>mighty word of hispower,</hi> as he made all things of old? No, this work is of another nature, and in another manner must be accomplished.For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To this purpose he must be <hi>Incarnate, made flesh, Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>made of a Woman, Gal.</hi> 4.4. Though hewere <hi>in the form of God, and equal to God,</hi> yet he <hi>was to humble and empty himself unto and in the form of a man, Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7. This is that <hi>great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh,</hi> that <hi>the Angels desire to look into.</hi> That the Son of God should take the <hi>Nature of Man</hi> into subsistence with himself in the same Person, which was necessary for the effecting of this salvation, is a thing that the whole Creation must admire unto Eternity. And yet this is but an entrance into this work. For,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In <hi>this Nature</hi> he must be <hi>made under theLaw, Gal.</hi> 4.4. obnoxious to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of it, and boundto the obedience which it required. It became <hi>him to fulfillall righteousness,</hi> that he might be our Saviour: for <hi>though he were a Son, yet he was to learn and yield obedience.</hi> Without his perfect obedience unto the Law, our salvation could not be perfected. The <hi>Son of God must obey,</hi> that we may be accepted and crowned. The difficulties also, temptations and dangers that attended him in the course of his obedience are inexpressible. And surely this renders <hi>salvation by him very great.</hi> But yet there is that remains which gives it another Exaltation. For,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This Son of God, after the course of his obedience to the whole will of God, <hi>must die, shed his bloud,</hi> and make his soul an offering for sin. And herein the <hi>glory of this salvation</hi> breaks forth like the Sun in its strength. Obedient he must be <hi>unto death, the death of the cross, Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>If he will be a Captain of salvation to bring many sons to glory, he must himself be made perfect by sufferings, Heb.</hi> 2.10. There were Law and Curse and Wrath standing in the way of our salvation, all of them to be removed, all of them to be undergone, and that by the Son of God. For we were not redeemed with silver and gold, or corruptible things, <hi>but with the precious bloud of Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. And therein <hi>God redeemed his Church with his own bloud, Acts</hi> 20.28. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in assuredly was <hi>the love of God manifest, that he laid down his life for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. This belongs unto the <hi>means</hi> whereby our salvation is procured. Nor yet is this all, for if Christ had <hi>only died for us,</hi> our faith in him had been in vain, and we had been still in our sins. Wherefore,</p>
                        <p n="4">4. To carry on the same work, he <hi>rose from the dead,</hi> and now <hi>lives for ever</hi> to make intercession for us, and so save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by him. By these means was the salvation preached in the Gospel obtained, which surely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it to be <hi>great salvation.</hi> Would God have sent his Son, his <hi>only</hi> Son, and that in such a <hi>manner,</hi> were it not for the accomplishment of a work as well <hi>great and glorious</hi> init self, as indispensibly <hi>necessary</hi> with reference untoits end? Would the Son him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self have so <hi>emptied himself</hi> of his glory, condescended to so low a condition, wrestled withsuch difficulties, and undergone at length such a cursed and <hi>shameful death,</hi> had not the work been <hi>great</hi> wherein he was employed? O the blindness hardness and stupidityof the sons of men! they profess they believe these things to be <hi>true,</hi> at least they dare not deny them so to be; but forthe effect of them, for the <hi>salvation</hi> wrought by them, they value it the least of all things that they have any acquaintance withall. If <hi>this salvation</hi> thus procured do <hi>seize</hi> on them in their sleep, and fall upon them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no, they will not much resist it, provided that it cross them in none of their <hi>lusts</hi> purposes or pleasures. But to see the <hi>Excellency</hi> of it, to put a valuation upon it according to the price whereby it is purchased, that they are utterly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of. <hi>Hear, ye despisers, wonder and perish.</hi> Shall the <hi>Son of God</hi> shed his blood in vain? Shall he obey, and suffer, and bleed, and pray, and die, for a thing of nought? Is it nothing unto you that heshould undergo all these things? Was there want of <hi>Wisdom</hi> in God, or <hi>love</hi> unto his Son, so toemploy him, so to use him, in a business which you esteem of sovery small concernment, as that you will scarce turn aside tomake enquiry after it? Assure your selves these things are not so, as you will one day find unto your <hi>eternal ruine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, This salvation will appear to be <hi>great,</hi> if we shall consider what by it we <hi>are delivered from,</hi> and what we are <hi>interested in,</hi> or made partakers of by vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. These also may denominate <hi>salvation</hi> to be <hi>great,</hi> and they may therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered apart.</p>
                        <p>First, What are we <hi>delivered from by this salvation?</hi> In a word, Every thing that is <hi>evil</hi> in this world, or that which is to come. And all <hi>evil</hi> may be referred unto two
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50110:265"/>
heads. 1. That which <hi>corrupteth</hi> and depraveth the principles of our nature in their being and operation. And, 2. That which is <hi>destructive</hi> of our nature as to its <hi>well-being</hi> and happiness. The first of these is <hi>sin,</hi> the latter is <hi>punishment</hi>; and both of them take up the whole nature of <hi>evil.</hi> The particulars comprised in them may not here be distinctly and severally insisted on. The former containeth our <hi>Apostasie</hi> from God, with all the consequences of it; in darkness, folly, filth, shame, bondage, rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness, service of lust the world and Sathan, and therein constant rebellion against God, and diligence in working out our own everlasting ruine; all attended with a sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>stupidity</hi> in not discerning these things to be <hi>evil, hurtful, noisome,</hi> corruptive of our natures and beings; and for the most part with <hi>bruitish sensuality</hi> in the <hi>approbation</hi> and liking of them. But he who understands no <hi>evil</hi> in being fallen off from God, the <hi>first Cause, chiefest Good,</hi> and last End of all; in being under the power of a constant <hi>Enmity</hi> against him, in the <hi>disorder</hi> of his whole soul, and all the faculties of it, in the constant service of sin, the fruit of bondage and captivity in the most vile condition, will be <hi>awakened</hi> unto another apprehension of these things, when a time of deliverance from them shall be no more. The <hi>latter</hi> of these consists in the <hi>wrath or curse of God,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizeth what ever is or may be <hi>poenal</hi> and <hi>afflictive</hi> unto our Nature unto Eternity. Now from both these, with all their effects and consequences, are Believers delivered by this <hi>salvation,</hi> namely from <hi>sin and wrath.</hi> The Lord Christ was called <hi>Jesus, because he saves his people from their sins, Matth.</hi> 1.21. And he isalso the <hi>Saviour who delivers them from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.10. And this is <hi>great salvation.</hi> If a man be but the means of delivering another from poverty, imprisonment, or a <hi>dangerous disease,</hi> especially if such a one could be no otherwise delivered <hi>but by him,</hi> how <hi>great</hi> is the kindness of it esteemed tobe, and that deservedly? <hi>Providential deliverances</hi> from imminent dangers of <hi>death temporal,</hi> are looked on as <hi>great salvations,</hi> and that by <hi>good men,</hi> and so they ought to be, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. But what are all these unto this <hi>salvation?</hi> What is the <hi>sickness</hi> of the body, unto the <hi>disease,</hi> yea the <hi>death</hi> of the soul? What is imprisonment of the <hi>out-ward man,</hi> under the wrath of poor worms like our selves, and that for a fewdays, unto the <hi>chains of everlasting darkness?</hi> What is alittle <hi>outward want</hi> and poverty, to the want of the <hi>favour</hi> love and presence of God unto Eternity? What is <hi>death temporal,</hi> past in a moment, an end of troubles, anentrance into Rest, unto <hi>death eternal,</hi> an eternaldying, under the curse wrath and righteous vengeance of the holyGod? These things have no <hi>proportion</hi> one to another. So unexpressibly <hi>great is this salvation,</hi> that there is nothing left us to <hi>illustrate</hi> it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And this excellency of <hi>Gospel salvation</hi> will at length be known to them by whom at present it is <hi>despised,</hi> when they shall fall and perish under the want of it, and that to Eternity.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, This salvation is <hi>Great</hi> upon the account of the <hi>End</hi> of it, or that which it brings Believers unto. The deliverance of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> of old out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was <hi>great salvation</hi>; so doth God every where set it forth, and so did the people esteem it, and that justly. They who murmured under it, they who despised the <hi>pleasant land,</hi> fell all of them under the sore displeasure of God. But yet as this deliverance was but from <hi>temporal outward bondage,</hi> so that which it brought them unto was but <hi>outward rest</hi> for a few days, in a plentiful country; it gave them an inheritance of Houses and Lands and Vineyards in the <hi>Land of Canaan</hi>; but yet there also they <hi>quickly died,</hi> and many of them perished in their sins. But as we have seen what we are <hi>delivered from by this salvation,</hi> so the Excellency of the <hi>Inheritance</hi> which we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thereby is such, as no heart can conceive, no tongue can express. It brings us into the <hi>favour and love of God,</hi> unto the <hi>Adoption</hi> of children, into durable rest and peace; in a word, unto the <hi>enjoyment of God in glory eternal.</hi> Oh the <hi>Blessedness</hi> of this Rest, the Glory of this Inheritance, the Excellency of this Crown, the Eternity and unchangeableness of this Condition, the <hi>Greatness</hi> of this Salvation! how mean, how weak, how low, how unworthy are our <hi>apprehensions</hi> of it? yet surely through the blessed <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Spirit of Grace by the word of the Gospel, we see, we feel, we experience so much of it, as is sufficient to keep us up unto an holy Admiration and longing after it all the days of our pilgrimage here on earth.</p>
                        <p>It remaineth now that we declare the <hi>unavoidableness of their destruction who neglect this so great salvation.</hi> There are three things that make the punishment, or destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any person to be <hi>unavoidable.</hi> 1. That it be <hi>just and equal.</hi> 2. That there be no <hi>relief</hi> nor remedy provided for him. And, 3. That he to whom it <hi>belongs</hi> to inflict <hi>punishment,</hi> be <hi>able</hi> and <hi>resolved</hi> so to do: and they all concur to the height in this case. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="185" facs="tcp:50110:265"/>1. It is <hi>just and equal</hi> that such persons should be destroyed; whence the sentence concerning them is so <hi>decretory</hi> and absolute. <hi>He that believeth not shall be damned, Matth.</hi> 16.16. And the Holy Ghost supposeth this case so clear evident and undeniable, that he refers the proceedings of God therein unto the judgmentof sinners themselves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. And they who are judged on this account at the last day will be <hi>speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> have nothing to reply, nothing to complainof. And the <hi>sentence</hi> denounced against them will appearunto all to be righteous,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because they <hi>despise an overture of a treaty about Peace and Reconciliation</hi> between God and their souls. There is by nature an enmity between God and them, a state and condition whereby themselves alone would be <hi>losers,</hi> and that for ever. God who hath no need of them, nor their obedience or friendship, tenders them a <hi>Treaty</hi> upon terms of peace. What greater condescension love or grace could be conceived or desired? This is tendred in the Gospel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. Now what greater indignity can be offered unto him, than to <hi>reject his tenders,</hi> without so much as an enquiry after what his terms are, as the most do to whom the Gospel is preached? Is not this plainly to tell him, that they <hi>despise his love,</hi> scorn his offers of Reconciliation, and fear not in the least what he can do unto them? And is it not <hi>just</hi> that such persons should be <hi>filled with the fruit of their own ways?</hi> Let men deal thus with their <hi>Rulers</hi> whom they have provoked, that have power over them, and see how it will fare with them. Neither <hi>will God be mocked,</hi> nor shall his grace always be despised. When men shall see and learn by woful experience what pitiful poor worms they are, and have some beams of the Greatness Majesty and Glory of God shining upon them, how will they be filled with <hi>shame,</hi> and forced to subscribe to the righteousness of their own Condemnation for refusing his treaty and terms of Peace.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>These terms contain salvation.</hi> Men in the neglect of them neglect and refuse their own salvation: and can any man perish more <hi>justly</hi> than they who refuse to be saved? If God's Terms had been great, hard, and difficult, yet considering by <hi>whom</hi> they were proposed, and to whom, there was all the reason in the world why they should be accepted; and their destruction would be <hi>just</hi> thatshould not endeavour to preserve them unto the utmost. But now itis <hi>life</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> that he tenders, on whose ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect he complains, that men <hi>will not come unto him that they might have life.</hi> Certainly there can be no want of righteousness in the ruine of such persons. But,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That which the Apostle principally builds the <hi>Righteousness</hi> and inevitableness of the destruction of <hi>Gospel neglecters</hi> upon, is the <hi>greatness of the salvation</hi> tendered unto them; <hi>How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?</hi> How it is so, and wherein the greatness and excellency of it doth consist hath been be fore declared. Such and so great it is, that there is nothing which as inner, can <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>suffer,</hi> but it will deliver him from it; nothing that a creature can <hi>desire</hi> but it will bring him to the possession of it. And if this be <hi>despised,</hi> is it not righteous that men should perish? If we know not, yet God knows how to set a value upon this great Effect of his Love, Wisdom and Grace, and how to proportion punishment unto its contempt. The truth is, God alone is able sufficiently to revenge the <hi>greatness</hi> of this sin and indignity done unto him. We have before shewed how meet it was that the transgression of the <hi>Law</hi> should be punished with punishment eternal; and yet the Law had provided no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> for any in distress or misery, only taking men as it found them, in the first place it required obedience of them, and then promised a reward. And a good holy and righteous <hi>Law</hi> it was, both in its Commands and in its Promises and Threatnings. It found men in a good estate, and promised them a better on their obedience; wherein if they failed, it <hi>threatned</hi> them with the loss of their present condition, and also with the superaddition of eternal ruine. And in all this it was a clear effect of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness holiness and faithfulness of God. But the Gospel finds men in <hi>quite another state</hi> and condition, in a condition of <hi>misery</hi> and ruine, helpless and hopeless, and is provided on purpose both for their <hi>present relief,</hi> and future everlasting happiness. And shall they escape by whom it is despised? Is it not <hi>just and equal</hi> that it should prove a savour of death unto death unto them? Is it meet that God <hi>should be mocked,</hi> his Grace be despised, his Justice violated, his Glory lost, all, that <hi>sinners</hi> may go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished? Let them think so whilst they please, <hi>God</hi> thinketh otherwise, all the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven think otherwise, all the <hi>Saints</hi> from the beginning of the world unto the end of it think otherwise, and will glorifie Godto eternity for the righteousness of his judgments on them thatobey not the Gospel. But,</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Suppose the destruction of these persons be in itself <hi>righteous,</hi> yet there
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50110:266"/>
may be some remedy and relief provided for them, that they maynot actually fall under it; there may yet some <hi>way of escape</hi> remain for them, and so their ruine not be so <hi>unavoidable</hi> as is pretended. It hath been shewed that itwas <hi>a righteous thing</hi> that the transgressors of the <hi>Law</hi> should perish, and yet a way of escape is providedfor them; <hi>God is merciful,</hi> and things may be found atthe last day otherwise than now they are reported: at least allthat Faith, Diligence, Obedience and Holiness which is spoken of, is not required to free men from being <hi>neglecters of the Gospel</hi>; so that they who come short of them may nevertheless <hi>escape.</hi> I answer, that we are not now discoursing of the <hi>Nature</hi> of that Faith and Obedience which is required tointerest men in <hi>Gospel salvation.</hi> But certain it is, that it will be found to be that which the Word requires, and no other; even that <hi>faith which purifieth the heart,</hi> that faith which reformeth the life, that faith which is <hi>fruitful in good works,</hi> that faith which bringeth forth universal Holiness, <hi>without which no man shall see God.</hi> A faith consisting with the love and service of sin, with neglect of Gospel duties, with conformity to the Word, with a sensual profane or wicked life, will stand men in no stead in this matter. But this is not the subject of our present discourse. It may suffice in general that the <hi>Faith and Obedience</hi> which the Gospel requireth are indispensably necessary to free men from being Gospel despisers; what they are is all our concernment to enquire and learn: for where they are wanting there is no relief nor remedy, what ever wind and ashes of vain hopes men may feed upon and deceive themselves withall. It is true, there was a remedy provided for the <hi>transgression of the Law,</hi> and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy was, 1. <hi>Reasonable,</hi> in that there was no mixture of <hi>mercy or grace</hi> in that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation. And God saw meet to glorifie those properties of his Nature, as well as those which before shone forth in the Creation of all things, and giving of the Law. <hi>Pardoning mercy</hi> was not sinned against in the breach of the Law, and therefore that might interpose for a relief, which was done accordingly. And yet, 2. Neither would this have been either <hi>reasonable or righteous,</hi> if that only and last way of satisfying the Righteousness and the Law by the <hi>sufferings and Sacrifice of the Son of God</hi> had not intervened. Without this, Mercy and Grace must have eternally rested in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of God, without the least exercise of them; as we see they are in respect unto the <hi>Angels</hi> that sinned, whose Nature the Son of God <hi>assumed not,</hi> thereby to relieve them. And, 3. This relief was <hi>declared</hi> immediately upon the entrance of sin, and the promises of it renewed continually until it waswrought and accomplished. And hereby it became the <hi>subject</hi> of the whole Book of God, and the principal matter of all entercourse between God and sinners. But all these things fully discover, that there neither is, nor can any relief be provided for them that <hi>sin against the Gospel.</hi> For, (1.) From what spring, what fountain should it proceed? <hi>Mercy and Grace</hi> are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally sinned against in it, and their whole design of it therein defeated. The <hi>utmost</hi> of mercy and grace is already sinned against, and what remaineth now for the relief of a sinner? Is there any other Propertie of the Divine Nature whose consideration will administer unto men any ground of hope? Is there any thing in the <hi>Name of God</hi> in that Revelation that he hath made of himself by his Works, or in his Word, to give them encouragement? Doubtless nothing at all. But yet suppose that God had not laid out all the riches and treasures of his Wisdom Grace Love and Goodness in <hi>Gospel salvation by Jesus Christ,</hi> which yet he affirmeth that he hath; suppose that in Infinite Mercy there were yet a reserve for pardon; by what <hi>way</hi> and means (2.) Should it be brought forth and made effectual? We have seen that God neither would nor could ever have exercised <hi>pardoning mercy</hi> towards sinners, had not way been made for it by the <hi>Bloud of his Son:</hi> what then? Shall <hi>Christ die again</hi> that the despisers of the Gospel may be saved? Why besides that the Scripture affirms positively, that <hi>henceforth he dieth no more,</hi> and that there is no <hi>more sacrifice</hi> for sin, this is the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable thing that can be imagined. Shall he <hi>die again</hi> for them by whom his death hath been despised? Is the Bloud of Christ such a common thing, as to be so cast away upon the lusts of men? Besides, when should he <hi>make an end</hi> of dying? They who have once neglected the Gospel may do so upon a <hi>second trial,</hi> nay undoubtedly would do so, and thence should Christ <hi>often die, often be offered,</hi> and all still in vain. Neither hath God any <hi>other Son</hi> to send to die for sinners; he sent <hi>his only begotten Son once for all,</hi> and he that believeth not on him must perish for ever. In vain then will all mens expectations be from such a mercy as there is nothing to <hi>open a door unto,</hi> nor to make way for its exercise. Nay <hi>this mercy</hi> is a meer figment of secure sinners, there is no such thing in God. All the mercy and grace that God hath for his creatures is
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50110:266"/>
engaged in <hi>Gospel salvation</hi>; and if that be despised, in vain shall men look for any other. Neither, 3. Is there any word spoken concerning any such relief or remedy for <hi>Gospel neglecters. Pardon</hi> being provided for transgressions of the Law, instantly it is <hi>promised,</hi> and the whole Scripture is written for the manifestation of it; but as for a <hi>provision of mercy</hi> for them that <hi>despise theGospel,</hi> where is any one word recorded concerning it? Nay doth not the Scripture in all places fully and plainly witness against it? <hi>He that believeth not shall be damned. There remains no more sacrifice for sin. He that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> And will men yet feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with hopes of mercy whilst they neglect the Gospel? Well fare them who being not able to retrieve secure sinners, against this light and evidence of the want of any relief reielved for them, have carried the whole matter behind the curtain, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a <hi>Purgatory</hi> for them to help them when they are gone from hence, and cannot return to complain of them by whom they are deceived. But this also as all other reliefs will prove a <hi>broken reed</hi> to them that lean on it; for they who <hi>neglect the Gospel</hi> must perish, and that eternally, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Then all hopes of escaping must arise from hence, That <hi>he whose right it is, and on whom it is incumbent totake vengeance on them that n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>glect the Gospel, will not be able so to do, or at least not to such a degree, as to render it so fearful as is pretended.</hi> This need not much to be insisted on. It is <hi>God</hi> with whom men have to do in this matter. And they who allow his <hi>Being,</hi> cannot deny him to be <hi>Omnipotent</hi> and Eternal. Now what cannot he do who is so? It will at length be found to be a <hi>fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> There is unto wicked men the same everlasting cause of Being and Punishment. The same hand that upholds them, shall afflict them, and that for ever. What his Righteousness requires, his Power and Wrath shall execute unto the uttermost, so that there will be no escaping. And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>se are the holy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations on which all <hi>Gospel Threatnings and Comminations</hi> are built, which will all of of them take place and be accomplished, with no less certainty than the Promises themselves. Now from all that hath been spoken unto this Proposition we may learn,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To admire the <hi>Riches of the Grace of God,</hi> which hath provided so <hi>great salvation</hi> for poor sinners. Such and so great as it is, we stood in need of it. Nothing could be abated without our eternal ruine. But when Divine Wisdom, Goodness, Love, Grace and Mercy shall set themselves at work, what will they not accomplish? And the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of them doth the Scripture set forth in those expressions. <hi>So God loved theworld; God commendeth his love unto us; Greater love hath nonethan this; Riches of grace; Treasures of wisdom; Exceeding greatness of Power</hi>; and the like. In this will God be glorified and admired unto all Eternity. And in the contemplation hereof are we to be exercised here and hereafter; and thereby <hi>may we grow up into the image of God in Christ</hi>; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Which way soever we look, what ever we consider in it, here is that which will entertain our souls withdelight and satisfaction. The <hi>Eternal Counsel</hi> of God, the Person of Christ, his Mediation and Grace, the Promises of the Gospel, the evil and wrath we are freed from, the Redemption and Glory purchased for us, the Priviledges we are admitted unto a participation of, the Consolations and Joys of the Spirit, the Communion with God that we are called unto: how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are they in the eyes of Believers? or assuredly at all times ought they so to be. How can we enough bewail that vanity whence it is, that the mind suffereth it self to be possessed and filled with other things? Alas, what are they if compared to the excellency of this Love of God in Christ Jesus? Here lies our treasure, here lies our inheritance, why should not our hearts be here also? Were our minds fixed on these things as they ought, how would the glory of them cast out our cares, subdue our fears, sweeten our afflictions and persecutions, and take off our affections from the fading perishing things of this world? and make us in every condition <hi>rejoyce in the hopes of the glory that shall be revealed.</hi> And indeed we lose the sweetness of the life of faith, the benefit of our profession, the reward that is in believing, and are made a scorn to the world, and a prey unto temptations, because we dwell not enough in the contemplation of this <hi>great salvation.</hi> To stir us up then hereunto we may consider, 1. The <hi>excellency of the things themselves</hi> that are proposed unto our meditations; they are the <hi>Great,</hi> the <hi>Deep,</hi> the hidden things of the Wisdom and Grace of God. Men justifie themselves in spending their time and speculations about the <hi>things of Nature</hi>; and indeed the employment is better and more noble than what the generality of men do exercise themselves about. For some seldom raise their thoughts above the <hi>dunghills</hi> whereon they live; and some stuff their minds with such filthy imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50110:267"/>
as make them an Abomination to God, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.1, 2. They are conversant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about their own <hi>Lusts,</hi> and making Provision to fulfill and satisfie them. But yet what are these things which the <hi>better</hi> and more <hi>refined part</hi> of mankind doth search and enquire into, things that <hi>came out of nothing,</hi> and are returning thitherward apace; things which when they are known, do not much inrich the mind, nor better it at all as to its <hi>eternal condition,</hi> nor contribute any thing to the Advantage of their souls. But these things are <hi>eternal, glorious, mysterious,</hi> that have the characters of all Gods Excellencies enstamped upon them; whose knowledge gives the mind its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the soul its blessedness; <hi>John</hi> 17.3. This made <hi>Paul</hi> cry out that <hi>he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted all things to be but loss and dung in comparison of an acquaintance with them, Phil.</hi> 3.8. And the Prophets of old to <hi>search diligently</hi> into the nature of them; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11, 12. as the things which alone deserved to be enquired after; and which enquiry renders them <hi>noble in whom it is, Acts</hi> 17.11. and that which alone differenceth men in the sight of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23, 24.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Propriety</hi> in them. If we are believers these are <hi>our things.</hi> The <hi>Rich man</hi> is much in the contemplation of his <hi>Riches,</hi> because they are <hi>his own</hi>; and the Great man of his Power, because of his propriety in it. Men take little delight in being conversant in their minds about things that are not their <hi>own.</hi> Now all these things are <hi>ours</hi> if we <hi>are Christs,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. This salvation was <hi>prepared for us</hi> from all Eternity, and we are the <hi>heirs of it, Heb.</hi> 1.13. It was <hi>purchased for us</hi> by Jesus Christ; we have redemption and salvation by his blood; It is <hi>made over unto us</hi> by the promise of the Gospel, and <hi>conferred upon us</hi> by the Spirit of Grace. Are these things to be despised? Are they to be cast aside among the things wherein we are least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned? Or can there be any greater evidence, that we have no <hi>Propriety</hi> in them, than that would be, if our hearts should not be set upon them? What, all these Riches <hi>ours,</hi> all these <hi>Treasures,</hi> this goodly Inheritance, this Kingdom, this Glory; and yet we not be constant in thoughts and meditations about them? It is doubtless a sign at least, that we <hi>question</hi> our Title unto them, and that the Evidences we have of them will not endure the tryall. But <hi>wo unto us</hi> if that should be the end of our profession; and if it be otherwise, why are not our minds fixed on that which is <hi>our own,</hi> and which no man can take from us.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>The Profit and Advantage</hi> which we shall have hereby; which will be much eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way: for (1.) By this means we shall <hi>grow up into a likeness and conformity</hi> unto these things in our inward man. Spiritual Meditation will <hi>assimulate</hi> our minds and souls unto that which is the object of it. So the Apostle tells the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they were <hi>delivered into the form of the Doctrine preached unto them, Chap.</hi> 6.17. <hi>obeying it by faith, the likeness of it was brought forth upon their souls</hi>; and by the renewing of their minds, <hi>transformed quite into another image in their souls, Chap.</hi> 12.2. This the Apostle most excellently expresseth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. A constant believing contemplation of the Glory of God in this salvation by Christ, will <hi>change the mind into the image and likeness of it,</hi> and that by various degrees untill we attain unto perfection, when we shall know as we are known. Accustoming of our minds unto these things, will make them heavenly; and our affectious which will be conformed unto them, <hi>holy.</hi> This is the way to have Christ <hi>dwell plentifully in us,</hi> and for our selves to grow up into him who is our head. And is it nothing to get our minds <hi>purged</hi> from an evil habit, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining unto earthly things, or continually forging foolish and hurtful Imaginations in our hearts? This Meditation will cast the soul into <hi>another mould and frame</hi>; make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart a good treasure, out of which may be drawn at all times, Good things new and old.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Consolation and supportment under all Afflictions will from hence spring up in the soul.</hi> When the Apostle would describe that property of faith whereby it enables a Believer to do and suffer <hi>great things</hi> joyfully and comfortably, he doth it by its work and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this matter; it is saith he, <hi>the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen, Chap.</hi> 11.1. that is, it brings into the soul, and makes evident unto it, the <hi>great things of this salvation,</hi> the great things of the Love and Grace of God therein; and thus it doth no otherwise, than by a constant <hi>contemplation</hi> and holy <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration</hi> of them; and when this is once done, he multiplyes instances to evince what great Effects it will produce, especially in its enabling of us to go through difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, tryals and afflictions. And the same also he ascribeth unto <hi>Hope</hi>; which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the souls waiting and expectation to be made partaker of the <hi>fulness</hi> of this salvation, whose <hi>greatness</hi> and satisfactory Excellency it doth admire, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4, 5.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50110:267"/>
When any Affliction or Tribulation presseth upon a believer, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> can readily divert his thoughts from it, unto the <hi>rich grace of God</hi> in this salvation, which will fill his heart with such a sense of his love, as shall carry him above all the assaults of his trouble. And a direction to this purpose the Apostle pursues at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38. This is a <hi>safe harbour</hi> for the soul to betake it self unto in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry storm; as he teacheth us again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18. Whatever befalls us in our <hi>outward man,</hi> though it should press so sore upon us as to ruine us in this world, yet we <hi>faint not,</hi> we despond not; and the reason is, because these things which we suffer, bear no proportion unto what we enjoy or expect; and the way whereby this consideration is made effectual unto us, is by a constant <hi>Contemplation</hi> by faith on the great unseen things of this salvation, which takes off our minds and spirits from a Valuation of the things which we presently suffer and endure. And this experience assures us to be our only relief in afflictions, which undoubtedly it is our wisdom to be provided for.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The same may be said concerning <hi>Persecution,</hi> one especial part of Affliction, and commonly that which most entangles the minds of them that suffer. Now no man can endure Persecution quietly, patiently, constantly according to the Will of God, especially when the Devil pursues his old design of <hi>bringing it home unto their persons, Job.</hi> 2.5. unless he hath in readiness a greater Good which shall in its self, and in his own mind, out-ballance the evil which he suffers. And this the Grace of this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will do. The soul that is exercised in the contemplation and Admiration of it, will despise and triumph over all his outward sufferings which befall him on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his <hi>interest therein,</hi> as all Persecution doth. This the Apostle declares at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31, 32, 33, 34. He directs us to an holy Meditation on Gods <hi>electing Love,</hi> the Death and Mediation of Christ, the two springs of this Meditation. And thence <hi>leads us, v.</hi> 35, 36. to a supposition of the <hi>great and sore persecutions</hi> that may befall us in this world; and from the former consideration triumphs over it all, <hi>v.</hi> 37. with a joy and exaltation beyond that of Conquerors in a battle, which yet is the greatest that the nature of man is capable of, in and about temporal things. When the soul is prepossessed with the Glory of this Grace, and his <hi>interest therein,</hi> it will assuredly bear him up against all the threatnings, reproaches and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of this World; even as it did the Apostles of old; making them esteem, that to be their <hi>Honour and Glory</hi> which the World looked on as their <hi>shame; Acts</hi> 5.41. and without this the heart will be very ready to sink and faint.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This also will greatly tend unto the <hi>confirmation of our faith,</hi> by giving us a full <hi>Experience</hi> of the things that we do believe. Then the Heart is immovable, when it is established by Experience; when we find a <hi>substance,</hi> a reality, a spiritual nourishment in things proposed unto us. Now how can this be obtained, unless we are conversant in our minds about them? unless we dwell in our thoughts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon them? For thereby do we taste and find <hi>how good the Lord</hi> is in this work of his Grace. Thus this duty being on many accounts of so great importance, we may do well to consider wherein it consisteth; and there are these four things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto it.</p>
                        <p>First, Intense Prayer for a Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation to give us an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Mysterie and Grace of this <hi>great salvation.</hi> In our selves we have no <hi>inbred knowledge</hi> of it, nor can we by our own endeavours attain unto it. We must have a <hi>new understanding</hi> given us, or we shall not <hi>know him that is true,</hi> 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5.20. For notwithstanding the <hi>Declaration</hi> that is made of this Mysterie in the Gospel, we see that the most men live in Darkness and Ignorance of it. It is only the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> which can search <hi>these deep things</hi> of God and reveal them unto us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. By him must he, <hi>who commanded light to shine out of darkness, shine into our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of this glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. And therefore the Apostle prayes for the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that <hi>God would give unto them the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, in the knowledge of him, that the eyes of their understandings being opened, they may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us ward who believe, Chap.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19. And for the <hi>Colossians,</hi> that they might come <hi>unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the Mysterie of God, and of the Father, and of Christ, Chap.</hi> 2.2. that is, that they might have a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and saving acquaintance with the Mysterie of this <hi>great salvation,</hi> the Love, Grace, and Wisdom of God therein; which without <hi>this Spirit of Wisdom and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                           <pb n="190" facs="tcp:50110:268"/>
from above we shall not attain unto. This then in the first place is to be sought after; this are we to abide in; constant Prayers and supplications for the <hi>teaching,</hi> instructing, revealing, enlightning Work and Efficacy of this Spirit; that we may be enabled to look into these <hi>deep things of God</hi>; that we may in some measure <hi>with all Saints comprehend them,</hi> and grow <hi>wise in the Mysterie of salvation. Solomon</hi> tells us how this wisdom is to be obtained, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5. <hi>If thou cryest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voyce for understanding, if thou seekest for her as for silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures, then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God</hi>; It is by praying, crying, supplications, with diligence, and perseverance, that we attain this Wisdom; abide herein, or all other attempts will prove but vain. How many poor souls otherwise weak and simple, have by this means grown <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wise</hi> in the Mysterie of God? And how many more, <hi>wise in this world,</hi> through the neglect of it, do walk in darkness all their dayes?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Diligent <hi>study of the Word</hi> wherein this Mysterie of God is declared and proposed unto our faith, and holy contemplation; but this hath been spoken unto in part already, and must again be considered, and so need not here to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Sincere <hi>love</hi> unto, and <hi>delight</hi> in the things that are by the Spirit of God revealed unto us, is another part of this duty. Herein our Apostle declares what was his frame of heart, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. How doth his heart <hi>triumph</hi> in, and rejoyce over the <hi>knowledge</hi> he had obtained of Jesus Christ? and then indeed do we know any thing of the Grace of God aright, when our hearts are <hi>affected</hi> with what we know. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that the Saints of old, in their believing, <hi>rejoyced with joy unspeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 1.8. They discovered that in Christ which ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> their hearts leap within them, and all their affections to overflow with delight and joy. And this is an Essential part of this <hi>Holy Admiration,</hi> which distinguisheth it from that barren, fruitless, <hi>notional speculation</hi> of it, which some are contented withall. This are we to stir up our hearts unto in all our Meditations of the Grace of God, and not to rest untill we find them affected, satisfied and filled with an <hi>holy complacency,</hi> which is the most eminent evidence of our <hi>interest</hi> in, and Union unto the things that are made known unto us.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, All these things are to be attended with <hi>thankfulness and praise.</hi> This the Apostle was full of, and brake forth into, when he entred upon the description of this <hi>Grace, Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4. and this will be the frame of his heart, who is exercised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an <hi>holy admiration</hi> of it. When our Lord Jesus Christ considered the Grace of God in revealing the mysteries of this salvation unto his Disciples, it is said of him, <hi>that he reioyced in Spirit, Luke</hi> 10.21. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> his Spirit <hi>leaped in him</hi>; and he breaks forth into a solemn <hi>Doxologie,</hi> giving Praise and Glory unto God. And is it not their duty to whom they are revealed, to do that, which out of love unto them, our Lord Christ Jesus did on their behalf? <hi>Thankfulness</hi> for the things themselves, <hi>thankfulness</hi> for the Revelation of them, <hi>thankfulness</hi> for the Love of God, and the Grace of Jesus Christ in the one and the other, is a great part of this duty.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This will teach us, <hi>what esteem we ought to have of the Word of the Gospel, by which alone this great salvation is revealed and exhibited unto us</hi>; the great means and instrument which God is pleased to use in bringing us unto a participation of it. This one consideration is enough to instruct us unto what <hi>valuation</hi> we ought to make of it, what <hi>price</hi> we should set upon it, seeing we cannot have the <hi>pearl</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the purchase of this <hi>Field.</hi> Some neglect it, some despise it, some persecute it, some look upon it as <hi>foolishness,</hi> some as weakness, but unto them that believe, it <hi>is the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</hi> To further us in this duty, I shall take up some of those considerations, which the words we insist upon do offer unto us, and thereby also pass through what yet remains for our instruction in them. And we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Excellency and Preheminence</hi> of the Gospel, which ariseth from the first Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that is, the Lord Christ the Son of God. <hi>It was begun to be spoken unto us by the Lord</hi>; Herein the Apostle prefers it before the Law. It is <hi>that Word,</hi> which the Son came to reveal and declare from the <hi>bosome of the Father</hi>; and surely he deserves to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto; Hence it is so often called the <hi>Word of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because it treateth of him, but because it proceedeth from him, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is worthy of all Acceptation. And (2.) <hi>To neglect the Gospel is to neglect and despise the Son of God who was the Author of it,</hi> and consequently the Love and Grace of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50110:268"/>
God in sending him. So the Lord Christ tells them that preach the Gospel, <hi>he that despiseth you, despiseth me, and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.</hi> Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Gospel reflects immediately upon the Lord Christ and the Father; and therefore our Apostle bids us <hi>take heed that we despise not him who spake from Heaven,</hi> which can be no otherwise done, but by neglect of his word. Some pretend to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Christ, but they have no regard for his <hi>Word</hi>; yea, they may say of it as <hi>Ahab</hi> of <hi>Micaiah,</hi> that they <hi>hate</hi> it; and have therefore some of them endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the preaching of it out of the world, as the <hi>Papists</hi> have done: at least, have looked on it as an <hi>useless thing,</hi> that the Church might be well enough without. But such men will find themselves mistaken, when it is too late to seek after a remedy; the true Cause of their <hi>hatred</hi> unto the word, is because they can find no other way to express their <hi>hatred</hi> unto Christ himself. Neither did ever any man <hi>hate</hi> or loath the Gospel, but he that first hated and loathed Jesus Christ: but against the <hi>Word</hi> they have many <hi>pretences,</hi> against the Person of Christ none, that are as yet passable in the world; This makes the Word to bear that which is intended against Christ himself, and so will he interpret it at the last day. (3.) Consider, that this <hi>Word was confirmed and witnessed unto from Heaven, by the mighty Works and Miracles which attended the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation thereof.</hi> So our Apostle here informs us; and though we saw not those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, yet we have them left on <hi>infallible Record</hi> for our use, that by them we might be yet stirred up to <hi>value</hi> and attend unto the Word in a due manner. God hath so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered things in his holy Providence, that none can neglect the Word, without shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his eyes against such Light and Evidence of conviction, as will leave them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly inexcusable at the last day. Now from these and the like considerations; the duty proposed may be enforced.</p>

                        <p>THe Apostle in these Verses proceeds in the pursuit of his former design. From the Doctrine of the <hi>first Chapter,</hi> he presseth the Exhortation at the beginning of this, which we have passed through. The <hi>Foundation</hi> of that Exhortation was the Preheminence of the Lord Christ, the Author of the Gospel, above the Angels by whom the <hi>Law</hi> was spoken and delivered. This he now farther confirms, and that by an <hi>instance</hi> suited to his present Purpose, and not as yet by him insisted on. And he doth it the rather, because by the <hi>Testimonies</hi> wherewith he proves his Assertion, he is lead to the Consideration of other concernments of the Mediation of Christ, which he thought meet to declare unto these <hi>Hebrews</hi> also. And this <hi>method</hi> he is constant unto throughout this whole Epistle. In the midst of his Reasonings, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies for the Explanation or Confirmation of what he delivers <hi>dogmatically,</hi> he layes hold on some Occasion or other, to press his Exhortation unto <hi>Faith,</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with Constancy and Perseverance in the Profession of the Gospel. And in the <hi>Arguments</hi> which he enterweaveth, and Testimonies which he produceth for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of his Exhortations, something still offers it self, which accordingly he layes hold upon, leading him to some farther <hi>Explication</hi> of the Doctrine which he had in hand; so insensibly passing from one thing unto another; that he might at the same time <hi>inform</hi> the Minds, and <hi>Work</hi> upon the Affections of them with whom he dealt. All which will appear in our ensuing Exposition of these Verses.</p>

                        <p>The whole <hi>Verse</hi> contains an <hi>Assertion</hi> laid down in a negative Proposition, the Assumption of the Apostles Argument, or the proof of it supposed in a <hi>pro-syllogism,</hi> consisting in the ensuing Testimony with his Explication of it. And it is to this purpose. <hi>The World to come</hi> is not made subject unto <hi>Angels</hi>; but it was made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Jesus,</hi> and therefore he is exalted above them. This he proves from the Testimony of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> to this purpose; <hi>All things were made subject to man,</hi> who for a little while was made lower than Angels; but this <hi>man was Jesus</hi>; and this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption he proves from the Event: First, On the part of man absolutely considered; <hi>we see that all things were not made subject unto him</hi>; therefore he cannot be intended. Secondly, On the part of <hi>Jesus</hi>; All things in the <hi>event</hi> agree unto him: First, He
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50110:270"/>
was made for a <hi>little while lower than the Angels</hi>; which he shews the reason of, and thence takes occasion to discourse of his Death and Sufferings, according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod before declared; and then, <hi>he was crowned with Glory and Dignity,</hi> all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made subject unto him; from all which it appears, that it is <hi>he,</hi> and not <hi>Angels,</hi> unto <hi>whom the world to come</hi> is put in subjection. This is the <hi>series</hi> of the Apostles Discourse, wherein are many things <hi>difficult and hard to be understood,</hi> which must be particularly considered.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>first Verse,</hi> as was said, layes down the principal Assertion in a <hi>Negative Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The world to come is not made subject unto Angels.</hi> One Proof hereof is included in the words themselves. For that Expression, <hi>he hath not put in subjection</hi>; is the same with our Apostle, <hi>as, it is no where written or recorded in the Scripture</hi>; There is no Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of it. God is no where said to have done it, See <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.5. with the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. And these <hi>Negative Arguments</hi> from the Authority of the Old Testament, He esteemed in this matter, cogent and sufficient.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Proposition</hi> it self, (1.) The <hi>Subject</hi> of it, the <hi>World to come,</hi> with (2.) Its limitation, <hi>whereof we treat</hi>; and (3.)

                        <p>The Subject of the Proposition is, the <hi>World to come:</hi>

This we must farther confirm, as the foundation of the ensuing Exposition. That this then is the intendment of the Apostle; appeareth,</p>
                        <p>First, From the limitation annexed; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>concerning which we treat.</hi> This is the world whereof he treats with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in this Epistle; namely, the <hi>Gospel-State</hi> of the Church; the Worship whereof he had in the words immediately fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going pressed them unto the observation of: And not only so, but <hi>described</hi> it also, by that State wherein the <hi>miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost</hi> were given and enjoyed. And the mention of them, in the words directly preceding, is that description of the World to come, which the Apostle in these words refers unto, <hi>concerning which we speak.</hi> And the Tradition of this New World, or the Restauration of all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Messiah, was one of the principal Reports of Truth received among the Jews, which the Apostle presseth them withall.</p>
                        <p>Some suppose that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>we speak,</hi> is put for <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>we have spoken,</hi> and would have it refer unto <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.6. But what the Apostle there intendeth by the <hi>World,</hi> we have sufficiently evinced and declared. The <hi>World</hi> there by an usual <hi>Synechdoche</hi> is put for the habitable earth; the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which the <hi>Son of God</hi> made and came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>John</hi> 1.11. Here a <hi>certain state and condition</hi> of things in the world, <hi>about which he treated with the Hebrews,</hi> is intended.</p>
                        <p>Besides they who would thus change the word, <hi>(Grotius, Crellius, Schlictingius)</hi> by the <hi>world, Chap.</hi> 1.6. understand <hi>Heaven it self,</hi> the state of Glory, which is not here insisted on by the Apostle: For,</p>
                        <p>Secondly, He treats of that which was already done in the <hi>crowning of Jesus with Glory and Honor,</hi> as the words following do manifest. This <hi>crowning of him</hi> was upon his Ascension, as we have before proved at large. Then, was not the <hi>state of Glory</hi> made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto him, because it was not then, nor is <hi>yet</hi> in being. And therefore they who turn, <hi>we speak,</hi> into, <hi>we have before spoken,</hi> are forced also to pervert the following words, and to interpret; <hi>he hath made all things subject unto him,</hi> he hath purposed or decreed so to do; both without cause or reason. The World whereof the Apostle treats was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately made subject to Jesus; that is, the <hi>Church</hi> of the New Testament, when God anointed him <hi>King upon his holy Hill of Sion</hi>; and therefore in the <hi>Psalm</hi> is there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of those <hi>other parts of the Creation</hi> to be joyned in this subjection, that have no Relation unto Heaven.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The Apostle doth not <hi>treat directly</hi> any where in this Epistle concerning
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50110:271"/>
Heaven, or the world of the blessed to come; he frequently indeed mentions Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not absolutely, but as it belongs unto the Gospel world, as being the place of the constant residence of the High Priest of the Church, and wherein also the Worship of it is through faith celebrated.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The Apostle in these words insists on the <hi>Antithesis</hi> which he pursueth in his whole discourse between the <hi>Judaical</hi> and Evangelical Church-state; for what ever power <hi>Angels</hi> might have in and over things formerly, this <hi>World to come,</hi> saith he, is not <hi>made subject unto them.</hi> Now it is not Heaven and Glory that he opposeth to the Judaical Church-state and Worship, but that of the Gospel, as we shall find in the progress of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> which is therefore necessarily here intended.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, If by the World to come, the eternal blessed state of Glory be designed, to begin at or after the general Judgment; then here is a promise, that that blessed estate shall <hi>de novo</hi> be put in subjection to Jesus Christ as Mediator; but this is directly contrary unto what is else-where revealed by the same Apostle, concerning the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions between the Father and the Son as Mediator at that day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. <hi>And when all shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him who put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</hi> Which words if they do not absolutely assert the ceasing of the Kingdom of the Mediator, but only the order of all things unto Eternity in their subjection unto God by Christ, yet they are plainly exclusive of the grant of a <hi>new Power or Authority</hi> unto him, or of a-new making <hi>subject of all things</hi> unto him. Adde unto all this, that the Apostle proves the <hi>subjection of this world</hi> unto the Lord Christ, and not unto Angels, by a testimony expressing directly the present things of this world, <hi>antecedent</hi> unto the day of Judgment. From what hath been discoursed we conclude, that the <hi>World to come</hi> here expressed, is the State and Worship of the Church under the <hi>Messiah,</hi> called so by the Apostle according to the <hi>usual appellation</hi> which then it had obtained among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and allowed by him until the <hi>Mosaical Church-state</hi> was utterly removed. And he afterwards declares how this comprized Heaven it self also, because of the Residence of our High Priest in the Holiest not made with hands, and the continual admission of the Worshippers unto the Throne of Grace. This is the <hi>subject</hi> of the Apostles Proposition, that concerning which he treats.</p>
                        <p>Concerning this <hi>World</hi> the Apostle first declares <hi>negatively,</hi> that it is not <hi>made subject unto Angels.</hi> The subjecting of this <hi>World to come</hi> unto any is such a disposal of it, as that he or they unto whom it is put in subjection, should, as the Lord of it, erect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute or set it up, rule and dispose of it being erected, and <hi>judge</hi> or reward it in the end of its course and time. This is denied concerning <hi>Angels,</hi> and the denial proved <hi>tacitly,</hi> because no such thing is testified in the Scripture. And herein the Apostle either preventeth an Objection that might arise from the power of the <hi>Angels</hi> in and over the Church of old, as some think; or rather proceeds in his design of exalting the Lord Jesus above them, and thereby prefers the Worship of the Gospel before that prescribed by the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> For he seems to grant that the <hi>old Church</hi> and Worship were in a sort made <hi>subject unto Angels</hi>; this of the <hi>World to come</hi> being solely and immediately in his power, who in all things <hi>was to have the preeminence.</hi> And this will farther appear, if we consider the instances before mentioned, wherein the subjection of this <hi>World to come</hi> unto any doth consist.</p>
                        <p>First, It was not put <hi>in subjection unto Angels</hi> in its Erection or Institution. That work was not committed unto them, as the Apostle declares in the entrance of this Epistle. They did not <hi>reveal</hi> the Will of God concerning it, nor were intrusted with Authority to erect it. Some of them indeed were employed in <hi>messages</hi> about its preparatory work, but they were not employed either to <hi>reveal</hi> the mysteries of it wherewith they were unacquainted, nor <hi>authoritatively</hi> in the Name of God to erect it. For the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God in the nature and mystery of this work they <hi>knew not,</hi> but by the effects in the work it self, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.9, 10. which they looked <hi>and enquired into,</hi> to learn and admire, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. and therefore could not be intrusted with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for its Revelation, and the building of the Church thereon. But things were otherwise of old. The <hi>Law,</hi> which was the foundation of the <hi>Judaical Church-state,</hi> was given by the <hi>Disposition of Angels, Acts</hi> 7.53. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. And our Apostle here calls it the <hi>Word spoken by Angels.</hi> They were therefore intrusted by God to give the Law and the Ordinances of it unto the people in his Name and Authority, which being the foundation of the <hi>Mosaical Church-state,</hi> it was so far <hi>put in subjection</hi> unto them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="197" facs="tcp:50110:271"/>Secondly, It is <hi>not put in subjection</hi> unto Angels, as to the Rule and disposal of it being erected. Their Office in <hi>this world</hi> is a Ministery, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.13. not a Rule or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. Rule in or over the Church they have none, but are brought into a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of <hi>service</hi> with them that have the <hi>testimony of Jesus, Rev.</hi> 19.10. <hi>chap.</hi> 22.9. being equally with us subjected unto <hi>him,</hi> in whom they and we are <hi>gathered into one head, Ephes.</hi> 1.10. And from their <hi>ministerial presence</hi> in the Congregations of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, doth our Apostle press <hi>women unto modesty</hi> and sobriety in their habit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. And the Church of old had an apprehension of this truth, of the presence of <hi>an Angel</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> in their Assemblies, but so <hi>as to preside in them.</hi> Hence is that caution relating to the Worship of God, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.5, 6. <hi>Better it is that thou shouldst not vow, than thou shouldest vow and not pay; suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin, neither say thou before the Angel that it was an errour; why should God be angry at thy voice and destroy the work of thine hands.</hi> By <hi>vowing</hi> and <hi>not paying,</hi> a man brought upon <hi>his flesh,</hi> that is, himself and his posterity, a guilt not to be taken away with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses of haste or precipitation made unto the <hi>Angel</hi> presiding in their Worship, to take an account of its due performance. It is true, the absolute sovereign power over the Church of old, was in the Son of God alone; but an <hi>especial immediate power</hi> over it was committed unto Angels. And hence was the Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, God, <hi>Judge, Mighty One,</hi> communicated unto them, namely from their Authority over the Church, that Name expressing the <hi>Authority of God,</hi> when unto him ascribed. And because of this, their acting in the Name, and representing the Authority of God, the Saints of old had an apprehension, that upon their <hi>seeing of an Angel they should die,</hi> from that saying of God, that <hi>none should see his face and live, Exod.</hi> 33.20 So <hi>Manoah</hi> expresly, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.22. He knew that it was <hi>an Angel</hi> which appeared unto him, and yet says to his wife, <hi>We shall surely die because we have seen</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>an Angel,</hi> vested with the Authority of God. And hence it is not unlikely, but that there might be a <hi>respect or Worship</hi> due unto the <hi>Angels</hi> under the Old Testament, which themselves declare not to be meet for them under the New, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. not that they are <hi>degraded</hi> from any Excellency or Priviledge which before they enjoyed, but that the Worshippers under the New Testament, through their Relation unto Christ, and the Exaltation of their nature in his Person, are delivered from that <hi>under-age estate,</hi> wherein they differed not from <hi>servants, Gal.</hi> 4.1. and are advanced into an equality of liberty with the Angels themselves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24, 25. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.10 <hi>chap.</hi> 3.14, 15. As amongst men there may be a respect due from an <hi>inferiour</hi> to a <hi>superiour,</hi> which may cease when he is advanced into the same condition with the other, though the <hi>superiour</hi> be not at all abased. And to this day the <hi>Jews</hi> contend that <hi>Angels are to be adored</hi> with some kind of Adoration, though they expresly deny that they are to be <hi>invocated or prayed unto.</hi> Furthermore about their Power and Authority in the disposal of the outward concernments of the Church of old, much more might be declared from the <hi>Visions</hi> of <hi>Zechary</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> with their works in the two great typical deliverances of it from <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> But we must not here insist on particulars.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, as to the power of <hi>judging</hi> and rewarding at the last day, it is openly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that God hath not put <hi>this world to come</hi> in subjection unto Angels, but unto <hi>Jesus</hi> alone.</p>
                        <p>This then is the <hi>main Proposition</hi> that the Apostle proceeds upon in his present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The most glorious effect of the Wisdom Power and Grace of God, and that wherein all our spiritual concernments here are enwrapped, consists in that <hi>blessed Church state,</hi> with the eternal consequences of it, which having been promised from the foundation of the world, was <hi>now to be erected</hi> in the days of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> That you may, saith he, no more cleave unto your old institutions, because given out unto you <hi>by Angels,</hi> nor hearken after such works of <hi>wonder</hi> and <hi>terrour</hi> as attended their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Law in the Wilderness, consider that <hi>this world,</hi> so long expected and desired, this <hi>blessed estate,</hi> is not on any account made <hi>subject unto Angels,</hi> or committed unto their disposal; the Honour thereof being entirely reserved for another.</p>
                        <p>Having thus fixed the true and proper sense of this <hi>verse,</hi> we may stop here a little to consult the Observations that it offers for our own instruction. Many things in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular might be hence educed; but I shall insist on <hi>one only,</hi> which is comprehensive of the design of the Apostle, and it is, That</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This is the great priviledge of the Church of the Gospel, that in the things of the Worship of God, it is made subject unto, and immediately depends upon the Lord Jesus Christ, and not any other, Angels or Men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="198" facs="tcp:50110:272"/>That this is the <hi>priviledge</hi> thereof, and that it is a <hi>great and blessed</hi> priviledge, will both appear in our consideration of what it is, and wherein it doth consist. And among many other things, these ensuing are contained therein.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Lord Christ is our Head.</hi> So it was promised of old, that their <hi>King should pass before them, and the Lord on the head of them, Mic.</hi> 2.13. He shall be their King Head and Ruler. God hath now <hi>gathered all things,</hi> all the things of his Church, into an Head in Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.10. They were all scattered and disordered by sin, but are now all <hi>recollected</hi> and brought into order under one Head. Him hath he given to <hi>be Head over all things unto the Church, verse</hi> 22. The whole Sovereignty over all the <hi>whole Creation</hi> that is committed unto him, is only for this end, that he may be the more perfect and glorious Head to the Church. He is that <hi>Head</hi> on which the whole body hath its orderly and regular dependance, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>The head of the body the Church, Col.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The head of every man,</hi> that is of every believer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.23. And this is every where proposed both as our great Honour, and our great Advantage. To be united unto him, subjected unto him as our Head, gives us both honour and safety. What greater honour can we have, than to be free-men of that Corporation whereof he is the Head, than to be subjects of his Kingdom? What greater safety than to be united unto him ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>parably, who is in Glory, invested with all Power and Authority over the <hi>whole Creation</hi> of God, every thing that may do us good or evil.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That he is our <hi>only Head.</hi> The Church is so put <hi>in subjection</hi> unto the Lord Christ, as not to be <hi>subject</hi> unto any other. It is true, the Members of the Church, as <hi>men</hi> on the earth have other Relations, in respect whereof they are, or may be <hi>subject</hi> one to another; Children unto Parents, Servants unto Masters, People unto Rulers; but as they are <hi>Members of the Church,</hi> they are subject unto <hi>Christ</hi> and none other: If any other were or might be an Head unto them, they must <hi>be Angels</hi> or men. As for <hi>Angels,</hi> we have it here plainly testified, that the Church is not made <hi>subject</hi> in any thing unto them. And amongst men, the <hi>Apostles</hi> of all others might seem to lay the justest claim to this Priviledge and Honor. But they openly disclaim any pretence thereunto. So doth <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>We have no Dominion, Rule, Lordship, Headship, over your faith,</hi> any thing that concerns your obedience to God, and your Worship, <hi>but are helpers of your joy.</hi> And again saith he, <hi>We preach not our selves but Jesus Christ, the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>rd, the only Lord, and our selves your servants for Jesus sake,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. And <hi>Peter</hi> as it should seem, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing that some who should come after would pretend unto such <hi>Preheminence,</hi> warns the Elders that they should not think themselves <hi>Lords over Gods heritage,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. And this they did in pursuit of the instructions and charge which their Lord and Master gave them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.25, 26, 27. where he warns them, that they should neither think of Dignity nor Dominion <hi>over the Church,</hi> but apply themselves with all Humility unto the service of it; for which he else-where addes his reason, namely that all his <hi>Disciples have one Lord and Master, and no more, Joh.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.9, 10. And it is a woful confusion that the <hi>Papists</hi> run themselves into in this matter. For first, they put the whole Church into <hi>subjection unto a man,</hi> whom they call the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>common Father and Master of Christians,</hi> the Head of the Church; and then <hi>subject both him and it</hi> unto <hi>Angels,</hi> in the Adoration and Invocation of them, the greatest subjection possible; when the Scripture assigneth <hi>one only Head of the Church</hi> expresly, even the Lord Jesus, and fully declares that it is <hi>not put in subjection unto Angels</hi> at all. But to pass them by, the Lord Christ is not only thus the only Head in general unto the <hi>whole Church,</hi> but also unto <hi>every individual Believer</hi> in the Church; <hi>The Head of every man is Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. He is so to every believer <hi>respectively</hi> and severally; and that in both those senses wherein he is an Head, that is according to the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>metaphorical</hi> use of the word: For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He is the only <hi>Head of Vital Influence</hi> to the whole Church, and every member thereof. As from the <hi>natural Head</hi> all influences of life, for subsistence, motion, acting, guidance and direction are communicated unto the <hi>whole body,</hi> and to every member thereof: so from the Lord Christ alone, as he is the <hi>spiritually vital Head</hi> of the Church, in whom are the springs of life and all quickning grace, there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto the whole Church, and every believer therein, both the first quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vital principle of life it self, and all succeeding supplies and influences of grace, for the <hi>enlivening,</hi> strengthning, acting, guiding and directing of them. This himself declares by comparing the Relations of all believers unto him, unto that of <hi>branches unto the Vine, Joh.</hi> 15.2, 4. which have <hi>no life</hi> but by vertue of their union unto the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50110:272"/>
                           <hi>Vine,</hi> nor sap for <hi>fruitfulness</hi> but what is derived therefrom, which he teacheth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, <hi>verse</hi> 5. <hi>Without me,</hi> saith he, <hi>ye can do nothing.</hi> And this the Apostle lively sets out unto us, in the similitude of the <hi>natural body, Col.</hi> 2.19. And this placing of all <hi>fulness in the Lord Christ,</hi> as the Head of the Church, that thence the whole and every member of it might derive needful supplies to themselves, is fully taught us in the Gospel. Hence the Church is called the <hi>fulness of Christ, Ephes.</hi> 1.2, 3. or that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Christ communicates of his <hi>All-fulness</hi> of Grace, until it comes unto the <hi>measure</hi> or degree of growth and perfection, which he hath graciously assigned unto it. And none I suppose will contend, but that the Lord Christ is the alone and only Head of the Church in this sense. It hath not a spiritual dependance on any other for grace. There is indeed I know not what <hi>monster</hi> lies in the Opinion of them, who take upon themselves to <hi>confer grace</hi> unto others by vertue of such things as they do unto them, or for them; but this we do not now consider. If any man think he may have <hi>grace</hi> from any but Christ alone, be they Angels or men, let him turn himself unto them, but withall know assuredly, that he forsakes the <hi>Fountain of living waters</hi> for <hi>broken cisterns,</hi> which will yield him no relief.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He is the only Head of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> unto the whole Church, and every member thereof. This <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Government</hi> of the Church concerneth all that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which it yields unto God in his Worship. And unto an <hi>Head</hi> herein it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that he give perfect Rules and Laws for all things necessarily belonging thereunto, and to take care that they be observed. And here a great contest ariseth in the world. The Papists in behalf of their Pope and others under him, contend to be <hi>sharers</hi> with the Lord Christ in this his <hi>Headship</hi>; and fain they would perswade us, that he himself hath appointed that so it should be. The Scripture tells us, that he <hi>was faithful</hi> in the whole house of God, as was <hi>Moses,</hi> and that as a <hi>Lord over his own house,</hi> to <hi>erect, rule,</hi> and establish it; and himself when he gives commission unto his Apostles, bids them to <hi>teach men to do and observe all that he had commanded them:</hi> And accordingly they tell us, that they <hi>delivered unto us what they received from the Lord</hi>; and command us not to be <hi>wise above what is written.</hi> But I know not how it is come to pass, that these men think, that the Lord Christ is not a <hi>compleat Head</hi> in this matter, that he hath not instituted all Rules and Laws that are <hi>needful</hi> and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the right discharge of the Worship of God, and Obedience of the Church therein; at least that somewhat may be added unto what he hath appointed, that may be much to the advantage of the Church. And this they take to be their work, by vertue of I know not what <hi>unsealed warrant,</hi> unwritten commission. But to adde any thing in the Worship of God unto the Laws of the Church, is to exercise Authority over it, <hi>dominion over its faith</hi>; and to pretend that this <hi>world to come,</hi> this blessed Gospel Church-state is put in subjection unto them, although it be <hi>not so to Angels.</hi> A vain and proud pretence, as at the last day it will appear. But you will say, Christ gives his Laws only unto his whole Church, and not to <hi>individual believers,</hi> who receive them from the Church, and so he is not an <hi>immediate Head</hi> unto every one in particular. I answer, That the Lord Christ commits his Laws unto the Churches ministery to <hi>teach them</hi> unto believers; but his <hi>own Authority</hi> immediately affects the soul and conscience of every believer. He that subjects himself aright unto them, doth it not upon the authority of the Church <hi>by whom they are taught and declared,</hi> but upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Christ by whom they are <hi>given and enacted.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. It appears from hence, that as he is our <hi>only Head,</hi> so he is our <hi>immediate Head.</hi> We have our immediate dependance upon him, and our immediate access unto him. He hath indeed appointed <hi>means</hi> for the communicating of his grace unto us, and for the exercising of his Rule and Authority over us. Such are all his Ordinances with the Offices and Officers that he hath appointed in his Church; the first whereof he requires us to be constant in the use of, the latter he requires our obedience and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission unto. But these belong only unto the <hi>way</hi> of our dependance, and hinder not but that our dependance is <hi>immediate</hi> on himself, he being the immediate Object of our <hi>Faith and Love.</hi> The soul of a believer rests not in any of these things, but only makes use of them to confirm his faith in <hi>subjection unto Christ.</hi> For all these things are <hi>ours</hi>; it is appointed for our use, and we are <hi>Christs, as he is Gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. And so have we our immediate access unto him, and not as some foolishly imagine by <hi>Saints and Angels,</hi> and by him to God, even to the Throne of Grace.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This priviledge is greatly augmented, in that the Church being made subject unto Christ alone, and cast into a dependance upon him, he <hi>will assuredly take care of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50110:273"/>
all its concernments,</hi> seeing unto him only doth it betake it self. The Church made it of old part of her plea, that she was as one <hi>fatherless, Hos.</hi> 14.3. that is every way <hi>helpless,</hi> that had none to relieve or succour her. And the Lord Christ giveth this as a reason why he stirreth up himself unto the assistance of his people, because there was <hi>no man that appeared for their help,</hi> no <hi>Intercessor</hi> to interpose for them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.16. Now God having placed the Church in this condition, as to be oft-times altogether <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans</hi> in this world, to have none to give them the least countenance or assistance, and the Church it self chusing this condition, to renounce all hopes and expectations from any else beside, betaking it self unto the Power Grace and Faithfulness of the Lord Christ alone, it cannot as it were but be a great Obligation upon him to <hi>take care of it,</hi> and to provide for it at all times. They are <hi>members</hi> of his Body, and he alone is their Head; they are <hi>Subjects</hi> of his Kingdom, and he alone is their <hi>King</hi>; they are <hi>Children</hi> and Servants in his Family, and he alone is their <hi>Father</hi> Lord and Master; and can he forget them, can he disregard them? Had they been committed to the care of men, it may be some of them would have fought and contended for them; though their <hi>faithfulness</hi> is always to be suspected, and their strength is a thing of nought: Had they been put into subjection unto <hi>Angels,</hi> they would have <hi>watched</hi> for their good; though their Wisdom and Ability be both finite and limited, so that they could never have <hi>secured</hi> their safety; and shall not the Lord Jesus Christ, now they are made his special care, as his Power and Faithfulness is infinitely above those of any mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And all these things do sufficiently set out the Greatness of that priviledge of the Church which we insist upon. And there are two things that make this Lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rty and Exaltation of the Church <hi>necessary</hi> and reasonable.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That God having exalted <hi>our nature</hi> in the Person of his Son, into a condition of Honour and Glory, so as to be worshipped and adored by <hi>all the Angels</hi> of Heaven, it was not meet nor convenient that it should in our persons, when united unto Christ as our Head, be made subject unto them. God would not allow, that whereas there is the <hi>strictest union</hi> between the Head and the Members, there should be such an interposition between them, as that the <hi>Angels</hi> should depend on their <hi>Head,</hi> and the <hi>Members</hi> should depend on <hi>Angels</hi>; which indeed would utterly destroy the Union and immediate <hi>entercourse</hi> that is and ought to be between them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God is pleased by Jesus Christ to take us into <hi>an holy communion with himself,</hi> without any other <hi>medium</hi> or means of communication, but only that of our nature, <hi>personally and inseparably</hi> united unto his own Nature in his Son. And this also our <hi>subjection unto Angels</hi> is inconsistent withall. This order of dependance the Apostle declares, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>All things are yours, and you are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</hi> As there is no interposition between God and Christ, no more is there between Christ and us; and in and by him alone do we relate unto God himself. And this should teach us,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The equity and necessity of our universal obedience unto God in Christ. He hath freed us from <hi>subjection</hi> unto men and Angels, that we might serve him, and live unto him. He hath taken us to be his peculiar ones, his lot and portion, from whom he expects all his Reverence of Glory out of this world. And he hath left us no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, no excuse for the <hi>neglect</hi> of any duties of obedience that he requireth of us. We cannot plead that we had <hi>other work</hi> to do, <hi>other Lords</hi> and Masters to serve; he hath set us free from them all, that we might be his. If a King take a servant into his family, and thereby free and discharge him from being liable unto any other duty or service what ever; may he not justly expect that such a one will be <hi>diligent</hi> in the observation of all his commands; especially considering also the Honour and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that he hath by being taken near unto his person, employed in his affairs; And shall not God much more expect the like from us, considering how exceedingly the priviledge we have by this relation unto him surpasseth all that men can attain by the favour of <hi>earthly Princes.</hi> And if we will choose <hi>other Lords</hi> of our own to serve, if we are so regardless of our selves as that we will <hi>serve our lusts and the world,</hi> when God hath had such respect unto us, as that he would not suffer us <hi>to be subject unto the Angels of heaven,</hi> how inexcusable shall we be in our sin and folly? <hi>You shall be for me,</hi> saith God, <hi>and not for any other</hi> what ever. And are we not miserable if we like not this agreement?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For the <hi>manner</hi> of our obedience, how ought we to endeavour that it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with all holiness and reverence: <hi>Moses</hi> makes this his great argument with
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50110:273"/>
the people for Holiness in all their Worship and services; because <hi>no people had God so nigh unto them as they had.</hi> And yet that nearness which he insisted on, was but that of his Institutions, and some visible Pledges and Representations therein of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence among them; now much more cogent must the considerations of this real and <hi>spiritual nearness</hi> which God hath taken us unto himself in, by Jesus, needs be to the same purpose. All that we do, we do it immediately unto <hi>this holy God</hi>; not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Eye, and in his Presence; but in an especial and immediate <hi>relation</hi> unto him by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

                        <p>THe Apostle hath shewed; that the <hi>World to come</hi> which the Judaical Church look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, was not made <hi>subject unto Angels,</hi> no mention of any such thing being made in the Scripture.

                        <p n="1">1. The way and manner of his <hi>introducing</hi> this Testimony which is peculiar.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Testimony it self produced</hi>; with an Explication of the meaning and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Words, in the <hi>Place</hi> from whence it is taken.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Application</hi> of it unto the Apostles purpose, both as to the <hi>Person</hi> intended, and as to the especial <hi>End</hi> aimed at. And,</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Farther unfold, what the Apostle adds about the <hi>death and sufferings</hi> of Christ, as included in this Testimony, though not intended as to the first use and design of it. And,</p>

                        <p>First, The <hi>manner</hi> of his citing this Testimony is somewhat peculiar. <hi>One testified in a certain place:</hi> Neither person nor place being specified. As though he had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, a <hi>certain Person</hi> whom he would not name. But the Reason of it is plain; both <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> were sufficiently known to them to whom he wrote. And the <hi>Syriack Translation</hi> changeth the Expression in the Text into, <hi>but as the Scripture witnesseth and saith</hi>; without Cause. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> were not ignorant <hi>whose</hi> words they were which he made use of, nor <hi>where</hi> they were recorded. The <hi>one</hi> there mentioned is <hi>David</hi>; and the <hi>certain place</hi> is the <hi>eighth Psalm</hi>; whereof much need not to be added. A <hi>Psalm</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>of the High Praises of God</hi>; and such <hi>Psalms</hi> do mostly, if not all of them respect the <hi>Messiah</hi> and his Kingdom, as the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves acknowledge. For the time of the <hi>Composure</hi> of this <hi>Psalm</hi> they have a conjecture which is not altogether improbable; namely, that it was in the <hi>Night</hi> whilest he kept his Fathers sheep. Hence in his Contemplation of the Works of God, he insists on the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> then gloriously presenting themselves unto him, not mentioning the <hi>Sun</hi> which appeared not. So also in the Distribution that he makes of the things here below that amongst others are made subject unto man, he fixeth in the first place on <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>flocks of Sheep,</hi> which were then peculiarly under his care. So should <hi>all the works</hi> of God, and those especially about which we are <hi>conversant</hi> in our particular Callings, excite us to the Admiration of his Glory, and Praise of his name: And none are usually more void of holy thoughts of God, than those who set themselves in <hi>no way</hi> acceptable unto him. This is the place from whence this <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi>
                           <pb n="202" facs="tcp:50110:274"/>
is taken; whose especial Author the Apostle omitteth, both because it was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known, and makes no difference at all who ever was the <hi>Penman</hi> of this or that Portion of Scripture, seeing it was all equally given by <hi>Inspiration from God,</hi> whereon alone the authority of it doth depend.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Testimony it self</hi> is contained in the words following, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>What is man, &amp;c.</hi> Before we enter into a particular <hi>Explication</hi> of the words, and of the Apostles <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of them, we may observe that there are two things in general, that lye plain and clear before us: As,</p>
                        <p>First, That <hi>All things whatsoever, are said to be put in subjection unto man</hi>; that is, unto Humane Nature in one or more Persons, in opposition unto Angels, or nature Angelical. To express the former, is the plain Design and Purpose of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> as we shall see. And whereas there is <hi>no such Testimony</hi> any where concerning <hi>Angels,</hi> it is evident, that the meaning of the word is, <hi>unto man, and not unto Angels</hi>; which the Apostle intimates in that <hi>adversative</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>but</hi>; but <hi>of man</hi> it is said, not of Angels.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That this Priviledge was never <hi>absolutely</hi> nor universally made good in, or unto the <hi>nature of man,</hi> but in, or with respect unto the Person of Jesus Christ the <hi>Messiah.</hi> This the Apostle call us to the consideration of, previously unto his Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Testimony in a peculiar manner unto <hi>Jesus; v.</hi> 8. <hi>We s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>e not all things.</hi> Now there is not any thing absolutely necessary to make good the Apostles <hi>Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> but what is comprized in these two general Assertions, which lye evident in the Text, and are acknowledged by all. We shall therefore distinctly consider the Testimony it self. The whole of it consists in a <hi>Contemplation</hi> of the Infinite Love and Condescension of God towards man; which is set out, (1.) In the <hi>manner</hi> of the expressing it. (2.) In and by the <hi>words</hi> of the Expression; (3.) In the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Mind and Will of God, wherein that Condescension and Grace consisted; and (4.) In the <hi>Effects</hi> thereof, in his dispensation towards him.</p>
                        <p>First, In the <hi>manner of the Expression; What is man</hi>; by way of Admiration, yea, he cryes out with a kind of astonishment. The immediate Occasion hereof is omitted by the Apostle, as not pertinent unto his purpose; but it is evident in the <hi>Psalm. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> having exercised his thoughts in the contemplation of the Greatness, Power, Wisdom and Glory of God, manifesting themselves in his <hi>mighty works,</hi> especially the Beauty, Order, Majesty, and usefulness of the Heavens, and those glorious bodies which in them present themselves to all the world, falls thereon into this Admiration, that this great, and infinitely Wise God, who by the word of his mouth gave Being and Existence unto all those things, and thereby made his own Exellencies conspicuous to all the world, should condescend unto that <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Regard</hi> of man, which on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion his thoughts fixed themselves upon. <hi>What is man,</hi> saith he? And this is, or should be the great <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>se</hi> of all our Contemplation of the works of God; namely, that considering his Wisdom and Power in them, we should learn to admire his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> in setting his heart upon us, who are every way so unworthy, seeing he might for ever satisfie himself, in those other appearingly more glorious products of his <hi>Power</hi> and Godhead.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, He farther expresseth his Admiration at this Condescension of God in the words that he useth, intimating the <hi>Low</hi> and mean <hi>Estate</hi> of man in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <gap reason="foreign">

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, are <hi>Sons of men</hi> in Place, Power and esteem. So these words are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, <hi>Psalm</hi> 62.9. where we translate <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Thirdly, He expresseth this <hi>Condescension</hi> of God in the <hi>Affections and acting</hi> of his mind towards man; <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>that thou shouldst be mindful of him.</hi> To <hi>Remember</hi> in the Scripture when ascribed unto God, alwayes intends some <hi>Act</hi> of his mind, and <hi>Purpose</hi> of his Will, and that either for good or evil towards them that are remembred, in a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manner. So also is Remembrance it self used; On this account God is said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>remember us for good,</hi> and sometimes to <hi>remember our sins no more.</hi> So that it denotes the <hi>Affection</hi> of the mind of God towards any creature for Good or Evil, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Purpose of his Will to act towards them accordingly. In the first way it is here used, and so also by <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 7.17. <gap reason="foreign">

The frame of the heart and mind of God towards the <hi>Nature of man</hi> in the Person of Jesus Christ, in reference unto all the Good that he did <hi>in it</hi> and by it, is intended in this Expression. The whole <hi>Councel</hi> and Purpose of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the salvation of mankind, in and by the Humiliation, Exaltation, and whole Mediation of the man Christ Jesus is couched herein.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, There are in this <hi>Condescension</hi> the <hi>Effects</hi> of this Act of Gods Mind and Will in remembring of man; And they are expressed (1.) Under one General head, and (2.) In Particular Instances of them.</p>
                        <p>First, The general effect of Gods remembring man, is that he <hi>visiteth him.</hi> As the same word is used in <hi>Job,</hi> in the place before mentioned. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                              </gap>riour towards an inferiour.</hi> And though it be often otherwise used; yet commonly it expresseth the acting of God towards his people for good. And in especial is this term of <hi>visiting</hi> used to express the acting of of God in doing of us <hi>good</hi> by sending of Jesus Christ to take our nature on him, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.68. <hi>He hath visited</hi> and redeemed his people. And to the same purpose, <hi>v.</hi> 78. <hi>The day spring from on high hath visited us,</hi> both relating to the acting of God towards us in the Person of his Son incarnate. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.16. This term therefore of <hi>visiting</hi> doth not precisely design Gods acting in the Exaltation of <hi>him visited,</hi> but such an ordering of things towards him, as is attended with great Care, Grace and Love; So was the <hi>nature of man</hi> in the Heart of God to do good unto it, in and by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Jesus Christ, and so he acted towards it, or <hi>visited it.</hi> This is that which was the ground of the <hi>Psalmists</hi> admiration, and which will be so in all believers unto <hi>Eternity.</hi> It was not the outward state and condition of <hi>mankind in the world,</hi> which since the entrance of sin is sad and deplorable, that excites this admiration in the <hi>Psalmist</hi>: But his mind is intent upon the Mysterie of the Grace, Wisdom and Love of God in the Person of the Messiah.</p>

The <hi>measure</hi> of that Depression, <hi>than the Angels.</hi> (3.) His duration in that State and Condition, <hi>a little while.</hi>

                           </gap>, and that properly; They both signifie a <hi>Diminution</hi> of State and Condition; a <hi>depression</hi> of any one from what he before enjoyed. And this in the first place belongs unto Gods Visitation. And the acting of the <hi>Will</hi> of Christ in this matter, suitably unto the <hi>Will</hi> of the Father, is expressed by words of the same importance. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <p>Secondly, The <hi>measure</hi> of this Humiliation and Depression is expressed in reference unto Angels, with whom he is now compared by the Apostle; he was made <hi>less than the Angels.</hi> This the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had seen and knew; and might from his <hi>Humiliation</hi> raise an Objection against what the Apostle asserted about his <hi>Preference</hi> above them. Wherefore he acknowledgeth, that he was made less than they, shews that it was <hi>foretold</hi> that <hi>so he should be,</hi> and in his following Discourse, gives the Reasons <hi>why it was so to be.</hi> And he speaks not of the Humiliation of Christ absolutely, which was <hi>far greater than here it is expressed</hi> by him, as he afterwards declares, but only with respect unto Angels, with whom he compares him; and it is therefore sufficient to his purpose at present to shew that he was made <hi>lower than they.</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. <hi>Hierom</hi> renders the word in the Psalm, <hi>à Deo, then God</hi>; and <hi>Faher Stapulensis</hi> had a long contest with <hi>Erasmus</hi> to prove that they should be so rendered in this place; which is plainly to contradict the Apostle, and to accuse him of corrupting the word of God. Besides the sense contended for by him and others, is <hi>absurd</hi> and foolish; namely, that the Humane Nature of Christ was made <hi>little l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ss than God,</hi> and <hi>humbled</hi> that it might be so; when it was <hi>infinitely less</hi> than the Divine Nature, as being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. The <hi>LXX.</hi> and all old <hi>Greek Translations</hi> read <hi>Angels</hi>; That <hi>Elohim</hi> is often used to denote them we have proved before. The <hi>Targum</hi> hath <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Angels.</hi> And the <hi>scope</hi> of the place necessarily requires that sense of the word. God then in his Visitation of the nature of man, in the Person of his Son, put it, and therein <hi>him that was invested in it,</hi> into a condition of wants and streights, and humbled him beneath the condition of Angels, for the blessed Ends afterwards declared. For although from his Incarnation and Birth, the Angels adored his Person as their Lord; yet in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition of his Humane Nature, he was made <hi>exceedingly beneath</hi> that state of Glory and Excellency, which the Angels are in a constant Enjoyment of.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, There is a <hi>space of time,</hi> a Duration intended for this condition. He made him lower, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>for a little while,</hi> or a short season. That <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, is often used in that sense, and that, that is the proper notation of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, we have shewed before. But that which renders that sense of the words here unquestionable, is the Apostles precise restraining them thereunto in <hi>v.</hi> 9. as we shall see. It was but <hi>for a little while,</hi> that the Person of Christ in the Nature of man was brought into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition more indigent than the state of Angels is exposed unto: Neither was he for that season <hi>made a little,</hi> but <hi>very much lower</hi> than the Angels. And had this been the whole of his state it could not have been an Effect of that inexpressible Love and Care which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> so admires. But being it is but for a <hi>little continuance,</hi> and that for the blessed Ends which the Apostle declares, nothing can more commend them unto us.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, There is another <hi>Effect</hi> of Gods Visitation of man in his <hi>Exaltation</hi>; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, 1. In the <hi>Dignity</hi> whereunto he advanced him: and 2. In the Rule and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he gave unto him.</p>
                        <p>For the first, He <hi>crowned him with Glory and Honour,</hi>

                           </gap>; is <hi>insigne regium</hi>; the badge and token of Supream and Kingly Power. Hence when <hi>David</hi> complains of the straightning and Diminution of his Power or Rule, he says, <hi>his Crown was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned unto the ground, Psal.</hi> 89.39. That is, made contemptible, and trampled on. To be <hi>crowned</hi> then, is to be invested with <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> or with Right and Title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; as it was with <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was <hi>crowned</hi> during the life of his Father. Nor is it an <hi>ordinary Crown</hi> that is intended, but one accompanied with <hi>Glory and Honour.</hi> To be crowned with Glory and Honour, is to have a <hi>glorious and honourable Crown,</hi> or Rule and Soveraignty. <gap reason="foreign">

the Apostle speaks in Allusion to the Primitive signification of this word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. The other its <hi>Beauty and Glory</hi>; both Authority and Majesty. How Christ was thus <hi>crowned,</hi> we have at large shewed on the first Chapter.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This Soveraignty is attended with actual Rule; Wherein (1.) The <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> it self is expressed: and (2.) The <hi>Extent</hi> of it. First, Thou madest <hi>him have Dominion over the works of thy hands</hi>: <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And Secondly, The <hi>Extent</hi> of this Dominion is the Works of Gods hands. And least any from this indefinite Expression should think this Rule li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, either to the things mentioned before by the <hi>Psalmist, v.</hi> 4. called the <hi>work of Gods fingers,</hi> that is, the Heavens, the <hi>Moon</hi> and the <hi>Stars,</hi> or in the following Distribution of things here below, into <hi>Sheep, Oxen, Fowls</hi> and <hi>Fish, v.</hi> 7, 8. that is, all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures here below, he adds an Amplification of it in an universal Proposition, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>under his very feet.</hi> An Expression setting forth a Dominion, every way unlimited and absolute.</p>

                        <head>Verse VIII.</head>
                        <p>THe Apostle having recited the <hi>Testimony</hi> which he intends to make use of, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the eighth Verse unto some such Explications of it, as may make it appear to be proper and suited unto the End for which it is produced by him. And they are two; the first whereof respects the <hi>sense</hi> of the words which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the <hi>Extent</hi> of this Dominion; the <hi>latter</hi> an instance of some <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Persons,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom this Testimony as thus explained, cannot be applied.</p>
                        <p>For the Explication of the <hi>Objective Extent</hi> of the Rule and Dominion mentioned, he adds, <hi>For in that he hath made all subject unto him, he hath left nothing that is not put under him.</hi> For whereas it might be objected, that there is no mention in the <hi>Psalm</hi> of the <hi>World to come</hi> whereof he treats; he lets them know, that that <hi>cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi>; seeing the Assertion is <hi>universal</hi> and unlimited, that all things whatsoever are put under him. It is true, our Apostle making use of this very Testimony in another place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. adds there, that there is a <hi>manifest Exception</hi> in reference unto him who <hi>so put all things under</hi> him; and it is evident that it is so indeed; for the <hi>Psalmist</hi> treats not of <hi>God himself,</hi> but of the <hi>works of God</hi>; and among them, saith the Apostle here; there lyes <hi>no Exception</hi>; they are all brought into Order under this Rule. And so by this Testimony, thus explained, as necessity requires it should be, he hath fully confirmed, that the <hi>World to come</hi> being one of the especial works of God, and not put in subjection unto Angels, is made <hi>subject unto man</hi>; which was that he undertook to demonstrate.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, To direct this Testimony unto its proper End, and to make way for its Application unto him, who is especially intended therein; he declares <hi>negatively</hi> unto whom it is <hi>not applicable; but now we see not yet all things put under him. Man</hi> it was, concerning whom the words are spoken; <hi>What is man?</hi> This must denote the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man</hi>; and that either as it is in <hi>all mankind</hi> in general and every individual, or in some especial and peculiar instance, in <hi>one</hi> partaker of that nature. For the First, He denyes that this can belong unto <hi>man in general,</hi> all, or any of them on that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral account of <hi>being men</hi>; And in this <hi>Negation</hi>; there are two Circumstances considerable: First, The <hi>manner</hi> of his asserting it by an appeal to <hi>common Experience; we see</hi>; this is a matter whereof every one may judge: We, all of us know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it is otherwise; we need neither Testimony nor Argument to instruct us herein. Our own condition, and that which we behold other men in, is sufficient to inform us. And this is <hi>a way</hi> whereby an <hi>appeal</hi> is made as it were to common sense and Experience, as we do in things that are most plain and unquestionable. Secondly, There is a limitation of this Experience, in the word <hi>yet; wee see not as yet.</hi> And this doth not intimate a <hi>contrary state of things</hi> for the future, but <hi>denyes,</hi> as <hi>to all the time that is past. A long space of time</hi> there hath been since the giving out of this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, much <hi>longer</hi> since the Creation of man, and all other things, and <hi>yet all this
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50110:276"/>
while,</hi> we see that all things are far enough from being <hi>put under the feet of man</hi>; or if there be in the word a <hi>reserve</hi> for some season, wherein this word shall in some sense be fulfilled in <hi>meer man</hi> also, it is for that time wherein they shall be perfectly glorified with him, who is principally intended, and so to be admitted as it were to be <hi>sharers</hi> with him in his Dominion, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.21. These things make plain <hi>what is here denyed,</hi> and in what sense. All mankind in conjunction are very remote from being invested with the Dominion here described; from having the <hi>whole Creation of God</hi> cast in subjection under their feet. It is true, there was given unto <hi>man</hi> at first in his <hi>Original condition,</hi> a Rule over those creatures here below, that were made for the use and sustentation of his natural life, and no other. And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is in some measure continued unto his Posterity; though against the present bent and inclination of the creatures, who <hi>groan</hi> because of the bondage that they are put unto, in serving of their use and necessity. But all this at first was but an obscure <hi>Type</hi> and shadow of the Dominion here intended, which is <hi>absolute, universal,</hi> and such as the creatures have no reason to complain of, their <hi>proper condition</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted unto them therein. Hence we our selves by our own Observation, may easily discern that <hi>this word</hi> respects not principally, either the <hi>first man</hi> or his posterity; for we see not as yet after this long space of time since the creation, that all things are put into subjection unto him.</p>
                        <p>Having thus unfolded the <hi>Testimony</hi> insisted on before we proceed unto the <hi>Apostolical Application</hi> of it unto the Person to whom it doth belong, we may stay here a little, and gather something from it for our instruction. And it is in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The consideration of the Infinitely Glorious Excellencies of the nature of God, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting themselves in his Works, doth greatly set out his Condescension and Grace, in his regard and respect unto mankind.</hi> This the occasion of the Words, and the <hi>Words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> do teach us.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This the <hi>method of the Psalmist,</hi> I say, leads us unto. He begins and ends his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the works of God, with an Admiration of his Glorious <hi>Excellency</hi> by whom they were made, <hi>v.</hi> 1.9. <hi>O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name</hi>: how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous art thou, and thou manifestest thy self so to be; and from thence doth he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the consideration of his condescension in his regard and love to man, <hi>v.</hi> 4. And to direct us in this duty with the <hi>Psalmist</hi> we may observe:</p>
                        <p>First, That the <hi>Works of God,</hi> those especially which were the peculiar subject of his Meditation, the heavenly bodies which we behold, are indeed in themselves exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>glorious.</hi> Their Frame, Greatness, Beauty, Order, Course, Usefulness, all speak them admirable and glorious. The <hi>naked view</hi> of them is enough to fill the mind of man with Admiration and Astonishment. And the more we contemplate on them, the more skilful are we in the consideration of their Nature, Order and Use, the more excellent do they appear unto us; and yet it is the least part of their Greatness, and beautiful disposition that we can attain a certain knowledge of; So that still they remain more the objects of our <hi>Admiration</hi> and wonder, than of our <hi>Science.</hi> Hence the wisest among the Heathen who were destitute of the teachings of the Word and Spirit of God, did with one consent ascribe of old a <hi>Deity</hi> unto them, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them as <hi>Gods</hi>; yea, the very name of God in the <hi>Greek</hi> Language <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, is taken from <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, to <hi>run,</hi> which they derived from the constant course of the heavenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. They saw with their Eyes how glorious they were: they found out by Reason their Greatness and <hi>dreadful motion.</hi> Experience taught them their Use, as the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate fountains of <hi>Light,</hi> Warmth, Heat, Moysture, and so consequently of Life, Growth, and all useful things; It may be they had some <hi>Tradition</hi> of that Rule and Dominion, which was at first allotted unto the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon over day and night, Gen.</hi> 1.16. On these and the like accounts, having lost the knowledge of the true and only God, they knew not so well whither to turn themselves for a <hi>Deity,</hi> as to those things which they saw so full of Glory, and which they found to be of so universal a communicative Goodness and usefulness. And in them did all <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the world begin. And it was betimes in the world; as we see in <hi>Job,</hi> where it is mentioned and condemned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.26, 27. <hi>If I beheld the Sun when it shined, or the Moon walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in brightness, and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand</hi>; he condemns the Idolatry, but yet withall shews, that the Lustre, Brightness and Glory of those <hi>heavenly lights</hi> had a great influence on the hearts of men, to entice them unto a secret Adoration, which would break out into outward Worship,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50110:276"/>
whereof <hi>salutation</hi> by <hi>kissing the hand</hi> was one part and act. And therefore God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his people against this Temptation; <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Lest thou lift up thine eyes up unto Heaven, and where thou seest the Sun and the Moon, and the Stars, even all the Host of Heaven shouldst be driven to worship them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all Nations under the whole Heaven</hi>; If men forget the true God, and then lift up their eyes unto, or fall into the contemplation of the <hi>Heavenly Bodies,</hi> such is their Glory, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and Excellency, that they will be driven and hurried unto the Adoration and Worship of them. And so universal was this folly of old, that from those latter words, <hi>which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all Nations:</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> affirm, that God hath given the <hi>Sun, Moon and Stars,</hi> to be the Deities of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for them to worship. But the distribution there mentioned is, as unto their <hi>common use</hi> unto all Nations, and not as to their Veneration; nor is God the Author of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as they blasphemously imagine. But this their Glory and Excellency lead them unto. And when any of them ascended higher, to apprehend living <hi>intelligent Spirits</hi> for their Deities; they yet conceived at least that they had their glorious Habitation in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies. Yea, and some Christians have fallen into <hi>vain imaginations,</hi> from a false Translation of the latter end of the fourth Verse of <hi>Psalm</hi> 19. by the <hi>LXX.</hi> and the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi>; who read the words, <hi>he hath placed his Tabernacle in the Sun</hi>; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of, <hi>he hath set in them</hi>; that is, in the Heavens, a <hi>Tabernacle for the Sun,</hi> as the words are plain in the Original. What should I mention the madness of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi> who affirmed that <hi>Christ</hi> himself was gone into, if not <hi>turned into</hi> the Sun. I name these things only to shew what Influence upon the minds of men destitute of the Word, the Glory and Excellency of these <hi>heavenly bodies</hi> hath had. And what ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable Grace God sheweth unto us in the benefit of his Word; for we are the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of them, and by nature not one jot wiser than they, who worshipped these things <hi>which are not God.</hi> But exceeding glorious works of God they are; and the more we consider them, the more will their Glory and Greatness appear unto us. And as the children of <hi>Israel</hi> said of the Sons of <hi>Anah, we were before them in our own sight as Grashoppers, and so we were in their sight</hi>: May we not much more say concerning our selves, compared with these Glorious Works of the hands of God, <hi>we are all but as Grashoppers</hi> in comparison of them; and whence is it, that God should set his heart upon us.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, These <hi>glorious works of God do indeed shew the infinite Glory of him that made them.</hi> This is the use that men should have made of their Contemplation of them, and not have chosen them for their Gods, as they did when their <hi>foolish hearts were darkened, and they waxed vain in their imaginations.</hi> This use the <hi>Psalmist</hi> here makes of them, and this the Scripture every where directs us unto. This <hi>David</hi> brings them in Preaching unto all the world, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

That is, his infinite Power, Alsufficiency, and self-subsistence. These things are <hi>clearly seen</hi> in them. Being all made and created by him in their season, doth it not manifest, that he was <hi>before them</hi> from Eternity, and that <hi>existing</hi> without them, in perfect blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: And that he hath made them; so <hi>beautiful,</hi> so <hi>glorious,</hi> so <hi>excellent,</hi> and that out of <hi>nothing,</hi> doth it not declare his infinite Power, Wisdom and Goodness? Do they not all lead us to the contemplation of his <hi>Infinite Excellencies?</hi> And whence is it, that he who made all these things of nothing, should have such regard to the <hi>weak,</hi> frail na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man? But that this consideration may be the more effectual, let us take a little weak view of some of those Excellencies of the Nature of God, which his works declare, and which set an especial <hi>lustre</hi> on his condescention unto us; As,</p>
                        <p>First, His Greatness. His <hi>Greatness</hi> is unsearchable, saith the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 145.3. That is, it is <hi>Infinite.</hi> The Immensity of his nature, is his Greatness. The <hi>Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> cannot contain him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.27. The Infiniteness and Ubiquity of his Essence, is beyond all that the Understanding and Imagination of man can reach unto. If men would set themselves to <hi>think</hi> and <hi>imagine</hi> a Greatness, they can reach no higher than Heavens above Heavens, and that as far as they can fancy; but this expresseth not <hi>Immensity.</hi> Those Heavens of Heavens cannot contain him. Our Thoughts of Greatness are apt to consist in adding one thing unto another, until that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50110:277"/>
which we think on, be extended unto the utmost of our Imagination. But this hath no Relation unto the <hi>Immensity</hi> of God; which is not his filling of all <hi>imaginary</hi> Place or Space, but an Infinite Existence in an Infinite Being; so that as he is present with, <hi>indistant</hi> from the whole Creation, for saith he, <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth? Jer.</hi> 23.24. So is he no <hi>less present,</hi> where there is no part of the Creation. And if he should produce <hi>thousands of Worlds,</hi> which he can do by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Power, he would be no less present in them all, <hi>indistant</hi> from every thing in them, than he is in and unto this which he hath already created. And this not by the extending of his Essence and Greatness, but by the infiniteness of his Being. Neither are there Parts in this Immensity; for that which hath Parts cannot be Infinite or Immense. <hi>Somewhat of God</hi> is not present in Heaven, and somewhat in earth; but God is wholly present in his whole Being every where. This leaves no place for the imagination of men, but calls us for pure Acts of Understanding, and <hi>Faith</hi> to assent unto it. And thus far Reason will go; that it will assent unto the truth of that which it cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, because it is convinced that it cannot be otherwise. What remains, it leaves to Faith, and Reverential Adoration. Reason having by the help of <hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> lead the mind and soul thus far; that God is <hi>immense,</hi> not only present unto the whole Creation, but existing in his infinite being, where no creature is, and that in his whole Essence equally, there it gives them up to Admiration, Reverence, Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Improvement by faith of this Excellency of God, where ever they are: so doth the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 139.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Thoughts of Gods <hi>Omnipresence</hi> are of singular use to the soul in every condition. And who can sufficiently admire this <hi>Excellency</hi> of the Nature of God? How astonishable is this his Greatness? How are all the Nations of the world, as <hi>the drop of a bucket,</hi> as the <hi>dust of the ballance,</hi> as <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> as Nothing before him? What is a little <hi>dust</hi> to an Immensity of Being? To that whose Greatness we cannot measure, whose Nature we cannot comprehend, whose Glory we can only stand afar off and adore? What is a <hi>poor worm</hi> unto him who is every where, and who is every where filled with his own Excellencies and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? The issue of all our thoughts on this Property of Gods Nature, is Admiration and holy Astonishment. And whence is it, that he should take thought of us, or set his heart upon us? And this Greatness of God doth he set forth by shewing what a <hi>mean thing</hi> the whole Creation which we behold is unto him. <hi>Who hath measured the Waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out the Heavens with a span, and comprehended the dust of the Earth in a measure, and weighed the Mountains in scales, and the Hills in a ballance: Behold, the Nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the ballance: behold, he taketh up the Isles as a very little thing; all Nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted unto him less than nothing and vanity, Isa.</hi> 40.12, 15, 17.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>His Infinite Self-sufficiency doth manifest it self in his works</hi>; for all these things are the absolute product of his Power and Wisdom and Goodness. From the infinite stores and Treasures of them did he bring them all forth. They had no <hi>previous matter</hi> whereof they were made, no Reason, cause, or end was there, why they should be made, but only what was in himself, and from himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. Now this could not have been without an <hi>Infinite Self-sufficiency</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; from whence it is, that all things begin and end in him. And had he not been every way <hi>self-sufficient,</hi> before the Existence of all other things out of nothing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could have been produced. And this ariseth from his <hi>Fulness of Being,</hi> which he declareth by his names <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; which denote <hi>his self-Being,</hi> his self-existence, his self-sufficiency. All the Propertyes of his Nature being infinite, have that which satisfies them and fills them. His <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding</hi> is infinite: And as nothing could comprehend the Infinite Nature of God, but an Infinite Understanding, God could not <hi>know himself,</hi> if his Understanding were not infinite; so nothing could satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie an Infinite Understanding but an <hi>Infinite Object</hi>; the Understanding of God could not be blessed and in rest, if the <hi>Object</hi> of it, the Nature of God were not <hi>infinite.</hi> God by his Understanding knows the extent of his <hi>Infinite Power,</hi> and so knows not only what he hath wrought by his Power, but also, what ever he can so do. And this suitableness of the Properties of God one to another, as it makes them because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, not <hi>really to differ</hi> from one another, or from his Nature it self; so it gives them all Rest, Blessedness, Satisfaction and self-sufficiency. As to continue in our former instance; the Blessedness of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding</hi> of God consists in its Comprehension of the whole Nature of God; nor is it capable of more, because it can comprehend
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50110:277"/>
no more. Hence is God Alsufficient, and eternally blessed in the contemplation and enjoyment of his own Excellencies. For <hi>Self-sufficiency</hi> is the fountain of Blessedness. Where any thing is <hi>wanting,</hi> there is no absolute Blessedness. And hence is the Blessedness of God absolute, <hi>eternal,</hi> and essential unto him, because it hath its rise and spring <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in himself,</hi> his own <hi>fulness</hi> of Being, his own sufficiency unto, and for himself. All the Blessedness of the creatures, that we shall or may ever attain unto, is but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, derivative,</hi> and <hi>communicated</hi>; because though nothing shall be <hi>wanting unto us,</hi> yet the spring of our supplies shall never be in our selves, but in God. His Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness is <hi>absolute,</hi> because it is from himself, and in himself; in his Being every way self-sufficient. This it is to be <hi>absolutely blessed.</hi> Hence God made not these things because he had need of them; for if he had had need of them, he could not have made them: or that they should <hi>add</hi> any thing unto him; for that is not <hi>infinite</hi> unto which any thing can be <hi>added</hi>: nor that he might settle that Rest and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in them, which he had not in himself before: for that which is <hi>Infinite</hi> must necessarily and unavoidably give <hi>eternal satisfaction</hi> unto that which is <hi>Infinite</hi>; but only by a most free Act of his Will, he chose by the Creation of all things, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press somewhat of his Power, Wisdom and Goodness; in something without himself. Absolutely he was <hi>self-sufficient</hi> from all Eternity; and that both as to Rest, Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Blessedness in himself; as also in respect of any Operation, as to outward Works which his Will and Wisdom should encline him unto; being every way able and powerful in, and from himself, to do what ever he pleaseth. And this infinite satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and complacency of God in himself, arising from that fulness of Divine Being which is in all the Properties of his Nature, is another Object of <hi>our holy Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and Adoration. This God was, this God did, before the world was created. Now <hi>what is man,</hi> that this every way <hi>all-sufficient God</hi> should mind, regard and visit him? Hath he any <hi>need</hi> of him, or his services? Doth his Goodness extend to him? Can he <hi>profit God as a man profiteth his neighbour? If he sin what doth he against him? Or if his transgressions be multiplied what doth he against him?</hi> That is to his disadvantage: <hi>If he be righteous what giveth he unto him, or what receiveth he at his hand? Job</hi> 35.6, 7. Nothing but <hi>Infinite Condescension and Grace</hi> is the fountain of all Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto us.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>His Infinite and Eternal Power</hi> is by the same means manifested. This the Apostle expresly affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. He that made all these things of <hi>nothing,</hi> and therefore can also make and create in like manner what ever <hi>else besides</hi> he pleaseth, must needs be <hi>infinite in power</hi>; or as he is called, <hi>the Lord God Omnipotent Rev.</hi> 19.6. This himself sets forth in general, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.28. And to convince <hi>Job</hi> hereof, he treats with him in particular instances about some few of his <hi>fellow creatures</hi> here below; in the Earth and in the Waters, <hi>Chap.</hi> 38.39. And if the Power of God in making this or that creature which we see and behold, be so <hi>admirable,</hi> declaring his Soveraignty and the infinite distance of man from him in his best condition, how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is it in the whole <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverse</hi>; and in the creation of all things visible and invisible, and that by a secret Emanation of Omnipotency in a Word of Command? The Art of man will go far in the framing, fashioning and ordering of things; but there are two things in the <hi>least</hi> of the creatures of God, that make the creating <hi>Energie</hi> that is seen in them, infinitely to differ from all limited and finite power; First, That they are <hi>brought out of nothing</hi>; now let all Creatures combine their Strength and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom together, unless they have some <hi>praeexistent matter</hi> to work upon, they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce nothing, effect nothing. Secondly, To many of his creatures, of the least of them, God hath given <hi>life</hi> and <hi>spontaneous motions</hi>; to all of them an especial inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and operation following inseparably the Principles of their Nature. But as all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Power can give neither <hi>life,</hi> nor <hi>spontaneous motion,</hi> nor <hi>growth</hi> to any thing; no more can it plant in any thing a new <hi>natural principle,</hi> that should <hi>encline it</hi> unto a new kind of Operation, which was not <hi>originally</hi> connatural unto it. There is a peculiar impress of <hi>Omnipotency</hi> upon all the works of God; as he declares at large in that Discourse with <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 38.39. And this Power is no less effectual, nor less evident in his <hi>sustentation</hi> and preservation of all things, than in his creation of them. Things do no more <hi>subsist</hi> by themselves, than they were made by themselves. <hi>He sustaineth all things by the word of his power, Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>And by him all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, Col.</hi> 1.17. He hath not made the World, and then turned it off his hand, to <hi>stand on its own bottom,</hi> and shift for it self. But there is continually, every moment, an <hi>emanation of Power</hi> from God, unto every creature, the greatest, the least, the meanest,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50110:278"/>
to preserve them in their Being and Order; which if it were suspended but for one moment, they would all lose their station and being, and by <hi>confusion</hi> be reduced into <hi>nothing. In him we live, and move, and have our being, Acts</hi> 7.28. and, <hi>He giveth unto all life and breath and all things, verse</hi> 25. God needs not put forth any act of his Power to destroy the Creation; the very <hi>suspension</hi> of that constant emanation of Omnipotency which is necessary unto its <hi>subsistence,</hi> would be sufficient for that end and purpose. And who can <hi>admire</hi> as he ought this Power of God, which is greater in every <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular grass</hi> of the field than we are able to search into, or comprehend. And <hi>what is man</hi> that he should be mindful of him.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, His <hi>Wisdom</hi> also shines forth in these works of his hands. <hi>In wisdom hath he made them all, Psal.</hi> 104.24. So also, 136.5. his <hi>Power</hi> was that which gave all things their <hi>Being,</hi> but his <hi>Wisdom</hi> gave them their Order beauty and use. How ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable this is, how <hi>incomprehensible</hi> it is unto us, <hi>Zophar</hi> declares in <hi>Job, chap.</hi> 11. <hi>verse</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>The secrets of this Wisdom are double unto what may be known of it,</hi> infinitely more than we can attain to the knowledge of. <hi>Searching</hi> will not do it, it is absolutely incomprehensible. He that can take but a little weak faint consideration of the glorious Disposition of the Heavenly Bodies, their Order, Course, Respect to each other, their usefulness and influences, their disposition and connexion of <hi>Causes</hi> and Effects here below, the orderly concurrence and <hi>subserviency</hi> of every thing in its place and operation, to the consistency use and beauty of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverse,</hi> will be forced to cry out with the <hi>Psalmist, O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in wisdom hast thou made them all, the earth is full of thy riches.</hi> But alas, what can the best and wisest of men attain unto in the investigation of the Wisdom of God? There is not the least creature, but considered apart by it self, hath somewhat belonging unto it, that will bring them unto <hi>wonder</hi> and astonishment. And what shall we say concerning the <hi>most glorious,</hi> concerning the Order of them all unto one another, and the whole? there must all mens considerations end, and among them this of ours.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, His <hi>Goodness</hi> is in like manner manifest in these things. There is in the whole and every part of God's Creation a <hi>four-fold goodness.</hi> 1. A <hi>goodness of being</hi> and subsistence. That which <hi>is,</hi> so far forth <hi>as it is,</hi> is good. So God saw all things, as he made them, that they <hi>were good.</hi> The very <hi>being</hi> of every thing is its <hi>first goodness,</hi> on which all other concernments of it do depend. And this ariseth from hence, because thereby and therein it participates of the <hi>first absolute Goodness,</hi> which is Being; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto a <hi>nothingness,</hi> if I may so speak, is <hi>negatively</hi> opposed <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> 2. A <hi>Goodness of Order.</hi> This gives them their Beauty, which is the first principle properly of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and convertible with it. Every thing that is <hi>good</hi> is <hi>beautiful,</hi> and every thing that is <hi>beautiful</hi> is <hi>good.</hi> Now the <hi>pulchritude</hi> or beauty of the whole Creation, and of every part of it, consists in the <hi>Order</hi> that is given unto it by the Wisdom of God, whereof we spake before. This is that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of all things, which of old by the light of nature was so much admired. Beautiful goodness, or goodly beauty, whereby every thing becomes comely and desirable, both in it self and its own parts, and in that respect which it hath unto all other things. 3. A <hi>Goodness of usefulness,</hi> nothing is made in vain. Every thing hath its <hi>work</hi> service and operation allotted unto it. If the whole Creation had been <hi>uniform,</hi> if it had been only <hi>one thing,</hi> it would have wanted this goodness, and been but a <hi>dead lump,</hi> or mass of being. But in this great <hi>variety</hi> and diversity of things which we behold, every one hath its proper place and service, and nothing is useless. As the Apostle says, that it is in the several parts and members of the <hi>lesser world, Man,</hi> that though some of them seem more <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>comely</hi> than other, yet all have their <hi>proper use,</hi> so that they cannot say unto one another, <hi>I have no need of thee:</hi> So is it in the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverse,</hi> though some parts of it seem to be <hi>very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> and others mean and to be trampled on, yet they cannot say one to another, <hi>I have no need of thee,</hi> each having its proper use. The <hi>Eye</hi> is a most noble part of the body, but, saith the Apostle, <hi>If the whole body were an eye,</hi> the beauty of the whole were lost, and the very <hi>use of the eye.</hi> How glorious is the <hi>Sun</hi> in the firmament in comparison of a <hi>poor worm</hi> in the earth? yet if the whole Creation were <hi>one Sun,</hi> it would have neither beauty nor use, nor indeed be a <hi>Sun,</hi> as having nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <hi>light</hi> or <hi>heat</hi> unto. But God hath brought forth his works in unspeakable <hi>variety,</hi> that they might all have this <hi>goodness of usefulness</hi> accompanying of them. 4. A <hi>goodness of an orderly tendency unto the utmost and last end</hi>; which is the glory of him by whom they were made. This also is implanted upon the whole Creation of God; and hence the <hi>Psalmist</hi> calls upon all the <hi>inanimate creatures</hi> to give praise and glory
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50110:278"/>
unto God; that is, he calls upon himself and others to consider how they do so. This is the <hi>point,</hi> the <hi>centre</hi> where all these lines do meet, without which there could be neither <hi>beauty</hi> nor <hi>order</hi> nor <hi>use</hi> in them: for that which <hi>errs</hi> from its end, is <hi>crooked, perverse,</hi> and <hi>not good.</hi> On all these considerations it is said, that <hi>God saw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good, Gen.</hi> 1.31. Now what an infinite eternal Ocean of Goodness must that be, which by the word of his mouth communicated <hi>all this goodness</hi> at once unto the whole Creation? How deep, how unfathomable is this fountain? how unsearchable are these springs? This the holy men in the Scripture often express by way of admiration, <hi>How great is his goodness! how great is his beauty!</hi> The first goodness, the fountain of all goodness must needs be <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>infinitely</hi> so; in which sense there is none good but one, that is God.</p>
                        <p>In these things consist somewhat of the <hi>Glory</hi> Excellency and Honour of God, which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> falls into an admiration of upon the contemplation of the works of his hands, and which made him so astonished at his <hi>condescention</hi> in the regard that he is pleased to bear unto the <hi>nature of man.</hi> But besides this consideration, he addes also an intimation, as we have shewed, of the <hi>mean condition</hi> of man unto whom this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is shewed, and that both in the <hi>manner of his expression, What is man</hi>; and in the words or names whereby he expresseth him, <hi>Enosh</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi>; which we shall also briefly adde unto our former considerations of the glory of God.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>What is man</hi> as to his extract? a <hi>little dust,</hi> made of <hi>the dust of the ground:</hi> one that may say to corruption, <hi>Thou art my father, and to the worm, Thou art my mother and my sister, Job</hi> 17.14. His fabrick was not one jot of any <hi>better materials</hi> than theirs. That God put this honour upon him to breath <hi>into the dust</hi> whereof he was made, that he should become a <hi>living soul,</hi> is part of that goodness wherein he is to be admired. Otherwise we are what God said to <hi>Adam, Dust thou art</hi>; poor creature that wouldest be like unto God, <hi>thou art dust</hi> and no more. And in the sense of this <hi>extraction</hi> did holy men of old abase themselves in the presence of God, as <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.27. <hi>How shall I speak unto the Lord that am but dust and ashes.</hi> Poor proud man, which scornest to touch that which thou art <hi>made of,</hi> and thinkest thy self I know not what, whilst the remainder of thee, that which was left in the making of thee, lies under the feet of all the creatures which thou despisest: what is this <hi>handful of dust</hi> that God should regard it? But yet,</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This <hi>fabrick</hi> being erected, perhaps is <hi>durable</hi> strong and abiding, and so may be considerable on that account. But alas, his <hi>frailty</hi> is inexpressible. It is true, that before the <hi>Floud</hi> the life of man was prolonged unto a great continuance; but as that was not in the least any advantage unto the most of them, giving them only an opportunity to increase their sin and misery; nor to the <hi>whole society</hi> of mankind, seeing by that means the <hi>earth was filled with violence,</hi> and became a woful habitation of distress, so they also came to their end, and nothing long since remaineth of their memory but that they <hi>lived so many years</hi> and then they died, which is the common end of man. But since that, in which our concernment lies, how do the holy men of God set forth, and as it were complain of the <hi>woful frailty</hi> of our condition! So doth <hi>Moses, Psal.</hi> 90.5, 6. <hi>Thou carriest them away with a floud</hi>; which he spake in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of <hi>those thousands</hi> which he saw die before his eyes in the Wilderness: <hi>In the morning they are like grass which groweth up, in the morning it flourisheth and groweth up, in the evening it is cut down and withereth.</hi> The like also pleadeth <hi>Job, chap.</hi> 14.1, 2. and then turning unto God he saith, <hi>And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard such a poor frail perishing creature? And <hi>David</hi> doth the like, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.24. And indeed no tongue can express the miserable frail condition of this poor creature; from within, from without, from himself, from all other creatures, and principally from the rage and cruelty of those of the same nature with himself, his <hi>misery</hi> is great, and his life of short continuance. And God abundantly shews that little weight also is to be laid on that <hi>duration</hi> which he hath here in this world, in that he takes many from the very <hi>womb,</hi> who scarce ever beheld the light, into the participation of his own eternal Glory.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, This <hi>earthly frail man</hi> hath made himself yet more unspeakably vile by <hi>sin</hi>; this sets him at the utmost distance from the glory of God, and utterly foils every thing that is in him, which of it self is worthy of consideration.</p>
                        <p>All these things being put together, they make the <hi>Condescension</hi> of God in <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring man,</hi> and setting his heart upon him, exceedingly to be admired and adored. And this also will farther appear, if we might consider what are the blessed effects of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50110:279"/>
this <hi>mindfulness</hi> of him; but these the Apostle insists upon in the <hi>next verses,</hi> whether we may refer our <hi>meditations</hi> on them. Only the <hi>Duty</hi> it self arising from hence may be here pressed upon us. And this is, that upon the accounts mentioned we would live constantly in an holy adoration of this <hi>infinite condescension</hi> and grace of God. To this end,</p>
                        <p>First, let us exercise our selves unto <hi>holy thoughts</hi> of Gods infinite Excellencies. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation accompanied with holy adoration is the fountain of this duty. Some men have over-busily and curiously enquired into the Nature and Properties of God, and have <hi>foolishly</hi> endeavoured to measure infinite things by the miserable short line of their own reason, and to suit the deep things of God unto their own narrow apprehensions. Such are many of the Disputations of the <hi>School-men</hi> on this subject, wherein though they have seemed <hi>wise to themselves</hi> and others, yet indeed for the most part they have <hi>waxed vain in their imaginations.</hi> Our duty lies in studying what God hath revealed of himself in his Word, and what is evidently suitable thereunto; and that not with <hi>curious searchings</hi> and speculations, but with holy <hi>admiration</hi> reverence and fear. This the <hi>Apostle</hi> adviseth us unto, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28, 29. In this way serious thoughts of God's Excellencies and Properties, his Greatness, Immensity, Self-sufficiency, Power and Wisdom are exceeding useful unto our souls. When these have filled us with wonder, when they have prostrated our spirits before him, and laid our mouthes in the dust, and our persons on the ground, when the glory of them shines round about us, and our whole souls are filled with an holy astonishment; then,</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Let us take a <hi>view of our selves,</hi> our extract, our frailty, our vileness on every account. How <hi>poor,</hi> how undeservable are we? What is a little sinful dust and ashes, before or in the sight of this God of glory? What is there in us, what is there belonging unto us, that is not suited to abase us? <hi>alive</hi> one day, <hi>dead</hi> another; <hi>quiet</hi> one moment, <hi>troubled</hi> another; fearing, caring, rejoycing cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly, sinning always: <hi>in our best condition altogether vanity.</hi> Though much may be said unto this purpose, yet it must be said after all, that in our selves we are <hi>inexpressibly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,</hi> and as the Prophet speaks, <hi>less than vanity and nothing.</hi> Would we be wise, we <hi>are like the wild Asses colt</hi>; would we be <hi>honourable,</hi> we have no understanding, but are like the beasts that perish; would we be <hi>strong,</hi> we are as a <hi>reed</hi> shaken with the wind. And,</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Let the result of these thoughts be, an holy admiration of Gods infinite Love, Care, Grace, and Condescension, in having any regard unto us. So doth the <hi>Psalmist</hi> teach us to do; hence will Praise, hence will Thankfulness, hence will Self-abasement ensue. And this will be a good foundation, as of obedience, so of comfort and supportment in every condition.</p>

                        <p>THese things being spoken <hi>indefinitely</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> by the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> the Apostle in the application of them unto his present purpose, proceeds to shew who it is that was especially <hi>intended,</hi> and in whom the words had their full accomplishment. <hi>But,</hi> saith he, <hi>we see Jesus, &amp;c.</hi> Many difficulties the words of this verse are attended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, all which we shall endeavour to clear: First, by shewing in <hi>general</hi> how in them the Apostle applies the testimony produced by him unto <hi>Jesus.</hi> Secondly, by freeing them from the obscurity that ariseth from a <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or transposition of expression in them. Thirdly, by opening the several things taught and asserted in them. And fourthly, by a vindication of the whole <hi>interpretation</hi> from exceptions and objections.</p>
                        <p>First, The Apostle positively applies this testimony unto <hi>Jesus,</hi> as he who was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intended therein, or as he in whom the things that God did when he <hi>minded man,</hi> were accomplished. And this the <hi>Syriack Translation</hi> directly expresseth, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>but him whom he made lower a little while than the Angels, we see that it is Jesus.</hi> That is, it is <hi>Jesus</hi> concerning whom the <hi>Psalmist</hi> spake, and in whom alone this testimony is verified. Two things are expressed concerning <hi>Man</hi> in the words: 1. That he <hi>was made lower than the Angels.</hi> 2. That he had <hi>all things</hi> put in subjection unto him. Both these, saith the Apostle, we see accomplished in <hi>Jesus</hi>; for that is the meaning of that expression, <hi>We see Jesus,</hi> that is, these things fulfilled in him. And as he had before appealed unto their faith and experience in his
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50110:279"/>
                           <hi>negative,</hi> that <hi>all things are not made subject to man in general</hi>; so doth he here in his <hi>affirmative, We see Jesus.</hi> Now they saw it, partly by what he had before proved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, partly by the signs and wonders he had newly spoken of, whereby his Doctrine was confirmed, and his Power over all things manifested; partly by his Calling and Gathering of his Church, giving Laws Rules and Worship unto it, by vertue of his Authority in and over this <hi>new world.</hi> And as unto the former part of the testimony, by what they had <hi>seen with their eyes,</hi> or had been otherwise taught concerning his <hi>low estate</hi> and humiliation; <hi>These things,</hi> saith he, <hi>we see,</hi> they are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto us, nor can be denied whilst the <hi>Gospel</hi> is acknowledged. Now this confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on the evidences mentioned he applies to both parts of the testimony.</p>
                        <p>First, saith he, <hi>We see that for a little while he was made lower than the Angels,</hi> or brought into a state and condition of more exigency and want than they are, or can be exposed unto. And hereby he evidently declares, that those words in the <hi>Psalm</hi> do not belong unto the <hi>dignity of man</hi> spoken of, as if he had said, <hi>He is so excellent, that he is but little beneath Angels</hi>; for as he ascribes unto him a <hi>Dignity</hi> far above all Angels, in as much as <hi>all things</hi> without exception are put under his feet; so he plainly declares that <hi>these words</hi> belong to the depression and <hi>minoration</hi> of <hi>Jesus,</hi> in that he was so humbled that he might die. And therefore he proceeds to shew, how that part of the testimony concerned his present purpose, not as directly <hi>proving</hi> what he had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to confirmation concerning his Dignity, but as evidently designing the Person that the whole belonged unto. As also he takes occasion from hence to enter upon the Exposition of another part of Christs <hi>Mediation,</hi> as prophesied of in this place. For though he was <hi>so lessened,</hi> yet it was not on his own account, but that by the grace of God he might <hi>taste death for every man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, For the other part of the testimony, <hi>We see,</hi> saith he upon the evidences mentioned, <hi>that he is crowned with glory and honour,</hi> and consequently that all things are put under his feet. So that the whole testimony, in both parts of it, is verified in him, and in him alone. And hereby he fully evinceth what he had before proposed unto confirmation, namely the preheminence of <hi>Jesus the Messiah</hi> above the Angels, or principal Administrators of the Law, in this especial instance, <hi>That the world to come was put into subjection unto him, and not unto them</hi>; and therefore in the state of the Church intended in that expression are his Teachings, his Doctrine, his Worship di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be attended unto, by all those who desire to be partakers of the promises and good things thereof.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, There seems to be a <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in the words, by a transposition of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions from their proper place and coherence, which must be removed. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Some would have those words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, to belong to the <hi>subject</hi> of the Proposition, whose <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate</hi> alone is, <hi>crowned with glory and honour,</hi> whereof the suffering of death is inserted as the <hi>meritorious</hi> cause. So reading the words to this purpose, <hi>We see that Jesus who was for a little while made lower than the Angels for his suffering of death, is crowned with glory and honour.</hi> Others would have <hi>Jesus</hi> alone to be the <hi>subject</hi> of the Proposition; of whose <hi>praedicate</hi> there are two parts, or two things are affirmed concerning him. First, that <hi>he was made lower than the Angels,</hi> the reason whereof is added, namely <hi>that he might suffer death</hi>; which is farther explained in the close of the verse, by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Cause</hi> and End of that his suffering, <hi>That by the grace of God he might taste of death for every man</hi>; so reading the words to this purpose, <hi>We see Jesus made lower than the Angels for the suffering of death, crowned</hi> (or, and crowned) <hi>with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> The difficulty principally consists in this only, namely whether the Apostle by <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>for the suffering of death,</hi> intend the <hi>final cause</hi> of the humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ; he was made low <hi>that he might suffer death</hi>; or the <hi>meritorious cause</hi> of his Exaltation; for, or because he suffered death, he was crowned with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And the former seems evidently the intention of the words, according to the latter resolution of them, and our application of the testimony fore-going. For, 1. if the cause and means of the <hi>Exaltation</hi> of Christ had been intended, it would have been expressed by <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> requiring a <hi>Genitive case,</hi> where the cause or means of any thing is intended; but <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> expresseth the <hi>end</hi> of what was before affirmed. 2. These words, <hi>for the suffering of death,</hi> must express either the <hi>minoration</hi> and humiliation of Christ, or the <hi>end</hi> of it; if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the <hi>end</hi> of it, then we obtain that which is pleaded for, he was <hi>made less that he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50110:280"/>
might suffer.</hi> If they express his <hi>minoration</hi> it self, then the end of it is contained only in the close of the verse, that <hi>he might taste of death for every man.</hi> In which exposition of the words, the sense would be, that <hi>he suffered death, that by the grace of God he might taste death,</hi> which is no sense at all. 3. If <hi>those words</hi> denote only the <hi>means</hi> or <hi>meritorious cause</hi> of the Exaltation of Christ, I enquire what is the <hi>medium</hi> intended of that <hi>end in the close,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>that he by the grace of God he might taste death.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>that so,</hi> plainly refers unto some <hi>preparatory means</hi> preceding, which in this way can be nothing, but the <hi>crowning him with glory and honour,</hi> which we know was not the <hi>means,</hi> but the <hi>effect</hi> of it. He was <hi>humbled,</hi> not <hi>exalted,</hi> that he might <hi>taste of death.</hi> 4. The Apostle doth not meerly take it for granted, that <hi>Jesus</hi> was for a little while made <hi>lesser</hi> than the Angels, but asserts it as proved in the testimony insisted on; whereunto he subjoyns the end of that his <hi>comparative minoration,</hi> because he intended it as the especial subject of his ensuing discourse. This therefore is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and natural order of the words, <hi>But we see Jesus crowned with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who was for a little while made lower than the Angels for the suffering of death, that he by the grace of God might taste death for every man.</hi> And the only reason of the <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> of the words consisteth in the Apostles following the order of the things te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified unto by the <hi>Psalmist</hi>; first his Humiliation, then his Exaltation; and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting that which he would <hi>next treat of</hi> unto that which was <hi>first laid down,</hi> passing by the other as now sufficiently confirmed.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The general design of the words, and their order being cleared, we shall open them in particular, seeing that besides the application of the testimony of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> unto the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> now vindicated, there is an assertion in them, containing that which of all other things was of most difficult acceptation with the <hi>Jews</hi>; upon the account whereof the Apostle confirms it with many reasons in the <hi>verses</hi> following, to the end of this Chapter. And indeed we have here the <hi>sum of the Gospel,</hi> and the Doctrine of it, concerning the Person and Office of the Messiah, asserted and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from the <hi>prejudicate opinions</hi> of many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> under these two heads. 1. That the salvation and deliverance that God had promised and intended to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish by the <hi>Messiah,</hi> was <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> from death, sin, Sathan, and hell, ending in <hi>everlasting glory</hi>; not temporal and carnal with respect unto the world, and the concomitants of it in this life, as they vainly imagined. 2. That this <hi>salvation</hi> could be no otherwise wrought nor brought about, but by the Incarnation Suffering and death of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> not in especial; by Arms, War, and mighty Power, as the People was of old led into <hi>Canaan</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Joshua</hi> the Captain of that salvation, and as some of them expected yet to be saved and delivered by the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Now the Apostle strengthning his discourse by multiplicity of reasons and arguments, he doth not only in these words apply his testimony to what he had before propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, unto confirmation, namely the <hi>subjection of the world to come unto Christ,</hi> but also lays in it the springs of those two other Principles which we have mentioned, and whose proof and confirmation in the next verses he pursues.</p>
                        <p>Sundry things, as we have partly seen, are contained in the words; as first, the <hi>Exinanition</hi> and Humiliation of Christ; <hi>We see Jesus for a little while made lower, and brought into a more indigent condition</hi> than the Angels are, or ever were obnoxious unto. 2. The general end of that Exinanition and Depression of <hi>Jesus,</hi> it was that he might <hi>suffer death.</hi> 3. His Exaltation unto Power and Authority over all things, in particular <hi>the world to come; crowned with glory and honour.</hi> 4. A numerous <hi>Amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> subjoyned, of the end of his <hi>depression,</hi> and the <hi>death</hi> that it tended unto. 1. From the <hi>Cause</hi> of it, the <hi>Grace</hi> of God. 2. The <hi>Nature</hi> of it, he was to <hi>taste of death.</hi> 3. The <hi>End</hi> of it, it was for others. And, 4. its <hi>extent, for all. That he by the grace of God might taste death for all.</hi>

                           <pb n="215" facs="tcp:50110:280"/>
in respect of Angels, did consist meerly in his Incarnation and participation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, which in general is esteemed beneath <hi>Angelical</hi>; or in the misery and anxiety which in that nature he conflicted withall. And the Apostle seems not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to intend the former: 1. Because he speaks of <hi>Jesus</hi> as the subject of this <hi>Minoration</hi>; now that name denotes the <hi>Son of God as Incarnate,</hi> who is supposed so to be, when he is said <hi>to be made less than the Angels.</hi> 2. Because the Humane Nature in the very instant of its <hi>union</hi> unto the Person of that Son of God, was absolutely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced above the <hi>Angelical,</hi> and might have immediately been possessed of Glory, if other works in it had not been to be performed. And yet neither doth it intend the low condition wherein he was placed <hi>exclusively</hi> to his Incarnation, though that be afterwards (<hi>verse</hi> 14.) particularly spoken unto, but his being <hi>Incarnate</hi> and brought forth, and in that condition wherein he was exposed to <hi>suffering,</hi> and so consequently to death it self. And thus was he <hi>made less than Angels</hi> in part, in that nature which he assumed, he was obnoxious unto all the <hi>infirmities</hi> which attend it, as Hunger, Thirst, Weariness, Pain, Sorrow, Grief; and exposed unto all the miseries from <hi>without,</hi> that any person partaker of that nature, is <hi>obnoxious</hi> unto; and in summe, <hi>death</hi> it self, from all which miseries Angels are exempted. This we <hi>see,</hi> know, and grant to have been the <hi>state and condition of Jesus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But, saith he, this was but <hi>for a little while,</hi> during his conversation with us on the earth, ending at his death. The Apostle knew, that he had now fixed upon that which of all things the <hi>Jews</hi> most stumbled at; the low and mean despised condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Jesus,</hi> they having inveterate prejudicate opinions of another manner of state and condition for the <hi>Messiah</hi>; wherefore he immediately subjoyns the end why he was humbled into this condition, which he first explains, and then vindicates the necessity of it.</p>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50110:282"/>
That wherein divers worthy Expositors are otherwise minded and differ from us; is the Application of the words of the Psalm immediately unto the Person of Christ; they say are referred unto him only by way of Allusion. Now though our Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sufficiently confirm and strengthen it self by its own Evidence; yet because <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse learned men</hi> whose Judgement is much to be regarded, have given another sense of the words than that embraced by us, I shall by some further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations confirm that part of our Exposition which is by them called into Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; premising unto them, for the further clearing of the place what we grant in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the sense by them contended for.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I grant that the <hi>Psalmists</hi> design in general is to set forth, the Goodness, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Love and Care of God unto <hi>mankind</hi>; so that in those words, <hi>What is man, and the Son of man,</hi> though he principally respect the instance of the <hi>Person of the Messiah,</hi> yet he doth it not exclusively to the <hi>nature of man</hi> in others; but hath a special regard unto <hi>mankind</hi> in general in contradistinction unto other outwardly more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works of the hands of God. But it is the especial instance of the <hi>Person of the Messiah,</hi> wherein alone he undertakes to make good, his assertion of mankinds Preheminence.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I also grant that he hath respect unto the Dignity and Honor collated on the first man at his Creation; not <hi>directly</hi> and intentionally as his chiefest scope, but by way of Allusion, as it did prefigure and obscurely represent that great glory and honour, which mankind was to be advanced unto in the <hi>Person of the Messiah.</hi> That <hi>primarily</hi> and directly he, and he alone according to our Exposition, is intended in the <hi>Psalm.</hi> For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the whole Psalm is <hi>Prophetical of the Messiah,</hi> the passages out of it reported in the New Testament and applyed unto him, do make evident and unquestionable; See <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. with this place; so that he must needs be the <hi>man,</hi> and <hi>son of man</hi> therein treated of; and who alone did <hi>make to cease the enemy and self-avenger, v.</hi> 2. as the Apostle <hi>declares, v.</hi> 14, 15. of this Chapter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The general scope of the <hi>Psalm</hi> will admit of no other Interpretation; The <hi>Psalmist</hi> on his contemplation of the great glory of God in <hi>framing the Heavens</hi> and all the host of them, especially those which then appeared unto him, falls into an Admiration of his Wisdom, Goodness and Love in that which was far greater and more excellent, as that wherein his Glory was more exalted, which he rejoyceth and triumpheth in, as that wherein his own, and the interest of all <hi>others</hi> did lye. Now this could not be either the state of <hi>man,</hi> as fallen by sin, which is far enough from a matter of Exultation and joy; nor yet the state of <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, in no Priviledge whereof without a Restitution by Christ, have we share or interest.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There are not any words in the Testimony that can properly be applyed unto <hi>any other man,</hi> or be verified in him; not in <hi>Adam</hi> at his first Creation, not in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, but only in the <hi>instance</hi> of the Person of Christ. For how was <hi>Adam diminished</hi> and made less than Angels, and therein depressed from another state and condition than that he had, or was due to him; or how can this be said of <hi>mankind</hi> in general, or of Believers in a <hi>special</hi> sense; And how could this be spoken of them for <hi>a little while,</hi> seeing the <hi>nature of man</hi> in it self considered, is for ever beneath the <hi>Angelical.</hi> Again, if the Apostles <hi>Interpretation</hi> be allowed, that expression, <hi>he hath put all things under his feet,</hi> is <hi>universal,</hi> and extends unto all the works of Gods hands, and among them the <hi>world to come</hi>; and these were never put in subjection to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor any other man, <hi>the man Christ Jesus</hi> excepted. And this also the Apostle plainly avers, <hi>v.</hi> 8. So that the Scope of the Place, Context of the Words, and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Expression do all direct us unto the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and to him alone.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The <hi>Vncertainty</hi> and mutual contradictions, yea, self-contradictions of the most who apply the words of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> directly unto any other but Christ, may serve further to fix us unto this Interpretation liable to none of those inconveniences which they cast themselves upon. Some would have a <hi>double literal sense</hi> in the words; the one <hi>principal,</hi> relating unto <hi>Adam</hi> or man in general; the other <hi>less principal</hi> or subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, respecting Christ; which is upon the matter to affirm that the words have no sense at all: For those words which have not one <hi>certain determinate sense,</hi> as those have not, which have <hi>two,</hi> have indeed no true proper sense at all; for their sense is their determinate signification of any thing. Some would have the <hi>literal sense</hi> to respect <hi>mankind</hi> in general, and what is affirmed in them to be <hi>mystically</hi> applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ. How far this is from truth we have already declared, by shewing that the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50110:282"/>
Words cannot so in any measure be <hi>verified</hi> or made good. By <hi>man,</hi> some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity, who how he can be called the <hi>Son of man,</hi> I know not; besides how was his Honour, not to be thought of or mentioned without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his sin and shameful fall, such a cause of rejoycing and Exaltation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Psalmist?</hi> Some, <hi>man in his corrupted condition</hi>; which how far he is from the things here mentioned need not be declared. Can we suppose the Apostle would prove the <hi>subjection of the world to come unto Christ,</hi> by a Testimony principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting them who have no interest in it; Some, <hi>believers as restored in Christ,</hi> which is true <hi>consequentially,</hi> and in respect of Participation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 27. but not <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> unto the investiture of the Honour that they are made partakers of in the Person of Christ. Besides which is the great absurdity of this <hi>Interpretation,</hi> they all affirm, that the same words are used to express and confirm things directly contrary and adverse unto one another. For those words in the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Thou hast made him <hi>little less than the Angels,</hi> they would have to signifie the <hi>Exaltation</hi> of man in his Creation, being made <hi>nigh unto, and little less than Angels,</hi> and in the Application of them by the Apostle unto Christ, they acknowledge, that they denote <hi>depression, mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, humiliation,</hi> or exinanition. How the same words in the same place can express contrary things, prove the <hi>exaltation</hi> of one, and the depression of another, is very hard, if not impossible to be understood. Besides, they are compelled to interpret the same <hi>phrase</hi> in divers senses, as well as the same sentence in contrary; for those words in the <hi>Psalmist</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as applyed unto man, they make to denote <hi>quantity</hi> or <hi>quality,</hi> as unto Christ, <hi>time</hi> or <hi>duration</hi>; which that in the same place, they cannot do both, is needless to prove. But as we said, our Exposition is wholly free from these <hi>entanglements,</hi> answering the words of the Psalmist, &amp; suited to the words and Context of the Apostle throughout.</p>

And whereas those to whom he <hi>wrote,</hi> did hear that he was in the discharge of his Office, for a <hi>little while</hi> made much lower than the Angels, it was not in vain for him to prove by <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Testimonies,</hi> that in the <hi>Execution of the same Office,</hi> he was also exalted above them, that part of his work being finished for which he was <hi>made lower than they</hi> for a season. And most needful it was for him so to do in respect of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who boasting in the <hi>Ministry of Angels</hi> in the giving of the Law, were to be convinced of the Excellency of the Author of the Gospel, as such, in the discharge of his work, above them. And the express mention of his <hi>Divine Nature</hi> was in this place altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>needless</hi> and <hi>improper</hi>; nor would it have proved the thing that he intended; for how easie had it been for the <hi>Jews</hi> to have replyed; that notwithstanding that, they saw in <hi>how low an outward condition</hi> he ministred upon the earth, and therefore that would not prove his Exaltation above Angels in the discharge of his Office; seeing notwithstanding that he was evidently made <hi>lower</hi> than they in that Office. It would also have been improper for him in this place to have made any mention thereof; seeing the proof of the Excellency of his Person absolutely considered, was nothing unto the business he had now in hand. And it was likewise every way <hi>needless,</hi> he having so abundantly proved and vindicated his <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in the <hi>Chapter</hi> foregoing. Now to take an Argument against a thing from the Apostles si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of it in one place, where the mention of it was <hi>improper,</hi> useless and needless, he having fully expressed the same matter elsewhere, yea, but newly before, is an
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50110:283"/>
evidence of a <hi>bad,</hi> or <hi>barren</hi> cause. Of the like importance is that which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards adds; p. 15. <hi>Quemadmodum autem Jesus homo verus, &amp; naturali conditione caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris hominibus fimilis esse debuit; neque enim eorum Servator est, qui natura &amp; dii sunt &amp; homines, sed hominum tantum.</hi> For we shall demonstrate, that it was needful he should have a <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> who was to suffer and to save them, who had only <hi>an humane.</hi> And if this man had acknowledged that End and Effect of his suffering, without which we know it would have been of no advantage unto them for whom he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he also would believe the same.</p>
                        <p>We say not any thing of the sense of the <hi>Jews</hi> on this place of the <hi>Psalmist.</hi> They seem wholly to have lost the design of the Holy Ghost in it, and therefore in their accustomed manner, to embrace fables and trifles. The <hi>Talmudists</hi> ascribe those words, <hi>what is man,</hi> unto some of the Angels, expressing their <hi>envy</hi> and Indignation at his honour upon his first Creation. The <hi>latter Doctors,</hi> as <hi>Kimchi</hi> and <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> make Application of it unto man in general, wherein they are followed by too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Christians, unto whom the Apostle had been a better guide. But we may here also see what is farther tendered unto us for our Instruction: As,</p>
                        <p n="i">I. <hi>The Respect, Care, Love and Grace of God unto mankind, expressed in the Person and Mediation of Jesus Christ, is a matter of singular and eternal Admiration.</hi> We have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewed from the words of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> that such in general is the <hi>Condescension</hi> of God, to have any regard of man, considering the infinite Excellency of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of his nature, as manifested in his great and glorious Works. That now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed followeth from the Apostles Application of the <hi>Psalmists</hi> words unto the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ; and consequently the regard of God unto us, in his Mediation. And this is such, as that the Apostle tells us, that at the last day, it shall be his great Glory that <hi>he will be admired in all them that do believe,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.10. When the work of his Grace shall be fully perfected in and towards them, than the Glory of his Grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth and is magnified for ever. This is that which the Admiration of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tends unto, and rests in. That God should so regard the <hi>nature of man,</hi> as to take it into Union with himself in the Person of his Son; and in that nature humbled and exalted to work out the Salvation of all them that believe on him. There are other wayes wherein the Respect of God towards man doth appear, even in the effects of his Holy Wise Providence over him. He <hi>causeth his Sun to shine, and his rain to fall upon him, Mat.</hi> 5.45. He <hi>leaves not himself without witness towards us, in that he doth good, and gives us rain from Heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness, Acts</hi> 14.17. And these wayes of his Providence are singularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable. But this Way of his Grace towards us in the Person of his Son, assuming our nature into union with himself, is that wherein the exceeding and unspeakable riches of his Glory and Wisdom are made manifest. So the Apostle expresseth it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. He hath that to declare unto them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of its <hi>Greatness,</hi> Glory and Beauty they are no way able of themselves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or comprehend: And therefore he prayes for them, that they may have the Spirit of <hi>Wisdom and Revelation to give them the knowledge of Christ</hi>; or that God by his Spirit would make them wise to apprehend, and give them a gracious discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of what he proposeth to them; as also that hereby they may enjoy the blessed effect of an enlightned Understanding, without which they will not discern the Excellency of this matter; and what is it, that they must thus be <hi>helped,</hi> assisted, prepared for to understand, in any measure? What is the Greatness, the Glory of it, that can no otherwise be discerned? why, saith he, marvel not at the necessity of this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that which I propose unto you is the <hi>glory of God</hi>; that wherein he will prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally be glorified, here and unto Eternity; and it is the <hi>Riches</hi> of that Glory; the treasures of it. God hath in other things set forth, and manifested his Glory; but yet as it were by <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>parcels</hi>; one thing hath declared his Power, another his Goodness and Wisdom; and that in part, with reference unto that particular about which they have been exercised. But in this, he hath drawn forth, displayed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested all the Riches and Treasures of his Glory, so that his Excellencies are capable of no greater <hi>Exaltation.</hi> And there is also in this work, the unspeakable <hi>Greatness of his power</hi> engaged; that no property of his nature may seem to be <hi>uninterested</hi> in this matter. Now whereunto doth all this tend? why it is all to give a blessed and eternal Inheritance unto believers, unto the hope and expectation whereof they are called by the Gospel. And by what way or means is all this wrought and brought
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50110:283"/>
about; even by the <hi>working of God in Jesus Christ</hi> in his Humiliation, when he dyed; and his Exaltation, in his Resurrection, putting all things under his feet, <hi>crowning him, with glory and honour,</hi> which the Apostle shews by a citation of this place of the Psalmist; for all this is out of Gods regard unto man; it is for the Church, which is the body of Christ, and his fulness. So full of glory, such an object of eternal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration is this work of the Love and Grace of God: which as <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, the <hi>very Angels themselves desire to look into,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. And this further appears,</p>
                        <p>First, Because all Gods <hi>regard of man</hi> in this way is a fruit of meer <hi>Soveraign Grace</hi> and condescension. And all <hi>Grace</hi> is admirable; especially the Grace of God; and that <hi>so great Grace,</hi> as the Scripture expresseth it. There was no consideration of any thing without God himself, that moved him hereunto. He had glorified himself as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> shews in other works of his hands; and he could have rested in that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Man deserved no such thing of him, being worthless and sinful. It <hi>was all of Grace</hi>; both in the head and members. The Humane nature of Christ <hi>neither did, nor could merit</hi> the <hi>Hypostatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> It <hi>did not,</hi> because being made partaker of it, from the instant of his Conception, all antecedent Operations that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, were prevented; and a thing cannot be <hi>merited</hi> by any after it is freely granted antecedently unto any deserts. Nor could it do so; Hypostatical Union could be no reward of obedience; being that which exceeds all the order of things, and Rules of Remunerative Justice. The Assumption then of our nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Personal Union with the Son of God, was an Act of <hi>meer, free, soveraign, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Grace.</hi> And this is the foundation of all the <hi>following fruits</hi> of Gods regard unto us; and that being of Grace, so must they be also. What ever God doth for us, in and by Jesus Christ as made man for us, which is all that he so doth, it must I say be <hi>all of Grace,</hi> because his being made man was so. Had there been any <hi>merit,</hi> any desert on our part, any Preparation for, or Disposition unto the Effects of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; had our nature, that portion of it which was sanctified and separated to be united unto the Son of God, any way procured, or prepared it self for its Union and Assumption, things had fallen under some rules of Justice and Equality, whereby they might be apprehended and measured; but <hi>all being of Grace,</hi> they leave place unto nothing but eternal Admiration and thankfulness.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Had not God been thus <hi>mindful</hi> of man, and visited him in the Person of his Son incarnate; <hi>every one</hi> partaker of that nature must have utterly perished in their lost condition. And this also renders the Grace of it an object of Admiration. We are not only to look what God <hi>takes us unto</hi> by this Visitation, but to consider also what he <hi>delivers us from.</hi> Now this is a great part of that <hi>vile and base conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which the Psalmist wonders that God should have regard unto; namely, that we had <hi>sinned and come short of his Glory</hi>; and thereby exposed our selves unto <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal misery.</hi> In that condition we must have perished for ever had not God freed us by this <hi>Visitation.</hi> It had been <hi>Great Grace</hi> to have taken an <hi>innocent,</hi> a sinless man into Glory; <hi>Great Grace</hi> to have freed a <hi>sinner from misery</hi>; though he should never be brought to the enjoyment of the least <hi>positive</hi> Good. But to free a <hi>sinner</hi> from the utmost and most <hi>inconceivable misery,</hi> in <hi>eternal ruine,</hi> and to bring him unto the highest happiness, in <hi>eternal Glory,</hi> and all this in a way of meer Grace; this is to be admired.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Because it appeareth that God is <hi>more glorified</hi> in the Humiliation and Exaltation of the Lord Christ, and the salvation of mankind thereby, than in any of, or all the Works of the first Creation. How <hi>glorious</hi> those works are, and how mightily they set forth the glory of God, we have before declared. But as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> intimates, God rested not in them; He had yet a farther design, to manifest his Glory in a more eminent and singular manner, and this he did, by <hi>minding and visiting of man</hi> in Christ Jesus. None almost is so stupid, but on the first view of the Heavens, the <hi>Sun, Moon and Stars,</hi> but he will confess, that their Fabrick, Beauty and Order, is wonderful, and that the Glory of their framer and builder is for ever to be admired in them: But all this comes <hi>short of that Glory</hi> which ariseth unto God from this Condescension and Grace. And therefore it may be the day will come, and that speedily, wherein these Heavens, and this whole old Creation, shall be utterly dissolved and brought to nothing. For why should they abide as a <hi>monument of his power</hi> unto them, who enjoying the <hi>blessed vision</hi> of him, shall see and know it far more evidently and eminently in himself. However they shall undoubtedly in a short time cease as to their <hi>Vse,</hi> wherein at present they are principally subservient unto the manifestation of the glory of God. But the Effects of this <hi>regard of God to man,</hi>
                           <pb n="222" facs="tcp:50110:284"/>
shall abide unto Eternity; and the glory of God therein. This is the foundation of Heaven, as it is a <hi>state</hi> and condition; as it denotes the Glorious Presence of God among his Saints and holy ones. Without this there would be no <hi>such Heaven</hi>; all that is there, and all the glory of it, depends thereon. Take away this <hi>foundation,</hi> and all that beauty and glory disappears. Nothing indeed would be taken from God, who ever was, and ever will be eternally <hi>blessed</hi> in his own Self sufficiency. But the whole <hi>Theatre</hi> which he hath erected for the manifestation of his glory unto Eternity, depends on this his holy Condescension and Grace; which assuredly render them meet for ever to be admired and adored.</p>
                        <p>This then let us exercise our selves unto. <hi>Faith</hi> having infinite, eternal, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible things proposed unto it, acts it self greatly in this Admiration. We are every where taught, that we now know but <hi>imperfectly,</hi> in part, and that we see <hi>darkly</hi> as in a glass; not that the Revelation of these things in the Word, is dark and obscure; for they are <hi>fully</hi> and clearly proposed; but that such is the nature of the things themselves, that we are not in this life able to comprehend them; and therefore, faith doth principally exercise it self in an holy admiration of them. And indeed no Love or Grace will suit our condition, but that which is incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We find our selves by Experience to stand in need of more Grace, Goodness, Love and Mercy, than we can look into, search to the bottom of, or fully understand. But when that which is <hi>infinite</hi> and incomprehensible is proposed unto us, there all fears are overwhelmed, and faith finds rest with Assurance. And if our admiration of these things, be an Act, an Effect, a fruit of faith, it will be of singular use to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear our hearts unto God, and to excite them unto <hi>thankful obedience.</hi> For who would not love and delight in the eternal fountain of this inconceivable Grace? And what shall we render unto him who hath done more for us, than we are any way able to think or conceive.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. Observe also, that <hi>such was the inconceivable Love of Jesus Christ the Son of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the souls of men, that he was free, and willing to condescend unto any condition for their good and salvation.</hi> That was the end of all this dispensation. And the Lord Christ was not humbled and made less than the Angels, without his <hi>own Will</hi> and consent. His Will and good liking concurred unto this work. Hence when the Eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of this whole matter is mentioned, it is said of him as the Wisdom of the Father, that he <hi>rejoyced in the habitable part of the earth, and his delights were with the Sons of men, Prov.</hi> 8.31. He delighted in the counsel of redeeming and saving them, by his own Humiliation and suffering. And the Scripture makes it evident, upon these two considerations.</p>
                        <p>First, In that it shews, that what he was to <hi>do,</hi> and what he was to <hi>undergo</hi> in this work was proposed unto him, and that he willingly accepted of the terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it, <hi>Psalm</hi> 40.6. God sayes unto him, <hi>that sacrifice and offering</hi> would not do this great work; <hi>burnt-offering and sin-offering</hi> would not effect it; that is, no kind of Offerings or Sacrifices instituted by the Law were available to take away sin, and to save sinners; as our Apostle expounds that place at large, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 1, 2, 3, 4. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming his Exposition with sundry Arguments taken from their nature and Effects; What then doth God require of him, that this great design of the salvation of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may be accomplished? even that he himself should make <hi>his own soul an offering for sin; pour out his soul unto death,</hi> and <hi>thereby bear the sin of many, Isa.</hi> 53.10.12. That <hi>seeing the Law was weak through the flesh,</hi> that is, by reason of our sins in the flesh, that he himself should take upon him the <hi>likeness of sinful flesh, and become an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for sin in the flesh, Rom.</hi> 8.3. That he should be <hi>made of a woman made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law,</hi> if he would <hi>redeem them that were under the Law, Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. that he <hi>should make himself of no reputation,</hi> but <hi>take upon him the form of a servant, and be made in the likeness of man, and being found in fashion as a man to humble himself and to become obedient unto death, the death of the Cross, Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8. These things were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto him, which he was to undergo, if he would deliver and save mankind. And how did he entertain this proposal? how did he like these Conditions? <hi>I was not,</hi> saith he, <hi>rebellious, I turned not away back; Isa.</hi> 50.5. He declined them not; he refused none of the terms that were proposed unto him, but underwent them in a way of Obedience; and that with Willingness, Alacrity and delight, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.6, 7, 8. <hi>Thou,</hi> saith he, <hi>hast opened my ears</hi>; or <hi>prepared a body for me</hi>; wherein I may yield this obedience; (that the Apostle declares to be the sense of the expression, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.)
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50110:284"/>
This Obedience could not be yielded <hi>without a body,</hi> wherein it was performed; and whereas to <hi>hear,</hi> or to have the <hi>ear opened,</hi> is in the Scripture to be <hi>prepared unto obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>: the <hi>Psalmist</hi> in that one Expression, <hi>Mine ear hast thou opened,</hi> comprizeth both these; even that Christ had <hi>a body prepared,</hi> by a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> of a part for the whole; and also in that <hi>body</hi> he was ready to yield obedience unto God in this great work, which could not be accomplished by <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and Burnt-offerings. And this readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and willingness of Christ unto this work is set out under three heads in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing words. (1.) His <hi>Tender</hi> of himself unto this work; then said he, <hi>Lo, I come, in the volume of thy book it is written of me</hi>: This thou hast promised, this is recorded in the <hi>head, beginning</hi> of thy book; namely, in that great Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That the seed of the woman should bruise the head of the serpent</hi>; and now thou hast given me, and <hi>prepared me</hi> in the fulness of time, a Body for that purpose, <hi>Lo, I come,</hi> willing and ready to undertake it. (2.) In the <hi>frame</hi> of his mind, in this engagement; he entred into it with great delight, <hi>I delight to do thy will O my God</hi>; he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the thoughts of it only of old, as before, and then grew heavy and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful when it was to be undertaken: but he went unto it, with <hi>chea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>fulness</hi> and delight, although he knew what <hi>sorrow</hi> and <hi>grief</hi> it would cost him before it was brought unto perfection. (3.) From the <hi>Principle,</hi> whence this Obedience and delight did spring; which was an universal conformity of his Soul, Mind and Will, unto the Law Will and Mind of God, <hi>thy Law is in my heart, in the midst of my bowels</hi>; every thing in me is compliant with thy Will and Law: There is in me an universal conformity thereunto. Being thus <hi>prepared,</hi> thus <hi>principled, he considered the Glory that was set before him,</hi> the glory that would redound unto God, by his becoming a <hi>Captain of salvation,</hi> and that would ensue unto himself: <hi>He endured the Cross and despised the shame, He.</hi> 12.2. He <hi>armed</hi> himself with those considerations, against the hardships and sufferings that he was to meet withall; as the Apostle adviseth us with the like mind when we are to suffer; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. By all which it appears, that the <hi>Good will and Love of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> was in this matter of being <hi>humbled and made less than Angels</hi>; as the Apostle sayes expresly, <hi>that he humbled himself, and made himself of no reputation, Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8. as well as it is here said, that <hi>God humbled him,</hi> or made him less than Angels.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Scripture peculiarly assigns this work unto the Love and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension of Christ himself. For although it abounds in sitting forth the <hi>Love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in the designing and contriving this work, and sending his Son into the world, yet it directs us unto the <hi>Lord Christ himself,</hi> as the next immediate cause of his engaging into it, and performance of it. So saith the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God</hi>; that is, by faith in him, <hi>who loved me, and gave himself for me.</hi> It was the <hi>Love of Christ</hi> that moved him to give himself for us; which is excellently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in that doxology, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>To him that loved us and washed us in his own blood from our sins, and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his Father, unto him be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen.</hi> All this was the fruit of his Love; and therefore unto him is all Praise and Honour to be given and ascribed. And so <hi>great</hi> was this Love of Christ, that he declined nothing that was proposed unto him. This the Apostle calls his <hi>Grace,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Ye know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</hi> He condescended unto a poor and low condition, and to suffer therein for our good, that we might be made partakers of the Riches of the Grace of God. And this was the love of the Person of Christ, because it was in, and wrought equally in him, both before and after his <hi>Assumption</hi> of our nature.</p>
                        <p>Now the Holy Ghost makes an especial Application of this truth unto us, as unto one part of our Obedience, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>; and what that mind was, he declares in the ensuing Verses; laying out his <hi>infinite condescension</hi> in taking our nature upon him, and submitting to all misery, reproach and death it self for our sakes. If this mind were in Christ, should not we endeavour after a Readiness and Willingness to submit our selves unto <hi>any condition</hi> for his glory. <hi>Forasmuch,</hi> saith <hi>Peter, as Christ hath suffered for us in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>sh, arm your selves likewise with the same mind,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. Many difficulties will lye in our way, many Reasonings will rise up against it, if we <hi>consult with flesh and blood</hi>; but, saith he, <hi>arm your selves with the same mind that was in Christ</hi>; get your souls strengthened and fenced by Grace, against all Oppositions, that you may follow him, and imitate him. Some that profess his name, will <hi>suffer nothing</hi> for him; if they may enjoy him, or his wayes in peace and quietness well and good; but if <hi>Persecution</hi> arise for the Gospel,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50110:285"/>
immediately they fall away. These have neither lot nor portion in this matter. Others, the most, the best, have a secret <hi>lothness</hi> and unwillingness to condescend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a condition of trouble and distress for the Gospel. Well, if we are <hi>unwilling</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; What doth the Lord Christ lose by it? Will it be any real <hi>Abatement</hi> of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or glory? Will he lose his Crown or Kingdom thereby? So far as suffering in this world is needful for any of his blessed Ends and Purposes; he will not want them who shall be ready even to <hi>dye for his name sake</hi>: But what if he had been <hi>unwilling</hi> to be humbled and to suffer for us? If the <hi>same mind</hi> had been in Christ, as was in us, what had been our state and condition unto eternity? In this Grace, Love and Willingness of Christ lyes the foundation of all our Happiness, of all our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from misery and ruine; and shall we reckon our selves to have an <hi>interest</hi> therein, and yet find our selves altogether unready to a conformity unto him? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Lord Christ was really <hi>rich</hi> when he made himself <hi>poor</hi> for our sakes; he was <hi>in the form of God,</hi> when he took upon him the <hi>form of a servant,</hi> and became for us of no reputation; nothing of this was due to him, or belonged unto him, but meerly on our account. But we are in our selves <hi>really poor,</hi> and obnoxious unto infinitely more miseries for our <hi>own sins,</hi> than what he calls us unto for <hi>his name.</hi> Are we unwilling to suffer a little light transitory trouble in this world for him, without whose sufferings for us, we must have suffered misery and that Eternal whether we would or no: And I speak not so much about suffering it self, as about the mind and <hi>frame</hi> of Spirit wherewith we undergo it. Some will suffer when they cannot avoid it; but so <hi>unwillingly,</hi> so <hi>unchearfully,</hi> as makes it evident, that they aim at nothing; nor act from no Principle, but meerly that they dare not go against their Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But the <hi>mind that was in Christ</hi> will lead us unto it, out of Love unto him, with <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>enlargedness</hi> of heart, which is required of us.</p>
                        <p n="iii">III. <hi>The blessed issue of the abasement of Jesus Christ in his exaltation unto honour and glory, is an assured pledge of the final glory and blessedness of all that believe in him; what ever difficulties and dangers they may be exercised withal in the way.</hi> His Humiliation and Exaltation, as we have seen proceeded out of <hi>Gods condescension</hi> and love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. His <hi>Electing Love,</hi> the eternal gracious purpose of his Will to recover lost sinners, and to bring them unto the enjoyment of himself, was the ground of this dispensation. And therefore what he hath done in Christ, is a certain pledge of what he will do in and for them also. He is not <hi>crowned with Honour and Glory</hi> meerly for himself, but that he may be a <hi>Captain of Salvation,</hi> and bring others unto a Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Glory.</p>
                        <p n="iv">IV. <hi>Jesus Christ as the Mediator of the New Covenant, hath absolute and supream au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given unto him over all the works of God in Heaven and Earth.</hi> This we have so fully manifested and insisted on upon the foregoing Chapter, that we shall not here farther pursue it; but only mind by the way, that <hi>blessed</hi> is the state and condition, <hi>great</hi> is the spiritual and eternal security of the Church; seeing all things are under the very <hi>feet of its Head and Saviour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="v">V. <hi>The Lord Jesus Christ is the only Lord of the Gospel state of the Church, called under the Old Testament the world to come</hi>; and therefore he only hath Power to dispose of all things in it, relating unto that <hi>Worship of God</hi> which it is to perform and celebrate. It is not <hi>put into subjection</hi> unto any other, Angels or men. This priviledge was reserved for Christ; this honour is bestowed on the Church. He is the only Head, King and Law-giver of it; and nothing is it to be taught <hi>to observe or do, but what he hath commanded.</hi> But this will fall more directly under our consideration in the beginning of the next Chapter.</p>
                        <p n="vi">VI. <hi>The Lord Jesus Christ in his death did undergo the poenal sentence of the Law; in the room and stead of them for whom he dyed.</hi> Death was that which by the sentence of the Law was due unto sin and sinners. For them did Christ dye, and therein <hi>tasted of the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that death</hi> which they were to have undergone; or else the fruit of it could not have redounded untô them; for what was it towards their discharge, if that which they had <hi>deserved</hi> was not <hi>suffered</hi>; but somewhat else wherein the least part of their concernment did lye. But this being done, certain deliverance and salvation will be the lot and portion of them, of all them for whom he dyed; and that upon the rules of Justice and righteousness on the part of Christ, though on theirs, of meer Mercy and Grace.</p>

                        <head>Verse X.</head>
                        <p>THE Apostle in the Verses fore-going made mention of that, which of all other things the <hi>Jews</hi> generally were most <hi>offended at,</hi> and which was of the greatest importance to be believed; namely the <hi>sufferings of the Messiah,</hi> wherein a great part of the discharge of his <hi>Sacerdotal Office,</hi> whereunto he here makes a <hi>Transition,</hi> did consist. This his <hi>own Disciples</hi> were <hi>slow in the belief of, Matth.</hi> 16.22. <hi>chap.</hi> 17.22, 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.25, 26. and the <hi>Jews</hi> generally stumbled at. They thought it strange that the <hi>Messiah, the Son of God,</hi> the Saviour of his people, and Captain of their salvation, concerning whom so great and glorious things were promised and foretold, should be brought into a <hi>low despised condition,</hi> and therein to <hi>suffer</hi> and die. Hence they cried unto him on the <hi>Cross, If thou be the Christ, come down and save thy self</hi>; intimating that by his <hi>suffering</hi> he was assuredly proved not to be so; for why any one should <hi>suffer</hi> that could <hi>deliver himself</hi> they saw no reason.</p>
                        <p>Besides they had inveterate prejudices about the <hi>Salvation</hi> promised by the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and the way whereby it was to be wrought, arising from their love and over-valuation of temporal or carnal things, with their contempt of things spiritual and eternal. They expected a deliverance outward glorious and <hi>Kingly</hi> in this world, and that to be wrought with Arms, Power, and a mighty hand. And what should they expect from a <hi>Messiah</hi> that suffered and died? Wherefore the Apostle having asserted the <hi>sufferings of Christ,</hi> saw it necessary to proceed unto a full confirmation of it, with a declaration of the Reasons, Causes and Ends of it; partly to evert that <hi>false perswasion</hi> which prevailed amongst them about the <hi>nature of the salvation</hi> to be wrought by Christ; partly to shew, that nothing would thence ensue <hi>derogatory</hi> unto what he had before delivered about his preheminence above Angels; but principally to instruct them in the Sacerdotal Office of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Redemption which he wrought, and the means whereby he accomplished it, which was the great business that he had designed to treat with them about. For the <hi>Salvation</hi> it self, he declares that it was not to be of the same kind with that which they had of old, when they were brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and setled in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Joshua</hi>; but <hi>spiritual</hi> and heavenly, in a deliverance from sin, Sathan, death and hell, with a <hi>manuduction</hi> into life and blessedness <hi>eternal.</hi> The way whereby this was to be wrought, he informs them that it was to be by the <hi>sufferings and death of the Messiah,</hi> and that no other way it could be accomplished; on which account they were indispensibly necessary. And the first reason hereof he expresseth in this tenth verse.</p>

Some suppose an <hi>hyperbaton</hi> in them; and that those expressions, <hi>For whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory,</hi> do intend the <hi>Son,</hi> the Captain of salvation. The word <gap reason="foreign">

And that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of, <hi>from whom are all things, and for whom are all things,</hi> from, <hi>it became him,</hi> takes away one main foundation of the Apostles reasoning, as we shall see. And the reason alledged for this <hi>ordering</hi> of the words is <hi>infirm,</hi> namely that it is Christ who <hi>brings the many sons unto glory,</hi> not the Father; for it is also assigned unto him, as we shall see upon many accounts.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>First, A <hi>Reason</hi> is rendred in the words, of what he had asserted in the fore-going verse, namely that <hi>Jesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to <hi>suffer death,</hi> and by the grace of God to taste of death for all; why he should do thus, on what account, what ground ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and reason there was for it, is here declared; it was so to be, <hi>For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The <hi>Design</hi> of God is expressed in this whole matter, and that was, <hi>to bring many sons unto glory.</hi> And herein the Apostle declares the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>salvation</hi> which was to be wrought by the <hi>Messiah,</hi> about which the <hi>Jews</hi> were so greatly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, and consequently in and about the <hi>way</hi> whereby it was to be wrought. His purpose herein was not <hi>now</hi> to carry his <hi>children into a new Canaan,</hi> to bring them into a <hi>wealthy country,</hi> an earthly Kingdom, which must or might have been done by <hi>Might,</hi> and Power, and Arms, as of old; but his <hi>design</hi> towards his <hi>sons</hi> in and by the <hi>Messiah</hi> was of another nature; it was <hi>to bring them unto glory,</hi> eternal glory with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in heaven; and so it is no wonder if the <hi>way</hi> whereby this is to be accomplished be <hi>quite of another nature</hi> than that whereby their temporal deliverance was wrought; namely by the death and sufferings of the <hi>Messiah</hi> himself. And here in reference unto this design of God it is supposed, 1. That some who were <hi>created</hi> for the glory of God, had by sin come short of it; so that without a <hi>new way</hi> of <hi>bringing them</hi> unto it, it was impossible that they should ever be made partakers of it. This is here <hi>supposed</hi> by the Apostle, and is the foundation of all his Doctrine concerning the <hi>Messiah.</hi> 2. That the way whereby God will at length bring them who are designed unto glory thereunto, is by taking of them first into a state of <hi>Sonship</hi> and Reconciliation with himself; they must be <hi>sons</hi> before they are brought to glory. There is a double act of Gods <hi>Predestination</hi>; the first is his <hi>designation of some unto grace,</hi> to be sons, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.5. the <hi>other</hi> his appointment of those sons unto <hi>glory,</hi> both to be wrought and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by Christ, <hi>the Captain of their salvation.</hi> The latter, and the execution of it, namely the <hi>bringing of those who by grace are made sons, unto glory,</hi> is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle here expresseth. He dealeth not with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in this Epistle about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Elect, the traduction of them into a state of grace and <hi>sonship,</hi> but of the government of them being made <hi>sons,</hi> and their guidance unto glory. And therefore the <hi>sufferings of Christ,</hi> which absolutely and in themselves are the cause of our <hi>sonship</hi> and reconciliation with God, are mentioned here only as the <hi>means</hi> whereby Christ entred into a condition of <hi>leading sons into glory,</hi> or of saving <hi>them</hi> who upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his <hi>sufferings</hi> are made sons by grace. But yet this is not so <hi>precisely</hi> respected neither, but that the Apostle withall intimates the necessity of the <hi>sufferings</hi> of Christ, as to the whole effect of it towards the Elect. Now these <hi>sons</hi> thus to be brought unto glory are said to be <hi>many</hi>; not <hi>all</hi> absolutely, not a <hi>few,</hi> or of the <hi>Jews</hi> only, which they looked for; but <hi>all the Elect</hi> of God, who are <hi>many, Rev.</hi> 7.9. And this work of <hi>bringing many sons unto glory,</hi> is here signally assigned by the Apostle unto <hi>God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> whose Love Wisdom and Grace, Believers are principally to eye in the whole work of their salvation wrought out and accomplished by Jesus Christ. This therefore we shall a little insist upon to declare the grounds and reasons, on the account whereof it is so ascribed unto him, or what acts are peculiarly assigned unto the Father in this work of <hi>bringing many sons unto glory</hi>; which will secure the ascription of it unto him, and therein our <hi>interpretation</hi> of the place.</p>

                           <pb n="229" facs="tcp:50110:287"/>1. The <hi>Eternal designation</hi> of them unto that glory whereunto they are to be brought, is peculiarly assigned unto him. <hi>He predestinates them to be conformed to the image of his Son, Rom.</hi> 8.28, 29, 30. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ <hi>chooseth us before the foundation of the world,</hi> and predestinateth us unto the <hi>adoption of children by Jesus Christ unto himself, Ephes.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. And he hath <hi>from the beginning chosen us unto salvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.13, 14.

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. He was the spring and fountain of that <hi>Covenant</hi> (as in all other Operations of the Deity) that was of old between <hi>himself</hi> and his Son, about the salvation and <hi>glory</hi> of the Elect. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.4. <hi>chap.</hi> 53.11, 12. <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.10 to <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.1, 6. He in his love and grace is still declared as the Proposer both of the Duty and of the Reward of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, the <hi>Son incarnate,</hi> as the Son accepts of his Terms and Proposals, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7, 8. And hence the Intenseness of his Love, the Immutability of his Counsel, the Holiness of his Nature, his Righteousness and Faithfulness, his Infinite Wisdom, do all shine forth in the <hi>Mediation</hi> and sufferings of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>chap.</hi> 5.8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. Rather than his Love should not be satisfied, and his Counsel accomplished, <hi>He spared not his own Son, but gave him unto death for us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. He <hi>signally</hi> gave out the <hi>first Promise,</hi> that great foundation of the Covenant of Grace, and afterwards declared, confirmed, and ratified by his <hi>Oath,</hi> that Covenant wherein all the means of <hi>bringing the elect unto glory</hi> are contained, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Jerem</hi>: 31.32, 33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8. The Person of the Father is considered as the <hi>principal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of the Covenant, as the Person <hi>covenanting</hi> and taking us into covenant with himself; the <hi>Son</hi> as the <hi>Messiah,</hi> being considered as the <hi>Surety</hi> and <hi>Mediator</hi> of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.15. and the Purchaser of the Promises of it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. He <hi>gave and sent his Son</hi> to be a Saviour and Redeemer for them, and unto them, so that in his whole work, in all that he did and suffered, he <hi>obeyed the Command,</hi> and fulfilled the <hi>Will</hi> of the Father. <hi>Him</hi> did God the Father <hi>send,</hi> and <hi>seal,</hi> and <hi>give,</hi> and <hi>set forth,</hi> as the Scripture every where expresseth it. And our Lord Jesus Christ every where remits us to the consideration of the Love, Will, and Authority of his Father in all that he did, taught or suffered, so seeking the <hi>Glory of God that sent him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. He draws his <hi>Elect,</hi> and enables them to <hi>come to the Son,</hi> to believe in him, and so to obtain life salvation and glory by him. <hi>No man,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him, Joh.</hi> 6.44. No man, no not any one of the Elect, can come to Christ, unless the Father, in the pursuit of that love from whence it was that he sent the Son, do put forth the <hi>efficacy of his grace</hi> to enable him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and accordingly he <hi>reveals him</hi> unto some, when he is <hi>hidden</hi> from others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. For the <hi>Revelation of Christ unto the soul</hi> is the immediate act of the Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.17.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Being <hi>reconciled unto them by the blood of his Son,</hi> he <hi>reconciles</hi> them unto himself, by giving them pardon and forgiveness of sins in and by the Promises of the Gospel, without which they cannot come to glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>He is in Christ reconciling us unto himself,</hi> by the <hi>non-imputation,</hi> or forgiveness of our sins; <hi>Forgiving us all our trespasses for Christ his sake, Ephes.</hi> 4.32. There are many things concurring unto the pardon of sin, that are peculiar acts of the Father.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. He <hi>quickens</hi> them and <hi>sanctifies</hi> them by his Spirit, to <hi>make them meet for the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Saints in light</hi>; that is, for the enjoyment of glory. <hi>He that raised up Jesus from the dead, quickens us by his Spirit, Rom.</hi> 8.11. So saving us, <hi>by the washing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us richly by Jesus Christ, Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6.

The whole right of <hi>adopting children</hi> is in the Father, and so is the <hi>authoritative translation</hi> of them out of the world and kingdom of Sathan into his own <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>Houshold,</hi> with their investiture in all the rights and priviledges thereof.</p>

                        <p>In brief, in <hi>bringing the Elect unto Glory,</hi> all the <hi>Sovereign Acts</hi> of Power, Wisdom, Love and Grace exerted therein, are peculiarly assigned unto the <hi>Father</hi>; as all <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial acts</hi> are unto the Son as <hi>Mediator.</hi> So that there is no reason why he may not be said by the way of eminency to be the <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, the <hi>leader or bringer of his sons unto glory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And herein lies a great <hi>direction</hi> unto Believers, and a great <hi>supportment</hi> for their faith. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>That by Christ we do believe in God that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, that our faith and hope might be in God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Jesus Christ considered as <hi>Mediator</hi> is the <hi>next,</hi> but not the <hi>ultimate</hi> Object of our faith and hope. We so believe <hi>in him,</hi> as <hi>by him</hi> to believe in God, that is the Father, whose Love is the supreme fountain and spring of our salvation; which the Apostle manifests in that double instance of his <hi>raising up Christ,</hi> and <hi>giving of him glory</hi>; thereby declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the principal Author of the great work of his Mediation. This he directs us unto, so to believe in Christ, as that discerning in and by him the <hi>Grace, Good-will,</hi> and Love of the Father himself towards us, we may be encouraged to fix our faith and hope on him, <hi>seeing he himself loveth us.</hi> So that Christ himself had no need to pray for the love of the Father unto us, but only for the <hi>communication of the effects of it, Joh.</hi> 16.26, 27. And this is the work of faith, when as we are directed we <hi>pray to the Father in the name of Christ, Joh.</hi> 16.23, 24. And we thus place <hi>our faith in God the Father,</hi> when we conceive of him as the <hi>Sovereign Leader of us unto glory,</hi> by all the instances before mentioned.

                        <p>Thirdly, There is in these words intimated the <hi>principal means</hi> that God fixed on for the accomplishment of this design of his, <hi>for the bringing of many sons unto glory</hi>; it was by appointing a <hi>Captain of their salvation.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> generally granted that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be the <hi>Captain of their salvation</hi>; but misunderstanding that <hi>salvation,</hi> they also mistook the whole nature of his Office. The Apostle doth here evidently compare him unto <hi>Joshua,</hi> the <hi>Captain</hi> and Leader of the people into <hi>Canaan,</hi> (as he had before preferred him above the <hi>Angels,</hi> by whose ministery the <hi>Law</hi> was given unto the people in the Wilderness) which was a Type of their salvation, as he farther declares, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. All the <hi>sons of God</hi> are put under his conduct and guidance, as the people of old were under the rule of <hi>Joshua,</hi> to bring them into the <hi>glory</hi> designed for them, and promised unto them in the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> And he is called their <gap reason="foreign">

of it. And the Holy Ghost hereby also intimates, that the way whereby God will bring the <hi>Sons</hi> unto Glory, is full of Difficulties, Perplexities and Oppositions, as that of the <hi>Israelites</hi> into <hi>Canaan</hi> was also; so that they have need of a <hi>Captain,</hi> Leader and Guide to carry them through it. But yet all is rendered <hi>safe</hi> and secure unto them, through the Power, Grace and Faithfulness of their Leader. They only perish in the <hi>Wilderness</hi> and dye in their sins, who either out of love unto the <hi>flesh-pots of Aegypt,</hi> the pleasures of this world, or being terrified with the hardships of the warfare which he calls them unto, refuse to go up under his command.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, There is expressed in the words, the <hi>especial way,</hi> whereby God fitted or designed the Lord Christ unto this Office of being a <hi>Captain of salvation</hi> unto the Sons to be brought unto Glory. To understand this aright, we must observe, that the Apostle speaks not here of the Redemption of the Elect absolutely;<note place="margin">
                              <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>.</note> but of the <hi>bringing them to Glory,</hi> when they are made Sons in an especial manner. And therefore he treats not <hi>absolutely</hi> of the Designation, Consecration, or fitting of the Lord Christ unto his Office of Mediator in general, but as unto that part, and the Execution of it, which especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerns the <hi>leading of the Sons unto glory,</hi> as <hi>Joshuah</hi> lead the <hi>Israelites</hi> into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> This will give us light into what <hi>Act</hi> of God towards the Lord Christ is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this expression, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. And sundry are here plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Expositors, not without some probability. As (1.) Some think, that his <hi>bringing him to glory</hi> is intended; it became him <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>to bring him to Glory</hi> by and through sufferings, so to perfect him. But besides, that the word is no where so used, nor hath any such signification, the Apostle doth not declare what God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>bring him unto,</hi> but <hi>by what</hi> in and about him, he intended to <hi>bring many Sons to glory.</hi> (2.) Some would have it to denote the <hi>finishing of Gods work about him</hi>; whence in his sufferings on the Cross he said <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap>, used in that place by our Saviour, but not of <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, the word here used by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> which never signifies to <hi>end or finish,</hi> or to <hi>perfect by bringing unto an end.</hi> (3.) Some think God made the <hi>Lord Christ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by sufferings,</hi> in that he gave him thereby a full sense and Experience of the condition of his people; whence he is said to <hi>learn obedience by the things that he suffered, Chap.</hi> 5.8. And this is <hi>true,</hi> God did so; but it is not <hi>formally</hi> and directly expressed by this word, which is never used unto that purpose. This is rather a <hi>consequent</hi> of the Act here intended, than the <hi>Act</hi> it self. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And this was the <hi>use</hi> of the word among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> signifying the <hi>Initiation</hi> and <hi>Consecration</hi> of a man into the Mysteries of their Religion, to be a Leader unto others. And among some of them it was performed through the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Devil by great sufferings. <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, saith <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen. Orat. cont. Jul.</hi> 1. <hi>No man could be consecrated unto the mysteries of Mithra</hi> (the Sun) <hi>unless he proved himself holy, and as it were inviolable, by passing through many degrees of punishments and trialls.</hi> Thus it became God to <hi>dedicate</hi> and <hi>consecrate</hi> the Lord Christ unto this <hi>Part</hi> of his Office by his <hi>own sufferings.</hi> He consecrated <hi>Aaron</hi> to be Priest of old, but by the hands of <hi>Moses</hi>; and he was set apart to his Office by the Sacrifice of other things. But the Lord Christ must be <hi>consecrated by his own sufferings,</hi> and the Sacrifice of himself. And thence it is, that those <hi>very sufferings,</hi> which as <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous</hi> unto his being a <hi>Captain of salvation,</hi> to this End that he might <hi>lead the Sons unto Glory,</hi> are the means of his <hi>dedication</hi> or consecration, are in themselves a great part of that means whereby he procures salvation for them. By all the <hi>sufferings</hi> then of the Lord Christ in his life and death, by which <hi>sufferings</hi> he wrought out the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the elect, did God <hi>consecrate</hi> and <hi>dedicate</hi> him to be a Prince, a Leader and <hi>Captain</hi> of salvation unto his people; as <hi>Peter</hi> declares the whole matter, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.30, 31.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50110:289"/>
and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.36. And from these things last mentioned, of the Lord Christ being the <hi>Captain</hi> of our Salvation, and being <hi>dedicated</hi> unto that Office by his own suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, it appeareth.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>That the whole work of saving the Sons of God from first to last, their guidance and conduct through sins and sufferings unto Glory, is committed unto the Lord Jesus</hi>; whence he is constantly to be eyed by believers in all the concernments of their Faith, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Consolation. <hi>Behold,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the People, Isa.</hi> 55.4. <hi>A Witness</hi> to testifie the truth, in revealing the mind and Will of God; a <hi>Leader</hi> going before them as a <hi>Prince</hi> and Captain, as the word signifies; and a <hi>Commander,</hi> that gives out Laws and Rules for their Obedience. God hath set him as a Lord over his whole House, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.5. and committed all the mannagement of all its concernments unto him; There is no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that belongs unto Gods design of <hi>bringing many sons to glory,</hi> but he is under his Rule and Inspection. Neither is there any thing that concerns any of them in their passage towards glory, whereby they may be farthered or hindered in their way, but the care is <hi>committed</hi> unto him; as the care of the whole Army lyes on the <hi>General,</hi> or Prince of the host. This the Prophet sets out in his <hi>type Eliakim, Isa.</hi> 22.21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>He is fastned as a nayl in a sure place; and all the glory of the house, and every vessel of it from the greatest unto the least is hanged on him,</hi> the weight of all, the care of all is upon him, committed unto him. When the People came out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> with <hi>Moses</hi> they were numbered unto him, and he being the Administrator of the Law, <hi>they dyed</hi> all in the Wilderness: but they were delivered again by tale and number unto <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah</hi> the <hi>type</hi> of Christ; and none of them, not one failed of entring into <hi>Canaan.</hi> And he dischargeth this trust as a faithful Captain.</p>
                        <p>First, With <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Watchfulness, Psal.</hi> 121.4. <hi>Behold he that keepeth</hi> Israel, <hi>shall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther slumber nor sleep.</hi> There is no time nor season wherein the Sons committed unto his Care, may be surprized through any neglect or regardlesness in him. His <hi>eyes</hi> are alwayes <hi>open</hi> upon them. They are never out of his heart, nor thoughts; they are <hi>engraven on the palms of his hand, and their walls are continually before him</hi>; or as he expresseth it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.3. <hi>I the Lord do keep my Vineyard, I will water it every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</hi> Greater <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Watchfulness</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expressed; <hi>night</hi> and <hi>day,</hi> and <hi>every moment</hi> in them, he is intent about this work. Oh how great an encouragement is this to adhere unto him, to follow him in the whole Course of Obedience that he calls unto. This puts <hi>life</hi> into <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and gives them <hi>security,</hi> when they know that their <hi>Commander</hi> is continually careful for them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, He dischargeth this great trust with <hi>Tenderness and Love, Isa.</hi> 40.11. <hi>He shall feed his flock like a Shepheard, he shall gather the Lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosome, and shall gently lead those that are with young.</hi> These <hi>Sons</hi> are of various sorts and degrees; the best and strongest of them are but <hi>sheep</hi>; poor infirm and helpless creatures; and amongst them some are <hi>young</hi> and tender, as <hi>Lambs</hi>; some <hi>heavy</hi> and burdened with sins and afflictions, like those that are with young. In ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>compassion</hi> he condescends unto all their conditions; <hi>feeds</hi> and preserves the whole flock as a <hi>shepheard</hi>; gathers in his arm, and bears in his bosome, those that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by their infirmity would be cast behind, and left unto danger. <hi>Compassion</hi> he hath for them that <hi>err</hi> and are out of the way; seeks for them that <hi>wander,</hi> heals the diseased, <hi>feeds</hi> them when they are even a <hi>flock of slaughter.</hi> And where these two concur, <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Compassion,</hi> there can be no want of any thing; <hi>Psal.</hi> 23.1. Indeed <hi>Sion</hi> is ready sometimes to complain that <hi>she is forgotten.</hi> The Sons in great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, Afflictions, Persecutions, Temptations that may befall them in their <hi>way to glory,</hi> are apt to think they are <hi>forgotten</hi> and disregarded, that they are left as it were to shift for themselves, and to wrestle with their difficulties by their own strength and Wisdom, which they know to be as a thing of nought. But this fear is <hi>vain</hi> and ungrateful. Whilst they are <hi>found in the way,</hi> following the Captain of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it is utterly impossible that this Watchfulness, Care, Love and tenderness should in any thing be wanting unto them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, He leads them with Power, Authority and Majesty, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.4. <hi>He shall stand and rule in the strength of the Lord, in the Majesty of the name of the Lord his God, and they shall abide.</hi> The <hi>name of God</hi> is in him, accompanied with his Power and Majesty, which he puts forth in the <hi>feeding</hi> and ruling of his people, whereon their safety doth depend. <hi>They shall abide,</hi> or dwell in safety, because in this his Glory and Majesty, <hi>he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50110:289"/>
shall be great,</hi> or be magnified <hi>unto the ends of the earth.</hi> So also is he described in his rule, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Even he shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his Throne, and shall be a Priest upon his Throne</hi>; Having built the Temple, raised an House and <hi>Family</hi> to God, he shall be the Ruler of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it, to preserve it unto Glory; and this in a <hi>glorious manner</hi>; bearing the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, <hi>sitting upon a Throne,</hi> in the whole discharge of his Office both as a King and Priest. Unto this end is he entrusted with all the Power and Authority which we have before described, God having <hi>given him to be head over all things unto his Church.</hi> There is nothing so high, so great, so mighty, that lyes in the way of his <hi>sons to glory,</hi> but it must stoop to his Authority, and give place to his Power. The whole <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom</hi> of Satan, the <hi>strong-holds</hi> of sin, the <hi>high imaginations</hi> of unbelief; the strength and malice of the world, all sink before him. And thence are they described so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and successful in their way, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.13. <hi>The breaker is come up before them, they have broken up and have passed through the Gate, and are gone out by it, and their King, shall pass before them, and the Lord on the head of them.</hi> Many obstacles lye in their way, but they shall <hi>break through them all,</hi> because of their <hi>King and Lord</hi> that goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. And those Difficulties which in this world they meet withal, that seem to be too hard for them, their Persecutions and Sufferings, though they may put a stop unto somewhat of their outward Profession, yet they shall not in the least hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in their progress unto glory. Their <hi>Captain</hi> goes before them with Power and Authority, and <hi>breaks up all</hi> the hedges and gates that lye in their way, and gives them a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>abundant</hi> entrance into the Kingdom of God.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, As the <hi>manner</hi> how, so the <hi>Acts</hi> wherein and whereby this <hi>Antecessor</hi> and Captain of salvation leads on the Sons of God, may be considered; and he doth it variously.</p>
                        <p>First, He <hi>goes before them</hi> in the whole way unto the end. This is a principal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a <hi>Captain</hi> or Leader to go before his Souldiers. Hence they that went unto the War, were said to go <hi>at the feet of their Commanders, Iudg.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Barak went up and ten thousand men at his feet,</hi> that is, followed him, and went where he went before them. And this also became the <hi>Captain of the Lords Host</hi>; even to <hi>go before</hi> his People in their whole way, not putting them on any thing, not calling them to any thing, which himself passeth not before them in. And there are three things whereunto their whole course may be referred.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) Their <hi>Obedience</hi>: (2.) Their <hi>Sufferings</hi>; (3.) Their <hi>Entrance</hi> into <hi>Glory</hi>; and in all these hath the Lord Christ gone before them, and that as their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Leader, inviting them to engage into them, and couragiously to pass thorough them, upon his Example, and the success that he sets before them.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) As unto <hi>Obedience</hi>; he himself was <hi>made under the Law; and learned obedience fulfilling all righteousness.</hi> Though he was in his own Person above the Law, yet he <hi>submitted</hi> himself to every Law of God, and righteous Law of men; that he might give an Example unto them who were of <hi>necessity</hi> to be subject unto them. So he tells his Disciples, as to one instance of his <hi>humility, I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done, John</hi> 3.15. As he calls on <hi>all to learn of him, for he was meek and lowly of heart, Matth.</hi> 11.29. That is, learn to be like him in those heavenly Graces. This the Apostles proposed as their pattern and ours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of me, as I am of Christ.</hi> That is, labour with me to imitate Christ. And the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Perfection which we are bound to aim at in Holiness and Obedience, is nothing but <hi>conformity</hi> unto Jesus Christ, and the <hi>Pattern</hi> that he hath set before us; to mark his footsteps and to follow him. This is our <hi>putting on of Jesus Christ,</hi> and growing up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same <hi>Image</hi> and likeness with him.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) He <hi>goes before</hi> the Sons of God in <hi>sufferings,</hi> and therein is also a Leader un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by his Example. Christ, saith <hi>Peter, hath suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow his steps</hi>; that is, be ready and prepared unto <hi>patience in sufferings</hi> when we are called thereunto; as he explains himself, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Forasmuch as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm your selves therefore with the same mind,</hi> that you may follow him in the same way. And this our Apostle presseth much in this Epistle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.2, 3. <hi>Look unto Jesus the Author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, despising the shame; for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.</hi> The <hi>Sons</hi> of God are sometimes ready to think it strange, that they should fall into ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity

and distresses; and are apt to say with <hi>Hezekiah, Remember O Lord we beseech thee how we have walked before thee in truth, and with an upright heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight,</hi> and weep sore; supposing that this might have freed them from oppositions and Persecutions. And as it was with <hi>Gideon</hi> when the Angel told him, <hi>the Lord was with him.</hi> He replies, <hi>Whence is all this evil come upon us?</hi> For when they find it is otherwise, and begin to apply themselves unto their <hi>condition,</hi> yet if their troubles continue, if they are not in their season removed, they are ready to be <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>faint</hi> in their minds. But, saith the Apostle, <hi>consider the Captain of your salvation,</hi> he hath set you another manner of Example; notwithstanding all his sufferings, he <hi>fainted not.</hi> The like Argument he presseth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.12, 13. And the Scripture in many places represents unto us the same consideration. The <hi>Jews</hi> have a saying, that a <hi>third part of the afflictions and troubles that shall be in the world, do belong unto the Messiah.</hi> But our Apostle who knew better than they, makes all the afflictions of the Church, to be the afflictions of Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. who both before underwent them in his own person, and lead the <hi>way</hi> to all that shall follow him. And as the <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of Christ which is our <hi>pattern,</hi> doth incomparably exceed what ever we can attain unto; so the <hi>sufferings</hi> of Christ which are our <hi>Example,</hi> did incomparably exceed all that we shall be called unto. Our pattern is excellent, inimitable in the substance and <hi>parts</hi> of it; unattainable and unexpressible in its <hi>degrees,</hi> and he is the best <hi>Proficient</hi> who attends most thereunto.</p>
                        <p>But what is the End of all this Obedience and suffering; death lyes at the door, as the <hi>Ocean</hi> whereunto all these streams do run, and seems to <hi>swallow</hi> them up, that there they are lost for ever. No, for (3.) This <hi>Captain of our salvation</hi> is <hi>gone before us</hi> in passing through <hi>death,</hi> and entring into glory. He hath shewed us in his own Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, (that great pledge of our immortality) that death is not the end of our course, but a passage into another more abiding condition. He promiseth, that <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever believeth on him,</hi> that they shall not be lost, or <hi>perish,</hi> or consumed by death, but that he will <hi>raise them up at the last day, John</hi> 6.39.40. But how shall this be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> unto them? Death looks ghastly and dreadful, as a <hi>Lyon</hi> that devours all that come within his reach: why, saith Christ, <hi>behold me,</hi> entring into his jaws, passing through his power, rising from under his dominion; and <hi>fear not,</hi> so shall it be with you also. This our Apostle disputes at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. He is <hi>gone before us</hi> through death, and is <hi>become the first fruit of them that sleep.</hi> And had Christ passed into Heaven before he dyed, as did <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> we had wanted the greatest Evidence of our future immortality. What then remains, for the finishing of our course? why, the Captain of our salvation after he had suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>entred into Glory</hi>; and that as our Leader, or fore-runner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Jesus as our fore-runner is entered into Heaven</hi>; He is gone before us, to evidence unto us, what is the End of our Obedience and Sufferings. In all this is he a Captain and <hi>Leader</hi> unto the Sons of God.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, He <hi>guides them and directs them in their way.</hi> This also belongs unto him as their <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Guide.</hi> Two things in this, are they of themselves defective in: (1.) <hi>They know not the way</hi> that leads to happiness and glory; and (2.) They want ability to <hi>discern it aright</hi> when it is shewed unto them; and in both they are relieved and assisted by their Leader; in the first by his <hi>Word</hi>; in the latter by his <hi>Spirit.</hi> First, Of themselves <hi>they know not the way</hi>; as <hi>Thomas</hi> said, <hi>how can we know the way</hi>; The Will of God, the Mysterie of his Love and Grace, as to the way whereby he will <hi>bring sinners unto Glory,</hi> is unknown to the Sons of men by nature; It was a secret <hi>hid in God,</hi> a sealed Book which none in Heaven or Earth could open; But this <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath fully declared in his <hi>Word,</hi> unto all the Sons that are to be brought unto glory; He hath <hi>revealed the Father from his own bosome, John</hi> 1.18. and declared those heavenly things, <hi>which no man knew, but he that came down from Heaven, and yet at the same time was in Heaven, John</hi> 3.12, 13. In his Word hath he declared the Name and revealed the whole counsel of God; and <hi>brought life and immortality to light,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. What ever is any way needful, useful, helpful in their Obedience, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, Suffering, Expectation of Glory, he hath taught it them all, revealed it all unto them; Other Teachers they need not. Had there been any thing belonging unto their way which he had not revealed unto them, he had not been a perfect <hi>Captain</hi> of salvation unto them. And men do nothing but presumptuously derogate from his Glory, who will be <hi>adding</hi> and imposing their prescriptions in and about this way.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="235" facs="tcp:50110:290"/>Again, The <hi>Way</hi> being revealed in the Word, he enables them by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> to <hi>see,</hi> discern and know it in such an holy and saving manner, as is needful to bring them unto the End of it. He gives them <hi>eyes to see,</hi> as well as provides <hi>paths</hi> for them to walk in. It had been to no purpose to have <hi>declared the way,</hi> if he had not also given them <hi>light to see it.</hi> This blessed work of his Spirit, is every where declared in the Scripture, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.16. And by this means is he unto us, what he was unto the <hi>Church in the Wilderness,</hi> when he went before them in a <hi>Pillar of fire,</hi> to guide them in their way, and to shew them where they should rest. And herein lyes no small part of the discharge of his Office towards us, as the <hi>Captain of our salvation.</hi> What ever acquaintance we have with the <hi>Way</hi> to Glory, we have it from him alone; and what ever Ability we have to <hi>discern the way,</hi> he is the fountain and Author of it. This God hath designed and called him unto. And all our Wisdom consists in this, that we betake our selves unto him, to him alone for instruction and direction in this matter, <hi>Mark</hi> 17.5. Doth not he deservedly wander, yea, and perish; who in <hi>war</hi> will neglect the orders and directions of his <hi>General,</hi> and attend unto every idle tale of men pretending to shew him a way that they have found out, better than that which his <hi>Captain</hi> hath limited him unto?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, He supplyes them with <hi>strength</hi> by his Grace, that they may be able to <hi>pass on in their way.</hi> They have much work lyes before them; much to do, much to suffer, and without him they can do <hi>nothing, John</hi> 15.5. Wherefore he <hi>watcheth</hi> over them to <hi>succour them that are tempted, Heb.</hi> 2 18. and to give out <hi>help unto them all in time of need, Chap.</hi> 4.16. and hence they who have no might, no sufficiency, can <hi>do all things through Christ that strengtheneth them, Phil.</hi> 4.13. Nothing is too hard for them, nothing can prevail against them, because of the constant sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes of Grace, which the <hi>Captain of their salvation</hi> communicates unto the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. And this makes the Wayes of the Gospel <hi>marvellous,</hi> both to the World and to Believers themselves; <hi>Their Life is hid with God in Christ, Col.</hi> 3. <hi>And they have a new name that no man knoweth, Rev.</hi> 2. The World seeing poor, mean, weak contemptible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, willing, ready and able <hi>to suffer,</hi> endure, and dye for the name of Christ, stand astonished, not knowing where their great strength lyes; as the <hi>Philistins</hi> did at the might of <hi>Sampson,</hi> whom they saw with their eyes to be like other men. Let them in the height of their Pride and Rage of their madness pretend what they please, they cannot but be, they really are <hi>amazed</hi> to see poor Creatures whom otherwise they exceedingly despise, <hi>constant</hi> unto the Truth and Profession of the Gospel, against all their Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Affrightments. They know not, they consider not the constant <hi>supplyes of the Strength and Grace</hi> which they receive from their Leader. He gives them the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth which the world neither sees nor knows, John</hi> 14.17. And therefore won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from whence they have their Ability and Constancy. They cry, What will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing turn these poor foolish creatures out of their way? They by them one way, and then another; add one weight of Affliction and Oppression unto another, and think surely this will effect their design; but they find themselves deceived, and know not whence it is. The Wayes of O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>edience are hence also <hi>marvellous unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers themselves.</hi> When they consider their own frailty and weakness, how ready they are to <hi>faint,</hi> how often they are surprized, and withal take a prospect of what Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position lyes against them, from <hi>indwelling sin, Satan</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> which they are acquainted with in several instances of their Power and Prevalency, they neither know <hi>how</hi> they have abode so long in their course as they have done, nor how they shall continue it unto the end. But they are relieved when they come to the Promise of the Gospel. There they see whence their Preservation doth proceed. They see this <hi>Captain of their Salvation</hi> in whom is the fulness of the Spirit, and to whom are committed all the stores of Grace, <hi>giving out daily and hourly</hi> unto them as the matter doth require. As the <hi>Captain in an Army</hi> doth not at once give out unto his Souldiers the whole provision that is needful for their way and undertaking; which if he should, the most of them would instantly waste it, and so quickly perish for want; but he keeps provision for them all in his stores, and gives out unto them according to their daily necessities; So God gave the people <hi>Manna</hi> for their daily food in the Wilderness: even so deals this great Leader with the Sons of God. He keeps the <hi>stores</hi> of Grace and spiritual strength in his own hand; and from thence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts unto them according as they stand in need.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, He <hi>subdues their enemies.</hi> And this belongs unto his Office as the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their salvation</hi> in an especial manner. Many Enemies they have, and unless they
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50110:291"/>
are conquered and subdued, they can never enter into Glory. Satan, the World, Death and Sin, are the chief or heads of them, and all these are <hi>subdued</hi> by Christ; and that two wayes. First, In his own Person. For they all attempted him, and failed in their enterprize, <hi>John</hi> 14.30. He <hi>bruised the Serpents head, Gen.</hi> 3.15. and destroyed <hi>him that had the power of death, that is the Devil, v.</hi> 14. of this Chapter; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed his Power in a glorious and triumphant manner, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>He spoyled prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, and made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in his Cross,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the utmost complement unto his Victory in a <hi>Triumph.</hi> And he <hi>overcome the world, John</hi> 16.33. Be <hi>of good chear,</hi> saith he, <hi>I have overcome the world.</hi> Both it, and the Prince of it were put under his feet. <hi>Death</hi> also was subdued by him: <hi>He swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it up in victory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. He plucked out its sting, broke its Power, disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled its peremptory Law, when he shook it off from him, and rose from under it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. Sin also set upon him in his Temptations, but was utterly foiled; as all sin is <hi>destroyed</hi> in its very being, where it is not obeyed. And all this was for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Sons of God.</p>
                        <p>For (1.) He hath given them encouragement in shewing them that their <hi>Enemies are not invincible</hi>; their Power is not uncontrollable, their Law not peremptory or eternal; but that having been <hi>once conquered,</hi> they may the more easily be dealt withal.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) They know also, that all these <hi>Enemies</hi> set upon his Person in their <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi> and as he was the great <hi>Defender of the faithful:</hi> So that although they were not conquered by their <hi>Persons,</hi> yet they were conquered in their Cause; and they are called in to be sharers in the Victory, although they were not engaged in the Battle.</p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) That he subdued them by Gods Ordinance and Appointment, as their <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative</hi>; declaring in his Person who is the Head, what should be accomplished in every one of his members.</p>
                        <p>And (4.) That by his <hi>Personal Conquest</hi> over them, He hath left them weak, maimed, disarmed and utterly deprived of that power they had to hurt and destroy, before he engaged with them. For he hath thereby deprived them; (1.) Of all their Right and Title to exercise their Enmity against; or Dominion over the Sons of God. Before his dealing with them, they had all Right to the utmost over mankind. <hi>Satan</hi> to rule, the <hi>World</hi> to vex, <hi>Sin</hi> to enslave, <hi>Death</hi> to destroy and give up unto Hell. And all this Right was enrolled in the Law, and <hi>hand-writing of Ordinances which was against us.</hi> This was cancelled by Christ, <hi>nailed to the Cross, never to be pleaded more, Col.</hi> 2.14. And when any have lost their Right or Title unto any thing, what ever their strength be, they are greatly weakned. But he hath herein (2.) Deprived them of their <hi>strength</hi> also. He took away the <hi>strength</hi> of sin as a Law, and the <hi>sting</hi> of death in sin, the <hi>arms</hi> of the world in the curse, and the <hi>power</hi> of Satan in his works and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds.</p>
                        <p>But this is not all; He not only subdues these Enemies <hi>for them,</hi> but also <hi>in them</hi> and by them; For though they have neit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>r <hi>Title</hi> nor <hi>Arms,</hi> yet they will try the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their Power against them also. <hi>But thanks be to God,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>who giveth us the victory by Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57. He enables us in <hi>our own Persons</hi> to conquer all these enemies. Nay, saith he, <hi>in all these things we are more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, Rom.</hi> 8.37. Because we hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> more <hi>Assurance</hi> of success, more <hi>Assistance</hi> in the conflict, more <hi>Joy</hi> in the tryal, than any other Conquerors have; Or we do not <hi>only conquer,</hi> but triumph also. For <hi>Satan,</hi> he tells Believers, that <hi>they have, overcome the wicked one,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 12.13, 14. And shews how it came to pass that they should be able to do so, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>It is, because greater is he that is in them, than he that is in the world.</hi> The Good Spirit which he hath given unto them to help and assist them, is <hi>infinitely greater</hi> and more powerful than that <hi>evil Spirit</hi> which rules in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of disobedience: And by this means is Satan <hi>bruised even under their feet.</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict indeed we must have with them; we must wrestle <hi>with principalities and powers in heavenly places,</hi> but the <hi>success</hi> is secured through the Assistance we receive from this <hi>Captain of our salvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>World</hi> also is subdued in them and by them, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>Whosoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith.</hi> Faith will do this work; it never failed in it, nor ever will. He that believeth shall overcome; the whole strength of Christ is engaged unto his Assistance. <hi>Sin</hi> is the worst and most obstinate of all their Enemies. This puts them hard to it in the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50110:291"/>
Battle, and makes them <hi>cry out</hi> for aid and help, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. But this also they receive strength against, so as to carry away the day. <hi>I thank God,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>through Jesus Christ our Lord, v.</hi> 15. namely, for deliverance and victory. Sin hath a double design in its Enmity against us. (1.) To <hi>reign</hi> in us: (2.) To <hi>condemn</hi> us. If it be disappointed in these designs, it is absolutely conquered, and that it is by the Grace of Christ. As to its Reign and Dominion it is perfectly defeated for the present, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. The means of its Rule, is the Authority of the Law over us; that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and our souls put under the Conduct of Grace, the <hi>Reign of sin</hi> comes to an end. Nor shall it <hi>condemn us, Rom.</hi> 8.1. And what can it then do? Where is the voice of this Oppressor? It abides but a season; and that but to endure and dye. <hi>Death</hi> also contends against us, by its own sting, and our fear; but the <hi>first</hi> by the Grace of Christ is taken from it, and the <hi>latter</hi> we are delivered from, and so have the <hi>Victory</hi> over it. And all this is the work of this <hi>Captain of our salvation</hi> for us, and in us.</p>
                        <p n="5">(5.) He doth not only conquer all their Enemies, but he <hi>avenges their sufferings upon them,</hi> and punisheth them for their Enmity. These enemies though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not absolutely, nor finally against the Sons of God, yet by their <hi>Temptations,</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, Oppressions, they put them oft times to unspeakable hardships, sorrow and trouble. This the <hi>Captain of their salvation</hi> will not take at their hands; but will <hi>avenge</hi> upon them all their ungodly endeavours from the lowest unto the greatest and highest of them. Some he will deal withal <hi>in this world</hi>; but he hath <hi>appointed a day</hi> wherein not one of them shall escape. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10, 14. <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>Beast,</hi> and <hi>false Prophet,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> shall altogether into the <hi>lake of fire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">(6.) He <hi>provides a Reward, a Crown for them,</hi> and in the bestowing thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisheth this his blessed Office of the <hi>Captain of our salvation.</hi> He is gone before the Sons into Heaven, to make ready their Glory, to prepare a place for them, and he <hi>will come and receive them unto himself, that where he is, there they may be also, John</hi> 14.2, 3. When he hath given them the <hi>Victory,</hi> he will take them unto himself, even unto his <hi>Throne, Rev.</hi> 3.22. And as a Righteous Judge give <hi>unto them a crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus is the whole work of <hi>conducting the Sons of God unto Glory,</hi> from first to last, committed unto this great <hi>Captain of their salvation,</hi> and thus doth he discharge his Office and trust therein; and <hi>blessed are all they who are under his leading and guidance.</hi> And all this should teach us;</p>
                        <p>First, To <hi>betake</hi> our selves unto him, and to <hi>relye</hi> upon him in the whole course of our Obedience, and all the passages thereof. To this purpose is he designed by the Father, this hath he undertaken; and this doth he go through withal. No <hi>address</hi> that is made unto him in this matter, will he ever refuse to attend unto; no Case or Condition that is proposed unto him, is too hard for him, or beyond his Power to relieve: He is <hi>careful,</hi> watchful, tender, faithful, powerful, and all these Properties and blessed Endowments will he exercise in the discharge of this Office. What should hinder us from betaking our selves unto him continually? Is our Trouble so <hi>small,</hi> are our Duties so <hi>ordinary,</hi> that we can wrestle with them, or perform them in our own strength? Alas, we <hi>can do nothing,</hi> not <hi>think a good thought,</hi> not endure a reproachful word. And what ever we seem to <hi>do</hi> or <hi>endure</hi> of our selves, it is all lost; <hi>for in us there dwelleth no good thing</hi>: Or are our Distresses so <hi>great,</hi> our Temptations so <hi>many,</hi> our corruptions so <hi>strong,</hi> that we begin to say there is no hope? Is any thing <hi>too hard for the Captain of our salvation?</hi> Hath he not already conquered all our enemies? Is he not able to <hi>subdue</hi> all things by his Power? Shall we faint whilest <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> lives and reigns? But it may be, we have looked for Help and Assistance, and it hath not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered our Expectation, so that now we begin to <hi>faint</hi> and despond. <hi>Sin</hi> is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, the <hi>World</hi> is still triumphant, and <hi>Satan</hi> rageth as much as ever; his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ready to pass over our souls; But have we sought for his Help and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in a <hi>due manner</hi> with faith and perseverance, unto right Ends of his Glory, and Advantage of the Gospel? Have we taken a <hi>right measure</hi> of what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Or do we not complain without a cause? Let us not judge according to <hi>outward appearance,</hi> but judge righteous judgement. What is it to us, if the <hi>World tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,</hi> if <hi>Satan rage,</hi> if <hi>Sin tempt</hi> and vex, we are not <hi>promised</hi> that it shall be otherwise. But are we forsaken? Are we not kept from being prevailed against? If we <hi>ask amiss,</hi> or for improper Ends, or know not what we do receive, or think because the strength of Enemies appears to be great, we must fail and be ruined; Let us not complain of <hi>our Captain</hi>; for all these things arise from our own Unbelief. Let our <hi>Application</hi>
                           <pb n="238" facs="tcp:50110:292"/>
unto him be according unto his Command, our <hi>Expectations</hi> from him according to the Promise; our <hi>Experiences</hi> of what we receive be measured by the Rule of the Word, and we shall find, that we have all grounds of Assurance, that we can desire. Let us then in every condition <hi>look unto Jesus the Author and finisher of our faith,</hi> who hath undertaken the leading of us in the whole course of our Obedience from first to last, and we shall not need to faint, nor shall we ever fail.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>To look for Direction and Guidance from him.</hi> This in an especial manner belongs unto him as the Captain of our salvation. There are <hi>two things</hi> which we find by Experience, that Professors are apt to be at a great loss in, whilest they are in this World. The <hi>Worship of God,</hi> and their <hi>own Troubles.</hi> For the <hi>first,</hi> We see and find that woful <hi>Variance</hi> that is among all sorts of men; and for the <hi>latter,</hi> we are apt our selves to be much <hi>bewildred</hi> in them, as unto our Duty and our Way. Now all this Uncertainty ariseth from the want of a <hi>due attendance</hi> unto Jesus Christ as our Guide. In reference unto both these, he hath peculiarly promised his Presence with us. With the <hi>Dispensers of the Word</hi> he hath promised to be unto the <hi>ends of the world,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of all things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.29. And we find <hi>him walking in the midst of his Golden Candlesticks; Rev.</hi> 1. In that <hi>allegorical</hi> description of the Gospel Church-State and Worship, which we have in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> there is a <hi>peculiar place assigned unto the Prince.</hi> Now one end of his Presence is, to see that all things are done according unto his Mind and Will. And unto whom should we go but unto himself alone. His <hi>Word</hi> here will prove the best <hi>Directory,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> the best <hi>Guide.</hi> If we neglect these, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto the Wisdom of Men, we shall wander in <hi>uncertainties</hi> all our dayes. It is so also in respect of <hi>our Troubles</hi>; we are ready in them to <hi>consult with flesh and blood</hi>; to look after the Examples of others, to take the <hi>advice</hi> that comes next to hand. When the Lord Christ hath promised his Presence with us in them all; and that as the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our salvation.</hi> And if we neglect <hi>Him,</hi> his <hi>Example,</hi> his Direction, his Teaching, it is no wonder if we <hi>pine away</hi> under our distresses.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. We may observe, <hi>That the Lord Jesus Christ being Priest, Sacrifice and Altar himself, the Offering whereby he was consecrated unto the perfection and complement of his Office, was of necessity to be part of that work, which as our Priest and Mediator he was to undergo and perform.</hi> When other <hi>Typical Priests</hi> were to be <hi>consecrated,</hi> there was an <hi>Offering of Beasts</hi> appointed for that purpose, and an <hi>Altar</hi> to offer on, and a <hi>Person</hi> to consecrate them. But all this was to be done in and by Jesus Christ himself. Even the Father is said to <hi>consecrate him,</hi> but upon the account of his <hi>designing</hi> him and <hi>appointing</hi> him unto this Office; but his immediate <hi>actual consecration</hi> was his own work, which he performed when he <hi>offered himself through the Eternal Spirit.</hi> By his death and suffering, which he underwent in the discharge of his Office, and as a <hi>Priest</hi> therein offered himself unto God, he was <hi>dedicated</hi> and consecrated unto the Perfection of his Office. This would require our further Explication in this place, but that it will again occur unto us more directly.</p>
                        <p n="iii">III. <hi>The Lord Christ being consecrated and perfected through sufferings, hath consecrated the way of suffering, for all that follow him to pass through unto Glory.</hi> All <hi>complaints</hi> of sufferings, all <hi>Despondencies</hi> under them, all <hi>Fears</hi> of them are rendered unjust and unequal by the sufferings of Christ. It is surely righteous that they should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his <hi>Lot</hi> here, who desire to be received into his <hi>Glory hereafter.</hi> Now there are sundry things that follow upon this <hi>Consecration of the way of suffering</hi> by Jesus Christ. As,</p>
                        <p>First, That they are made <hi>necessary, and unavoidable</hi>: Men may hope and desire <hi>other things,</hi> and turn themselves several wayes in their contrivances to avoid them, but <hi>one way or other,</hi> sufferings will be the Portion of them that intend to follow <hi>this Captain of Salvation.</hi> The Apostle tells Believers, that they are <hi>predestinated to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Image of the Son of God, Rom.</hi> 8.29. And lets them know in the close of that Chapter, that no small part of this <hi>Conformity</hi> consists in their Afflictions and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi> The <hi>Head</hi> having passed through them, there is a measure of Afflictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto the Body, which every <hi>member</hi> is to bear his share of, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.24. And the Lord Jesus himself hath given this Law unto us, <hi>That every one who will be his Disciple must take up his Cross, and follow him. Discipleship</hi> and the <hi>Cross</hi> are inseparably knit together, by the unchangeable Law and Constitution of Christ himself. And the Gospel is full of Warnings and Instructions unto this purpose; that none may
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50110:292"/>
                           <hi>complain</hi> that they were surprized, or that any thing did befall them in the course of their profession which they looked not for. Men may deceive themselves with vain hopes and expectations, but the <hi>Gospel deceiveth none</hi>; it tells them plainly before-hand, <hi>That through many tribulations they must enter into the Kingdom of God; and that they who will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</hi> If they <hi>like</hi> not of these terms, they may let the way of Christ alone; if they will not do so, why do they yet <hi>complain?</hi> Christ will be taken with his <hi>Cross,</hi> or not at all. And the folly of our hearts can never be enough bewailed, in <hi>thinking strange of trials and afflictions</hi>; when the very first thing that the Lord Christ requireth of them that will be made partakers of him, is, that <hi>they deny themselves, and take up their cross.</hi> But we would be <hi>children,</hi> and not be <hi>chastised</hi>; we would be <hi>gold,</hi> and not be <hi>tried</hi>; we would <hi>overcome,</hi> and yet not be put to fight and contend; we would be <hi>Christians,</hi> and not <hi>suffer</hi>: But all these things are contrary to the Eternal Law of our Profession. And so necessary is this way made, that though God deal with his people in great <hi>variety,</hi> exercising some with such trials and troubles, that other sometimes in comparison of them seem <hi>utterly to go free,</hi> yet every one, one way or other, shall have his <hi>share</hi> and measure. And those excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are made in the Providence of God, as to some individual persons at some seasons, derogate nothing from the <hi>general necessity</hi> of the way towards all that do believe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>It hath made all sufferings for the Gospel honourable.</hi> The sufferings of Christ himself were indeed <hi>shameful,</hi> and that not only in the <hi>esteem</hi> of men, but also in the <hi>nature</hi> of them, and by Gods constitution. They were <hi>part of the curse, As it is written, Cursed is he that hangs upon a tree.</hi> And <hi>as such</hi> our Lord Jesus Christ looked on them, when he wrestled with and conquered the <hi>shame</hi> as well as the <hi>sharpness.</hi> But he hath rendred all the sufferings of his that remain very <hi>honourable</hi> in themselves, what ever they are in the reputation of a blind perishing world. That which is truly <hi>shameful</hi> in suffering, is an effect of the curse for sin. This Christ by his <hi>suffering</hi> hath utterly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the sufferings of his Disciples. Hence the Apostles <hi>rejoyced th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>t they had the honour to suffer shame for his Name, Acts</hi> 5.41. that is, the things which the world looked on as <hi>shameful,</hi> but themselves knew to be <hi>honourable.</hi> They are so in the sight of God, of the Lord Jesus Christ, of all the holy Angels, which are <hi>competent judges</hi> in this case. God hath a great cause in the world, and that such a one as wherein his Name, his Goodness, his Love, his Glory is concerned; this in his infinite Wisdom is to be witnessed, confirmed, testified unto by sufferings. Now can there be any greater Honour done unto any of the sons of men, than that God should single them out from among the rest of mankind, and appoint them unto this work? Men are <hi>honoured</hi> according to their riches and treasures. And when <hi>Moses</hi> came to make a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning this thing, he esteemed the <hi>reproach of Christ greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt, Heb.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.29. We believe that God gave <hi>great honour</hi> unto the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> of old in all their sufferings. Let us labour for the same spirit of faith in reference unto our selves, and it will relieve us under all our trials. This then also hath Christ <hi>added unto the way of sufferings</hi> by his <hi>consecration of it</hi> for us. All the glory and honour of the world is not to be compared with theirs, unto whom it is <hi>given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>He hath thereby made them us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ful and profitable.</hi> Troubles and afflictions in themselves and their own nature have no good in them, nor do they tend unto any good end: they grow out of the <hi>first sentence</hi> against sin, and are in their own nature <hi>poenal</hi> tending unto death, and nothing else. Nor are they in those who have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ, any thing but <hi>effects</hi> of the wrath of God. But the Lord Christ by his <hi>consecrating</hi> of them, to be the way of our following him, hath quite altered their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and tendency; he hath made them <hi>good,</hi> useful and profitable. I shall not here shew the usefulness of <hi>Afflictions</hi> and sufferings, the whole Scripture abundantly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth unto it, and the experience of Believers in all ages and seasons confirms it. I only shew <hi>whence it is</hi> that they become so, and that is, because the Lord Christ hath <hi>consecrated, dedicated</hi> and sanctified them unto that end. He hath thereby cut them off from their old stock of wrath and the curse, and planted them on that of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Good-will.</hi> He hath taken them off from the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> and translated them into that of Grace. He hath turned their course from <hi>death,</hi> towards <hi>life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi>; mixing his Grace Love and Wisdom with these <hi>bitter waters,</hi> he hath made them <hi>sweet</hi> and wholesome. And if we would have benefit by them, we must always have regard unto this <hi>consecration</hi> of them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="240" facs="tcp:50110:293"/>Fourthly, He hath made them <hi>safe.</hi> They are in their own nature a <hi>Wilderness,</hi> wherein men may endlesly wander and quickly lose themselves. But he hath made them a <hi>way,</hi> a <hi>safe way; That way-faring men, though fools, may not erre therein.</hi> Never did a Believer perish by <hi>afflictions</hi> or <hi>persecutions</hi>: never was good Gold or Silver consumed or lost in this Furnace. <hi>Hypocrites</hi> indeed and false Professors, <hi>fearful</hi> and <hi>unbelievers</hi> are discovered by them, and discarded from their hopes. But they that are <hi>Disciples indeed,</hi> are never <hi>safer</hi> than in this way, and that because it is <hi>consecrated</hi> for them. Sometimes it may be through their <hi>unbelief,</hi> and want of heeding the <hi>Captain of their salvation,</hi> they are wounded and cast down by them for a season, but they are <hi>still in the way,</hi> they are never turned <hi>quite out of the way.</hi> And this through the grace of Christ doth turn also unto their advantage. Nay it is not only <hi>absolutely</hi> a safe way, but <hi>comparatively</hi> more safe than the way of Prosperity. And this the <hi>Scripture,</hi> with the experience of all Saints, bear plentiful witness unto. And many other <hi>blessed ends</hi> are wrought by the <hi>consecration of this way</hi> for the Disciples of Christ, not now to be insisted on.</p>
                        <p>There remains yet to be considered in the words of the Apostle, the <hi>Reason</hi> why the <hi>Captain of our salvation was to be consecrated by sufferings</hi>; and this he declares in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Verse, <hi>It became God so to deal with him</hi>; which he amplifies by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of him, <hi>For whom are all things, and by whom are all things.</hi> Having such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign as he had, <hi>to bring many sons unto glory,</hi> and being he, <hi>for whom are all things, and by whom are all things,</hi> it <hi>became</hi> him so to deal with the Captain of their salvation. What is the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> here intended, and what is the importance of the word, was declared before. This <hi>Becomingness,</hi> what ever it be, it ariseth from hence, <hi>That God is he for whom are all things, and by whom are all things.</hi> It became him, not only <hi>who is</hi> so, but <hi>as he is</hi> so, and <hi>because</hi> he is so. There is no reason for the addition of that <hi>consideration of God in this matter,</hi> but that the cause is in them contained and expressed, why it <hi>became him</hi> to do that which is here ascribed unto him. We are then to enquire what it is that is principally regarded in God in this <hi>Attribution,</hi> and thence we shall learn how it <hi>became</hi> him to bring the Lord Christ unto suffering. Now the description of God in these words, is plainly of him as the <hi>first Cause</hi> and <hi>last End</hi> of all things; neither is it absolutely his Power in <hi>making all of nothing,</hi> and his Sovereign Eternal Being requiring that <hi>all things tend unto his glory</hi> that are intended in the words. But he is the <hi>Governour,</hi> Ruler and Judge of all things made by him and for him, with respect unto that Order and Law of their Creation which they were to observe. This <hi>Rule</hi> and Government of all things, taking care that as they are <hi>of God,</hi> so they should be <hi>for him,</hi> is that which the Apostle respects. This then is that which he asserts, namely that it became God, <hi>as the Governour, Ruler and Judge of all,</hi> to consecrate Christ by sufferings; which must be farther explained.</p>
                        <p>Man being made an intellectual Creature, had a Rule of <hi>Moral Obedience</hi> given unto him. This was he to observe to the glory of his Creator and Law-giver, and as the condition of his coming unto him, and enjoyment of him. This is here supposed by the Apostle; and he discourseth how man having <hi>broken the Law of his Creation,</hi> and therein come short of the glory of God, might by his grace be again made partaker of it. With respect unto this state of things, God can be no otherwise considered but as the Supreme <hi>Governour and Judge</hi> of them. Now that Property of God, which he exerteth principally as the <hi>Ruler</hi> and Governour of all, is his <hi>Justice, Justitia regiminis,</hi> the Righteousness of Government. Hereof there are two branches; for it is either <hi>Remunerative</hi> or <hi>Vindictive.</hi> And this Righteousness of God, as the Supreme Ruler and Judge of all, is that, upon the account whereof it <hi>was meet</hi> for him, or <hi>became him</hi> to bring the sons to glory by the <hi>sufferings of the Captain of their salvation.</hi> It was hence <hi>just,</hi> equal, and therefore indispensibly necessary that so he should do. Supposing that man was created in the Image of God, capable of yielding Obedience unto him, according to the Law concreated with him, and written in his heart, which Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was his <hi>moral being for God,</hi> as he was <hi>from or of him</hi>; supposing that he by sin had broken this Law, and so was no longer <hi>for God,</hi> according to the primitive Order and Law of his Creation; supposing also notwithstanding all this, that God in his infinite, Grace and Love intended to bring <hi>some men</hi> unto the enjoyment of himself, by a new way, Law, and appointment, by which they should be brought to <hi>be for him again</hi>; Supposing, I say, these things which are all here <hi>supposed</hi> by our Apostle, and were granted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> it <hi>became the Justice of God,</hi> that is, it was so just, right, meet and equal, that the Judge of all the world who doth right could no otherwise do, than cause him, who was to be the Way, Cause, Means and Author of this Recovery of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50110:293"/>
men into a new condition of being <hi>for God,</hi> to suffer in their steed. For whereas the <hi>Vindictive Justice of God,</hi> which is the respect of the Universal Rectitude of his Holy Nature, unto the <hi>deviation of his rational creatures</hi> from the Law of their Creation, required that that <hi>deviation</hi> should be revenged, and themselves brought into a <hi>new way of being for God,</hi> or of glorifying him by their <hi>sufferings,</hi> when they had refused to do so by <hi>Obedience,</hi> it was necessary on the account thereof, that if they were to be delivered from that condition, that the Author of their deliverance should suffer for them. And this excellently suits the design of the Apostle, which is to prove the <hi>necessity of the suffering of the Messiah,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> so stumbled at. For if the <hi>Justice of God</hi> required that so it should be, how could it be dispensed withall? Would they have God unjust? Shall he fore-go the glory of his Righteousn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is true indeed, if God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no salvation of his sons but one that was <hi>temporal,</hi> like that granted unto the people of old under the conduct of <hi>Joshua,</hi> there had been no need at all of the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>the Captain of their salvation.</hi> But they being such, as in themselves had <hi>sinned,</hi> and come short of the glory of God, and the <hi>salvation</hi> intended them being <hi>spiritual,</hi> consisting in a new ordering of them <hi>for God,</hi> and the bringing of them unto the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal enjoyment of him in Glory, there was no way to maintain the Honour of the Justice of God, but by his sufferings. And as here lay the great mistake of the <hi>Jews,</hi> so the denial of this <hi>condecency of Gods Justice,</hi> as to the <hi>sufferings of the Messiah,</hi> is the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of the <hi>Socinians. Schlictingius</hi> on this place would have no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but that the way of bringing Christ to suffer was answerable unto that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign which God had laid to glorifie himself in the salvation of man. But the Apostle says not, that it <hi>became,</hi> or was suitable unto an arbitrary free decree of God, but it became himself as the Supreme <hi>Ruler and Judge</hi> of all; he speaks not of what was <hi>meet</hi> unto the execution of a <hi>free Decree,</hi> but what was <hi>meet</hi> on the account of Gods Holiness and Righteousness to the constitution of it, as the description of him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed doth plainly shew. And herein have we with our Apostle discovered the great indispensible and <hi>fundamental cause of the sufferings of Christ.</hi> And we may hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that,</p>
                        <p n="v">V. <hi>Such is the desert of sin, and such is the immutability of the Justice of God, that there was no way possible to bring sinners unto glory, but by the death and sufferings of the Son of God, who undertook to be the Captain of their salvation.</hi> It would have been <hi>unbecoming</hi> God, the Supreme Governour of all the world, to have passed by the desert of sin without this satisfaction. And this being a truth of great <hi>importance,</hi> and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of most of the Apostles ensuing discourses, must be a while insisted on.</p>
                        <p>In these Verses, that <hi>fore-going, this,</hi> and some of those following, the Apostle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly treats of the <hi>Causes of the sufferings and death of Christ.</hi> A matter, as of great <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi> in it self, comprizing no small part of the mystery of the Gospel, so <hi>indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly</hi> necessary to be explained and confirmed unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who had entertained many prejudices against it. In the fore-going Verse he declared the <hi>cause,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the inducing, leading, <hi>moving cause,</hi> which was the <hi>Grace of God</hi>; by the <hi>grace of God he was to taste death</hi> for men: This grace he farther explains in this <hi>Verse,</hi> shewing that it consisted in the <hi>Design of God to bring many sons to glory.</hi> All had sinned and come short of his glory. He had according to the exigence of his Justice denounced and declared <hi>Death</hi> and Judgment to be brought upon all that sinned without exception. Yet such was his infinite Love and Grace, that he determined or purposed in himself to <hi>deliver</hi> some of them, to make them <hi>sons,</hi> and to bring them unto glory. Unto this end he resolved to send or give his <hi>Son</hi> to be a <hi>Captain of salvation</hi> unto them. And this Love or Grace of God is every where set forth in the Gospel. How the <hi>sufferings</hi> of this <hi>Captain of salvation</hi> became useful unto the sons, upon the account of the manifold union that was between them, he declares in the <hi>following Verses,</hi> farther explaining the Reasons and Causes why the benefit of his sufferings should redound unto them. In this Verse he expresseth the cause <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the <hi>procuring cause of the death and sufferings of Christ,</hi> which is the Justice of God, upon <hi>supposition</hi> of sin, and his purpose to save sinners. And this upon examination we shall find to be the great cause of the death of Christ.</p>
                        <p>That the Son of God, who <hi>did no sin,</hi> in whom his <hi>soul was always well pleased</hi> on the account of his obedience, should suffer and <hi>die,</hi> and that a death under the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and curse of the Law, is a great and astonishable mystery; all the Saints of God
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50110:294"/>
                           <hi>admire</hi> at it, the Angels <hi>desire to look into it.</hi> What should be the cause and reason hereof? why God should thus bruise him, and put him to grief? This is worth our enquiry; and various are the conceptions of men about it. The <hi>Socinians</hi> deny that his sufferings were <hi>poenal,</hi> or that he died to make satisfaction for sin; but only that he did so, to confirm the Doctrine that he had taught, and to set us an example to suffer for the truth. But his <hi>Doctrine</hi> carried its own evidence with it, that it was from God, and was besides uncontrollably confirmed by the <hi>Miracles</hi> that he wrought. So that his <hi>sufferings</hi> on that account might have been dispensed withall. And surely this great and stupendous matter of the <hi>dying of the Son of God,</hi> is not to be resolved into a Reason and Cause that might so easily be dispensed with. God would never have given up his <hi>Son to die,</hi> but only for such causes and ends as could no otherwise have been satisfied or accomplished. The like also may be said of the <hi>other cause</hi> assigned by them, namely to set us an example. It is true, in his <hi>death</hi> he did so, and of great and singular <hi>use</hi> unto us it is that so he did. But yet neither was this from any <hi>precedent Law or Constitution,</hi> nor from the nature of the thing it self, nor from any property of God <hi>indispensibly necessary:</hi> God could by his grace have carried us through <hi>sufferings,</hi> although he had not set before us the example of his Son; so he doth through other things no less difficult, wherein the Lord Christ could not in his own Person go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; as in our <hi>conversion unto God,</hi> and <hi>mortification of indwelling sin,</hi> neither of which the Lord Christ was capable of. We shall leave them then, as those who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the death of Christ, do not yet acknowledge or own any <hi>sufficient cause</hi> or reason why he should die.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Christians</hi> generally allow that the <hi>sufferings</hi> of Christ were <hi>poenal,</hi> and his death sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory for the sins of men; but as to the cause and reason of his so suffering they differ. Some, following <hi>Austine,</hi> refer the death of Christ solely unto the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and Sovereignty of God. God would have it so, and therein are we to acquiesce. Other ways of saving the Elect were <hi>possible,</hi> but this God chose, because so it seemed good unto him. Hence arose that saying, That <hi>one drop of the blood of Christ was sufficient to redeem the whole world</hi>; only it pleased God that he should suffer unto the utmost. And herein are we to rest, that <hi>He hath suffered for us, and that God hath revealed.</hi> But this seems not to me any way to answer that which is here affirmed by the Apostle, namely that <hi>it became God,</hi> as the Supreme Governour of all the world, so to cause Christ to suffer; nor do I see what <hi>demonstration</hi> of the glory of Justice can arise from the punishing of an <hi>innocent Person,</hi> who might have been spared, and yet all the ends of his being so punished to have been otherwise brought about. And to say, that <hi>one drop of Christs bloud was sufficient to redeem the world,</hi> is derogatory unto the Goodness, Wisdom, and Righteousness of God, in causing not only the <hi>whole</hi> to be shed, but also his <hi>Soul to be made an offering for sin,</hi> which was altogether needless if that were true. But how far this whole Opinion is from truth, which leaves no <hi>necessary cause</hi> of the death of Christ, will afterwards appear.</p>
                        <p>Others say, that on <hi>supposition</hi> that God had appointed the <hi>Curse of the Law,</hi> and death to be the penalty of sin, his <hi>faithfulness</hi> and <hi>Veracity</hi> were engaged so far, that no sinner should <hi>go free,</hi> or be made partaker of glory but by the <hi>intervention of satisfaction.</hi> And therefore on the supposition that God would make some men his <hi>sons,</hi> and bring them to glory, it was <hi>necessary</hi> with respect unto the engagement of the truth of God, that he should suffer, die, and make satisfaction for them. But all this they refer <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally</hi> unto a free constitution, which might have been otherwise. God might have ordered things so, without any derogation unto the glory of his Justice or Holiness in the Government of all things, as that sinners <hi>might have been saved</hi> without the death of Christ. For if he had not engaged his <hi>Word,</hi> and declared that death should be the penalty of sin, he might have <hi>freely remitted</hi> it without the <hi>intervention of any satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> And thus all this whole work of death being the punishment of sin, and of the sufferings of Christ for sinners, is resolved into a free purpose and <hi>Decree</hi> of Gods Will, and not into the exigence of any essential property of his Nature; so that it might have been <hi>otherwise</hi> in all the parts of it, and yet the glory of God preserved every way entire. Whether this be so or no, we shall immediately enquire.</p>
                        <p>Others grant many <hi>free Acts</hi> of the Mind and Will of God in this matter: as, 1. The Creation of man in such a condition, as that he should have a <hi>moral dependance on God</hi> in reference unto his utmost end, was an effect of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Pleasure Will and Wisdom of God. But on supposition of this Decree and Constitution, they say, the Nature, Authority, and Holiness of God required <hi>indispensibly,</hi> that man should

yield unto him that obedience which he was directed unto, and guide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again, they say, that God did freely by an Act of his <hi>Sovereign</hi> Will and Pleasure decree to permit man to sin and fall, which might have been otherwise. But on supposition that so he should do, and would do, and thereby infringe the Order of his dependance on God, in reference unto his <hi>utmost end,</hi> that the Justice of God, as the Supreme Governour of all things, did indispensibly require, that he should receive a <hi>meet recompence of reward,</hi> or be punished answerably unto hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> crimes; so that God could not have dealt otherwise with him, without an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation from his own Righteousness. Again, they say, that God by a meer <hi>free Act</hi> of his Love and Grace designed the Lord Jesus Christ to be the way and means for the saving of sinners; which might have been otherwise. He might without the least <hi>impeachment</hi> of the glory of any of his Essential Properties have suffered <hi>all mankind</hi> to have perished under that penalty which they had justly incurred; but of his own <hi>meer Love, free Grace</hi> and good pleasure he gave and sent him to redeem them. But on the supposition thereof they say, the <hi>Justice</hi> of God required, that he should lay on him the punishment due unto the <hi>sons whom he redeemed</hi>; it became him on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Natural Essential Justice to bring him unto sufferings. And in this <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> is contained the truth laid down in our Proposition, which we shall now farther confirm; namely that it became the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> or the Essential Properties of his Nature required indispensibly, that <hi>sin should be punished with death,</hi> in the sinner or in his surety: And therefore if he would bring any sons to glory, <hi>the Captain of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> must undergo death and sufferings, to make <hi>satisfaction</hi> for them. For,</p>
                        <p>First, Consider that <hi>description</hi> which the Scripture giveth us of the <hi>Nature</hi> of God in reference unto sin; and this it doth either <hi>metaphorically,</hi> or properly; in the first way it compares God <hi>unto fire,</hi> unto a <hi>consuming fire,</hi> and his actings toward sin as the <hi>acting of fire</hi> on that which is combustible, whose nature it is to consume them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Thy God is a consuming fire</hi>; which words the Apostle repeats, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Devouring fire and everlasting burnings, Isa.</hi> 33.14. Hence when he came to give the <hi>Law,</hi> which expresseth his wrath and indignation against sin, his presence was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested by great and terrible <hi>fires and burnings,</hi> until the people cried out, <hi>Let me not see this great fire any more, lest I die, Deut.</hi> 18.16. They saw <hi>death</hi> and destruction in that <hi>fire,</hi> because it expressed the indignation of God against sin; and therefore the Law it self is also called a <hi>fiery Law, Deut.</hi> 33.2. because it contains the sense and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God against sin; as in the execution of the sentence of it, <hi>the breath of the Lord</hi> is said to <hi>kindle the fire</hi> of it like a <hi>stream of brimstone, Isa.</hi> 30.33. so <hi>chap.</hi> 66.15, 16. And by this <hi>metaphor</hi> doth the Scripture lively represent the Nature of God in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto sin. For as it is the nature of <hi>fire</hi> to consume and devoure all things that are put into it, without <hi>sparing any</hi> or making difference; so is the Nature of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto sin: where ever it is, he punisheth and revengeth it according to its demerit. The <hi>metaphor</hi> indeed expresseth not the <hi>manner</hi> of the operation of the one and the other, but the <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Event</hi> of the working of both from the Principles of the Nature of the one and the other. The <hi>fire</hi> so burneth by a <hi>necessity of nature,</hi> as that it acts to the utmost of its quality and faculty by a pure natural necessity. God punisheth sin, as suitably unto the principle of his Nature, that otherwise he cannot do, yet so, as that for the <hi>manner, time, measure</hi> and <hi>season,</hi> they depend on the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his Wisdom and Righteousness, assigning a <hi>meet and equal recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto every transgression.</hi> And this the Scripture teacheth us by this <hi>metaphor,</hi> or otherwise we are led by it from a <hi>right conception</hi> of that which it doth propose: for God cannot at all be unto <hi>sin and sinners</hi> as a <hi>devouring fire,</hi> unless it be in the principles of his <hi>Nature</hi> indispensibly to take vengeance on them.</p>
                        <p>Again, The Scripture expresseth this Nature of God with reference unto sin, <hi>properly</hi> as to what we can conceive thereof in this world, and that is by his <hi>Holiness,</hi> which it sets forth to be such, as that on the account thereof he can bear with <hi>no sin,</hi> nor suffer any sinner to approach unto him; that is, let no sin go <hi>unpunished,</hi> nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any sinner into his presence whose sin is not expiated and satisfied for. And what is necessary upon the account of the Holiness of God, is <hi>absolutely</hi> and indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly so, his Holiness being his Nature. <hi>Thou art,</hi> saith <hi>Habakkuk, of purer ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50110:295"/>
upon the account of his <hi>Purity,</hi> or Holiness. That is <hi>such,</hi> as he cannot pass by sin, or let it go unpunished. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> also expresseth the nature of God to the same purpose, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6. <hi>Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with thee; the foolish shall not stand in thy sight, thou hatest all the workers of iniquity, thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing, the Lord will abhor the bloody and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful man.</hi> What is the formal Reason and Cause of all these things, that he <hi>hates, abhors,</hi> and <hi>will destroy sin</hi> and <hi>sinners?</hi> It is because he is <hi>such a God</hi>; Thou art not a God to do otherwise; a God of such Purity, such Holiness; and should he pass by sin without the Punishment of it, he would not be <hi>such a God</hi> as he is. Without ceasing to be <hi>such a God,</hi> so infinitely <hi>holy and pure,</hi> this cannot be: The <hi>foolish,</hi> and all Workers of Iniquity must be destroyed, because he is such a God. And in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of his name, wherein he declared many blessed Eternal Properties of his Nature, he adds this among the rest; that <hi>he will by no means clear the guilty, Exod.</hi> 34.7. This his Nature, this his Eternal Holiness requireth, that the <hi>guilty be by no means cleared.</hi> So <hi>Joshua</hi> instructs the people in the Nature of this Holiness of God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24.19. <hi>Ye cannot serve the Lord, for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God, he will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins.</hi> That is, if you continue in your sins, if there be not a <hi>way</hi> to free you from them, it is in vain for you to <hi>have any thing to do with this God</hi>; for he is Holy and Jealous, and will therefore certainly destroy you for your iniquities. Now if such be the <hi>nature of God,</hi> that with respect thereunto, He <hi>cannot</hi> but punish sin in whomsoever it be found, then the <hi>suffering</hi> of every sinner, in his own person, or by his <hi>sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ty,</hi> doth not depend on a meer <hi>free Voluntary Constitution,</hi> nor is resolved meerly into the <hi>Veracity</hi> of God, in his commination or thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tning, but is <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently</hi> unto them <hi>indispensibly necessary,</hi> unless we would have the Nature of God changed, that sinners may be freed. Whereas therefore the Lord Christ is assigned the <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> and hath undertaken the work of bringing sinners unto Glory, it was <hi>meet</hi> with respect unto the <hi>Holiness of God,</hi> that he should undergo the punishment due unto their sin. And thus the <hi>necessity</hi> of the sufferings and satisfaction of Christ, is resolved into the Holiness and Nature of God; He being <hi>such a God</hi> as he is, it could not otherwise be.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The same is manifest from that <hi>principle</hi> whereunto the <hi>punishment of sin is assigned</hi>; which is not any <hi>free Act</hi> of the Will of God, but an Essential property of his nature; namely, his <hi>Justice</hi> or Righteousness. What God doth because he is <hi>righteous,</hi> is necessary to be done. And if it be <hi>just with God</hi> in respect of his Essential Justice to <hi>punish sin,</hi> it would be <hi>unjust</hi> not to do it: for to condemn the innocent, and to acquit the guilty is equally unjust. Justice is an eternal and unalterable Rule, and what is done according unto it, is <hi>necessary</hi>; it may not otherwise be, and Justice not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached. That which is to be done with respect to Justice, <hi>must be done</hi>; or he that is to do it, is <hi>unjust.</hi> Thus it is said to be <hi>a righteous thing with God to render tribulation unto sinners,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.6. Because he is Righteous, and from his <hi>Righteousness or Justice</hi>; So that the contrary would be <hi>unjust,</hi> not answer his Righteousness. And it is the <hi>judgement of God, that they who commit sin, are worthy of death, Rom.</hi> 1.32. Namely, it is that which his Justice requireth should be so; that is, the <hi>judgement of God.</hi> Not only doth he render death unto sinners, because he hath <hi>threatned</hi> so to do, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Justice necessarily requireth that so he should do. So the Apostle farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himself, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Where he calls the last day, <hi>the day of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteous Judgement of God</hi>; wherein by <hi>rendring tribulation unto sinners,</hi> he will manifest what his Righteousness requires. And what that requires cannot otherwise be; God being <hi>naturally, necessarily, essentially</hi> Righteous. And this <hi>Property</hi> of Gods nature requiring that <hi>Punishment</hi> be infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>cted on sin and sinners; is often in Scripture called his <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Wrath.</hi> For although sometimes the <hi>Effects</hi> of Anger and Wrath in Punishment it self, be denoted by those expressions, yet often also they denote the Habitude of the Nature of God in his Justice towards sin. For Anger in it self being a Passion and Perturbation of mind, including <hi>change</hi> and Weakness, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be ascribed unto God; and therefore when it is spoken of, as that which is in him, and not of the Effects which he works on others, it can intend nothing but his <hi>Vindictive Justice,</hi> that property of his nature, which <hi>necessarily enclines him</hi> unto the punishment of sin. Thus it is said, that his <hi>Wrath</hi> or Anger <hi>is revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven against all ungodliness, Rom.</hi> 1.18. That is, he discovers in his <hi>judgements</hi> what is his Justice against sin. And thus when he comes to deal with Christ himself, to make him a <hi>propitiation</hi> for us; he is said to have set him forth, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>To declare his righteousness for the remission of sins; that he might be just, and the justifier of them that believe in Jesus</hi>; as God would pardon sin, and justifie them that believe, so he would be <hi>just</hi> also; and how could this be; by <hi>punishing our sins in Christ</hi>: that declared his Righteousness: <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>an Example unto them that should live ungodly</hi>; that is, an instance of what his dealings would be with sinners. So God is said here to have <hi>declared his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> by an Example in the sufferings of Christ; which indeed was the greatest instance of the severity and inexorableness of Justice against sin, that God ever gave in this world. And this he did, that he <hi>might be just</hi> as well as gracious and merciful in the forgiveness of sin. Now if the <hi>Justice</hi> of God did not require, that sin should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in the Mediator, how did God give an instance of his <hi>Justice</hi> in his sufferings; for nothing can be declared, but in and by that which it requires; For to say, that God shewed his Righteousness in doing that, which might have been <hi>omitted without the least impeachment of his Righteousness,</hi> is in this matter not safe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, God is the Supream <hi>Ruler, Governour</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> of all. To him as such it belongeth to do right. So saith <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.25. <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</hi> undoubtedly he will do so, it belongs unto him so to do: For, saith the Apostle, <hi>Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance, God forbid; for then how shall God judge the world, Rom.</hi> 3.5, 6. Right Judgement in all things belongs unto the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Rectitude</hi> of the Nature of God, as he is the Supream Governour and Judge of all the world. Now the Goodness and Rightness of all things, consists in the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Place and Order which God in their Creation allotted unto them, whereon he pronounced that they <hi>were exceeding Good.</hi> And that this Order be preserved for the good of the whole, it belongs unto the <hi>Government of God</hi> to take care; or if it be in any thing transgressed not to leave all things in Confusion, but to <hi>reduce them</hi> into some <hi>new Order</hi> and subjection unto himself. That this Order was broken by sin we all know. What shall now the <hi>Governour of all the world do?</hi> Shall he leave all things in disorder and confusion? Cast off the works of his hands, and suffer all things to run at random? Would this become the <hi>Righteous Governour</hi> of all the world? What then is to be done to prevent this confusion? Nothing remains, but that he who brake the <hi>first Order</hi> by <hi>sin,</hi> should be subdued into a <hi>new one by punishment.</hi> This brings him into subjection unto God upon <hi>a new account.</hi> And to say that God might have let his sin go <hi>unpunished,</hi> is to say, that he might <hi>not be righteous</hi> in his Government, nor do that which is necessary for the Good, Beauty and Order of the whole. But hereof somewhat was spoken in the opening of the words, so that it needs not far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be insisted on.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, There is no <hi>common presumption</hi> engrafted in the hearts of men, concerning any <hi>free Act</hi> of God, and which might have been otherwise. No <hi>free Decree</hi> or Act of God is, or can be known unto any of the children of men, but by <hi>Revelation</hi>; much less have they all of them universally an <hi>inbred Perswasion</hi> concerning any such Acts or actings. But of the <hi>natural properties</hi> of God, and his acting suitable unto them; there is a secret Light and <hi>Perswasion</hi> engrafted in the hearts of all men by nature. At least, <hi>those things of God,</hi> whereof there is a <hi>natural</hi> and indelible <hi>Character</hi> in the hearts of all men, are <hi>natural, necessary</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> unto him. Now that <hi>God is just,</hi> and that therefore he <hi>will punish sin, all sin,</hi> is an inbred Presumption of nature, that can never be rooted out of the minds of men. All sinners have an <hi>inbred Apprehension</hi> that God is displeased with sin; and that punishment is due unto it. They cannot but know, that it is the <hi>judgement of God that they who commit sin are worthy of death.</hi> And therefore though they have not the <hi>Law written</hi> to instruct them, yet their <hi>thoughts accuse</hi> them upon sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.14, 15. that is, their Consciences; which is the <hi>judgement which a man makes of himself in reference unto the judgement of God.</hi> And therefore all Nations who retained any knowledge of a <hi>Deity,</hi> constantly invented some Wayes and Means whereby they thought they might <hi>expiate sin,</hi> and <hi>appease</hi> the God that they feared. All which manifests that the Punishment of sin, insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably follows the <hi>nature of God,</hi> and such properties thereof, as men have a <hi>natural inbred notion</hi> and presumption of. For if it depended meerly on the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and his Faithfulness in the accomplishing of that <hi>Threatning</hi> and constitution, whereof they had no knowledge; they could not have had such an <hi>immoveable</hi> and unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Apprehension of it. But these things I have handled at large elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="246" facs="tcp:50110:296"/>And this fully discovers the <hi>vile and horrid nature of sin. Fools,</hi> as the Wise man tells us, <hi>make a mock of it.</hi> Stifling for a while their natural convictions, they act as <hi>if sin were a thing of nought</hi>; at least, not so horrible as by some it is represented. And few there are who endeavour aright to obtain a <hi>true notion</hi> of it; contenting themselves in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that it is a thing that <hi>ought not to be.</hi> What direct Opposition it stands in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nature, Properties, Rule and Authority of God, they consider not. But the <hi>last day</hi> will discover the <hi>true nature</hi> of it; when all eyes shall see what it deserves in the <hi>judgement of God,</hi> which is according unto Righteousness. Is it a small thing for a <hi>Creature</hi> to <hi>break that Order</hi> which God at first placed him and all things in? To cast off the Rule and Authority of God, to endeavour to dethrone him, so that he cannot continue to be the <hi>Supream Governour</hi> of all things, and Judge of all the world, unless he punish it? Is it a small thing to set up that which hath an <hi>utter inconsistency</hi> with the Holiness and Righteousness of God, so that if it go <hi>free,</hi> God cannot be <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>righteous?</hi> If these things will not <hi>now</hi> sink into the minds of men; if they will not learn the <hi>severity</hi> of God in this matter from the <hi>Law,</hi> on the threatning and curse whereof he hath impressed the Image of his Holiness and Justice, as was said, they will learn it <hi>all in Hell.</hi> Why doth God thus <hi>threaten</hi> and curse sin and sinners? Why hath he prepared an Eternity of Vengeance and Torment for them? Is it because he would? Nay, because it could not otherwise be, God being so Holy and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as he is. Men may thank themselves for <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi>; They are <hi>no more</hi> than sin hath made <hi>necessary</hi> unless God should cease to be Holy, Righteous, and the Judge of all, that they might sin freely and endlesly. And this appears most eminently in the Cross of Christ; for God gave in him an instance of his Righteousness, and of the desert of sin. Sin being <hi>imputed</hi> unto the only Son of God, he could not be spared. If he be <hi>made sin,</hi> he must be <hi>made a curse</hi>; If he will <hi>take away our iniquities,</hi> he must make <hi>his soul an offering for sins,</hi> and bear the punishment due unto them. <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> in all Duties will not do it; <hi>Intercession</hi> and Prayers will not do it, sin required another manner of Expiation. Nothing but <hi>undergoing the wrath of God,</hi> and the Curse of the Law, and therein answering what the eternal Justice of God required, will effect that End. How can God <hi>spare sin in his Enemies,</hi> who could not spare it on his only Son? Had it been possible this Cup should have passed from him: but this could not be, and God continue Righteous.

                        <p>THe great Reason and Ground of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of the sufferings of Christ hath been declared. It <hi>became God</hi> that he should suffer. But it doth not yet appear on what Grounds this suffering of his could be <hi>profitable</hi> or beneficial unto the <hi>Sons</hi> to be brought unto Glory. It was the <hi>sinner himself</hi> against whom the Law denounced the <hi>Judgement of death.</hi> And although the Lord Christ undertaking to be a <hi>Captain of Salvation</hi> unto the Sons of God, might be <hi>willing</hi> to suffer for them, yet what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is there that the Punishment of <hi>One,</hi> should be accepted for the sin of Another? Let it be granted, that the Lord Christ had an absolute and <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> over his own Life, and all the Concernments of it, in the nature which he <hi>assumed</hi>; as also that he was <hi>willing</hi> to undergo any sufferings that God should call him unto; this indeed will <hi>acquit</hi> the Justice of God in giving him up unto death. But whence is it that <hi>sinners</hi> should come to be so interested in these things, as thereon to be <hi>acquitted</hi> from sin, and brought unto Glory. In <hi>these Verses</hi> the Apostle enters upon a discovery of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons hereof also. He <hi>supposeth</hi> indeed, that there was a <hi>Compact</hi> and Agreement between the Father and Son in this matter; which he afterwards expresly treateth on, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. He <hi>supposeth</hi> also, that in his Soveraign Authority, God had made a <hi>Relaxation of the Law,</hi> as to the <hi>Person suffering,</hi> though not as to the <hi>Penalty</hi> to be suffered; which
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50110:296"/>
God abundantly declared unto the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> in all their Sacrifices, as we shall manifest. These things being <hi>supposed,</hi> the Apostle proceeds to declare the grounds of the Equity of this Substitution of Christ, in the room of the Sons, and of their Advantage by <hi>his suffering</hi>; the <hi>Proposition</hi> whereof he layes down in these <hi>Verses,</hi> and the especial <hi>Application</hi> in those that ensue.</p>

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, are rendered by the <hi>LXX.</hi>

                           </gap>, <hi>the words here used by the Apostle.</hi> But there are sundry things, that will not allow us to close with this supposal. First, The <hi>Original</hi> is not rightly rendered by the <hi>LXX.</hi> and as we shall see, the Apostles words do exactly express the <hi>Original</hi> in another place. Besides <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, is never but in this place and once more turned into <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, by the <hi>LXX.</hi> but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly rendered by them, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. So that it is not <hi>improbable,</hi> but that these words might be inserted into the <hi>Greek Text</hi> out of this place of the Apostle, there being some Presumptions and likelihoods, that it was the place intended by him; especially because the <hi>next Testimony</hi> used by the Apostle, consists in the Words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ensuing these in the Prophet: But yet that yields another Reason against this supposition. For if the Apostle continued on the words of the Prophet, to what end should he insert in the midst of them, that constant note of proceeding unto another Testimony, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And as in the <hi>Verse foregoing,</hi> giving an account why God would have Christ to <hi>suffer,</hi> he describes him by that Property of his Nature which includes a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of his so doing; so setting forth the <hi>Causes</hi> on our part, of that suffering, and the grounds of our <hi>advantage</hi> thereby, he expresseth him and the children by those terms, which manifest their Relation unto one another; and which they could not have stood in, had they not been of the <hi>same nature,</hi> as he afterwards declares.

This work was the <hi>Captain of salvation</hi> designed unto; the <hi>children that were to be brought unto glory,</hi> being in themselves <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>unholy,</hi> and on that account <hi>separated</hi> from God, he was to <hi>purge</hi> their natures, and to make them <hi>holy,</hi> that they might be admitted into the favour of, and find acceptance with God. And for the <hi>Nature</hi> of this work, two things must be considered: (1.) The <hi>Impetration</hi> of it, or the Way and Means whereby he obtained this Sanctification for them; and (2.) The <hi>Application</hi> of that Means, or <hi>real effecting</hi> of it. The first consisteth in the <hi>sufferings</hi> of Christ, and the merit thereof. Hence we are so often said to be <hi>sanctified and washed in his blood, Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. and his blood is said to <hi>cleanse us from all our sins,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. As it was <hi>shed for us,</hi> he procured by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Obedience therein, that those for whom it was shed, should be <hi>purged</hi> and <hi>purified, Titus</hi> 2.14. The other consists in the <hi>effectual workings</hi> of the Spirit of Grace,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50110:297"/>
communicated unto us by vertue of the bloodshedding and sufferings of Christ, as the Apostle declares, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. And they who place this <hi>sanctification</hi> meerly on the Doctrine and Example of Christ, (as <hi>Grotius</hi> on this place) besides that they consider not at all the design and scope of the place, so they reject the principal End, and the most blessed Effect of the death and bloodshedding of the Lord Jesus. Now in this Description of the Captain of Salvation, and of the Sons, the Apostle inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates a farther <hi>necessity of his sufferings,</hi> because <hi>they were to be sanctified</hi> by him, which could no otherwise be done but by his <hi>death and bloodshedding.</hi> Having many things to observe from these Verses, we shall take them up as they offer themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in our procedure: As here:</p>
                        <p n="i">I. <hi>That all the children which are to be brought unt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This for many blessed Ends the Scripture abundantly instructs us in, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. <hi>We our selves also were sometimes foolish, and disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating of one another.</hi> A most wretched, defiled and loathsome condition, that which justly might be an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency to God, and all his holy Angels: and such indeed God describes it to be by his Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5, 6. <hi>Thou wast polluted in thy blood, and cast out in the field, to the loathing of thy Person</hi>; Thus we were saith the Apostle; even <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>,</hi> who are now <hi>sanctified</hi> and <hi>cleansed</hi> by the means which he afterwards relates. The like description he gives of this estate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11, 12. with an Assertion of the same delivery from it. We are naturally <hi>very proud,</hi> apt to please our selves in our selves; to think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than of being <hi>polluted</hi> or <hi>defiled</hi>; or at least not so far, but that we can <hi>wash our selves.</hi> What a hard thing is it to perswade the great men of the world, in the midst of their Ornaments, Paintings and Perfumes, that they are all over <hi>vile, leprous, loathsome</hi> and defiled? Are they not ready to wash themselves in the <hi>blood of them</hi> who intimate any such thing unto them? But whether men will hear or forbear, this is the condition of all men, even of the <hi>Sons of God themselves</hi> before they are washed and sanctified by Christ Jesus. And as this sets out the Infinite Love of God, in taking notice of such vile creatures as we are, and the unspeakable <hi>Condescension</hi> of the Lord Christ, with the Efficacy of his Grace in cleansing us by his blood, so it is sufficient to keep us humble in our selves, and thankful unto God all our dayes.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. <hi>That the Lord Christ is the great sanctifier of the Church. His Title</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the <hi>Sanctifier</hi>; of which more afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Lord Christ the Captain of our Salvation, sanctifies every Son whom he brings unto glory.</hi> He will never glorifie an <hi>unsanctified</hi> person. The world indeed is full of an Expectation of Glory by Christ; but of that which is indispensibly previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thereunto, they have no regard. But this the Scripture gives us as a principal Effect of the whole Mediation of Christ. Of his <hi>death, Ephes.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. Of his communication of his <hi>Word and Spirit, John</hi> 17.19. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5, 6. Of his <hi>blood-shedding</hi> in an especial manner; 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.5. Of his <hi>Life</hi> in Heaven and Intercession for us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. This he <hi>creates his people</hi> unto by his <hi>Grace, Ephes.</hi> 2.8. <hi>excites</hi> them unto by his Promises, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. and commands; <hi>John</hi> 15.16, 17. So that no End of the Mediation of Christ is accomplished in them who are not sanctified and made holy; And this was necessary for him to do, on the part (1.) Of God: (2.) Of himself: (3.) Of themselves.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Of God,</hi> unto whom they are to be brought in glory. He is <hi>holy</hi>; of <hi>purer eyes than to behold iniquity</hi>: No unclean thing can stand in his presence. Holy in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>glorious in Holiness</hi>; holy in his Commands, and will be <hi>sanctified</hi> in all that draw nigh unto him. And this <hi>Peter</hi> urgeth as that which requires Holiness in us, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>As he that hath called them is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of Conversation, because it is written; be ye holy; for I am holy</hi>; and thence it is said, that Holiness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh his house; that is, all that <hi>draw nigh</hi> unto him; and the Apostle sets it down as an uncontrollable <hi>Maxime,</hi> that without <hi>Holiness no man shall see God.</hi> If the Lord Christ then will bring the children unto God, he must make them <hi>Holy,</hi> or they can have no admittance into his presence, no acceptance with him; for <hi>no unclean thing,</hi> nothing that defileth, can enter into the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> the place where his Holiness
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50110:298"/>
dwelleth. It is utterly impossible that any soul not washed with the blood of Christ, not <hi>sanctified</hi> by his Spirit and Grace, should stand in the sight of God. And this was expressed in all the <hi>typical Institutions</hi> about <hi>cleansing</hi> which God appointed unto his people of old. He did it to teach them, that unless they were <hi>sanctified,</hi> washed and cleansed from their sins, they could be admitted unto no Communion with him, nor Enjoyment of him. Neither can any serve him here, unless their <hi>consciences be purged by the blood of Christ from dead works</hi>; nor can they come to him hereafter, unless they are washed from all their defilements. Their services here he rejects as an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean</hi> and polluted thing, and their confidences for the future he despiseth as a presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous abomination. God will not divest himself of his <hi>Holiness,</hi> that he may receive, or be enjoyed by <hi>unholy creature.</hi> And the day is coming wherein poor <hi>unsanctified creatures,</hi> who think they may <hi>miss Holiness</hi> in the way to glory, shall cry out, <hi>who amongst us shall inhabit with those everlasting burnings;</hi> for so will he appear unto all unsanctified persons.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Of <hi>Himself,</hi> and the Relation whereunto he takes these Sons with himself. He is their <hi>Head,</hi> and they are to be <hi>members</hi> of his body. Now he is <hi>holy,</hi> and so must they be also, or this Revelation will be very unsuitable and uncomely. <hi>A living head</hi> and <hi>dead members,</hi> a beautiful head and rotten members, how uncomely would it be? Such a <hi>monstrous</hi> body Christ will never own. Nay, it would overthrow the whole nature of that Relation, and take away the life and form of that Union that Christ and his are brought into, as head and members. For whereas it consists in this, that the whole <hi>Head and members are animated, quickned and acted by one and the self same Spirit of life;</hi> nor doth any thing else give Union between head and members; if they be not <hi>sanctified by that Spirit,</hi> there can be no such Relation between them. Again, he takes them unto himself to be his <hi>Bride and Spouse.</hi> Now you know, that it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of old, that if any one would take up a <hi>Captive Maid</hi> to be his Wife, she was to <hi>shave her head, and pare her nayls, and wash her self,</hi> that she might be meet for him. And the Lord Christ taking this <hi>Bride</hi> unto himself, by the conquest he hath made of her, must by <hi>Sanctification</hi> make them meet for this Relation with himself. And therefore he doth it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.25, 26. <hi>Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, v.</hi> 27. <hi>that he might present it unto himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such things, but that it should be holy and without blemish.</hi> This it <hi>became</hi> him to do, this was the End why he did it; he <hi>sanctifieth his Church</hi> that he may present it a <hi>meet Bride</hi> or Spouse unto himself. The like may be said of all other Relations wherein the Lord Christ stands unto his people; there is no one of them but makes their <hi>sanctification</hi> absolutely necessary.</p>
                        <p n="3">. On the part of the Children themselves; for unless they are <hi>Regenerate, or born again,</hi> wherein the foundation of their <hi>sanctification</hi> is laid, they can by no means en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of God. It is this that makes them <hi>meet for the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> As without it, they are not <hi>meet</hi> for their Duty, so are they not <hi>capable</hi> of their Reward. Yea, Heaven it self in the true light and notion of it, is undesirable unto an <hi>unsanctified</hi> person. Such an one, neither can, nor would enjoy God if he might. In a word, There is no <hi>one thing required</hi> of the Sons of God, that an <hi>unsanctified Person</hi> can do, no <hi>one thing promised</hi> unto them, that he can enjoy.</p>
                        <p>There is surely then a woful <hi>mistake</hi> in the world. If <hi>Christ sanctifier</hi> all whom he saves, many will appear to have been mistaken in their Expectations another day. It is grown amongst us almost an Abhorrency unto all flesh, to say, that the <hi>Church of God is to holy.</hi> What though God hath <hi>promised</hi> that it should be so; that Christ hath undertaken to <hi>make it so;</hi> What if it be <hi>required</hi> to be so? What if all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it he <hi>rejected</hi> of God if it be not so; it is all one; if men be <hi>baptized</hi> whether they <hi>will or no,</hi> and outwardly profess the name of Christ, though not one of them be truly sanctified, yet they are, as it is said, the <hi>Church of Christ.</hi> Why then let them be so; but what are they the better for it? Are their Persons, or their Services there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>accepted</hi> with God? Are they <hi>related</hi> or united unto Christ? Are they under his conduct unto glory? Are they <hi>meet for the Inheritance</hi> of the Saints in light? not at all; not all, not any of these things do they obtain thereby: What is it then that they get by the furious contest which they make for the Reputation of this Previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Only this, that satisfying their minds by it, resting, if not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50110:298"/>
at this day more contended for in this world, than that Christ might be thought to be a <hi>Captain of salvation</hi> unto them unto whom he is not a <hi>Sanctifier;</hi> that he may have an <hi>unholy Church,</hi> a <hi>dead Body.</hi> These things tend neither to the glory of Christ, nor to the good of the souls of men. Let none then deceive themselves, <hi>sanctification</hi> is a qualification indispensibly necessary unto them who will be under the conduct of the Lord Christ unto salvation, to lead none to heaven but whom he sanctifies on the earth. The holy God will not receive <hi>unholy</hi> persons. This living Head will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of dead members, nor bring men into the possession of a glory which they neither love nor like.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Having given this description of the <hi>Captain of salvation,</hi> and of the <hi>sons</hi> to be <hi>brought unto glory,</hi> The Apostle affirms of them that they are <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>of one,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>.</note> which made it meet for him to suffer, and for them to be made partakers of his sufferings. The equity hereof lies in the agreement, that he and they are <hi>of one</hi>; which what it is, we must now enquire.</p>
                        <p>The word hath this ambiguity in it, that it may be of the <hi>Masculine Gender,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note <hi>one person</hi>; or of the <hi>Neuter,</hi> and signifie <hi>one thing.</hi> If it relate unto the person, it may have a double interpretation.</p>
                        <p>First, That it is <hi>God</hi> who is intended; they are <hi>of one,</hi> that is <hi>God.</hi> And this may be spoken in several respects. The <hi>Son</hi> was of him by Eternal Generation, the <hi>many sons</hi> by Temporal Creation, they were made by him. Or they are all of him, he <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him to be the Sanctifier,</hi> them to be <hi>sanctified; Him</hi> to be the Captain of salvation, and <hi>them</hi> to be brought unto glory. And this sense the last testimony produced by the Apostles seems to give countenance unto: <hi>Behold I and the children whom God hath given unto me</hi>; Me to be their <hi>Father, Captain,</hi> Leader; they to be the <hi>children</hi> to be cared for, and conducted by me. And this way went most of the <hi>Antients,</hi> in their Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this place. In this sense the reason yielded by the Apostle in these words, why the <hi>Captain of salvation</hi> should be made perfect by sufferings, because the sons to be brought unto glory were also to suffer, and they were <hi>all of one,</hi> both he and they, even <hi>of God.</hi> But though these things are <hi>true,</hi> yet they contain not a <hi>full reason</hi> of what the Apostle intends to prove by this assertion. For this Interpretation allows no other Relation to be expressed between Christ and the sons, than what is between <hi>him and Angels</hi>; they are also with him of <hi>one God.</hi> And yet the Apostle afterward sheweth, that there was <hi>another <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and Relation between Christ and the Elect needful, that they might be saved by him, than any that was between him and Angels. And if nothing be intimated but the <hi>good pleasure</hi> of God, appointing him to be a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and them to <hi>be saved,</hi> because they were <hi>all of himself,</hi> of <hi>one God,</hi> which was sufficient to make that appointment just and righteous, then is here nothing asserted to prove the <hi>meetness</hi> of Christ to be a Saviour unto men, and not to Angels, which yet the Apostle in the <hi>following Verses</hi> expresly deduceth from hence.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If it respect a <hi>Person,</hi> it may be <hi>ex uno homine, of one man,</hi> that is, of <hi>Adam</hi>; they are all of <hi>one common Root</hi> and stock, he and they came all of <hi>one Adam:</hi> unto him is the <hi>Genealogie</hi> of Christ referred by <hi>Luke.</hi> And as a common stock of our nature he is often called the <hi>One,</hi> the <hi>One man, Rom.</hi> 5. And this for the substance of it falls in with what will be next considered.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It may be taken in the <hi>Neuter sense,</hi> and denote <hi>one thing</hi>; and so also it may receive a double Interpretation.</p>
                        <p>First, It may denote the <hi>same mass of humane nature.</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, of one and the same <hi>mass</hi> of humane nature; or <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, so it is said of all mankind, that God made them <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>of one blood, Acts</hi> 17.26. of one <hi>common principle,</hi> which gives an Alliance, Cognation, and Brotherhood unto the whole Race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. As the making of all mankind <hi>by one God</hi> gives them all a relation unto him, as saith the Apostle, <hi>We are all his off-spring</hi>; so their being made of <hi>one blood</hi> gives them a Brotherhood among themselves. See <hi>Acts</hi> 14.15. And this interpretation differs not in the substance of it from that <hi>last preceding</hi>; in as much as the <hi>whole mass of humane nature</hi> had its existence in the person of <hi>Adam,</hi> only it refers not the <hi>Oneness</hi> mentioned formally unto his person, but unto the <hi>nature</hi> it self whereof he was made partaker. And this sense the Apostle farther explains, <hi>verse</hi> 14. as he also observes it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, By <hi>One,</hi> some understand the same <hi>spiritual nature</hi>; the principles of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life which is in Christ the Head, and the children his members. And this they say is that which is their peculiar <hi>Oneness,</hi> or being of one; seeing all wicked men, even Reprobates, are of the <hi>same common mass of humane nature</hi> as well as the children.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50110:299"/>
But yet this is not satisfactory. It is true indeed, that after the children are <hi>really san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi> they are of <hi>one and the same spiritual nature</hi> with their Head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. and hereby are they differenced from all others. But the Apostle here treats of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so <hi>of One,</hi> that he might be meet to <hi>suffer</hi> for them, which is <hi>antecedent</hi> unto their being <hi>sanctified,</hi> as the Cause is unto the Effect. Neither is it of any weight that the <hi>Reprobates</hi> are partakers of the same <hi>common nature</hi> with the children, seeing the Lord Christ partook of it only on the <hi>childrens account,</hi> as <hi>verse</hi> 14. And of their nature he could not be partaker, without being partaker of that which was common to them all, seeing that of <hi>one blood</hi> God made all Nations under heaven. But the bond of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self is in the Covenant, reckoned only unto them that shall be sanctified.</p>
                        <p>It is then <hi>one common nature</hi> that is here intended: He and they are of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of <hi>one mass,</hi> of <hi>one blood.</hi> And hereby he became to be meet to suffer for them, and they to be in a capacity of enjoying the benefit of his sufferings; which how it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers the whole design of the Apostle in this place, doth evidently appear.</p>
                        <p>First, He intends to shew that the Lord Christ was <hi>meet to suffer</hi> for the children; and this arose from hence, that he was of the <hi>same nature with them,</hi> as he afterwards at large declares. And he was meet to <hi>sanctifie</hi> them by his sufferings, as in this verse he intimates. For as in an Offering made unto the Lord of the <hi>first Fruits,</hi> of <hi>Meat,</hi> or of <hi>Meal,</hi> a parcel of the same nature with the whole was taken and offered, whereby the <hi>whole was sanctified, Levit.</hi> 2. So the Lord Jesus Christ being taken as the <hi>first fruits</hi> of the nature of the children, and offered unto God, the <hi>whole lump,</hi> or the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man in the children, that is all the Elect, is separated unto God, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>sanctified</hi> in their season. And this gives the ground unto all the testimonies which the Apostle produceth unto his purpose out of the Old Testament. For being thus of <hi>one nature</hi> with them, he is not <hi>ashamed to call them brethren,</hi> as he proves from <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. For although it be true, that as <hi>brethren</hi> is a term of <hi>spiritual cognation</hi> and love, he calls them not so until they are made partakers of his Spirit, and of the same spiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is in him; yet the first foundation of this Appellation lies in his participation of the <hi>same nature</hi> with them, without which, however he might <hi>love them,</hi> he could not properly call them Brethren. Also his participation of their nature, was that which brought him into such a condition, as wherein it was needful <hi>for him to put his trust in God,</hi> and to look for <hi>deliverance from hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> in a time of danger,</hi> which the Apostle proves in the second place by a testimony out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. which could not in any sense have been said of Christ, had he not been <hi>partaker of that nature,</hi> which is exposed unto all kind of wants and troubles, with outward streights and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, which the nature of Angels is not. And as his being thus of <hi>One with us</hi> made him our Brother, and placed him in that condition with us, wherein it was necessary for him <hi>to put his trust in God for deliverance,</hi> so being the principal Head and <hi>first Fruits</hi> of our nature, and therein the <hi>Author and finisher of our salvation,</hi> he is a <hi>Father</hi> unto us, and <hi>we are his children,</hi> which the Apostle proveth by his last testimony from <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. <hi>Behold I and the children which the Lord hath given unto me.</hi> And further upon the close of these testimonies, the Apostle assumes again his Proposition, and asserts it unto the same purpose, <hi>verse</hi> 14. shewing in what sense he and the children were of one, namely in their mutual <hi>participation of flesh and blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus this interpretation of the word will sufficiently bear the whole weight of the Apostles Argument and Inferences. But if any one list to extend the word farther, and to comprize in it the <hi>manifold Relation</hi> that is between Christ and his Members, I shall not contend about it. There may be in it, 1. Their being of <hi>one God,</hi> designing him and them to be one <hi>mystical body,</hi> one Church, he the Head, they the Members. 2. Their taking <hi>into one Covenant,</hi> made originally with him, and exemplified in them. 3. Their being of <hi>one common principle of humane nature.</hi> 4. Disigned unto a <hi>manifold spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual union</hi> in respect of that <hi>new nature</hi> which the children receive from him, with every other thing that concurs to serve the <hi>union</hi> and relation between them; but that which we have insisted on is <hi>principally intended,</hi> and to be so considered by us. And we might teach from hence, that,</p>
                        <p n="iii">III. <hi>The agreement of Christ and the Elect in one common nature, is the foundation of his fitness to be an Undertaker on their behalf, and of the equity of their being made partakers of the benefits of his Mediation:</hi> But that this will occur unto us again more fully, <hi>verse</hi> 14.</p>
                        <p>And by all this doth the Apostle discover unto the <hi>Hebrews</hi> the unreasonableness of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50110:299"/>
their offence at the <hi>affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>cted condition</hi> and sufferings of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> He had minded them of the work that he had to do, which was <hi>to save his Elect</hi> by a spiritual and eternal salvation. He had also intimated what was their condition by nature, wherein they were <hi>unclean,</hi> unsanctifi'd, separate from God. And withall had made known what the <hi>Justice</hi> of God, as the Supreme Governour and Judge of all required, that sinners might be saved. He now minds them of the Union that was between him and them, whereby he became <hi>fit to suffer</hi> for them, as that they might enjoy the blessed effects thereof in deliverance and salvation.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The Apostle lays down an Inference from his preceding assertion, in those words, <hi>For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren.</hi> In which words we have 1. The respect of that which is here affirmed unto the assertion fore-going; <hi>for which cause.</hi> 2. The thing it self affirmed, which is, <hi>That the Lord Christ calls the sons to be brought unto glory, his brethren.</hi> 3. The manner of his so doing, he <hi>is not ashamed to call them so.</hi> And herein also the Apostle, according to his wonted way of proceeding, which we have often observed, makes a transition towards somewhat else which he had in design, namely the <hi>Prophetical Office</hi> of Christ, as we shall see afterwards.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For which cause</hi>; that is, because they <hi>are of one,</hi> partakers of one common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>He calls them brethren.</hi> This gives a rightful foundation unto that Appellation: Hereon is built that relation which is between him and them. It is true, there is more required to perfect the <hi>relation of Brotherhood</hi> between him and them, than meerly their <hi>being of one;</hi> but it is so far established from hence, that he was <hi>meet to suffer</hi> for them, to <hi>sanctifie</hi> and save them. And without this there could have been no such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Now his calling of them <hi>Brethren</hi> doth both declare, that they <hi>are so,</hi> and also that he <hi>owns them</hi> and avouches them as such. But whereas it may be said, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are <hi>thus of one</hi> in respect of their common nature, yet upon sundry other accounts he is so <hi>glorious,</hi> and they are so <hi>vile</hi> and miserable, that he might justly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow this <hi>cognation,</hi> and reject them as strangers; The Apostle tells us it is otherwise, and that passing by all other distances between them, and setting aside the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their unworthiness, for which he might justly disavow them, and remembring wherefore he was <hi>of one with them,</hi> he is <hi>not ashamed to call them brethren.</hi> There may be a <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in the words, and the <hi>contrary asserted</hi> to that which is denied; <hi>he is not ashamed,</hi> that is willingly, cheerfully, and readily he doth it. But I rather look upon it as an expression of <hi>condescension</hi> and love; and herein doth the Apostle shew the use of what he taught before, that they <hi>were of one,</hi> namely that thereby they became <hi>Brethren,</hi> he meet to suffer for them, and they meet to be saved by him. What in all this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle confirms by the ensuing testimonies, we shall see in the explication of them; in the mean time we may learn for our own instruction,</p>
                        <p n="iv">IV. <hi>That notwithstanding the union of nature which is between the Son of God incarnate the Sanctifier, and the children that are to be sanctified, there is in respect of their Persons as inconceivable distance between them, so that it is a marvellous condescension in him to call them brethren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He is not <hi>ashamed</hi> to call them so, though considering what himself is, and what they are, it should seem that he might justly be so. The same expression for the like reasons is used concerning <hi>Gods owning his people</hi> in covenant, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God.</hi> And this distance between Christ and us, which makes his condescension so marvellous, relates unto a four-fold head.</p>
                        <p>First, The immunity of the nature wherein he was of one <hi>with us</hi> in his Person, from all sin. <hi>He was made like unto us in all things, sin excepted.</hi> The nature of man in every other individual person is <hi>defiled</hi> with, and debased by sin. We are <hi>every one gone astray,</hi> and are become altogether <hi>filthy or abhominable.</hi> This sets us at no small distance from him. Humane nature <hi>defiled with sin,</hi> is farther distanced from the <hi>same nature</hi> as <hi>pure and holy,</hi> in worth and excellency, than the meanest worm is from the most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Angel. Nothing but sin casts the creature out of its <hi>own place,</hi> and puts it into another distance from God than it hath by being a creature. This is a <hi>debasement unto hell,</hi> as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Thou didst debase thy self-even unto hell, Isa.</hi> 57.9. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the condescension of God unto us in Christ is set out by his regarding of us, when we <hi>were enemies unto him, Rom.</hi> 5.10. that is, whilst we were <hi>sinners,</hi> as <hi>verse</hi> 8. This had cast us into hell it self, at the most <hi>inconceivable distance</hi> from him. Yet this hindred not him, who was <hi>holy,</hi> harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, to own us as his brethren. He says not with those proud hypocrites in the Prophet, <hi>Stand farther
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50110:300"/>
off, I am holier than you</hi>; but he comes unto us, and takes us by the hand in his love, to deliver us from this condition.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, We are in this nature <hi>obnoxious unto all miseries</hi> in this world, and that which is to come. Man now is <hi>born to trouble,</hi> all the trouble that sin can deserve, or a provoked God inflict; his <hi>misery</hi> is great upon him, and that growing and endless. <hi>He,</hi> justly in himself, free from all, obnoxious to nothing that was <hi>grievous</hi> or <hi>irksome,</hi> no more than the <hi>Angels</hi> in heaven, or <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise. <hi>Poena noxam sequitur,</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and trouble follow guilt only, naturally. <hi>He did no sin, nor was there guile found in his mouth</hi>; so that God was always well pleased with him. What ever of <hi>hardship</hi> or difficulty he underwent, it was <hi>for us,</hi> and not for himself. Might not he have left us to perish in our condition, and freely enjoyed his own? We see how unapt those who are in prosperity, <hi>full and rich,</hi> are to take notice of their nearest Relations in poverty misery and distress: and who among them would do so, if it would cast them into the <hi>state</hi> of those who are already miserable? yet so it did the Lord Christ. His <hi>calling us brethren,</hi> and owning of us, made him instantly <hi>obnoxious</hi> unto all the miseries, the guilt whereof we had contracted upon our selves. The owning of his alliance unto us cost him, as it were, all he was worth; for being <hi>rich, for our sakes he became poor.</hi> He came into the prison, and into the furnace to own us. And this also renders his <hi>condescension</hi> marvellous.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, He is inconceivably <hi>distanced</hi> from us, in respect of that Place and Dignity which he was designed unto. This, as we have shewed at large, was to be <hi>Lord of all,</hi> with absolute sovereign authority over the whole Creation of God. We are <hi>poor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> who either have not <hi>bread to eat,</hi> or have no good right to eat that which we meet withall. Sin hath set the whole Creation against us. And if <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> thought it a great condescension in <hi>David</hi> on his Throne, to take notice of him being <hi>poor,</hi> who was yet the son of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> what is it in this <hi>King of Kings</hi> to own us for Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in our vile and low condition. Thoughts of his glorious Exaltation will put a lustre on his <hi>condescension</hi> in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, He is infinitely <hi>distanced</hi> from us in his Person, in respect of his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> wherein he is and was <hi>God over all, blessed for ever.</hi> He did not so <hi>become</hi> man, as to <hi>cease</hi> to be God. Though he drew a <hi>vail</hi> over his infinite Glory, yet he <hi>parted</hi> not with it. He who calls us Brethren, who suffered for us, who died for us, was God still in all these things. The <hi>condescension</hi> of Christ in this respect the Apostle in an especial manner insists upon, and improves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. That he who in himself is thus over all, eternally blessed, holy, powerful, should take us poor worms of the earth into this Relation with himself, and avow us for his brethren, as it is not easie to be believed, so it is for ever to be admired. And these are some of the heads of that <hi>distance</hi> which is between Christ and us. Notwithstanding his participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same nature with us; yet such was his <hi>love</hi> unto us, such his <hi>constancy</hi> in the pursuit of the design and purpose of his Father, in <hi>bringing many sons unto glory,</hi> that he over-looks as it were them all, and <hi>is not ashamed to call us brethren.</hi> And if he will do this because he is <hi>of one</hi> with us, because a foundation of this relation is laid in his participation of our nature; how much more will he continue so to do, when he hath perfected this <hi>Relation</hi> by the communication of his Spirit.</p>
                        <p>And this is a ground of <hi>unspeakable consolation</hi> unto Believers, with supportment in every condition. No unworthiness <hi>in them,</hi> no misery <hi>upon them,</hi> shall ever hinder the Lord Christ from <hi>owning them,</hi> and open avowing them to be his Brethren. He is a <hi>Brother born for the day of trouble,</hi> a Redeemer for the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iendless and fatherless. Let their miseries be what they will, he will be <hi>ashamed of none</hi> but of them who are <hi>ashamed of him</hi> and his ways, when persecuted and reproached. A little while will clear up great mistakes; all the world shall see at the last day <hi>whom Christ will own:</hi> and it will be a great surprisal when men shall hear him <hi>call them brethren,</hi> whom they hate, and esteem as the <hi>off-scouring of all things.</hi> He doth it indeed already by <hi>his Word,</hi> but they will not attend thereunto. But at the last day they shall both <hi>see</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> whether they will or no. And herein, I say, lies the great consolation of Believers. The world rejects them, it may be their own Relations despise them, they are perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, hated, reproached; but the Lord Christ is <hi>not ashamed of them.</hi> He will not pass by them because they are <hi>poor,</hi> and in <hi>rags,</hi> it may be reckoned as he himself was for them, among <hi>malefactors.</hi> They may see also the Wisdom, Grace, and Love of God in this matter. His great design in the Incarnation of his Son was to bring him into that condition, wherein he might <hi>naturally care</hi> for them as their Brother, that he
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50110:300"/>
might not be <hi>ashamed of them,</hi> but be sensible of their wants, their state and condition in all things, and so be always ready and meet to relieve them. Let the <hi>World</hi> now take its course, and the men thereof do their worst; let <hi>Sathan</hi> rage, and the powers of hell be stirred up against them; let them load them with reproaches and scorn, and cover them all over with the filth and dirt of their false imputations; let them bring them into rags, into dungeons, unto death; Christ comes in the midst of all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and says, Surely these are <hi>my Brethren,</hi> the <hi>children of my Father,</hi> and he becomes their Saviour. And this is a stable foundation of comfort and supportment in every condition. And are we not taught our duty also herein, namely not <hi>to be ashamed of him,</hi> or his Gospel, or any one that bears his image. The Lord Christ is now himself in that condition, that even the <hi>worst of men</hi> esteem it an honour to own him, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are no <hi>less ashamed of him,</hi> than they would have been when he was carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Cross upon his shoulders, or <hi>hanging upon the tree.</hi> For every thing that he hath in this world they are <hi>ashamed</hi>; his Gospel, his Ways, his Worship, his Spirit, his Saints, they are all of them the objects of their scorn; and in these things it is, that the Lord Christ may be truly honoured or be despised. For those thoughts which men have of his present glory, abstracting from these things, he is not concerned in them; they are all exercised about an <hi>imaginary Christ,</hi> that is inconcerned in the Word and Spirit of the Lord Jesus. These are the things when we are <hi>not to be ashamed</hi> of him. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.16.</p>
                        <p>That which remaineth of these <hi>Verses</hi> consisteth in the <hi>testimonies</hi> which the Apostle produceth out of the Old Testament in the confirmation of what he had taught and asserted. And <hi>two things</hi> are to be considered concerning them; the <hi>end</hi> for which they are produced, and the especial importance of the words contained in them. The first he mentions is from <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.22. <hi>I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I sing praise unto thee.</hi> The end why the Apostle produceth this <hi>testimony,</hi> is to confirm what he had said immediately before, namely that with respect unto his being <hi>one with the children,</hi> Christ owns them for his brethren; for this he doth expresly in this place. And we are to take notice that the Apostle in the use of these testimonies, doth not observe any <hi>order,</hi> so that <hi>one</hi> of them should confirm <hi>one part,</hi> and another part of his assertion, in the order wherein he had laid them down; it sufficeth him, that his whole intendment in all the parts of it, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in and by them all, one having a more especial respect unto <hi>one</hi> part than another. In this first it is clear, that he proves what he had immediately before af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, namely that the <hi>Lord Christ owns the children for his brethren,</hi> because of their common interest in the same nature. And there needs nothing to evince the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of this testimony, but only to shew that it is the <hi>Messiah</hi> which speaketh in that <hi>Psalm,</hi> and whose words these are, which we have done fully already in our <hi>Prolegomena.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Explication</hi> of the words themselves, we may consider the two-fold <hi>Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>or</hi> Duty that the Lord Christ takes upon himself in them; first, that he will <hi>declare the Name of God unto his brethren</hi>; and, secondly, that he <hi>would celebrate him with praises in the congregation.</hi> In the former we must enquire what is meant by the <hi>Name of God,</hi> and then how it is or was <hi>declared</hi> by Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>This expression, the <hi>Name of God</hi> is variously used. Sometimes it denotes the <hi>Being of God,</hi> God himself; sometimes his Attributes, his Excellencies or Divine Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, some one or more of them. As it is proposed unto sinners as an object for their Faith, Trust, and Love, it denotes in an especial manner his <hi>Love, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> that in himself he is good, gracious and merciful, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.10. And withall it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates what God <hi>requires</hi> of them towards whom he is so good and gracious. This <hi>Name</hi> of God is unknown to men by nature; so is the way and means whereby he will communicate his Goodness and Grace unto them. And this is the <hi>Name of God</hi> here intended, which the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> manifested unto the men given him out of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. which is the same with his <hi>declaring the Father, whom no man hath seen at any time, Joh.</hi> 1.18. This is that <hi>Name of God</hi> which the Lord Jesus Christ had experience of in his sufferings, and the manifestation whereof unto his Brethren he had procured thereby.</p>
                        <p>Hereof he says in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>I will make it known as a messenger,</hi> sent from thee and by thee. And there are two ways whereby the Lord Christ <hi>declared this Name of God.</hi> 1. In his <hi>own
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50110:301"/>
Person,</hi> and that both before and after his sufferings; for although it be mentioned here, as a work that <hi>ensued his death,</hi> yet is it not <hi>exclusive</hi> of his teachings before his suffering; because they also were built upon the supposition thereof. Thus in the dayes of his flesh, he instructed his Disciples and preached the Gospel in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in the <hi>Temple, declaring the name of God</hi> unto them. So also after his Resurrection, he <hi>conferred with his Apostles about the Kingdom of God, Acts</hi> 1. (2.) By his <hi>Spirit</hi>: and that both in the <hi>Effusion</hi> of it upon his Disciples enabling them personally to preach the Gospel unto the men of their own genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the <hi>Inspiration</hi> of some of them, enabling them to commit the Truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to writing for the Instruction of the Elect unto the end of the world. And herein doth the Apostle according unto his wonted manner, not only confirm what he had <hi>before</hi> delivered, but make way for what he had <hi>farther</hi> to instruct the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in; namely, the <hi>Prophetical Office</hi> of Christ, as he is the great Revealer of the Will of God and Teacher of the Church, which he professedly insists upon in the <hi>beginning of the next Chapter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the <hi>second part</hi> of this <hi>first</hi> Testimony, is declared farther: (1) <hi>What</hi> Christ will moreover do; <hi>He will sing praises unto God,</hi> and (2.) <hi>Where</hi> he will do it; in the <hi>midst of the Congregation.</hi> The Expression of both these is accommodated unto the Declaration of <hi>Gods Name,</hi> and <hi>praising of him in the Temple.</hi> The <hi>singing of Hymns</hi> of praise unto God in the great Congregation was <hi>then</hi> a principal part of his Worship. And in the first Expression two things are observable. (1.) What Christ undertakes to do, and that is <hi>to praise God.</hi> Now this is only Exegetical of what went before. He would <hi>praise God</hi> by <hi>declaring his name.</hi> There is no way whereby the Praise of God may be celebrated, like that of <hi>declaring his Grace,</hi> Goodness, and love unto men, whereby they may be won to believe and trust in him; whence Glory redounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. (2.) The <hi>chearfulness and alacrity</hi> of the Spirit of Christ in this work, he would do it as with <hi>Joy and Singing</hi>; with such a frame of heart, as was required in them, who were to <hi>sing the praises of God</hi> in the great Assemblies in the Temple. (2.) Where would he do this, <gap reason="foreign">

And this was a Type of the whole Church of the Elect under the <hi>New Testament.</hi> The Lord Christ in his <hi>own Person,</hi> by <hi>his Spirit, in his Apostles,</hi> and his Word, by all his Messengers unto the end of the world, setting forth the Love, Grace, Goodness and Mercy of God in him the Mediator, sets forth <hi>the praise of God in the midst of the Congregation.</hi> I shall only add, that whereas <hi>singing of hymns unto God</hi> was an especial part of the Instituted Worship under the Old Testament, to whose use these Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are accommodated, it is evident that the Lord Christ hath eminently set forth <hi>this praise of God</hi> in his Institution of Worship under the New Testament, wherein God will ever be glorified and praised. This was that which the Lord Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to do upon the Issue of his sufferings; and we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As he <hi>lands upon the shore</hi> from that Tempest wherein he was tossed in his Passion, he cryes out, <hi>I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the Congregation will I sing praise unto thee.</hi> And thus we find, that upon his Resurrection he did not immediately <hi>ascend into glory,</hi> but first <hi>declared the name of God</hi> unto his Apostles and Disciples: and then took order that by them it should be <hi>declared</hi> and published to all the world. This was upon his Spirit, and he entered not into his <hi>glorious Rest</hi> untill he had performed it.

that he should declare or preach the Gospel, and the <hi>name of God</hi> therein unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Isa.</hi> 49.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. He rejoyced therefore greatly to do it; and that,</p>
                        <p>First, Because herein consisted the <hi>Manifestation</hi> and Exaltation of the glory of God which he principally in his whole work aimed at. <hi>He came to do the will,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to set forth the glory of the Father. By and in him God designed to make his glory known; the glory of his <hi>Love</hi> and Grace in sending him; the glory of his <hi>Justice</hi> and faithfulness in his sufferings; the glory of his <hi>Mercy</hi> in the Reconciliation and Pardon of sinners; the glory of his Wisdom in the whole <hi>Mysterie of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and the glory together of all his Eternal Excellencies in bringing his Sons unto the everlasting Enjoyment of him. Now nothing of all this could have been <hi>made known,</hi> unless the Lord Christ had taken upon him to <hi>preach the Gospel</hi> and declare the name of God. Without this, what ever else he had <hi>done</hi> or <hi>suffered,</hi> had been lost as unto the interest of the glory of God. This then being that which he principally <hi>aymed</hi> at, this design must needs be greatly in his mind: He took care that so <hi>great</hi> Glory, built on so <hi>great</hi> a foundation as his Incarnation and Mediation, should not be lost. His other work was <hi>necessary,</hi> but this was a Joy of heart and soul unto him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The <hi>Salvation</hi> of the Sons to be brought unto glory, with all their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the Benefit of his sufferings depended on this work of his. How much he sought <hi>that,</hi> his whole work declares. For <hi>their</hi> sakes it was, that he came down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and was made flesh and dwelt amongst them; for <hi>their sakes</hi> did he undergo all the miseries that the world could cast upon him; for <hi>their sakes</hi> did he undergo the Curse of the Law, and wrestle with the Displeasure and Wrath of God against sin. And all this seemed as it were <hi>little</hi> unto him, for the <hi>love</hi> he bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> them, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> hard service did to him for his love unto <hi>Rachel.</hi> Now after he had done all this for them, unless he had <hi>declared the Name of God</hi> unto them in the Gospel, they could have had no Benefit by it. For if they <hi>believe</hi> not, they cannot be <hi>saved.</hi> And how should they believe without the word; and how, or whence could they hear the word, unless it had been preached unto them. They could not of themselves have known any thing of <hi>that name of God,</hi> which is their life and salvation. Some men talk of I know not what <hi>Declaration of Gods Name,</hi> Nature and Glory, by the works of Nature and Providence; but if the Lord Christ had not indeed revealed, declared and <hi>preached</hi> these things, these <hi>Disputers</hi> themselves would not have been in any other Condition than all mankind is, who are left unto those Teachers, which is most dark and miserable. The Lord Christ knew, that without his performance of this work, not one of the Sons, the <hi>conduct of whom to glory</hi> he had undertaken, could ever have been brought unto the knowledge of the name of God, or unto faith in him, or obedience unto him, which made him earnestly and heartily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage into it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Hereon depended his <hi>own Glory also.</hi> His Elect were to be gathered unto him; in, among, and over them was <hi>his glorious Kingdom</hi> to be erected. Without their <hi>Conversion</hi> unto God, this could not be done. In the state of nature they also are <hi>children of Wrath,</hi> and belong to the Kingdom of Satan. And this <hi>Declaration of the name of God,</hi> is the great Way and means of their Calling, Conversion, and Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the power of Satan into his Kingdom. The Gospel is the <hi>Rod of his strength,</hi> whereby his people are made <hi>willing in the day of his power.</hi> In brief, the gathering of his <hi>Church,</hi> the setting up of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the establishment of his <hi>Throne,</hi> the setting of the <hi>Crown</hi> upon his head, depend wholly on his <hi>declaring the name of God</hi> in the preaching of the Gospel. Seeing therefore that the <hi>glory of God</hi> which he aimed at, the <hi>salvation of the Sons</hi> which he sought for, and the <hi>Honour of his Kingdom</hi> which was promised unto him, do all depend on this Work, it is no wonder, if his <hi>Heart</hi> were full of it, and that he rejoyced to be engaged in it.</p>
                        <p>And this <hi>Frame of heart</hi> ought to be in them, who under him are called unto this work. The work it self we see is <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi>; such as the Lord Christ carried in his Eye through all his <hi>sufferings,</hi> as that whereby they were to be rendered useful unto the glory of God, and the souls of men. And by his <hi>Rejoycing</hi> to be engaged in it, he hath set a <hi>Pattern</hi> unto them, whom he calls to the same Employment. Where men undertake it for <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> for self Ends, and carnal Respects, this is not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Example of Christ, nor to serve him but their own bellies: Zeal for the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50110:302"/>
glory of God, Compassion for the souls of men, Love to the Honour and Exaltation of Christ, ought to be the principles of men in this undertaking.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the Lord Christ by declaring, that he will <hi>set forth the praise of God</hi> in the Church, manifests what is the <hi>Duty</hi> of the Church it self; namely, to <hi>praise God</hi> for the work of his Love and Grace in our Redemption by Christ Jesus. This he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to go before them in; and what he leads them unto, is by them to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in. This is indeed the very End of <hi>gathering the Church,</hi> and of all the Duties that are performed therein, and thereby. The Church is called unto the <hi>glory of the Grace of God, Ephes.</hi> 1.6. that it may be set forth in them, and by them. This is the End of the Institution of all Ordinances of Worship in the Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10. And in them do they set forth the <hi>Praises of God</hi> unto men and Angels. This is the Tendency of <hi>Prayer,</hi> the Work of <hi>Faith,</hi> the fruit of <hi>Obedience.</hi> It is a fond imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which some have fallen upon, that God is not <hi>praised</hi> in the Church for the work of Redemption, unless it be done by Words and <hi>Hymns</hi> particularly expressing it. All <hi>Praying,</hi> all <hi>Preaching,</hi> all Administration of Ordinances, all our Faith, all our Obedience if ordered aright, are nothing but giving glory to God, for his Love and Grace in Christ Jesus in a due and acceptable manner. And this is that which ought to be in our design in all our Worship of God, especially in what we perform in the Church. To <hi>set forth his praise,</hi> to <hi>declare his name,</hi> to give glory unto him by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and the profession of our faith, is the End of all we do. And this is the first <hi>Testimony</hi> produced by our Apostle.</p>
                        <p>His <hi>next</hi> is taken from <hi>Psalm.</hi> 18.2. <hi>I will put my trust in him.</hi> The whole <hi>Psalm</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally respects <hi>David,</hi> with his Streights and Deliverances: not absolutely, but as he was a <hi>Type</hi> of Christ. That he was so, the <hi>Jews</hi> cannot deny; seeing the <hi>Messiah</hi> is promised on that account under the name of <hi>David.</hi> And the close of the <hi>Psalm</hi> treating of the <hi>calling of the Gentiles,</hi> as a fruit of his deliverance from sufferings, manifest him principally to be intended. And that which the Apostle intends to prove by this Testimony, is, that he was really and truly <hi>of one</hi> with the Sons to be <hi>brought unto glory</hi>: and that he doth from hence, inasmuch as he was made and brought into that condition, wherein it was necessary for him to <hi>trust in God,</hi> and act in that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him, which the <hi>nature of man</hi> whilest exposed unto Troubles doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibility require: Had he been <hi>only</hi> God, this could have been spoken of him. Neither is the <hi>nature of Angels</hi> exposed to such Dangers and Troubles, as to make it necessary for them to <hi>betake themselves</hi> unto Gods Protection with respect thereunto. And this the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, used by the <hi>Psalmist</hi> properly signifies; <hi>to betake a mans self</hi> unto the Care and Protection of another, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> This then the condition of the Lord Christ <hi>required,</hi> and this he did perform in all Troubles and Difficulties, that he had contended withal; <hi>He put his trust in God,</hi> as <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.8, 9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.19. And this evinceth him to have been truly and really <hi>of one with the children,</hi> his brethren; seeing it was his Duty no less than it is theirs, to depend on God in troubles and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses; And in vain doth <hi>Schlictingius</hi> hence endeavour to prove, that Christ was the <hi>Son of God by Grace only,</hi> because he is said to <hi>depend</hi> on him, which if he had been God by nature he could not do. True, if he had been <hi>God only</hi>; but the Apostle is now proving, <hi>that he was man also</hi>; like unto us in all things sin only excepted. And <hi>as such</hi> his duty it was, in all streights to betake himself by faith unto the care and protection of God. And some things may hence also be briefly observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the Lord Christ the <hi>Captain of our salvation, was exposed in the dayes of his flesh, unto great Difficulties, Anxiety of mind, Dangers and Troubles.</hi> This is included in what he here affirms about <hi>putting his trust in God.</hi> And they were all <hi>typified</hi> out by the great sufferings of <hi>David</hi> before he came unto his Kingdom. In the consideration of the <hi>sufferings of Christ,</hi> men commonly fix their thoughts solely unto his <hi>Death.</hi> And indeed therein was a Recapitulation of all that he had before undergone, with an addition of the Wrath of God. But yet neither are the <hi>sufferings of his Life</hi> to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded. Such they were as made his whole Pilgrimage on the earth <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>dolorous.</hi> There was upon him a confluence of every thing that is evil or trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some unto <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> And herein is he <hi>principally</hi> our Example; at least so far, that we should think no kind of sufferings <hi>strange</hi> unto us.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord Christ in all his Perplexities and troubles, betook himself unto the protection of God, trusting in him.</hi> See <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.7, 8. And he alwayes made an open Profession of this trust, insomuch as that his Enemies reproached him with it in his greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50110:302"/>
                           <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.39. But this was his Course, this was his Refuge, wherein at length he had <hi>blessed and glorious</hi> success.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>He both suffered and trusted as our Head and President.</hi> What he did in both these kinds he calls us unto. As he did, so must we, undergo Perplexities and Dangers in the course of our Pilgrimage. The Scripture abounds with Instructions unto this purpose, and Experience confims it. And Professors of the Gospel do but indulge unto <hi>pleasing dreams,</hi> when they fancy any other condition in this world unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. They would not be willing, I suppose to purchase it, at the price of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto Jesus Christ. And he is a <hi>President</hi> unto us in trusting, as well as in suffering. As he betook himself unto the protection of God, so should we do also; and we shall have the same <hi>blessed success</hi> with him.</p>
                        <p>There remains yet <hi>one Testimony</hi> more, which we shall briefly pass through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of. <hi>Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</hi> It is taken from <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.18. That it was a Prophecy of Christ which is there insisted on, we have proved at large in our <hi>Prolegomena</hi>; so that we need not here again farther to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course that matter. That which the Apostle aims at in the <hi>citation</hi> of this Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is farther to confirm the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> in nature, and the <hi>Relation</hi> that ensues thereupon, between the <hi>Captain of salvation,</hi> and the <hi>Sons</hi> to be brought unto glory. Now as this is such, that thereon he calls them <hi>Brethren,</hi> and came into the same condition of <hi>trouble</hi> with them, so they are by the Grant and Appointment of God, <hi>his children.</hi> Being of the same nature with them, and so meet to become a <hi>common Parent</hi> unto them all, God by an act of Soveraign Grace, gives them unto him for <hi>his children.</hi> This is the aim of the Apostle, in the use of this Testimony unto his present purpose. In the words themselves we may consider,</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>That God gives all the Sons that are to be brought unto glory, to Jesus Christ.</hi> The Lord hath <hi>given them unto me. Thine they were,</hi> saith he, <hi>and thou gavest them unto me, John</hi> 17.6. God having separated them, as his peculiar Portion in the Eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of his Will, gives them unto the Son to <hi>take care</hi> of them, that they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and brought unto the glory that he had designed for them. And this work he testifies that he undertook, so that none of them shall be lost, but that what ever <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> they may pass through, he <hi>will raise them up at the last day,</hi> and give them an entrance into Life and Immortality.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>He gives them to him as his children to be provided for</hi>; and to have an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance purchased for them, that they may become <hi>Heirs of God and Coheirs with himself. Adam</hi> was their first Parent by nature; and in him they lost that Inheritance, which they might have expected by the Law of their Creation. They are threrefore given to the <hi>second Adam</hi> as their Parent by Grace, to have an inheritance provided for them, which accordingly he hath purchased with the Price of his Blood.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, That <hi>the Lord Christ is satisfied with, and rejoyceth in the portion given him of his Father,</hi> his Children his Redeemed ones. This the manner of the Expression in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us in. <hi>Behold I and the children</hi>; though he considers himself and them at that time <hi>as signs and wonders to be spoken against.</hi> He rejoyceth in his Portion, and doth not call it <hi>Chabul,</hi> as <hi>Hiram</hi> did the Cities given him of <hi>Solomon, because they displeased him.</hi> He is not only <hi>satisfied</hi> upon the sight of the <hi>travail of his soul, Isa.</hi> 53.11. but <hi>glorieth</hi> also, that the <hi>lines are fallen unto him in pleasantnesses, that he hath a goodly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, Psal.</hi> 16.6. Such was his Love, such was his Grace, for we in our selves are a people not to be desired.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the Lord Jesus assumes the children given him of his Father into the same condition with himself, both as to Life and Eternity. I and the children</hi>; as <hi>he is,</hi> so are they; His lot is their lot; his God is their God, his Father their Father; and his Glory shall be theirs.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>From the Context</hi> of the words in the Prophet, expressing the separation of Christ and the <hi>Children</hi> from the world, and all the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> therein combined together in the pursuit of their sinful courses; we are taught, <hi>that Christ and believers are in the same Covenant, confederate to trust in God in difficulties and troubles, in opposition unto all the confederacies of the men of the world, for their carnal security.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus by this <hi>Triple Testimony</hi> hath the Apostle both confirmed his foregoing As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion; and farther manifested the Relation that is between the children to be brought unto Glory, and the Captain of their salvation, whereby it became <hi>righteous</hi> that he should suffer for them, and <hi>meet</hi> that they should enjoy the benefit of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; which he more fully expresseth in the following <hi>Verses.</hi>

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Work</hi> which God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed him unto, and the <hi>Ends</hi> which he had to accomplish thereby.

                           </gap>. Thirdly, The <hi>latter Jews</hi> suppose that this <hi>Angel of death</hi> takes away the life of every man, even of those who die a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death. And hereby as they express the <hi>old faith of the Church,</hi> that <hi>death is poenal,</hi> and that it came upon all for sin through the temptation of Sathan, so also they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>bondage</hi> that they themselves are in for fear of death all their days. For when a man is ready to die, they say the <hi>Angel of death</hi> appears to him in a terrible manner, with a sword drawn in his hand. From thence drops I know not what poison into him, whereon he dies. Hence they wofully houl, lament, and rend their garments upon the death of their friends. And they have composed a prayer for themselves against this terrour. Because also of this their being <hi>slain by the Angel of death,</hi> they hope and pray that their <hi>death</hi> may be an expiation for all their sins. Here lies the <hi>sting of death,</hi> mentioned by the Apostle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. Hence they have a long story in their <hi>Midrash,</hi> or <hi>mystical Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> on the last section of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> about <hi>Samaels</hi> coming to take away the life of <hi>Moses</hi>; whom he repelled and drove
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50110:304"/>
away with the Rod that had the <hi>Shem Hamphorash</hi> written in it. And the like story they have in a book about the acts of <hi>Moses,</hi> which <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> rejects on <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.20. This hand of <hi>Sathan</hi> in death, manifesting it to be <hi>poenal,</hi> is that which keeps them in <hi>bondage</hi> and fear all their days. Fourthly, they suppose that this <hi>Angel of death</hi> hath power over men even <hi>after death.</hi> One horrible penalty they fancy in particular that he inflicts on them, which is set down by <hi>Elias</hi> in his <hi>Tishbi</hi> in <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, out of the <hi>Midrash</hi> of <hi>Rabbi Isaac the son of Parnaer</hi>; for when a man, as they say, departs out of this world, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>the Angel of death</hi> comes and <hi>sits upon his grave.</hi> And he brings with him a <hi>Chain, partly of iron, partly of fire</hi>; and making the soul to return into body, <hi>he breaks the bones,</hi> and torments variously both body and soul for a season. This is their <hi>Purgatory</hi>; and the best of their hopes are, that their <hi>punishment</hi> after this life shall not be <hi>eternal.</hi> And this various interest of <hi>Sathan</hi> in the <hi>power of death,</hi> both keeps them in <hi>dismal bondage</hi> all their days, and puts them upon the invention of several ways for their deliverance. Thus one of their solemn Prayers on the day of Expiation is to be delivered from <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or this <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the devil in their graves</hi>; to which purpose also they offer a <hi>Cock</hi> unto him for his pacification. And their prayer to this purpose in their <hi>Berachoth</hi> is this, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>That it may please thee, (good Lord) to deliver us from evil Decrees or Laws, from poverty, from contempt, from all kind of punishments, from the judgment of hell, and from beating in the grave,</hi> by the Angel of death. And this supposition is in like manner admitted by the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who have also this prayer, <hi>Deus noster libera nos ab Angelo interrogante tormento sepulchri, &amp; à via mala.</hi> And many such lewd imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are they now given up unto, proceeding from their ignorance of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God. But yet from these apprehensions of theirs, we may see what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle intended in this expression, calling the devil him that had the <hi>power of death.</hi>

                        <p>In former <hi>Verses,</hi> as was shewed, the Apostle declared the necessity that there was on the part of God, intending to <hi>bring many sons unto glory,</hi> to constitute such an <hi>union</hi> between <hi>them</hi> and the <hi>Captain of their salvation,</hi> as that it might be just for him to suffer in their stead. In these he proceeds to manifest in particular what that Nature is, in the <hi>common participation</hi> whereof their <hi>union</hi> designed did consist, wherein they were <hi>all of one</hi>; and what were the especial reasons why the Lord Christ was made partaker of that nature. This coherence of these Verses <hi>Chrysostom</hi> briefly gives us
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50110:305"/>
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>; <hi>Having shewed the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood</hi> (that was between Christ and the children) <hi>he lays down the causes of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation</hi>; and what they are, we shall find here expressed.</p>
                        <p>There are sundry things which the Apostle supposeth in these words, as known unto, and granted by the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> As, first, that the <hi>Devil had the power of death.</hi> Secondly, That on this account men were <hi>filled with fear of it,</hi> and led a life full of anxiety and trouble by reason of that fear. Thirdly, That a deliverance from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was to be effected by the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Fourthly, That the way whereby he was to do this was by his <hi>suffering.</hi> All which, as they are contained in the first Promise, so that they were allowed of by the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of old, we have fully proved else-where. And by all these doth the Apostle yield a reason of his former concession, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was for a <hi>little while made lower than the Angels,</hi> the Causes and Ends whereof he here declares. There are in the words,</p>
                        <p>First, A supposition of a <hi>two-fold state</hi> and condition of the <hi>children</hi> to be brought unto glory,</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>Natural,</hi> or their natural state and condition, they were all of them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>partakers of flesh and bloud: For as much then as the children were partakers of flesh and blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Moral,</hi> their moral state and condition; they were <hi>obnoxious unto death,</hi> as it is poenal for sin, and in <hi>great bondage</hi> through fear of it: <hi>them who through fear of death were all their life time subject unto bondage.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, There is a double inference with respect unto this supposition, on the part of Christ, the Captain of salvation.</p>
                        <p>First, As to their <hi>natural condition,</hi> that he <hi>did partake of it,</hi> he was so to do; <hi>He himself also did partake of the same.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, As to their <hi>moral condition,</hi> he <hi>freed</hi> them from it: <hi>and deliver them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The <hi>means</hi> whereby he did this, or this was to be done, evidencing the necessity of his participation with them in their condition of <hi>nature,</hi> that he might relieve them from their condition of <hi>trouble</hi>; he <hi>did it by death: that by death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The immediate Effect of his death, tending unto their <hi>delivery</hi> and <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and that is the <hi>destruction of the devil,</hi> as to his power over and interest in death as poenal, whereof their deliverance is an infallible consequent: <hi>and destroy him, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the first place the Apostle expresseth, as by way of supposition, the <hi>natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the children, that is the children whom God designed to bring unto glory; those who were given unto Christ, they were in <hi>common partakers of flesh and blood.</hi> I shall not stay to remove the conceit of some, who yet are not a few among the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> who refer those words unto the participation of the <hi>flesh and blood of Christ in the Sacrament,</hi> whereunto also, as we observed, the <hi>Aethiopick Version</hi> gives countenance. For not only is there not any thing in the expression that inclines unto such an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, but also it enervates the whole design of the Apostles discourse and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as from the former consideration of it doth appear. <hi>Flesh and blood</hi> are by an usual <hi>Synecdoche</hi> put for the <hi>whole humane nature</hi>; not as though by <hi>blood</hi> the <hi>soul</hi> was intended, because the life is said to be in it, as not acting without it; but this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is used, because it is not <hi>humane nature</hi> as absolutely considered, but as <hi>mortal, passible, subject</hi> unto infirmities and death it self, that is intended. And it is no more than if he had said, the children <hi>were men subject unto death.</hi> For he gives his reason herein, why the Lord Christ was made <hi>a man subject unto death.</hi> That he and the children should be of <hi>one nature</hi> he had shewed before; for as much then as this was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the children, that they were all partakers of humane nature, liable to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, sorrow, and death; he was so also. And this is thus expressed to set forth the love and condescension of Jesus Christ, as will afterward appear.</p>
                        <p>The second thing in these words is the <hi>moral condition</hi> of the children; and there are sundry things, partly intimated, partly expressed in the description that is here given us of it; as, 1. Their estate <hi>absolutely</hi> considered, they were <hi>subject to death.</hi> 2. The <hi>consequences</hi> of that estate. 1. It wrought <hi>fear</hi> in them. 2. That fear brought them into <hi>bondage.</hi> 3. The continuance of that condition, <hi>it was for the whole course of their lives.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, It is implied that they were <hi>subject,</hi> obnoxious unto, guilty of death, and that as it was <hi>poenal,</hi> due to sin, as contained in the <hi>curse of the Law</hi>; which what it comprehendeth, and how far it is extended is usually declared. On this supposition lies the whole weight of the Mediation of Christ. The children to be brought unto glory were <hi>obnoxious unto death,</hi> the curse and wrath of God therein, which he came to deliver them from.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="265" facs="tcp:50110:305"/>Secondly, The first effect and consequent of this <hi>obnoxiousness</hi> unto death concurring unto their state and condition is, that they were filled <hi>with fear of it: for fear of death. Fear is a perturbation of mind, arising from the apprehension of a future imminent evil.</hi> And the greater this evil is, the greater will the perturbation of the mind be; provided the apprehension of it be answerable. The <hi>fear of death</hi> then here intended is that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of mind which men have in the expectation of death to be inflicted on them, as a punishment due unto their sins. And this apprehension is common to all men, arising from a general presumption that death is <hi>poenal,</hi> and that it is the judgment of God that they which commit sin are <hi>worthy of death,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. <hi>chap.</hi> 2.15. But it is cleared and confirmed by the <hi>Law,</hi> whose known sentence it is, <hi>The soul that sinneth shall die.</hi> And the troublesome expectation of the event of this apprehension is the <hi>fear of death</hi> here intended. And according unto the means that men have to come unto the knowledge of the righteousness of God, are, or ought to be their apprehensions of the evil that is in death. But even those who had lost all clear knowledge of the <hi>consequents of death natural,</hi> or the dissolution of their present mortal condition, yet on a <hi>confused apprehension</hi> of its being <hi>poenal,</hi> always esteemed it, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the <hi>most dreadful</hi> of all things that are so unto humane nature. And in some this is heightned and increased, until it come to be <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as our Apostle speaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.27. <hi>A fearful expectation of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</hi> And this is the second thing that is in this description of the estate and condition of the children to be brought unto glory; being obnoxious unto the <hi>sentence</hi> of death, they could not but <hi>live in fear</hi> of the <hi>execution</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, They are by this means brought into <hi>bondage.</hi> The troublesome expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death as <hi>poenal,</hi> brings them into <hi>bondage</hi>; into the nature whereof we must a little enquire. Sundry things concur to make any state a state of <hi>bondage</hi>; as, 1. That it be <hi>involuntary</hi>; no man is in <hi>bondage</hi> by his will, that which a man chuseth is not bondage unto him. A man that would have his <hi>ear bored,</hi> though he were <hi>always a servant</hi> was never in bondage, for he enjoyed the condition that pleased him. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly all bondage is involuntary. 2. <hi>Bondage</hi> ingenerates strong desires after, and puts men on all manner of attempts for liberty. <hi>Yokes gall,</hi> and make them on whom they are, desire ease. So long as men are sensible of bondage, which is <hi>against nature,</hi> (for that which is not so is not bondage) they will desire and labour for liberty. When some in the <hi>Roman Senate</hi> asked an Ambassador of the <hi>Priernates,</hi> after they were overthrown in battel, if they granted them peace, how they would keep it, what peace they should have with them? He answered, <hi>Si bonam dederitis, fidam &amp; perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuam; si malam haud diuturnam.</hi> Whereat when some in the <hi>Senate</hi> stormed, as if he had threatned them with War and Rebellion, the wiser sort commended him, as one that spake <hi>like a man</hi> and a free-man; adding as their reason, <hi>An credi posse ullum popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, aut hominem denique in ea conditione, cujus eam poeniteat, diutius quam necesse sit mansurum, Liv. lib.</hi> 8. So certain it is, that <hi>bondage</hi> wearieth and stirreth up restless desires in <hi>all,</hi> endeavours in <hi>some</hi> after liberty. 3. Bondage <hi>perplexeth</hi> the mind. It ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from fear, the greatest perturbation of the mind, and is attended with weariness and distrust, all which are perplexing. 4. Where bondage is compleat, it lies in a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency unto <hi>future</hi> and greater evils. Such is the bondage of <hi>condemned malefactors,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the day of execution; such is the bondage of <hi>Sathan,</hi> who is kept in <hi>chains of darkness</hi> for the judgment of the great day. And all these things concur in the <hi>bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> here intended; which is, a dejected troublesome state and condition of mind, arising from the apprehension and fear of death to be inflicted, and their disability in whom it is to avoid it, attended with <hi>fruitless desires</hi> and vain attempts to be delivered from it, and to escape the evil feared. And this is the condition of <hi>sinners</hi> out of Christ, whereof there are various degrees, answerable unto their convictions. For the Apostle treats not here of <hi>mens</hi> being servants unto sin, which is <hi>voluntary</hi>; but of their sense of the guilt of sin, which is wrought in them even whether they will or no; and by any means they would cast off the <hi>yoke</hi> of it, though by none are they able so to do; for,</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, They are said to <hi>continue in this estate all their lives.</hi> Not that they were always perplexed with this bondage, but that they could never be utterly freed from it. For the Apostle doth not say, that they were thus <hi>in bondage</hi> all their days, but that they were <hi>obnoxious and subject unto it.</hi> They had no ways to free or deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from it, but that at any time they might righteously be brought under its
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50110:306"/>
power; and the more they cast off the thoughts of it, the more they increased their danger. This was the estate of the children, whose deliverance was undertaken by the Lord Christ, the Captain of their salvation. And we may hence observe, that,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>All sinners are subject unto death, as it is poenal.</hi> The first sentence reacheth them all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. And thence are they said <hi>by nature to be children of wrath, Ephes.</hi> 2.3. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto death to be inflicted in a way of <hi>wrath</hi> and revenge for sin. This <hi>passeth upon all, in as much as all have sinned, Rom.</hi> 5.12. This all men see and know; but all do not sufficiently consider what is contained in the sentence of death, and very few how it may be avoided. Most men look on death as the <hi>common lot</hi> and condition of mankind, upon the account of their frail natural condition; as though it belonged to the <hi>natural condition</hi> of the children, and not the <hi>moral</hi>; and were a <hi>consequent</hi> of their <hi>being,</hi> and not the <hi>demerit</hi> of their sin. They consider not, that although the principles of our nature are in themselves subject unto a dissolution, yet if, we had kept the Law of our Creation, it had been prevented by the power of God, engaged to continue life during our obedience. Life and obedience were to be commensurate, until temporal obedience ended in life eternal. <hi>Death is poenal,</hi> and its being common unto all, hinders not but that it is the <hi>punishment</hi> of every one. How it is changed unto Believers by the <hi>death of Christ,</hi> shall be afterward declared. In the mean time all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is condemned, as soon as born. Life is a reprieve, a suspension of execution. If during that time a pardon be not effectually sued out, the sentence will be executed according to the severity of justice. Under this Law are men now born, this <hi>yoke</hi> have they pulled on themselves by their apostasie from God. Neither is it to any purpose to <hi>repine</hi> against it, or to conflict with it; there is but one way of delivery.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Fear of death,</hi> as it is poenal, is <hi>inseparable from sin, before the sinner be delivered by the death of Christ.</hi> They were in fear of death. There is a <hi>fear of death</hi> that is <hi>natural,</hi> and inseparable from our present condition; that is but natures aversation of its own dissolution. And this hath various degrees, occasioned by the differences of <hi>mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural constitution,</hi> and other accidental occurrences and occasions: so that some seem to fear death <hi>too much,</hi> and others <hi>not at all</hi>; I mean of those who are freed from it, as it is in the curse and under the power of Sathan. But this difference is from <hi>occasions</hi> forreign and accidental; there is in all naturally the same aversation of it. And this is a <hi>guiltless infirmity,</hi> like our weariness, and sickness, inseparably annexed unto the condition of mortality. But sinners in their <hi>natural state</hi> fear death as it is <hi>poenal,</hi> as an issue of the curse, as under the power of Sathan, as a dreadful entrance into eternal ruine. There are indeed a <hi>thousand ways</hi> whereby this fear is for a season stifled in the minds of men. Some live in <hi>brutish ignorance,</hi> never receiving any full conviction of Sin, Judgment, or Eternity. Some put off the thoughts of their present and future estate, resolving to shut their eyes and rush into it, when as they can no longer avoid it. <hi>Fear</hi> presents it self unto them as the fore-runner of death, but they avoid the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and leave themselves to the power of death it self. Some please themselves with <hi>vain hopes</hi> of deliverance, though well they know not how, nor why they should be partakers of it. But let men fore-go these <hi>helpless shifts,</hi> and suffer their own <hi>innate light</hi> to be excited with such means of conviction as they do enjoy, and they will quickly find what a judgment there is made in their own souls concerning <hi>death to come,</hi> and what effects it will produce. They will conclude that it is the <hi>judgment of God, that they which commit sin are worthy of death, Rom.</hi> 1.32. and then that their <hi>own consciences</hi> do accuse and condemn them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. Whence unavoidably <hi>fear, dread,</hi> and <hi>terrour</hi> will seize upon them. And then,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Fear of death, as poenal, renders the minds of men obnoxious unto bondage:</hi> which what it is we have in part before declared. <hi>It is a state of trouble,</hi> which men dislike, but cannot avoid. It is a <hi>poenal disquietment</hi> arising from sense of future misery: fain would men quit themselves of it, but are not able; there is a <hi>chain</hi> of God in it, not to be broken; men may <hi>gall themselves</hi> with it, but cannot remove it: and if God take it from them without granting them a lawful release and delivery, it is to their farther misery. And this is in some measure or other the portion of every one that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of sin, before they are freed by the Gospel. And some have disputed what <hi>degrees</hi> of it are necessary before believing. But what is <hi>necessary for any one to attain unto,</hi> is his duty. But this bondage can be the <hi>duty</hi> of no man, because it is <hi>involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</hi> It will follow conviction of sin, but it is no mans duty; rather it is such an <hi>effect of the Law</hi> as every one is to free himself from, so soon as he may, in a right way and manner. This estate then befalls men whether they will or no. And this is so, if
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50110:306"/>
we take bondage <hi>passively,</hi> as it affects the soul of the sinner; which the Apostle seems to intend, by placing it as an effect of the fear of death; take it <hi>actively,</hi> and it is no more than the sentence of the Law, which works and causeth it in the soul; and so all sinners are inevitably obnoxious unto it. And this estate, as we observed, fills men with <hi>desires</hi> after, and puts them upon various attempts for deliverance. Some desire only <hi>present ease,</hi> and they commonly with-draw themselves from it, by giving up themselves wholly unto their <hi>hearts lusts,</hi> and therein to <hi>Atheism,</hi> which God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in his righteous judgment gives them up unto, knowing that the day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherein their present woful <hi>temporal relief</hi> will be recompenced with eternal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. Some look <hi>forwards</hi> unto what is to come, and accordingly to their light and assistance variously apply themselves to seek relief. Some do it by a righteousness of their own, and in the pursuit thereof also there are ways innumerable, not now to be insisted on; and some do it <hi>by Christ,</hi> which how it is by him effected, the Apostle in the next place declares.</p>
                        <p>Two things, as was shewed, are affirmed of the Lord Christ, in consequence unto the premised supposition of the <hi>childrens being partakers of flesh and bloud,</hi> and of their <hi>obnoxiousness unto death,</hi> and to <hi>bondage.</hi> 1. That of their <hi>natural condition,</hi> he <hi>himself par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took.</hi> 2. That from their <hi>moral condition,</hi> he delivered them; which that he might do, it was necessary that he should partake of the other.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>He himself did likewise partake of the same.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>likewise,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>.</note> in <hi>like manner,</hi> doth denote such a similitude as is consistent with a <hi>specifical identity.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chrysostom</hi> from hence urgeth the <hi>Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Valentinians,</hi> who denyed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of Christ, seeing that he partook of it <hi>in like manner</hi> with us, that is, truly and really, even as we do. But yet the word, by force of its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, doth intimate some <hi>disparity</hi> and difference. He took part of humane nature <hi>really</hi> as we do, and <hi>almost in like manner with us.</hi> For there were two differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>his</hi> being partaker of humane nature and <hi>ours.</hi> First, In that we subsist <hi>singly</hi> in that nature: but he took his portion in this nature into subsistence with himself in the Person of the Son of God. Secondly, This nature in us is attended with many <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> that follow the <hi>individual</hi> persons that are partakers of it; in him it was free from them all. And this the Apostle also intimates in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, changing his expression from that whereby he declared the <hi>common interest</hi> of the children in the same nature, which is <hi>every way equal</hi> and alike. The whole is, <hi>That he took his own Portion,</hi> in his own Manner, unto himself.</p>
                        <p>And this Observation removes what is hence objected against the Deity of Christ. <hi>Cum Christus</hi> (saith <hi>Schlictingius</hi>) <hi>hominum mortalium &amp; fragilium dux &amp; fautor sit, propterea is non Angelus aliquis, multo verò minus ipse Deus summus qui solus immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem habet, sed homo suo tempore malis, &amp; variis calamitatibus obnoxius esse debuit.</hi> It is true, it appears from hence, that <hi>Christ ought to be a man,</hi> subject to sufferings and death, and not an <hi>Angel,</hi> as the Apostle farther declares in the next verse; but that he ought <hi>not to be God</hi> it doth not appear. <hi>As God</hi> indeed he could not die, but if he who was God had not taken part of <hi>flesh and bloud, God could not have redeemed his Church with his own blood.</hi> But this is the perpetual <hi>Paralogism</hi> of these men. Because Christ is asserted to have been <hi>truly a man,</hi> therefore he is <hi>not God</hi>; which is to deny the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and the whole <hi>mystery</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>He proceeds with his exceptions against the application of these words unto the <hi>incarnation</hi> of the Lord Christ, the sum whereof is, that the words <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>denote an universal conformity, or specifick identity between Christ and the children,</hi> not only as to the <hi>Essence, but also as to all other concernments of humane nature, or else no benefit could redound unto them from what he did or suffered.</hi> But, 1. The words do not assert any such thing, as hath been declared. 2. It is not <hi>true.</hi> The children were partakers of <hi>humane nature,</hi> either by <hi>Creation</hi> out of the dust of the earth, as <hi>Adam</hi>; or by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural generation.</hi> The Lord Christ was <hi>conceived of a Virgin</hi> by the power of the Holy Ghost; and yet the benefit redounds unto the children. It is evident then, that the similitude urged by the Apostle is confined to the <hi>substance of flesh and bloud,</hi> or the Essence of Humane Nature, and is not to be extended unto the personal concernments of the one or the other; nor the way whereby they became partakers of the same nature. Nor is the argument for the <hi>Incarnation of Christ</hi> taken meerly from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in this verse; but whereas he had before proved him to be above, and before the Angels, even <hi>God over all,</hi> and here intimating his existence antecedent to his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of flesh and blood, his <hi>Incarnation</hi> doth necessarily ensue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="268" facs="tcp:50110:307"/>The necessity of this Incarnation of Christ, with respect unto the End of it, hath before been declared, evinced and confirmed. We shall now stay only a little to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi> the Love, Grace and Mysterie of it. And we see here,</p>
                        <p n="iv">IV. <hi>That the Lord Christ out of his inexpressible Love, willingly submitted himself unto every condition of the Children to be saved by him, and to every thing in every condition of them, sin only excepted.</hi> They being of flesh and blood which must be attended with many infirmities, and exposed unto all sorts of Temptations and miseries, he himself would also <hi>partake of the same.</hi> His delight was of <hi>Old in the Sons of men, Prov.</hi> 8.30. and his <hi>heart</hi> was full of thoughts of Love towards them; and that alone put him on this Resolution, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. When God refused <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Burnt-Offerings</hi> as insufficient to make the Attonement required, and the matter was rolled on his hand alone, it was a Joy unto him that he had Body prepared, wherein he might discharge his work, although he knew what he had to do and suffer therein, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.8, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8, 9. He rejoyced to do the will of God, in taking the <hi>body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him,</hi> because the children were partakers of flesh and blood. Though he was in the <hi>form of God,</hi> equal unto him, yet that Mind, that Love, that Affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us was in him, that to be <hi>like unto us,</hi> and thereby to <hi>save us,</hi> he <hi>emptyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> and took on him the <hi>form of a servant,</hi> our form, and became like unto us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7, 8. He would be <hi>like unto us,</hi> that he might make us <hi>like unto himself</hi>; he would take our flesh, that he might give unto his Spirit. He would <hi>joyn himself</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and become <hi>one flesh</hi> with us, that we might be joyned unto him, and become <hi>one Spirit</hi> with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. And as this was a Fruit of his <hi>Eternal antecedent Love,</hi> so it is a spring of consequent Love. When <hi>Eve</hi> was brought unto <hi>Adam</hi> after she was taken out of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.23. to manifest the ground of that Affection which was to be alwayes between them, he sayes of her, <hi>this is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh.</hi> And by this condescention of Christ, saith the Apostle, are we <hi>members of his body and of his flesh, and of his bones, Ephes.</hi> 5.30. Whence he infers, that <hi>he loves and nourisheth his Church, as a man doth his own flesh.</hi> And how should this inexpressible Love of Christ constrain us to <hi>love him</hi> and to live unto him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, 15. As also to labour to be <hi>like unto</hi> him, wherein all our <hi>blessedness</hi> consisteth, seeing for that end he was willing to be like unto us, whence all <hi>his troubles</hi> and sufferings arose. Here also we see that,</p>
                        <p n="v">V. <hi>It was only in flesh and blood the substance and essence of humane nature, and not in our personal infirmities that the Lord Christ was made like unto us.</hi> He took to himself the <hi>nature</hi> of all men, and not the <hi>Person</hi> of any man. We have not only <hi>humane nature</hi> in common, but we have every one particular Infirmities and weaknesses fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that nature, as existing in our sinful persons. Such are the <hi>sicknesses</hi> and pains of our bodies from inward distempers; and the disorder of the Passions of our minds. Of these the Lord Christ did not <hi>partake</hi>; It was not <hi>needful,</hi> it was not <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> that he should do so; not <hi>needful,</hi> because he could provide for their cure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out assuming them, not <hi>possible,</hi> for they can have no place in a nature innocent and holy. And therefore he took our nature; not by an immediate <hi>new creation</hi> out of nothing, or of the dust of the earth like <hi>Adam</hi>; for if so, though he might have been <hi>like unto us,</hi> yet he would have been <hi>no kin</hi> to us, and so could not have been our <hi>Goel</hi> to whom the <hi>right of Redemption</hi> did belong; nor by <hi>natural Generation,</hi> which would have rendered our nature in him obnoxious to the sin and punishment of <hi>Adam:</hi> but by a <hi>miraculous conception</hi> of a Virgin, whereby he had truly our nature, yet not subject <hi>on its own account,</hi> unto any one of those evils, whereunto it is liable as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated from <hi>Adam</hi> in an ordinary course: And thus though he was joyned unto us in our nature; yet as he was <hi>holy, harmless and undefiled in that nature,</hi> he was <hi>separate from sinners, Heb.</hi> 7.25. So that although our nature <hi>suffered</hi> more in his Person, then it was capable of in the Person of any meer man, yet not being debased by any sinful imperfection, it was alwayes <hi>excellent,</hi> beautiful and glorious. And then,</p>
                        <p n="vi">VI. <hi>That the Son of God should take part in humane nature with the children, is the greatest and most admirable effect of Divine Love, Wisdom and Grace.</hi> So our Apostle proposeth it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. A <hi>Mysterie</hi> which the Angels with all diligence <hi>desire to look into,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11, 12. See <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Atheists</hi> scoff at it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded

                           <hi>Christians</hi> deny it, but the Angels adore it, the Church professeth it, Believers find the comfort and benefit of it. The <hi>Heavens</hi> indeed declare the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and the Firmament sheweth his handy work, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.1. <hi>And the invisible things of God from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, Rom.</hi> 1.20. In particular man himself is fearfully and wonderfully made. These works of Gods Power and Providence do greatly manifest the glory of his Wisdom, Omnipotency and Goodness; and are like the <hi>light</hi> which was created the first day at the beginning of all things, as we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But in this instance of <hi>assuming humane nature into Personal su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

And this surely was not done, but for the <hi>greatest End</hi>; that can be conceived, and such is the salvation of sinners.</p>
                        <p>But we must proceed with our Apostle; and he gives the Reason and End of this wonderful Dispensation. The <hi>End</hi> is, the Delivery of the children from the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before described: And first the <hi>means</hi> whereby he wrought and brought about this End is proposed unto us; <hi>by death,</hi> he was to do it by <hi>death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That by death he might deliver them</hi>; that is by his <hi>own death.</hi> This as it is placed, as one <hi>principal End</hi> of his being made partaker of flesh and blood, so it is also the <hi>means</hi> of the farther end aimed at, namely, the <hi>delivery of the children</hi> out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition expressed. Some Translations add, <hi>by his own death,</hi> which is evidently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, though it be not <hi>literally</hi> in the Text; the <hi>death</hi> which he underwent in the nature of man, whereof he was partaker. <hi>His Death</hi> was the means of delivering <hi>them from death.</hi> Some distinguish between Death in the first place, which Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, and that death in the close of the Verse, which the children are said to be in <hi>fear</hi> of; for this latter they say is more extensive than the former, as comprizing death eternal also. But there doth not any thing in the Text appear to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that <hi>the Captain of Salvation</hi> by death of <hi>one kind,</hi> should deliver the <hi>children</hi> from that of another. Neither will the Apostles discourse well bear such a <hi>suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For if he might have <hi>freed the children</hi> by any way or means, but only by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>that</hi> which was due unto them for sin, whence could arise that indispensible necessity which he pleads for by so many considerations of his being made like unto them, seeing without the participation of their nature which he urgeth, he might have done any other thing for their good and benefit, but only suffer what was due to them. And if it be said, that without this <hi>participation of their nature</hi> he could not <hi>dye,</hi> which it was necessary that he should do; I desire to know why, if <hi>the death</hi> which he was to undergo, was not <hi>that death</hi> which they were obnoxious unto, <hi>for whom he dyed,</hi> how could it be any way more <hi>beneficial</hi> unto them, than any thing else which he might have done for them, although he had not dyed. There is no ground then to pretend such an <hi>Amphibologie</hi> in the words as that which some contend for. Now as we observed before, the Death of Christ is here placed in the midst, as the <hi>End</hi> of one thing, and the <hi>Means</hi> or cause of another; the End of his own <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> of the <hi>Childrens Deliverance</hi>; from the first we may see,</p>
                        <p n="vii">VII. <hi>That the first and principal End of the Lord Christs assuming Humane Nature was not to reign in it, but to suffer and dye in it.</hi> He was indeed from of old designed unto a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but he was to <hi>suffer,</hi> and so to enter into his glory: <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26. And he so speaks of his coming into the world, to <hi>suffer, to dye, to bear witness unto the truth,</hi> as if that had been the only work that he was <hi>incarnate</hi> for. Glory was to follow, a Kingdom to ensue, but <hi>suffering</hi> and dying was the principal work he came about. Glory he had with his <hi>Father before the world was, John</hi> 17.5. and therein a joynt Rule with him over all the works of his hands. He need not have been made <hi>partaker of flesh and blood</hi> to have been a <hi>King</hi>; for he was the <hi>King immortal, invisible,</hi> the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the only Potentate from everlasting. But he could not have <hi>dyed</hi> if he had not been <hi>made partaker of our Nature.</hi> And therefore when the People would have taken him by force, and <hi>have made him a King,</hi> he <hi>hid himself</hi> from them, <hi>John</hi> 6.15. But he <hi>hid not himself,</hi> when they came to take him by force, and put him to death, but affirmed, <hi>that for that hour,</hi> or business he came into the world, <hi>John</hi> 18.4, 5, 11. And this farther sets forth his Love and Condescension. He saw the <hi>work</hi> that was proposed unto him; how he was to be
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50110:308"/>
exposed unto Miseries, Afflictions and Persecutions, and at length to make <hi>his soul an offering for sin</hi>; yet because it was all for the Salvation of the children, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with it, and delighted in it. And how then ought we to be contented with the Difficulties, Sorrows, Afflictions and Persecutions, which for <hi>his sake</hi> we are or may be exposed unto; When he <hi>on purpose</hi> took our nature, that for <hi>our sakes</hi> he might be exposed and subject unto much more than we are called unto.</p>
                        <p>There yet remains in these <hi>Verses,</hi> the <hi>Effects</hi> of the Death of Christ; <hi>that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy sin and deliver</hi>: wherein we must consider (1.) <hi>Who</hi> it is that had the <hi>Power of Death</hi>: (2.) <hi>Wherein</hi> that Power of his did consist: (3.) <hi>How</hi> he was <hi>destroyed</hi>: (4.) <hi>How</hi> by the Death of Christ: (5.) <hi>What</hi> was the <hi>Delivery</hi> that was obtained for the children thereby.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He that had the <hi>Power of Death</hi> is described by his name, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>the Devil</hi>; the great Enemy of our salvation; the great <hi>Calumniator,</hi> make-bate, and false Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser; the <hi>firebrand</hi> of the creation. The Head and Captain of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> from God, and of all desertion of the Law of the creation. The <hi>old Serpent</hi>; Prince of the <hi>Apostate Angels,</hi> with all his Associates, who first falsly accused God unto man, and continues to accuse men falsly unto God; of whom before.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. His <hi>Power in and over Death</hi> is variously apprehended. What the <hi>Jews</hi> conceive hereof, we have before declared; and much of the <hi>Truth</hi> is mixed with their fables. And the Apostle deals with them upon their Acknowledgement in general, that he had the <hi>Power of death.</hi> Properly in what sense, or in what respect he is said so to have it, <hi>Learned Expositors</hi> are not agreed. All consent, (1.) That the <hi>Devil</hi> hath no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute or <hi>Soveraign</hi> supream power over death. Nor (2.) Any <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> about it, <hi>de jure,</hi> in his own Right, or on Grant, so as to act lawfully and rightly about it according unto his own Will. Nor (3.) Any judging or <hi>determining</hi> power as to the Guilt of death committed unto him; which is peculiar to God the <hi>supream Rector</hi> and Judge of all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18.</p>
                        <p>But wherein this Power of <hi>Satan</hi> doth <hi>positively</hi> consist, they are not agreed. Some place it in his <hi>Temptations</hi> unto Sin, which <hi>bind</hi> unto death: some in his <hi>Execution</hi> of the Sentence of death; he hath the Power of an Executioner. There cannot well be any doubt, but that the whole <hi>Interest</hi> of Satan in reference unto Death is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Expression. This Death is that which was <hi>threatned</hi> in the beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Death poenally</hi> to be inflicted in the way of a <hi>Curse, Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. that is, death consisting in the <hi>Dissolution</hi> of soul and body, with every thing tending <hi>poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> thereunto, with the everlasting Destruction of body and soul. And there are sundry things wherein the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or <hi>Power</hi> of Satan in reference unto this death doth consist. As (1.) He was the <hi>means</hi> of bringing it into the world. So is the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Jews</hi> in this matter expressed in the Book of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> written as is most probable, by one of them not long before this <hi>Epistle.</hi> They tell us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.13. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; <hi>God made not death,</hi> it belonged not unto the <hi>Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of all things; but <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.24. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>by the Envy of the Devil-death entred into the world.</hi> And that expression of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, is retained by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. Only he layes the End of it on the <hi>morally deserving cause,</hi> the sin of man; as here it is laid on the <hi>efficiently procuring cause,</hi> the Envy of the Devil. And herein consisted no small part of the <hi>Power</hi> of Satan with respect unto death. Being able to introduce <hi>sin,</hi> he had power to <hi>bring in death</hi> also, which in the righteous judgement of God, and by the Sentence of the Law was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably annexed thereunto. And by a parity of Reason, so far as he yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have Power <hi>over sin, deserving</hi> death, he hath <hi>Power over death</hi> it self.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> being thus entered into the world, and all mankind being guilty of the <hi>one,</hi> and obnoxious unto the <hi>other,</hi> Satan became thereby to be their <hi>Princess</hi> as being the Prince, or Author of that state and condition whereinto they are brought. Hence he is called the <hi>Prince of this world, John</hi> 12.32 and the <hi>God of it,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. Inasmuch as all the world is under the Guilt of <hi>that sin and death</hi> which he brought them into.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. God having passed the sentence of death against sin, it was in the <hi>Power</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to terrifie and affright the consciences of men, with the Expectation and dread of it; so bringing them into <hi>Bondage.</hi> And many God gives up unto him to be agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and <hi>terrified</hi> as it were at his pleasure. To this end were Persons excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate given up unto Satan to vex, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. He threatens them as an Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, with the work that he hath to do upon them.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="271" facs="tcp:50110:308"/>4. God hath ordained him to be the <hi>Executioner</hi> of the sentence of Death upon <hi>stubborn sinners</hi> unto all Eternity; partly for the <hi>Aggravation</hi> of their Punishment, when they shall alwayes see, and without relief bewail their folly in hearkening unto his Allurements; and partly, to <hi>punish himself</hi> in his wofull Employment. And for these several Reasons is Satan said to have the <hi>power of death.</hi> And hence it is evident; That,</p>
                        <p n="viii">VIII. <hi>All the Power of Satan in the world, over any of the sons of men is founded in Sin, and the Guilt of Death attending it</hi>: Death entered by sin; the Guilt of sin brought it in: Herewith comes in Satans <hi>interest</hi>; without which he could have no more to do in the Earth, than he hath in Heaven. And according as sin abounds, or is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, so his Power is enlarged or streightned. As he is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> he is mighty, strong, wise; as <hi>sinful,</hi> he is malitious, subtle, ambitious, revengeful, proud: Yet none of all these give him his Power. He that made him, can cause his sword to pierce unto him, and preserve man though weak and mortal, from all his <hi>force,</hi> as a <hi>mighty</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and his Attempts, as a <hi>wicked</hi> one. And yet these are the things in him that men are generally afraid of; when yet by them he cannot reach one <hi>hair of their heads.</hi> But here lyes the foundation of his power; even in <hi>sin,</hi> which so few regard. Then,</p>
                        <p n="ix">IX. <hi>All sinners out of Christ, are under the power of Satan.</hi> They belong unto that <hi>Kingdom of Death</hi> whereof he is the <hi>Prince</hi> and Ruler. The whole world lyes <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>in the power of this wicked one.</hi> If the <hi>Guilt</hi> of death be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from any, the <hi>Power</hi> of the Devil extends unto them. A power indeed it is, that is regulated. Were it <hi>Soveraign</hi> or absolute, he would continually devour. But it is <hi>limited</hi> unto times, seasons and degrees, by the Will of God, the Judge of all. But yet great it is, and answerable unto his Titles, the <hi>Prince, the God of the world.</hi> And however men may flatter themselves, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did of old, that they are <hi>free</hi>; if they are not <hi>freed</hi> by an interest in the death of Christ, they are in <hi>bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> unto this beastly Tyrant; and as he works <hi>effectually</hi> in them here, he will <hi>ragingly</hi> inflict vengeance on them hereafter.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>He is destroyed. To destroy him</hi>; The sense and importance of the word here used, was before declared. It is not applyed unto the <hi>Nature,</hi> Essence or Being of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but unto his Power in and over death; As it is elsewhere declared, <hi>John</hi> 12.32. <hi>Now is the Judgement of this world, now is the Prince of this world cast out</hi>; that which is here called the <hi>destroying of the Devil,</hi> is there called, <hi>the casting out of the Prince of this world.</hi> It is, the casting him out of his Power, from his <hi>Princedom</hi> and Rule, and <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made an open shew of them, triumphing over them in his cross</hi>; as Conquerors used to do, when they had not <hi>slain</hi> the Persons of their Enemies, but <hi>deprived</hi> them of their Rule, and lead them Captives. The Destruction then here intended of <hi>him that had the power of death,</hi> is the Dissolution, Evacuation, and Removing of that Power which he had in and over death, with all the effects and consequences of it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The <hi>means</hi> whereby Satan was thus destroyed is also expressed. <hi>It was by death, by his own death.</hi> This of all others, seemed the most <hi>unlikely way</hi> and means, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was not only the <hi>best,</hi> but <hi>the only way</hi> whereby it might be accomplished. And the manner how it was done <hi>thereby,</hi> must be declared and vindicated. The <hi>fourfold power</hi> of Satan in reference unto death before mentioned, was all founded in sin. The Obligation of the sinner unto death, was that which <hi>gave him</hi> all his Power. The taking away then of that Obligation, must needs be the Dissolution of his Power. The foundation being removed, all that is built upon it, must needs fall to the ground. Now this in reference unto the Children for whom he dyed, was done in the death of Christ; <hi>Virtually</hi> in his death it self, <hi>Actually</hi> in the Application of it unto them. When the sinner ceaseth to be <hi>obnoxious</hi> unto death, the Power of Satan ceaseth also. And this every one doth, that hath an interest in the death of Christ: <hi>for there is no condemnation unto them that are in Christ Jesus, Rom.</hi> 8.1. And this because <hi>he dyed,</hi> he dyed for their sins, took that death upon himself which was due unto them; which being conquered thereby, and their Obligation thereunto ceasing, the Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is therewith dissolved. The first Branch of his Power consisted in the <hi>bringing of sin into the world</hi>; This is dissolved by Christs taking <hi>away the sin of the world, John</hi> 1.29. which he did as the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> by the Sacrifice of himself in his death, typified by the <hi>Paschal Lamb,</hi> and all other Sacrifices of old. Again, His power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50110:309"/>
in his <hi>Rule</hi> in the world, as cast under sin and death: From this he was cast out (<hi>John</hi> 12.32.) in the death of Christ, when contending with him for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> he was conquered, the ground whereon he stood, even the <hi>guilt of sin</hi> being taken away from under him, and his Title defeated. And actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Believers</hi> are translated from under his Rule, from the <hi>Power of Darkness,</hi> into the Kingdom of Light, and of the Son of God. Nor can he longer make use of death as <hi>poenal,</hi> as threatned in the curse of the Law, to <hi>terrifie</hi> and affright the consciences of men; for being <hi>justified by faith</hi> in the death of Christ, <hi>they have peace with God, Rom.</hi> 5.1. Christ making Peace between God and us, by the blood of his Cross, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.14, 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. the Weapons of this part of his Power are wrested out of his hand; seeing Death hath no power to terrifie the conscience, but as it expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the curse of God. And lastly, his final Execution of the <hi>sentence of death</hi> upon sinners, is utterly taken out of his hand by the death of Christ, inasmuch as they for whom he dyed shall never undergo death <hi>poenally.</hi> And thus was Satan as to his power over death, fully <hi>destroyed</hi> by the death of Christ. And all this depended on Gods Institution; appointing the <hi>satisfactory sufferings</hi> of Christ, and accepting them instead of the sufferings of the children themselves.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> give us another Exposition of these words; as knowing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on to be no less destructive of their Error, than the death of Christ, is of the power of the Devil. The Reason hereof, saith <hi>Schlictingius,</hi> is, <hi>quia per mortem Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus adeptus est supremam potestatem in omnia; qua omnes inimicos suos quorum caput est diabolus coercet, eorum vires frangit, eosque tandem penitus abolebit.</hi> But if this be so, and the abolishing of the power of Satan be an act of <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> then it was not done by the <hi>death of Christ</hi>; nor was there any need that he should <hi>partake of flesh and blood</hi> for that purpose, or dye. So that this Exposition contradicts both the <hi>express words</hi> of the Apostle, and also, the <hi>whole design</hi> of his discourse: No proposition can be more plain than this is; that the <hi>Power of Satan</hi> was destroyed by the death of Christ, which in this <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the words is denyed.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And hence it lastly appears, what was the <hi>Delivery that was procured for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> by this dissolution of the Power of Satan. It respects both what they <hi>feared,</hi> and what ensued on their fear; that is, <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Bondage.</hi> For the delivery here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not meerly a <hi>Consequent</hi> of the destruction of Satan, but hath regard unto the <hi>things themselves,</hi> about which the power of Satan was exercised. They were obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious unto death on the Guilt of sin, as <hi>poenal,</hi> as under the Curse, as attended with Hell, or everlasting misery. This he <hi>delivered</hi> the children from; by making an <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement</hi> for their sins in his death, virtually loosing their Obligation thereunto; and procuring for them Eternal Redemption, as shall afterwards be fully declared. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on also they are delivered from the <hi>Bondage</hi> before described. The <hi>fear of death</hi> being taken away, the <hi>bondage</hi> that ensues thereon vanisheth also. And these things, as they are done <hi>virtually</hi> and legally in the death of Christ; so they are <hi>actually</hi> accomplished in and towards the children, upon the Application of the death of Christ unto them, when they do believe. And we may now close our consideration of these Verses with one or two other Observations; as,</p>
                        <p n="x">X. <hi>The death of Christ through the wise and righteous disposal of God, is victorious, all conquering, and prevalent.</hi> The aim of the world was to <hi>bring him unto death</hi>; and therein they thought they had done with him. The <hi>aim of Satan</hi> was so also; who thereby supposed he should have secured his own Kingdom. And what could <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> or <hi>Satanical</hi> Wisdom have imagined otherwise? He that is slain is conquered. His own followers were ready to think so; <hi>We trusted,</hi> say they, <hi>that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel, Luke</hi> 24.21. <hi>But he is dead</hi>; and their hopes are with him in the grave. What can be expected from him, who is taken, slain, crucified? Can he save others, who it seems could not save himself? <hi>Per mortem alterius, stultum est sperare salutem.</hi> Is it not a foolish thing to look for <hi>life,</hi> by the <hi>death</hi> of another? This was that which the <hi>Pagans</hi> of old reproached the <hi>Christians</hi> withal; that they believed in one that was <hi>crucified</hi> and dyed himself, and what could they expect from him? And our Apostle tells us, that this <hi>death,</hi> this <hi>Cross,</hi> was a <hi>stumbling block unto the Jews, and folly to the Greeks,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18, 23. And so would it have been in its self, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.28. had not the Will and Counsel, and Wisdom and Grace of God been in it. But he ordered things so, that <hi>this death of Christ,</hi> should pull out that pin, which kept together the whold fabrick of sin and Satan;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50110:309"/>
that like <hi>Sampson,</hi> he should in his death, pull down the <hi>pallace of Satan</hi> about his ears, and that in dying he should conquer and subdue all things unto himself. All the <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven stood looking on, to see what would be the end of this great trial. Men and Devils were ignorant of the great work which God had in hand. And whilest they thought they were <hi>destroying him,</hi> God was in and by him <hi>destroying them</hi> and their power. Whilest his <hi>heel was bruised,</hi> he <hi>brake their head.</hi> And this should teach us, to leave all Gods works unto himself: See <hi>John</hi> 11.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. He can bring light out of darkness, and meat out of the Eater. He can disappoint his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of their greatest hopes, and fairest possibilities, and raise up the hopes of his own out of the grave. He can make <hi>suffering</hi> to be <hi>saving; death victorious,</hi> and heal us by the stripes of his Son. And in particular, it should stir us up to meditate on this <hi>mysterious work</hi> of his Love and Wisdom. We can never enough search into it, whilest our Enquiry is guided by his Word. New Mysteries, all fountains of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment and Joy, will continually open themselves unto us, untill we come be to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the endless fulness of it unto Eternity. Again,</p>
                        <p n="xi">XI. <hi>One principal end of the death of Christ was to destroy the power of Satan.</hi> To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him that had the power of death. This was promised of old, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. He was to break the head of the <hi>Serpent.</hi> From <hi>him</hi> sprang all the miseries which he came to deliver his <hi>Elect</hi> from, and which could not be affected without the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Power. He was anointed to <hi>proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening the Prison to them that were bound, Isa.</hi> 61.1. To this End he was to conquer him, who detained them; which he did by his death, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. and so <hi>lead Captivity Captive, Psalm</hi> 68.18. stilling this <hi>enemy and self-avenger, Psal.</hi> 8.3. binding the <hi>strong man, Mat.</hi> 12. and <hi>dividing the spoil with him, Isa.</hi> 53.12. And this he did by the <hi>merit of his blood,</hi> and the Attonement he made for sin thereby. This took away the Obligation of the Law unto death, and disarmed Satan. And moreover, by the Power of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit whereby he <hi>offered himself unto God,</hi> he conquered and quelled him. Satan laid his claim unto the Person of Christ; but coming to put it in Execution, he met with that great and <hi>hidden Power</hi> in him, which he knew not, and was utterly conquered. And this as it gives us a particular consideration of the Excellency of our Redemption, wherein <hi>Satan</hi> our old Enemy, who first foyled us, who alwayes hates us, and seeks our ruine, is conquered, spoiled and chained; so it teacheth us how to contend with him, by what <hi>Weapons</hi> to resist his Temptations, and to repell his Affrightments; even those whereby he hath been already subdued. Faith in the death of Christ, is the only Way and Means of obtaining a Conquest over him. He will fly at the <hi>Sign of the Cross</hi> rightly made.</p>

                        <p>In the words, there is first the Reference that the Apostle makes unto somewhat else, whereby that which he declareth is confirmed. For <hi>verily not any where</hi>: that is, that which he denyeth in the following words, is <hi>no where</hi> taught in the Scripture; as <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.5. <hi>For unto which of the Angels said he at any time</hi>; That is, there is no Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony extant in the Scripture concerning them to that purpose. So here; <hi>no where</hi> is it spoken in the Scripture, that Christ <hi>taketh Angels.</hi> And what is <hi>so spoken,</hi> he is said <hi>to do.</hi> And thus also the Affirmative clause of his Proposition, <hi>but he taketh the seed of Abraham,</hi> is to be referred to the Scripture. <hi>There</hi> it is promised, there it is spoken, and therein it is <hi>done</hi> by him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That which he asserteth hath the nature of a <hi>discrete axiom,</hi> wherein the <hi>same thing</hi> is denyed, and affirmed of the <hi>disparates</hi> expressed, and that <hi>univocally</hi> in the same sense; he <hi>took not Angels,</hi> but <hi>he took the seed of Abraham</hi>; And this, we being referred to the <hi>Scripture</hi> for the proof and confirmation of, gives <hi>light</hi> and <hi>perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> into the meaning of the words. For how doth Christ in the Scripture <hi>take the seed of Abraham,</hi> in such a sense as that therein nothing is spoken of him in reference unto <hi>Angels</hi>: It is evident, that it was, in that he was of the <hi>Posterity of Abraham</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the flesh; that he was promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he should be of <hi>his seed,</hi> yea, that he should be <hi>his seed</hi>; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6. This was the great Principle, the great
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50110:310"/>
expectation of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be the <hi>seed of Abraham:</hi> this was declared unto them in the Promise, and this accordingly was accomplished. And he is here said <hi>to take the seed of Abraham,</hi> because in the <hi>Scripture</hi> it is so plainly, so often affirmed that he should so do; when not <hi>one word</hi> is any where spoken that he should be an <hi>Angel,</hi> or <hi>take their nature</hi> upon him. And this, as I said, gives us the <hi>true meaning</hi> of the words. The Apostle in them confirms what he had before affirmed, concerning his being made <hi>partaker of flesh and bloud</hi> together with the children. This, saith he, the <hi>Scripture</hi> declares, wherein it is promised that he should be of the <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> which he therein takes upon him, and which was already accomplished in his being made <hi>partaker of flesh and bloud.</hi> See <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>chap.</hi> 3.16. This then the Apostle teacheth us, that the Lord Christ, the Son of God, according to the <hi>Promise,</hi> took to himself the nature of man, coming of the <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> that is into <hi>personal union</hi> with himself; but took not the <hi>nature of Angels,</hi> no such thing being spoken of him, nor concerning him any where in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> And this exposition of the words will be farther evidenced and confirmed by our examination of another, which with great endeavour is advanced in opposition unto it.</p>
                        <p>Some then take the meaning of this Exposition to be, that the Lord Christ by his <hi>participation of flesh and blood brought help and relief, not unto Angels, but unto men, the seed of Abraham.</hi> And they suppose to this purpose, that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> is put for <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, to <hi>help,</hi> to <hi>succour,</hi> to <hi>relieve,</hi> to <hi>vindicate</hi> into liberty. Of this mind are <hi>Castalio,</hi> and all the <hi>Socinians</hi>; among those of the <hi>Roman Church, Ribera; Estius</hi> also, and <hi>A Lapide</hi> speak doubtfully in the case. Of Protestants, <hi>Camero,</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi> who affirms moreover, that <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Scholiasts so interpret the place and words: which I should have marvelled at, had I not long before observed him greatly to fail or mistake in many of his Quotations. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> whom he names in particular, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly referreth this <hi>whole verse</hi> unto the <hi>Lord Christs Assumption of the nature of man,</hi> and not of the nature of Angels. The same also is insisted on by <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius,</hi> without any intimation of the sense that <hi>Grotius</hi> would impose upon them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> embrace and endeavour to confirm this second Exposition of the words, and it is their concernment so to do. For if the words express that the Lord Christ <hi>assumed humane nature,</hi> which necessarily infers his <hi>prae-existence</hi> in <hi>another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> their perswasion about the Person of Christ is utterly overthrown. Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in their <hi>controversial writings</hi> unto this place have been else-where considered. Those of <hi>Eniedinus</hi> on this Text, are answered by <hi>Paraeus,</hi> those of <hi>Castalio</hi> by <hi>Beza</hi>; and the objections of some others by <hi>Gomarus.</hi> We shall in the first place consider what is proposed for the confirmation of their sense, by <hi>Schlictingius</hi> or <hi>Crellius</hi>; and then the exception of <hi>a very learned Expositor</hi> unto the sense before laid down and confirmed. And <hi>Schlictingius</hi> first argues from the Context, <hi>Praeter ipsa verba</hi> (saith he) <hi>quae hunc sensum nullo modo patiuntur ut postea dicemus, contextus &amp; ratiocinatio au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoris id repudiat; qui pro ratione &amp; argumento id sumere non potuit debuitve, quod sibi hoc ipso argumento &amp; ratione probandum sumsisset. De eo enim erat quaestio, cur Christus qui nunc ad tantam majestatem &amp; gloriam est evectus, non angelicam sed humanam, morti &amp; variis calamitatibus obnoxiam habuerit naturam? bujus vero rei, quo pacto ratio redderetur, per id quod non angelicam sed humanam naturam assumpserit; cum istius ipsius rei, quae in hac quaestione continetur, nempe quod Christus homo fuit natus, nunc causa ratioque quaeratur. At vero si haec verba, de juvandis non Angelis, sed hominibus, deque ope iis ferenda intelligamus, pulcherrime omnia cohaerent; nempe Christum hominem mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talem fuisse, non angelum aliquem, quod non angelis sed hominibus juvandis, servandisque fuerit destinatus.</hi> But the foundation of this Exposition of the <hi>Context</hi> is a mistake, which his own <hi>preceding discourse</hi> might have relieved him from. For there is no such <hi>question</hi> proposed as here is imagined, nor doth <hi>he</hi> in <hi>his following Exposition</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it. The Apostle doth not once propose this unto confirmation, that it <hi>behoved the Lord Christ to be a man and not an Angel.</hi> But having proved at large before, that in Nature and Authority he was above the <hi>Angels,</hi> he grants, <hi>verse</hi> 8. that he was for <hi>a little while made lower than they</hi>; and gives at large the reason of the <hi>necessity</hi> of that dispensation, taken from the work which God had designed him unto, which being to <hi>bring many sons unto glory,</hi> he shews and proves by sundry reasons, that it could not be accomplished <hi>without his death</hi> and <hi>suffering</hi>; for which end it was indispensibly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that he should be made <hi>partaker of flesh and blood.</hi> And this he confirms far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by referring the <hi>Hebrews</hi> unto the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and in especial unto the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the <hi>Messiah</hi> made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be his <hi>seed</hi>; the love
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50110:311"/>
and grace whereof he amplifies by an intimation that he was not to partake of the <hi>Angelical nature.</hi> That supposition therefore which is the foundation of this Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, namely that the Apostle had before designed to prove that the <hi>Messiah</hi> ought to partake of <hi>humane nature,</hi> and <hi>not of Angelical,</hi> which is nothing to his purpose, is a surmise suited only to the present occasion. Wherefore <hi>Felbinger</hi> in his <hi>Demonstratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Evangelica</hi> takes another course, and affirms that these words contain the end of what was before asserted, <hi>verse</hi> 14, 15. namely about <hi>Christs participation of flesh and blood,</hi> which was not to <hi>help Angels,</hi> but the <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> and to take them into grace and favour. But these things are both of them expresly declared in those verses, especially <hi>verse</hi> 15. where it is directly affirmed, that his design in his Incarnation and Death was to <hi>destroy the devil,</hi> and to <hi>free and save the children:</hi> And to what end should these things be here again <hi>repeated,</hi> and that in words and terms far more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and <hi>ambiguous</hi> than those wherein it was before taught and declared? For by <hi>Angels</hi> they understand <hi>evil Angels</hi>; and there could be no cause why the Apostle should say in this <hi>Verse,</hi> that he did not <hi>assist</hi> or relieve them, when he had declared in the words immediately fore-going, that he was <hi>born and died</hi> that he might <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them.</hi> Neither is it <hi>comely</hi> to say, that the end why Christ <hi>destroyed the devil</hi> was, that he <hi>might not help him</hi>; or the end why he saved the children was, that he <hi>might assist them.</hi> Besides the introduction of this assertion, <gap reason="foreign">

And the Apostle teacheth us by it, that the Lord Christ <hi>took unto him,</hi> and <hi>took on him</hi> our <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of the <hi>seed of Abraham.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the <hi>Genuine sense</hi> of the place may be yet more fully vindicated, I shall farther consider the exceptions of <hi>a very learned man</hi> unto our Interpretation of the words, and his <hi>Answers</hi> unto the <hi>Reasons</hi> whereby it is confirmed.</p>
                        <p>First, he says, that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>being in the present tense,</hi> signifieth a continued action, such as <hi>Christs helping of us</hi> is; but his assumption of humane nature was a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaneous action,</hi> which being past long before, the Apostle would not express it as a thing present. It is generally answered unto this exception, that an <hi>enallage</hi> is to be allowed, and that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> is put for <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which is usual in the Scripture: So <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.31. <hi>chap.</hi> 21.13. But yet there is no <hi>just necessity</hi> of supposing it in this place. The Apostle in his usual manner disputing with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> on the principles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had been instructed from the Old Testament, minds them that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>said therein</hi> of his <hi>taking</hi> upon him the <hi>nature of Angels,</hi> but only of the <hi>seed of Abraham.</hi> So that, <hi>he takes,</hi> is, <hi>he doth so in the Scripture,</hi> that affirms him so to do; and in respect hereunto the expression in the present tense is proper to his purpose. This way of arguing and manner of expression we have manifested on <hi>chap.</hi> 1.5.</p>
                        <p>Again he addes; this expression, <hi>He took not on him Angels,</hi> for, <hi>the nature of Angels,</hi> is hard and uncouth; as it would be in the <hi>affirmative</hi> to say, <hi>assumpsit homines,</hi> or <hi>homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem; he took men,</hi> or <hi>a man</hi>; which we say not, although we do that he took humane nature. But the reason of this <hi>phrase of speech</hi> is evident. Having before affirmed that he was partaker <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>of flesh and blood,</hi> whereby the <hi>nature of man</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, repeating here again the same <hi>assertion</hi> with respect unto the <hi>Promise,</hi> and a negation of the same thing in reference unto Angels, because their nature consisteth not of <hi>flesh and blood,</hi> he expresseth it indefinitely, and in the <hi>concrete</hi>; he <hi>took not them,</hi> that is, not that in and of them, which answers unto <hi>flesh and blood in the children,</hi> that is, their nature. So that there is no need to assert, as he supposeth some may do, that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>ought to be repeated</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and referred unto those bodies which the Angels assumed for a season in their Apparitions under the Old Testament; there being only an <hi>Elipsis</hi> easie to be supplied of that in them which answers unto <hi>flesh and blood</hi> in the children.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Apostle,</hi> he saith, <hi>sheweth,</hi> verse 17. <hi>that Christ ought in all things to be made like unto us,</hi> by this reason, <hi>Quod non assumpsit Angelos, sed semen Abrabae. But if this be to take on him the nature of man, he comes to prove the same thing by the same. For to be made like unto us, and to assume humane nature, differ only in words, and not really, or indeed.</hi> But, <hi>take</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>to help or relieve, and all things agree. For because he came to help us and not Angels, it became him to be made like unto us.</hi> But herein lies a double mistake: First, in the <hi>scope</hi> and argument of the Apostle; for those words in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 17 <hi>verse</hi> are not an Inference or Conclusion from what is asserted in this <hi>verse,</hi> but an Affirmation of the necessity of what is there asserted, from that which follows in the same <hi>verse, that he might be a faithful High Priest.</hi> Secondly, those words <hi>like unto us,</hi> do not intend his conformity unto us in his <hi>participation of humane nature,</hi> which he had on other reasons before confirmed, but in the <hi>sufferings and temptations</hi> which there he insists upon.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>The seed of Abraham,</hi> he says, <hi>is a collective expression, and denotes many, at least it must denote the person of some man, which Christ did not assume. And therefore it is the spiritual seed of Abraham that is intended, that is, believers. And the Apostle so calls them, because the Hebrews were well pleased with the mention of that priviledge.</hi> But this will not abide the examination. The great promise of old unto <hi>Abraham</hi> was, that in <hi>his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed.</hi> The intendment of that Promise was, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be <hi>his seed,</hi> of his posterity. That by <hi>this seed</hi> one <hi>individual</hi> was intended, our Apostle declares, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. As Christ in like manner is said to be of <hi>the seed of David</hi> according to the flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. Of this <hi>Promise</hi> the Apostle minds the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> So that his taking on him the <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> is not the assuming of many, nor of the person of any one of them, but meerly his being <hi>made of the seed of Abraham</hi> according to the Promise. And to bend these words unto any other sense, than the accomplishment of the Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that Christ should be of his seed, is plainly to pervert them. And this is all of weight that I can meet withall, which is objected unto our interpretation of this place, which being removed, it is further established.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, in the <hi>disparate</hi> removed, by <hi>Angels,</hi> the good Angels, not <hi>fallen Angels,</hi> are
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50110:312"/>
principally regarded. Of <hi>fallen Angels</hi> he had newly spoken under the collective ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, the <hi>devil, who had the power of death.</hi> Norare, it may be, the <hi>devils</hi> any where called absolutely by the name of <hi>Angels</hi>; but they are termed either <hi>evil Angels,</hi> or <hi>Angels that sinned,</hi> that <hi>left their habitation,</hi> that are <hi>to be judged,</hi> the <hi>devils Angels</hi>; or have some or other peculiar Adjunct whereby they are marked out and distinguished. Now it cannot be that this word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, if it be interpreted to <hi>help, assist,</hi> or <hi>relieve,</hi> can in any sense be applied unto the <hi>Angels,</hi> that must be intended if any. For the word must denote either <hi>any help,</hi> assistance, or relief in general, or that especial help and assistance which is given by Christ in the work of Reconciliation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. If the first be intended, I much question the truth of the assertion, seeing the <hi>Angels</hi> owe their establishment in grace unto Christ, and their advancement in glory, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.10. If it be to be taken in the latter sense as is pretended, then the nature of the <hi>discrete Axiom</hi> here used by the Apostle requires, that there be the same <hi>need of the help</hi> intimated in both the <hi>disparates,</hi> which is <hi>denied</hi> as unto the one, and <hi>affirmed</hi> as unto the other. But now the Angels, that is the <hi>good Angels,</hi> had no need of the help of <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> unto God, or of being freed from death, or the <hi>fear</hi> of it, which they were never obnoxious unto. And what remains for the clearing of the mind of the Apostle, will appear yet farther in the ensuing Observations from the words.</p>
                        <p n="i">I. <hi>The Lord Jesus Christ is truly God and Man in one Person</hi>; and this is fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in these words. For, first, there is supposed in them his <hi>prae-existence</hi> in another Nature, than that which he is said here to <hi>assume.</hi> He was before, he <hi>subsisted</hi> before, or he could not have taken on him what he had not. This was his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> as the like is intimated, where he is said to be <hi>made flesh, Joh.</hi> 1.14. to be <hi>made of a woman, Gal.</hi> 4.4. to be <hi>manifested in the flesh,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. to <hi>take on him the form of a servant, Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. as here, he took <hi>the seed of Abraham</hi>; he <hi>was</hi> before he did so; that is the Son, the Word of God, the Son of God, as in the places mentioned, eternally prae-existing unto this his Incarnation. For the <hi>subject</hi> of this Proposition, he <hi>took on him,</hi> &amp;c. denotes a <hi>person</hi> prae-existing unto the <hi>act of taking</hi> here ascribed unto him, which was no other than the <hi>Son of God.</hi> 2. He <hi>assumed,</hi> he took to himself another <hi>nature,</hi> of the seed of <hi>Abraham according unto the promise</hi>; so continuing what he was, he became what he was not. For, 3. He took this to be his <hi>own nature</hi>; he so took it, as himself to <hi>become</hi> truly the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom, and concerning whom, the promise was given, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. and was himself made of the <hi>seed of David according to the flesh, Rom.</hi> 1.3. and as <hi>concerning the flesh came of the fathers, Rom.</hi> 9.5. and so was the Son of <hi>David</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham, Matth.</hi> 1.1. And this could no otherwise be done, but, 4. by taking that Nature into <hi>Personal Subsistence</hi> with himself, in the <hi>Hypostasis</hi> of the Son of God; the nature he assumed could no otherwise become his. For if he had by any ways or means taken the person of a man to be united unto him, in the strictest union that two persons are capable of, a Divine and an Humane, the nature had still been the nature of that other person and not his own. But he took it to be his <hi>own nature,</hi> which it could no ways be but by personal union, causing it to subsist in his own person. And he is therefore a true and perfect Man; for no more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make a complete and perfect man, but the <hi>entire nature of man subsisting.</hi> And this is in Christ, as a man, the <hi>Humane nature</hi> having a <hi>subsistence</hi> communicated unto it by the Son of God. And therefore, 6. This is done without a <hi>multiplication of persons</hi> in him. For the Humane Nature can have no personality of its own, because it was taken to be the nature of another person, who was <hi>prae-existent</hi> unto it, and by assuming of it, prevented its proper personality. Neither, 7. did hence any mixture or confusion of natures ensue, or of the essential properties of them; for he took the <hi>seed of Abraham</hi> to be his Humane Nature, which if mixed with the Divine, it could not be. And this he hath done, 8. <hi>inseparably</hi> and for ever. Which things are handled at large else-where.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. <hi>The Redemption of Mankind by the taking of our nature, was a work of meer Sovereign grace.</hi> He took the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>; he took not the nature of Angels. And for what cause or reason? Can any be assigned but the Sovereign Grace, Pleasure, and Love of God? nor doth the Scripture any where assign any other. And this will the better appear, if we consider,</p>
                        <p>First, That for a <hi>sinning nature</hi> to be saved, it was indispensibly necessary that it
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50110:312"/>
should be <hi>assumed.</hi> The nature of <hi>Angels</hi> being not taken, those that sinned in that nature, must perish for ever; and they that fancy a possibility of saving sinners any other way but by <hi>satisfaction</hi> made in the <hi>nature that had sinned,</hi> seem not to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered aright the nature of sin, and the Justice of God. Had any other way been pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, why doth the perishing of <hi>Angels</hi> so inevitably follow the non-assumption of their nature? This way alone then could it be wrought.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That we were <hi>carrying away all humane nature into endless destruction</hi>; for so it is intimated, whence Christs assumption of it is expressed by his <hi>putting forth his hand and taking hold of it,</hi> to stop it in its course of apostasie and ruine. Of Angels only some <hi>individual</hi> persons fell from God; but our <hi>whole nature,</hi> in every one to whom it was communicated from and by <hi>Adam</hi> was running head-long to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In it self there could be no relief, nor any thing to commend it unto God.</p>

                        <p>In these two Verses, the <hi>Apostle</hi> illustrates what he had taught before; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms what he had asserted concerning the Sons participation <hi>of flesh and blood, in like manner with the children,</hi> from one especial End thereof. And this End is, his being an <hi>High Priest,</hi> which that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be, both the <hi>Hebrews</hi> granted, and he himself intended more largely afterwards to demonstrate. Moreover, he was to be <hi>such an High Priest,</hi> as was setled and suited for the discharge of his Office, unto the benefit of them, for whose good he was to minister therein. This the Wisdom of God, and the Nature of the thing it self doth require. Now they being persons obnoxious unto <hi>Temptations</hi> and sufferings of all sorts, he must in an especial manner be able, to <hi>help,</hi> relieve and save such Persons. And all this the Apostle declares in these <hi>Verses</hi>; in the opening whereof we may consider,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The importance of the <hi>illative expression</hi> in the entrance; <hi>wherefore, or hence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The necessity intimated of what is here assigned to the Messiah; it <hi>behooved him,</hi> or it was meet that he should.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. What the Apostle repeats and reasserts; namely, that he was <hi>in all things,</hi> or <hi>every manner of way,</hi> to be made like unto his brethren; or,</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The general End of this his necessary conformity unto the brethren; that he <hi>might be a merciful and faithful High Priest.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. The especial work and end of that Office, which he was so prepared for; in the things of God, to <hi>make Reconciliation for the sins of the people.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. A farther enforcement of the necessity of the foregoing assertion; taken from a double consideration.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Of what he did, or what befell him, in the condition wherein he was made like unto the Brethren: <hi>he suffered being tempted,</hi> or when he was tempted.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="282" facs="tcp:50110:315"/>2. Of the blessed Effect and consequence thereof, both in his own preparation unto the farther discharge of his Office, and the benefit of them whom he ministers in it for, <hi>he is able to succour them that are tempted.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, There is the <hi>Illation</hi> intimated in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>wherefore</hi>; Now this may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect either what had been <hi>before discoursed</hi>; or what is farther insisted on in the words ensuing. In the first way, the Apostle would seem to infer the necessity of his being made like <hi>unto his brethren in all things,</hi> from what he had before proved of his participation of humane nature; but this seems not to be the meaning of the word. That expression <hi>to be made like unto his brethren in all things,</hi> is only <hi>a Recapitulation</hi> of what the Apostle had before taught concerning his incarnation and sufferings; and here, his design is to shew the Reason or End thereof; namely, that he might be an <hi>High Priest,</hi> and discharge his office unto the benefit of the people. He gives therefore an account of what he had delivered, and declares the End of it, wherefore, <hi>or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought he thus to be made like his brethren, that he might be a merciful High Priest.</hi> And thus did <hi>Chrysostom</hi> understand the connection of these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; <hi>Therefore was he made man, that he might be a Sacrifice able to purge our sins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, The <hi>Necessity</hi> of the matter of the Apostles assertion, is expressed in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>He ought; it must be so</hi>; it could not be otherwise, on supposition that he was to be an <hi>High Priest.</hi> God having designed him unto that <hi>Office,</hi> and the work thereof, it was <hi>indispensibly necessary</hi> for him to be made like unto his brethren in all things.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, That which the Apostle thus asserts, is, <hi>his being made like unto his brethren in all things.</hi> The <hi>Proposition</hi> is of the nature of them that are <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; <hi>universal,</hi> but not <hi>universally to be understood.</hi> For that expression <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, is capable of sundry limitations. As First, It respects only all those things which are necessary unto the End assigned; and Secondly, In them also, there may be a great difference. The things it respects are <hi>Nature</hi> with the essential properties thereof; attended with temptations and sufferings. But whereas the <hi>Brethren</hi> are sinners, he was not made like unto them in <hi>sin</hi>; which Exception the Apostle elsewhere puts in unto this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.15. For this would have been so far from conducing unto the End aimed at, that it would have been utterly destructive thereof. In the things also wherein he was made like unto them, still the Regulation from the End is to be carried along with us. That therein which was needful thereunto, this Assimulation or conformity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends unto; that which was otherwise it supposeth not. And as the <hi>first</hi> part of this <hi>double limitation</hi> is made evident in the instance of sin, so the truth and necessity of the <hi>latter</hi> will appear in the consideration of the things wherein this Conformity doth consist. As,</p>
                        <p>First, He was made like unto them in the Essence of humane nature; a Rational Spiritual Soul, and a mortal body, quickned by its Union therewithal. This it was necessary he should be like the Brethren in; and not have a <hi>phantastical Body,</hi> or a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy animated by the Deity as some fancied of old. But that he should take this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him by natural Generation after the manner of the Brethren, this was not necessary; yea, so to have done, would not have farthered the End of his Priesthood, but have enervated the Efficacy of it, and have rendered him incapable of being such a Priest as he was to be. For whereas the <hi>Original contagion</hi> of sin is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by natural procreation, had he been by that means made partaker of humane nature, how could he have been <hi>holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners</hi>; as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came our High Priest to be, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.26. Again, it was not necessary that this Humane Nature should have its individuation from its self, and a particular subsistence in and by its self; yea, this also would have overthrown his Priesthood. For whereas the efficacy thereof depends on the excellency of the Divine Nature, this could not have given its influence thereunto, had not the Humane Nature been taken into the same personal subsistence with its self. Only, as we said, that he should have an Humane Nature, truly and really as the Brethren, and therein be like unto them, this was <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> that he might be an <hi>offering</hi> Priest: and have of his own to offer unto God.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It was also necessary, that in and with his Humane Nature he should take upon him all the Properties and Affections of it, that so he might be made like unto the Brethren. He was not to have an <hi>ubiquatarian body,</hi> a body <hi>commensurate</hi> to the Deity, that is <hi>immense,</hi> and consequently no true body at all. Nor was his <hi>soul</hi> to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50110:315"/>
be freed from the Affections which are connatural to an humane rational soul; as Love, Joy, Fear, Sorrow, Shame and the like; nor was his Body to be free from being obnoxious unto Hunger, Thirst, Cold, Pain, Death it self. But now whereas these things in the Brethren are attended with <hi>irregular perturbations</hi> for the most part; and whereas all the individuals of them have their proper infirmities in their own Persons, partly, by inordinate inclinations from their Tempers and Complexions, partly, in Weaknesses and Sicknesses, proceeding either from their Original Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or other following inordinacies, it was no way needful, that in any of these he should be made like unto the Brethren; yea, a Conformity unto them therein would have absolutely impeded the work he had to do.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, He was also like unto us in Temptations, for the Reason which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle gives in the last Verse; but herein also some difference may be observed between him and us. For the most of our Temptations arise from <hi>within us,</hi> from our own Unbelief and Lusts. Again, in those that are <hi>from without,</hi> there is somewhat in us to <hi>take part with them,</hi> which alwayes makes us fail in our duty of resistance, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leads to farther miscarriages. But from these things he was absolutely free. For as he had no inward disposition or inclination unto the least evil, being perfect in all Graces, and all their Operations at all times: So when the Prince of this world came unto him, he had <hi>no part in him,</hi> nothing to close with his suggestions, or to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his terrors.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>His Sufferings</hi> were of the same kind, with them that the Brethren under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, or ought so to have done; yet they had far different Effects on him, from what they would have had on them. For whereas he was perfectly innocent, and perfectly righteous, no way deserving them in his own Person, he was free from all impressions of those sinful consequents which attend the utmost sufferings under the Curse of the Law by sinners themselves.</p>
                        <p>Thus the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>the likeness in all here</hi> asserted, is capable of a double limitation; the first concerning some things themselves, as <hi>sin</hi>; the other, the <hi>mode</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of the things wherein the conformity doth really consist.</p>
                        <p>Now thus to be made like unto them it <hi>became him</hi>; it was <hi>meet,</hi> just and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that God should make him so, because of the Office, Duty and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he had assigned him unto; which as the End hereof, is nextly to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The general End of his Conformity unto the Brethren, is that he <hi>might be a merciful and faithful High Priest.</hi> Two things are comprized herein: First, The <hi>Office</hi> that he was designed unto; He was to be an High Priest; Secondly, His <hi>Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> for that Office: He was to be <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>faithful.</hi> His conformity unto the Brethren as we have seen, consisted in two things: First His <hi>Participation</hi> of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Secondly, His <hi>Copartnership</hi> with them in their condition of suffering and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. The first of these was necessary unto his <hi>Office</hi>; the latter unto his <hi>Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi> He was made <hi>man,</hi> that he might be an High Priest; he <hi>suffered being tempted,</hi> that he might be merciful and faithful. There was no more required that he might be an High Priest, but that he should partake of our nature; but that he might be <hi>merciful and faithful,</hi> with that kind of mercy and faithfulness which the Brethren stood in need of, it was moreover required, that he should <hi>suffer and be tempted</hi>; which things must be distinctly considered.</p>
                        <p>First, That he might be an High Priest, it was necessary that he should be <hi>partaker of the Nature of them,</hi> for whom he was to administer in the things of God. So the Apostle informs us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Every High Priest for men,</hi> must be <hi>taken from among men.</hi> This is not work for an Angel; nor for God himself as such. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the benefits of the Priesthood of Christ, were communicated unto all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers from the foundation of the world, by vertue of the compact and agreement between the Father and him, for the undertaking and execution of that Office at the time appointed; yet he was not actually, nor could be an High Priest, untill he was <hi>cloathed with flesh,</hi> and made partaker of the nature of the children. The duty which as an High Priest he had perform, namely, to offer <hi>Gifts and Sacrifices unto God, Chap.</hi> 8.3. with the especial nature of that great Sacrifice that he was to offer, which was <hi>himself,</hi> his Body and Soul prepared and given him for that purpose, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.10. require and make necessary this Conformity. For this cause then was he made like unto the Brethren in a Participation of Humane Nature.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That in this nature he should be <hi>perfectly Holy,</hi> and exactly discharge
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50110:316"/>
his duty according unto the Mind and Will of God, was all that was required of him as to his being an High Priest. But this was not all that the estate and condition of the Brethren required. Their sorrows, tenderness, weakness, miseries, disconsolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are such, that if there be not a contemperation of his <hi>sublime Holiness,</hi> and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute perfection in fulfilling of all Righteousness, with some Qualifications enclining him to Condescension, Pity, Compassion, and tender sense of their condition, what ever might be the issue of their safety in the <hi>life to come,</hi> their Comforts in <hi>this life</hi> would be in continual hazard. For this cause therefore was he made like unto them in the infirmities of their nature, their Temptations and Sufferings, from whence all their disconsolations and sorrows do arise. Hence was the necessity of the <hi>Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> for his Office which by his sufferings and Temptations he was furnished withal; and they are two:</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>Mercifulness</hi>; he was <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, merciful, <hi>tenderly compassionate,</hi> as the <hi>Syriack Version</hi> renders the word; <hi>misericors</hi>; one that layes all the miseries of his people to heart, so caring for them, to relieve them. Mercy in God is but a naked simple Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of misery, made Effective by an act of his holy Will to relieve. Mercy in Christ is a <hi>compassion,</hi> a condolency, and hath a moving of pity and sorrow joyned with it. And this was in the Humane Nature of Christ a Grace of the Spirit in all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Now it being such a Vertue, as in the operation of it, deeply affects the whole soul and body also, and being incomparably more excellent in Christ, than in all the Sons of men, it must needs produce the same effects in him, wherewith in others in lesser degrees it is attended. Thus we find him at all times full of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and pity towards all the Sons of men, yea, the worst of his enemies, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it self by sighs and tears, intimating the deep compassion of his heart. And this made him, as it were even <hi>forget his own miseries</hi> in his greatest distress, when seeing the <hi>Daughters of Jerusalem</hi> mourn for him, as he was going to his Cross, he minds them of that which his compassionate heart was fixed on, even their approaching misery and ruine, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.28. But yet neither is this Mercifulness in general that which the Apostle intends; but he considers it, as excited, provoked, and drawn forth by his own temptations and sufferings. He suffered and was tempted, that he might be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, not absolutely, but a merciful High Priest. The Relation of the Sufferings and Temptations of Christ unto his Mercifulness, is not as unto the Grace, or Habit of it, but as unto its especial Exercise as our High Priest. And this mercifulness of Christ is, the gracious <hi>Condolency</hi> and Compassion of his whole soul with his people in all their temptations, sufferings, dangers, fears and sorrows, with a continual propensity of Will and Affections unto their Relief, implanted in him by the Holy Ghost, as one of those Graces which were to dwell in his nature in all fulness, excited and provoked, as to its continual exercise in his Office of High Priest, by the sense and experience, which he himself had of those Miseries which they undergo; whereof more on the last Verse.</p>

Others, his general Faithfulness, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and Righteousness in the discharge of his Office, being <hi>faithful unto him that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him,</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.2. But neither of these senses answer the especial design of the Apostle, nor his referring of this <hi>Qualification</hi> unto his conformity with the Brethren in sufferings and temptations. It must also answer that <hi>mercifulness</hi> which we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore described. It consists therefore in his exact, constant, careful consideration of all the concernments of the Brethren under their temptations and sufferings. This he is excited unto by his own Experience of what it is to serve God in such a condition. It is described, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.11. Not his <hi>Faithfulness</hi> then in general, whereby he discharged his whole Office, and accomplished the work committed unto him, mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 17.4. but his constant Care and Condescension unto the Wants and Sorrows of his suffering and tempted Brethren, is here intended.</p>
                        <p>Before we proceed unto the Explication of the remaining passages of these <hi>Verses,</hi> what offers it self from what hath been already discoursed unto our <hi>Instruction,</hi> may be observed: As,</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>The promised Messiah was to be the great High Priest of the people of God.</hi> This the Apostle here presumes and proves elsewhere. And this we have elsewhere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. The especial Office of Priesthood, for one to perform it in the behalf of others, came in after <hi>sin,</hi> upon the first Promise. In the state of <hi>Innocency</hi> every one
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50110:316"/>
was to be Priest for himself, or perform in <hi>his own name</hi> the things which with God he had to do according unto the Law of his Creation. This priviledge failing by sin, which cut off all gracious entercourse between God and man, a <hi>new way</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and included in the first Promise for the transaction of things between God and sinners. This was by <hi>Christ</hi> alone, the promised seed. But because he was not to be immediately exhibited in the flesh, and it was the will of God that sundry <hi>Sacrifices</hi> should be offered unto him, partly for his Honour and Glory in the world, and to testifie the subjection of his people unto him, partly to teach and instruct them in the Nature and Benefits of the Priesthood which he had designed for them, and to <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie</hi> it in such Representations as they were capable of, he did at several seasons insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute various sorts of temporary fading <hi>typical Priests</hi>; this he did both before and after the Law. Not that ever there was amongst them a <hi>Priest properly and absolutely so called,</hi> by whom the things of men might be completely and ultimately transacted with God. Only those who were appointed to administer before the Lord in the behalf of others, were <hi>called Priests,</hi> as Rulers are called gods; because they <hi>represented the true Priest,</hi> and outwardly expressed his actings unto the people. The true, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and absolute High Priest, is Jesus Christ alone, the Son of God; for he alone had <hi>all the solemnities</hi> that were necessary for the constitution and confirmation of such a Priest. As in particular, the <hi>Oath</hi> of God was necessary hereunto, that his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood might be stable and unchangeable. Now none was ever appointed a Priest by the <hi>Oath of God,</hi> but Christ alone, as the Apostle declares, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.20, 21. And how this differences his Office from that of others, shall on that place be made manifest. 2. He alone had <hi>somewhat of his own</hi> to offer unto God; other Priests had <hi>somewhat to offer,</hi> but nothing of their own; only they offered up the <hi>beasts</hi> that were brought unto them by the people. But the Lord Christ had a Body and Soul of his own <hi>prepared for him to offer,</hi> which was properly his own and at his own disposal, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.5. 3. He alone was set <hi>over the whole spiritual House of God,</hi> the whole Family of God in heaven and earth. This belongs unto the Office of a High Priest, to preside in and over the House of God, to look to the rule and disposal of all things therein. Now the Priests of old were, as unto this part of their Office, confined unto the <hi>material House</hi> or Temple of God; but <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was set over the whole <hi>spiritual House of God</hi> to rule and dispose of it, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.6. 4. He alone <hi>abides for ever.</hi> The true and real High Priest was not to minister for <hi>one Age</hi> or Generation only, but for the whole people of God unto the end of the world. And this Prerogative of the Priesthood of Christ the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists upon, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.23, 24. 5. He alone did, and could do the <hi>true and proper work of a Priest</hi>; namely, <hi>make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</hi> The Sacrifices of other Priests could only <hi>represent</hi> what was to be done, the thing it self they could not effect; for <hi>it was not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin,</hi> as the Apostle shews, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.4. but this was done effectually <hi>by that one offering</hi> which this High Priest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, <hi>verse</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. All which things must be afterwards insisted on in their proper places, if God permit. This then is his Prerogative, this is our priviledge and advantage.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. <hi>The assumption of our nature, and his conformity unto us therein, was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally necessary unto the Lord Jesus, on the account of his being an High Priest for us.</hi> It <hi>behoved</hi> him to be made like unto us, that he might be an High Priest; it is true, that as the great <hi>Prophet</hi> of his Church he did in part teach and instruct it, whilst he was in the flesh in his own Person: but this was in a manner a meer <hi>consequence</hi> of his <hi>assuming our nature</hi> to be our High Priest. For he instructed his Church before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter principally by his Spirit. And this he might have done to the full, though he had never been <hi>incarnate.</hi> So also might he have ruled it with supreme Power as its King and Head. But our <hi>High Priest</hi> without the assumption of our nature he could not be, because without this he had <hi>nothing to offer</hi>; and of necessity, saith the Apostle, he must have somewhat to offer unto God. A Priest without a Sacrifice is as a King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Subject. Had not God <hi>prepared him a body,</hi> he could have had nothing to offer. He was to have <hi>a self</hi> to offer to God, or his Priesthood had been in vain. For God had shewed that no other Sacrifice would be accepted, or was effectual for that end which was designed unto this Office. On this therefore is laid the indispensible neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Christ.</p>

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>the things appertaining unto God.</hi> 2. In a particular instance taken from the <hi>end</hi> of his Priesthood, and the great work that he performed thereby, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</p>
                        <p>First, He was to be an <hi>High Priest in the things pertaining unto God</hi>; that is, either in things that were to be done for God with men, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>We are Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. Or in things that were to be done with God for men. For there were two general parts of the Office of the High Priest: the one to <hi>preside</hi> in the House and over the Worship of God, to do the things of God with men. This the Prophet assigns unto <hi>Joshua</hi> the High Priest, an especial Type of Christ, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, If thou wilt walk, in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and thou shalt also keep my courts.</hi> And of Christ himself, even <hi>he shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne, and he shall be a priest upon his throne, chap.</hi> 6.13. that is, <hi>the High Priest of our profession, chap.</hi> 3.1. He was set autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively over the House of God, to take care that the whole Worship of it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed according unto his appointment, and to declare his Statutes and Ordinances unto the people. And in this sense the Lord Christ is also the High Priest of his Church, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The other part of the High Priests Office was to perform the things <hi>toward God,</hi> which on the part of the people were to be performed. So <hi>Jethro</hi> adviseth <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 18.19. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap>, in the phrase here used by the Apostle, <hi>Be thou unto the people in things appertaining unto God.</hi> And this was the principal part of the Office and Duty of the High Priest, the other being only a consequent thereof. And that it was so, as to the Office of Christ, the Apostle manifests in the especial limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which he adjoyns unto this general assertion; he was an High Priest in things appertaining unto God, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </p>
                        <p>Two things are to be considered in these words: 1. The <hi>Object</hi> of the Priestly action here assigned to the Lord Christ. 2. The Action it self, which with respect thereunto he is said to perform.</p>
                        <p>The first is, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; <hi>the people</hi>; that is, say some; the <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> whose interest in the Mediation of Christ, and their priviledge therein, the Apostle here minds them of, to provoke the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to constancy in their faith and profession. And so also they limit the term <hi>Brethren</hi> before used, not, as they say, that the <hi>Elect</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are excluded, but that he expresly mentions only the first fruits in the <hi>Jews.</hi> But this sense is not necessarily included in the words; the intention of the Apostle in the expression is only to give some light into the effect of the Priesthood of Christ, from the Office of the High Priest under the Old Testament, and the discharge thereof. For as he had a <hi>peculiar people</hi> for whom he made attonement, so also hath Christ, that is, <hi>all his Elect.</hi>

                           </gap>; which want not their difficulty, the construction of the <hi>Verb</hi> being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with its native and proper signification; <gap reason="foreign">

But the following word seems not to admit of that sense in this place, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Most Translations render it by <hi>expio, ad expiandum peccata</hi>; but the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that word is also doubtful. It is indeed sometimes used for to <hi>cleanse, make pure,</hi> and <hi>to take away sin</hi>; but never in any good Author but with reference unto at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement; to take them away by sacrifice, by publick punishments, by mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting themselves to destruction. So <hi>Livy,</hi> speaking of <hi>Horatius</hi> who killed his sister, <hi>Ita ut caedes manifesta aliquo tamen piaculo lueretur, imperatum patri, ut filium expiaret pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunia publica. Expiare</hi> is the same with <hi>luere piaculo,</hi> which is to take away the guilt of a crime by a commutation of punishments. There may then be a double sense of these words. 1. To make attonement and reconciliation for sin, appeasing the anger and wrath of God against it. 2. To remove and take away sin, either by the cleansing and sanctifying of the sinner, or by any means prevailing with him not to continue in sin. Against the first sense, the construction of the word with <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>sins,</hi> is objected; Against the latter, the constant sense of the word it self, which is not to be deserted. It is the former sense therefore which we do embrace, and shall confirm.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The constant use of the word in all good Authors of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no other; <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Jews</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, knew that the principal work of the High Priest was to <hi>make attonement with God for sin</hi>; whereof their Expiations and freedom from it was a consequent; and therefore they understood this act and duty accordingly, it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor is there any mention in the Scripture of the <hi>expiation</hi> of sins but by <hi>attonement</hi>; nor doth this word ever in any place signifie the <hi>real cleansing of sin inherent</hi> from the sinner; so that the latter sense proposed hath no consistency with it.</p>

                           </gap>, <hi>he suffered being tempted</hi>; not, it <hi>hapned</hi> unto him to be tempted, which we before rejected. The <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> and Expositors following that Translation; <hi>He suffered and was tempted.</hi> But the <hi>[and]</hi> inserted we have shewed to be <hi>superfluous,</hi> and it is acknowledged to be so by <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Estius, A Lapide</hi>; though <hi>Tena</hi> with some others contend for the retaining of it. It is not the suffering of Christ in <hi>general</hi> that is here intended; nor is the end mentioned of it that of his suffering in general, which was to make reconciliation; but the <hi>succouring</hi> and relieving of them that are tempted, which regards the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that befell him in his <hi>temptations.</hi> It is not his sufferings absolutely considered, nor his being <hi>tempted</hi> that is peculiarly designed, but his suffering in his temptation, as was before observed. To know then what were these sufferings, we must enquire what were his temptations, and how he was affected with them.</p>
                        <p>To <hi>tempt,</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi> are things in themselves of an indifferent nature, and have no <hi>moral evil</hi> in them absolutely considered. What ever attends them of that kind, proceeds either from the <hi>intention</hi> of the tempter, or the <hi>condition</hi> of them that are tempted. Hence God is said to <hi>tempt men,</hi> but not to induce them unto sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.1. <hi>James</hi> 1.13. What of evil ensues on temptation, is from the tempted themselves. Moreover, though <hi>temptation</hi> seems to be of an <hi>active</hi> importance, yet in it self it is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50110:318"/>
meerly for the most part <hi>neutral.</hi> Hence it compriseth any thing, state or condition, whereby a man may be tried, exercised or tempted. And this will give us light into the various <hi>temptations</hi> under which the Lord Christ suffered. For although they were all external, and by impressions from without, yet they were not confined unto the <hi>assaults of Sathan,</hi> which are principally regarded under that name. Some of the heads of them we may briefly recount.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. His state and condition in the world; He was poor, despised, persecuted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, especially from the beginning unto the end of his publick ministery. Herein lay one continued <hi>temptation,</hi> that is, a trial of his obedience by all manner of hardships. Hence he calls this whole time, the time of his temptations; <hi>You have abode with me in my temptations</hi>; or in the work that he carried on in a constant course of temptation, arising from his outward state and condition. See <hi>James</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. In this temptation he suffered Hunger, Poverty, Weariness, Sorrow, Reproach, Shame, Contempt, wherewith his holy Soul was deeply affected. And he underwent it cheerfully, because it was to be the condition of them, whose preservation and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as their High Priest he had undertaken, as we shall see. And his experience here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the spring of their comfort and safety.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whilst he was in this state and condition, innumerable particular temptations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell him, under all which he suffered. 1. Temptations from his <hi>Relations</hi> in the flesh, being disregarded and disbelieved by them, which deeply affected his compassionate heart with sorrow. 2. From his Followers, being forsaken by them upon his preaching the <hi>Mysteries of the Gospel.</hi> 3. From his chosen Disciples, <hi>all</hi> of whom <hi>left</hi> him, <hi>one</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him, and <hi>one</hi> betrayed him. 4. From the anguish of his Mother, when a sword pierced through her soul in his sufferings. 5. From his enemies of all sorts. All which are at large related in the Gospel; from all which his sufferings were inexpressible.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Satan</hi> had a principal hand in the temptations wherein he suffered. He set upon him in the entrance of his Ministery immediately in his own Person, and followed him in the whole course of it by the instruments that he set on work. He had also a season, an <hi>hour of darkness</hi> allowed unto him, when he was to try his utmost strength and policy against him; under which assault from him he <hi>suffered,</hi> as was fore-told, from the foundation of the world, the <hi>bruising of his heel,</hi> or the temporal ruine of all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Gods <hi>desertion</hi> of him was another temptation under which he suffered. As this was most mysterious, so his sufferings under it were his greatest perplexity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.1, 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7.</p>
                        <p>These are some of the heads and springs of those various and innumerable tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the Lord Christ suffered in and under.</p>

The description of them for whose sake the Lord Christ underwent this condition. 2. The Ability that accrued unto him thereby for their relief. And, 3. The Advantage that they are thereby made partakers of.</p>
                        <p>First, They for whose sakes he underwent this condition, are those whom he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled</hi> unto God by his Sacrifice as an High Priest, but are here described by an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial concerment of their obedience, which producing all their sorrow and trouble, makes them stand in continual need of aid and assistance. They are <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>tempted ones.</hi> Notwithstanding their reconciliation unto God by the death of Christ, they have a course of obedience prescribed unto them. In this course they meet with many difficulties, dangers, and sorrows, all proceeding from the <hi>temptations</hi> that they are exercised withall. Hence is this description of them, they are <hi>those who are tempted,</hi> and suffer greatly on that account. Others are little concerned in temptations; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it may be as unto <hi>danger</hi> they have not many; and if they have, it is the trouble and not the temptations which they regard; inward and unto <hi>sin,</hi> they yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto; and the trouble from temptation is in the opposition made unto it. It is reconciled persons who <hi>emphatically</hi> are the tempted ones, especially as temptations are looked on as the cause of sufferings. They are the mark of Sathan and the world, against which all their arrows and darts are directed, the subject whereon God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self exerciseth his trials. And besides all this, they maintain a continual warfare within them against temptations in the remainder of their own <hi>corruptions</hi>: so that within and about them are they conversant in the whole course of their lives. Moreover unto this constant and perpetual conflict, there do befall them in the Holy Wise
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50110:319"/>
Providence of God certain <hi>seasons</hi> wherein Temptations grow high, strong, impet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and are even ready to ruine them. As Christ had an <hi>Hour of Darkness</hi> to conflict withal; so have they also. Such was the condition of the believing <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this <hi>Epistle</hi> unto them. What through the Persecution, wherein they <hi>endured a great fight of Afflictions,</hi> and what through the Seductions of false brethren, alluring them unto an <hi>Apostacy</hi> unto <hi>Judaism,</hi> and an acquiescency in <hi>Mosaical Ceremonies,</hi> they were even ready to be utterly ruined. Unto them therefore, and by them unto all others in the like condition the <hi>Apostle</hi> hath respect in his description of those whom the Lord Christ is ready to <hi>succour</hi>; they are <hi>tempted ones.</hi> This is the proper name of Believers. As Satan from what he doth, is called the <hi>Tempter</hi>; so they from what they endure, may be called the <hi>Tempted ones.</hi> Their calling is to oppose Temptations; and their lives a conflict with them. The High Priest having suffered the like things with them, they have an assured ground of consolation in all their temptations and suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus <hi>Moses</hi> stirs up the <hi>Israelites</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Compassion unto <hi>Strangers,</hi> from the Experience they had themselves of the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of their hearts; <hi>thou knowest the heart of a stranger.</hi> And the <hi>Jews</hi> tell us, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or <hi>Officers</hi> that he set over the people in the Wilderness were of those <hi>Elders</hi> who were so evily entreated by the Taskmasters in <hi>Aegypt</hi>; that from their own sufferings, they might know how to exercise tenderness over their brethren now put under their rule.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This Compassion moves and excites him unto their Relief and Succour. This is the proper effect of mercy and compassion. It sets Power on work for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of them whose condition it is affected withal. So said she.</p>
                        <q>Haud ignara mali miseris succurrere disco.</q>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Being exercised with evils and troubles her self, she had thence learned to relieve the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble so far as she was able.</hi> This is the Ability ascribed unto our High Priest. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and Mercy arising from an Experience of the sufferings and dangers of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature under Temptations, exciting his Power for the relief of them that are tempted.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Lastly, The <hi>Advantage</hi> of the Brethren from hence lyes in the <hi>succour</hi> that he is thus able to afford unto them. This in general, as we have shewed, consists in a <hi>speedy coming in with relief</hi> unto them who being in distress do cry out, or call for it. There are three things that tempted Believers do stand in need of; and which they cry out for, (1.) <hi>Strength</hi> to withstand their temptations, that they prevail not against them: (2.) <hi>Consolation</hi> to support their Spirits under them. (3.) Seasonable <hi>Deliveranc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </hi> from them. Unto these is the succour afforded by our High Priest suited; and it is variously administred unto them. As (1.) By his <hi>Word</hi> or Promises: (2.) By his <hi>Spirit</hi>: and that, (1.) By communicating unto them supplies of Grace or spiritual strength. (2.) Strong consolation. (3.) By rebuking their Tempters and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:50110:319"/>
(3.) By his <hi>Providence</hi> disposing of all things to their good and Advantage in the issue; and what is more in the words, will be manifest in the ensuing Observations taken from them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The principal work of the Lord Christ as our High Priest, and from which all other actings of his and that Office do flow, was to make Reconciliation or Attonement for sin.</hi> This <hi>John</hi> declares, 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 2.2. <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, and he is a propitiation for our sins.</hi> What he doth for us in Heaven as our <hi>Advocate,</hi> depends on what he did on earth, when he was a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for our sins. This work was that which was principally regarded in the first Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.
namely, That which he was to do by his sufferings. To shadow out and represent this unto the Church of old, were all the Sacrifices of the Law, and the Typical Priesthood it self instituted. They all directed Believers to look for, and to believe the Attonement that was to be made by him. And that this should be the foundation of all his other actings as an High Priest, was necessary;</p>
                        <p>First, On the part of his <hi>Elect,</hi> for whom he undertook that Office. They were by nature Enemies of God, and children of Wrath; unless Peace and Reconciliation be made for them in the first place, they could neither have encouragement to go to him with their <hi>Obedience,</hi> nor to expect any mercy from him, or Acceptation with him. For as Enemies, they could neither have any <hi>mind</hi> to serve him, nor <hi>hope</hi> to please him. Here lye the first thoughts of all who have any design seriously to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God, or to have to do with him; wherewith shall we come before him, how shall we obtain Reconciliation with him? Until this Enquiry be answered and satisfied, they find it in vain to address themselves unto any thing else, nor can obtain any ground of hope to receive any good thing from the hand of God. This order of things the <hi>Apostle</hi> layes down, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10. The first thing to be done for us, was to <hi>reconcile us to God</hi> whilest we were sinners and enemies; this was done by the death, by the blood of Christ, when as our High Priest he offered himself a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for us. This being performed, as we have abundant Cause of, and Encouragement unto Obedience, so also just ground to expect what ever else belongs unto our salvation; as he also argues, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It was so on his <hi>own part</hi> also. Had not this been first accomplished, he could not have undertaken any other Act of his Priestly Office for us. What the Lord Christ doth in Heaven on our behalf, was prefigured by the entrance of the High Priest into the Holy Place. Now this he could not do, unless he had before <hi>offered his Sacrifice of Attonement,</hi> the blood whereof he carried along with him into the presence of God. All his <hi>Intercession</hi> for us, his watching for our Good, as the merciful High Priest over the House of God, is grounded upon the Reconciliation and Attonement which he made: his Intercession indeed being nothing but the blessed Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood of the Attonement. Besides, this was required of him in the first place, namely, <hi>that he should make his soul an Offering for sin,</hi> and do that, in the Body prepared for him, which all the Sacrifices and Burnt-Offerings of old could not effect nor accomplish. And therefore hereon depended all the Promises that were made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him about the success of his <hi>Mediation,</hi> so that without the performance of it he could not claim the accomplishment of them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It was so on the part of God also; For herein principally had he designed to manifest his Righteousness, Grace, Love and Wisdom, wherein he will be glorified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>He set him forth to be a propitiation to declare h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>s Righteousness</hi>; the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God was most eminently glorified in the Reconciliation wrought by Christ, when he was a Propitiation for us, or made attonement for us in his blood. And herein also God commendeth his Love unto us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. And what greater demonstration of it could possibly be made, than to <hi>send his Son to dye for us</hi> when we were enemies, that we might be reconciled unto him. All after actings of God towards us indeed are full of Love, but they are all streams from this fountain, or Rivers from this <hi>Ocean.</hi> And the Apostle summs up all the Grace of the Gospel in this; that <hi>God was in Christ reconciling us to himself</hi>; and that by this way of Attonement, making <hi>him to be sin for us, who knew no sin,</hi> that we might become the Righteousness of God in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 21. And so also he declares, that this was the mysterie of his Will wherein he abounded towards us in all <hi>Wisdom and Prudence, Ephes.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10. So that in all things the great glory which God designed in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Christ, is founded alone in that Act of his Priesthood, whereby he made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the sins of his people. And therefore.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="292" facs="tcp:50110:320"/>1. They who weaken, oppose, or take away this Reconciliation, are Enemies to the salvation of men, the Honour of Christ, and the Glory of God, From men they take their Hopes and Happiness, from Christ his Office and Honour, from God his Grace and Glory. I know they will allow of a Reconciliation in <hi>Words,</hi> but it is of <hi>Men to God,</hi> not of <hi>God unto men.</hi> They would have us <hi>reconcile our selves unto God</hi> by Faith and Obedience, but for the Reconciliation of God unto us, by Sacrifice, Satisfaction and Attonement, that they deny. What would they have poor sinners do in this case? they are Enemies unto God; go say they, and be reconciled unto him; lay aside your Enmity, and be no more his adversaries: but alas, he is our <hi>Enemy also</hi>; we are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, obnoxious to the curse as transgressors of his Law, and how shall we be delivered from the wrath to come? Take no care of that, there is no such <hi>Justice</hi> in God, no such Indignation against sin and sinners as you imagine; but our <hi>Consciences</hi> tell us otherwise; the <hi>Law</hi> of God tells us otherwise; the whole Scripture testifies to the contrary; all the Creation is filled with tokens and evidences of this Justice and Indignation of God against sin, which you deny: And would you have us to give credit unto you, contrary to the constant dictates of our own <hi>Consciences,</hi> the Sentence of the <hi>Law,</hi> the Testimony of the <hi>Word,</hi> the Voyce of the whole Creation, and that in a matter of such importance and everlasting concernment unto us? What if all these should prove <hi>true,</hi> and you should prove <hi>lyars,</hi> should we not perish for ever, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on your testimony? Is it reasonable we should attend unto you in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Go with your <hi>Sophisms</hi> unto men who were never burdened with a sense of the <hi>Guilt of sin,</hi> whose Spirits never took in a sense of Gods displeasure against it, who never were brought under <hi>bondage</hi> by the sentence of the Law, who never were forced to cry out in the bitterness and anguish of their souls, what shall we do to be saved? Wherewith shall we come before the Lord, or appear before the High God? and it may be they will be entangled and seduced by you; but for those who have thus in any measure <hi>known the terror of the Lord,</hi> they will be secured from you by his Grace. Besides, what ground do such men leave unto the Lord Christ to stand upon as it were in his <hi>Intercession</hi> for us in Heaven? Do they not take that blood out of his hand, which he is carrying into the Holy Place? And how do they despoil him of his Honor, in taking of from his work? a miserable employment; when men shall study and take pains to perswade themselves and others, that Christ hath not done that for them, which he hath done for all that are his; and which if he hath not done for them, they must perish for evermore; Is it worth the while for them to weaken Faith, Love and Thankfulness unto Christ? From whom can such men look for their Reward? Can Right Reason, or a <hi>Light</hi> within, be no otherwise adored, but by sacrificing the blood of Christ unto them? no otherwise be enthroned, but by depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him from his <hi>Office,</hi> and taking his work out of his hand; and by an horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, because they know no other could do that work, to conclude that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less? Are men so resolved not to be beholding unto Jesus Christ, that rather than grant that he hath made Reconciliation for us by his blood, they will deny that there was any need that any such Reconciliation should be made? O the depths of Satan; Oh the stupidity and blindness of men that are <hi>taken alive</hi> by him, and lead captive at his pleasure.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They who would come unto God by Christ, may see what in the first place, they are to look after. Indeed if they are once brought into that Condition wherein they will seriously look after him, they will not be able to look <hi>from</hi> it, though for a while it may be they will be unwilling to look <hi>unto</hi> it. Reconciliation they must have, or they can have no peace. This lyes straight before them; they are willing it may be to look upon the right hand, and the left, to see if there be any thing nigh them that will yield them relief; but all is in vain: If any thing else gives them <hi>ease,</hi> it gives them <hi>poyson</hi>: if it gives them <hi>peace,</hi> it gives them <hi>ruine.</hi> Reconciliation by the blood of Christ is the only relief for their souls. And nothing more discovers the vanity of much of that <hi>Religion</hi> which is in the world, than the regardlesness of men in looking after this, which is the Foundation-stone of any durable building in the things of God. This they will do, and that they will do, but how they shall have an interest in the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> made for sin, they trouble not themselves withall.</p>
                        <p n="ii">II. <hi>The Lord Christ suffered under all his temptations, sinned in none.</hi> He suffered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempted, sinned not being tempted. He had the Heart of a man, the Affections of a man, and that in the highest degree offense and tenderness. What ever sufferings
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50110:320"/>
the <hi>soul</hi> of a man may be brought under, by Grief, Sorrow, Shame, Fear, Pain, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, loss, by any afflictive passions within, or impressions of force from without, he underwent, he felt it all. Because he was alwayes in the Favour of God, and in the assurance of the indissolubility of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of his Person,</hi> we are apt to think, that what came upon him, was so overballanced by the Blessedness of his Relation unto God, as not to cause <hi>any great Trouble</hi> unto him. But we mistake when we so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. No sorrows were like to his, no sufferings like unto his. He fortified not himself against them, but as they were meerly <hi>poenal,</hi> he made bare his breast unto their strokes, and laid open his soul that they might soak into the inmost parts of it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.6. All those Reliefs and diversions of this life which we may make use of, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate our sorrows and sufferings, he utterly abandoned. He left nothing in the whole Nature of sorrow or suffering, that he tasted not, and made experience of. Indeed in all his sufferings and temptations, he was supported with the <hi>thoughts of the glory that was set before him</hi>; but our thoughts of his <hi>present glory</hi> should not divert us from the contemplation of his <hi>past real sufferings.</hi> All the advantage that he had above us by the Excellency of his Person, was only that the sorrows of his heart were enlarged thereby, and he was made capable of greater enduring without sin. And it was to be thus with him.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because, although the Participation of Humane Nature was only necessary, that he might be an High Priest, yet his sufferings under Temptations were so, that he might be a <hi>merciful High Priest</hi> for tempted sufferers. Such have need not only to be <hi>saved</hi> by his Attonement, but to be <hi>relieved,</hi> favoured, comforted by his Grace. They did not only want one to undertake for them, but to undertake for them with <hi>Care,</hi> Pity and tenderness. Their state required delivery with compassion. God by that way of Salvation that he provides for them, intends not only their final Safety in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but also that in the sense of the first fruits of it in this world, they may glorifie him by Faith and Thankful Obedience. To this end it was necessary that they should have relief provided for them in the Tenderness and Compassion of their High Priest, which they could have no greater pledge of, than by seeing him for their sakes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing himself unto the miseries which they had to conflict withal: and so alwayes to bear that sense of them, which that impression would surely leave upon his soul. And,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because, although the Lord Jesus by vertue of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of his Person</hi> and plenary unction with the Spirit, had an <hi>habitual fulness of mercy and compassion,</hi> yet he was to be particularly excited unto the exercise of them towards the <hi>Brethren,</hi> by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he had of their condition. His internal habitual fulness of Grace and mercy was capable of <hi>excitation</hi> unto suitable actings by external Objects, and sensible Experience. It added not to his mercifulness, but occasioned his readiness to dispose it unto others; and shut the door against pleas of delaying succour. He bears still in his <hi>holy mind</hi> the sense he had of the sorrows wherewith he was pressed in the time of his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and thereon seeing his Brethren conflicting with the like difficulties, is <hi>ready to help them</hi>; and because his Power is proportioned unto his Will, it is said he is able. And what ever may be the real effects on the mind of Christ from his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and sufferings now he is in Heaven; I am sure they ought to be great on our Faith and Consolation, when we consider him undergoing them for this very end and purpose, that seeing he was constituted our High Priest to transact all our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with God, he would be sensible of that condition in his own person, which he was afterwards to present unto God, for relief to be afforded unto it.</p>
                        <p n="iii">III. <hi>Temptations cast souls into Danger.</hi> They have need under them of relief and succour. Their spring, rise, nature, tendency, effects, all make <hi>this</hi> manifest. Many perish by them, many are wounded, none escape free that fall into them. Their <hi>kinds</hi> are various; so are their <hi>degrees,</hi> and seasons, but all dangerous. But this I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where particularly insisted on.</p>
                        <p n="iv">IV. <hi>The great duty of tempted souls, is to cry out unto the Lord Christ for help and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi> To <hi>succour</hi> any one, is to come unto his help upon his cry and call. This being promised by Christ, unto those that are tempted, supposeth their <hi>earnest cry</hi> unto him. If we be slothful, if we be negligent under our Temptations, if we look other wayes for Assistance, if we trust unto, or rest in our own endeavours for the conquest of them, no wonder if we are <hi>wounded</hi> by them, or fall under them. This is the great <hi>arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
                           <pb n="294" facs="tcp:50110:321"/>
for the cure of this disease, the only means for supportment, deliverance and conquest, namely, that we earnestly and constantly apply our selves unto the Lord Christ for <hi>succour,</hi> and that as our <hi>merciful High Priest,</hi> who had experience of them. This is our <hi>duty</hi> upon our first surprizal with them, which would put a stop to their progress, this our <hi>Wisdom</hi> in their success and prevalency. What ever we do against them without this, we strive not <hi>lawfully,</hi> and shall not receive the crown. Were this more our practice than it is, we should have more <hi>freedom</hi> from them, more <hi>success</hi> against them than usually we have. Never any soul miscarried under temptation, that cryed unto the Lord Christ for succour in a due manner, that cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him under a real apprehension of his danger, with Faith and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of relief. And hereunto have we encouragement given us, by the great qualifications of his Person in this Office; he is <hi>faithful,</hi> he is <hi>merciful,</hi> and that which is the Effect of them both, he <hi>is able</hi>; he is every way sufficient to relieve and succour poor tempted souls. He hath a sufficiency of <hi>Care,</hi> Wisdom and Faithfulness, to observe and know the seasons wherein succour is necessary unto us: a sufficiency of <hi>Tenderness,</hi> Mercy and Compassion to excite him thereunto; a sufficiency of <hi>Power</hi> to afford suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour that shall be effectual; a sufficiency of <hi>Acceptation</hi> at the Throne of Grace, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God for suitable supplies and succour. He is every way able to succour them that are tempted; to Him be Praise and Glory for evermore.</p>
