            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>MATTH. 5. 44.</bibl>
               <q>But I say unto you, love your enemies; bless them that
curse you; do good to them that hate you; pray for
them that despitefully use you, and persecute you.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE <hi>Gospel</hi> hath promised forgiveness of
Sins to us upon <hi>two</hi> Conditions; That
we sincerely repent of the Sins which
we have committed against God; and, That we
heartily forgive to men the injuries and offences
which they have been guilty of towards us.</p>
            <p>I shall at this time, by Gods Assistance, treat
of the latter of these, from the <hi>Words</hi> which I
have recited to you; which are part of our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64816:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Saviours</hi> excellent <hi>Sermon upon the Mount.</hi> In
which he doth not only explain, but enlarge
and perfect the Moral and Natural Law, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to it <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Prohibitions</hi> of greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
than either the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> or the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
Law, in their largest extent, did contain.</p>
            <p>He forbids <hi>Polygamy,</hi> and <hi>Divorce,</hi> except only
in case of <hi>Adultery;</hi> and likewise <hi>Revenge;</hi> none
of which were forbidden either by the <hi>Law</hi> of
<hi>Nature,</hi> or by the <hi>Law</hi> which was given by <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to these <hi>Prohibitions</hi> our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi>
adds several new <hi>Precepts</hi> of greater perfection
than any Laws that were extant before. <hi>But I
say unto you, love your enemies.</hi> The <hi>Jewish</hi> Law
commanded them to <hi>love their. Neighbour,</hi> meaning
their brethren and those of their own Nation: But
our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by commanding us <hi>to love our enemies,</hi>
hath in the most emphatical manner that can be
commanded us to love <hi>all men.</hi> For if any were to
be excluded from our Charity, none so likely to be
so as our Enemies. So that after a command to
love our Enemies it was needless to name any
others; because men are naturally apt to love
those that love them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I say unto you, love your enemies;</hi> here the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
affection is requir'd. <hi>Bless them that curse
you;</hi> here outward Civility and Affability are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64816:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
requir'd, in opposition to rude and uncivil Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
for so <hi>blessing</hi> and <hi>cursing</hi> do in <hi>Scripture</hi>
frequently signify. <hi>Do good to them that hate you;</hi>
here real acts of kindness are commanded to be
done by us to our bitterest and most malicious
Enemies. <hi>Pray for them that despitefully use you,
and persecute you.</hi> These are the highest expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Enmity that can be, <hi>calumny</hi> and <hi>cruelty;</hi>
and yet we are commanded to pray for those
that touch us in these <hi>two</hi> tenderest Points of all
other, our <hi>Reputation</hi> and our <hi>Life.</hi> And to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the sincerity of our Charity towards our
Enemies, we are requir'd to express it by our
hearty Prayers to God for them: <hi>To God,</hi> I say,
before whom it is both impious and dangerous
to dissemble; and from whom we can expect
no mercy for our selves, if with feigned Lips
we beg it of Him for others.</p>
            <p>You see what is the Duty here required; That
we bear a sincere affection to our most malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and implacable Enemies, and be ready upon
occasion to give real testimony of it.</p>
            <p>And because this may seem a hard duty, and
not so easie to be reconciled either to our Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
or our Reason; I shall endeavour to
shew, that this Law is not onely reasonable,
but much more perfect and excellent, and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64816:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
practice of it more easie and delightful, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all accounts much more for our benefit and
advantage, than the contrary: And that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>four</hi> Considerations; which I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to represent with their just advantage, and
so as may, I hope, not onely convince our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the reasonableness of this Precept, but
likewise bend and sway our Wills to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and practice of it.</p>
            <p>I. If we consider the nature of the <hi>act</hi> here
requir'd, which is to <hi>Love;</hi> which when it is
not a meer Passion, but under the government
of our Reason, is the most natural, and easie,
and delightful of all the Affections which God
hath planted in Humane Nature: Whereas <hi>ill-will,</hi>
and <hi>hatred,</hi> and <hi>revenge,</hi> are very troublesome
and vexatious Passions. Both the devising of
mischief, and the accomplishment of it, and the
reflection upon it afterwards, are all uneasie;
and the consequences of it many times pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to our selves, The very design of Revenge
is troublesome, and puts the Spirits into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
fermentation and tumult. The man
that meditates it is always restless, his very soul
is stung, swells and boiles, is in pain and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
hath no ease, no enjoyment of it self so
long as this Passion reigns. The execution of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64816:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it may perhaps be attended with some present
pleasure, but that pleasure is unreasonable and
brutish, momentany and short, like a flash of
Lightning which vanisheth in the twinkling of
an Eye.</p>
            <p>It is commonly said that Revenge is sweet,
but to a calm and considerate mind Patience and
Forgiveness are sweeter, and do afford a much
more rational and solid and durable pleasure
than Revenge. The Monuments of our Mercy
and Goodness are a far more pleasing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
spectacle, than of our Rage and Cruelty.
And no sort of thought does usually haunt men
with more terrour, than the reflection upon what
they have done in way of Revenge.</p>
            <p>Besides that the consequences of this Passion
do commonly prove very prejudicial to our
selves. For the Revenge of one injury doth
naturally draw on more, and will oblige us for
the same reason to a new Revenge of <hi>them;</hi> and
this brings on a perpetual and endless circulation
of Injuries and Revenges. So that whoever
seeks Revenge upon another doth commonly in
the issue take it upon himself, and whilst he
thinks to transfer the injury which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
upon him that did it, he doubles it upon
himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64816:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Such, and so great are the troubles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
of a malicious and revengeful tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
but <hi>there is no torment in Love,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi>
excellently sayes. To be kindly affection'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all, to bear no grudge or ill-will, no
thought of displeasure or revenge towards any
man, is the easiest posture, the most pleasant
state of the Mind. So that if not for their sakes,
yet for our own, we should <hi>Love our Enemies and
do good to them that hate us;</hi> because to be thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
towards all men, is as great kindness to
our selves as it is charity to others.</p>
            <p>II. If we consider the qualification of the
<hi>Object;</hi> it is <hi>our Enemy</hi> whom we are requir'd <hi>to
Love.</hi> In whom though there be something
that is justly disgustful, yet there is something
also that is lovely; and if we persist in our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to him, notwithstanding his enmity to us,
the enmity may wear off, and perhaps at length
be chang'd into a sincere and firm friendship.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, that with regard to our
selves personal enmity towards us is one of the
most inconvenient qualities that a man can have,
but not therefore the worst in it self. If we
could be impartial and lay aside prejudice, we
might perhaps discern several very lovely quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64816:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in him which hates us: And Vertue is
to be own'd, and prais'd, and lov'd, even
in an Enemy. And perhaps his enmity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us is not so great and inexcusable a fault,
as we apprehend; he is not perhaps our
Enemy to that degree, nor so altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause, as we imagine; possibly we have
provok'd him, or by his own mistake, or through
the malicious representation of others, he may
be induc'd to think so: And are not we our
selves lyable to the like misapprehensions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
others? of which we are many times
afterwards convinc'd and asham'd: and so may
he, and then his enmity will cease, if we will
but have a little patience with him, as we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
wish in the like case that others would
have with us.</p>
            <p>At the worst, though never so sore and cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
an Enemy, though never so bad a Man, yet
he is a Man, and as such, hath something in
him which the blindest Passion cannot deny to
be good and amiable. He hath the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with our selves, which we cannot hate, or
despise, without hatred and contempt of our
selves. Let a mans faults be what they will,
they do not destroy his Nature and make him
cease to be a Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64816:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The <hi>two</hi> great Foundations of <hi>Love</hi> are <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Likeness. No one thing,</hi> sayes <hi>Tully, is so
like, so equal to another, as one man is to another.</hi> What
difference soever there may be between us and
another man, yea, though he be our Enemy,
yet he is still like us in the main; and perhaps,
but too like us in that for which we find so much
fault with him, a proneness to offer affronts and
injuries.</p>
            <p>And there is an essential <hi>Relation,</hi> as well as
<hi>Likeness,</hi> between one man and another; which
nothing can ever dissolve, because it is founded
in that which no man can devest himself of, in
<hi>Humane Nature.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Barrow.</hi>
               </note> So far is it from being true,
which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> asserts as the fundamental
<hi>Principle</hi> of his <hi>Politicks, That men are naturally in a
state of War and enmity with one another;</hi> that the
contrary <hi>Principle,</hi> laid down by a much deeper
and wiser man, I mean <hi>Aristotle,</hi> is most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true, <hi>That men are naturally akin and friends to
each other.</hi> Some unhappy accidents and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
may make men Enemies, but <hi>naturally every
man is friend to another:</hi> and that is the surest and
most unalterable reason of things which is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Nature, not that which springs from mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
accidents and occasions. So that whoever
is recommended to us under the notion of a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64816:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Man,</hi> ought not to be look'd upon by us and
treated as an Enemy.</p>
            <p>Consider farther that an Enemy, even whilst
he is exercising his enmity towards us, may do
us many acts of real advantage; which though
they do not proceed from kindness, yet in truth
are benefits. The malicious Censures of our
Enemies, if we make a right use of them, may
prove of greater advantage to us, than the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
of our best friends. We can easily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
nay the wisest Men can hardly forbear,
to love a <hi>Flatterer;</hi> to embrace him, and to take
him into our bosom; and yet an open <hi>Enemy</hi> is
a thousands times better and less dangerous than
<hi>he.</hi> It is good for many men that they have had
Enemies, who have many times been to them the
happy occasion of reforming those faults, which
none but an Enemy would have taken the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
I had almost said would have had
the Friendship, to have told them of.</p>
            <p>But what if after all, this Enemy of ours,
this hated man, prove to be one of our best
Friends? For so reconciled Enemies usually are.
And if any thing will reconcile an Enemy,
Love and Kindness will. An obstinate good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is apt to conquer even the worst of Men.
It is hardly in the nature of man to withstand
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64816:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the kindness of one whom, by all that we could
do, we have not been able to make our enemy.
After a man hath done the greatest injury to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
not onely to find no revenge following
upon it, but the first opportunity taken to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him, is so very surprizing, that it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fail to gain upon the worst disposition and to
melt down the hardest temper. So that we
should love our Enemies, if not for what they
are at present, yet for what they may be, and in
hope that by these means they may in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our Friends.</p>
            <p>III. If we consider the Excellency and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
of the thing it self. <hi>To love our enemies,
and to do good to them that hate us,</hi> is the perfection
of goodness, and the advancement of it to its
highest pitch. It is the most excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
act of the greatest and most perfect of all
Graces and Vertues, I mean <hi>Charity;</hi> which by
St. <hi>Paul</hi> is call'd <hi>the bond of perfection;</hi> and by St.
<hi>James, the perfect</hi> and <hi>the Royal Law:</hi> because it
inspires men with a greatness of Mind fit for
Kings and Princes, in whom nothing is more
admirable than a generous Goodness and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
even towards great Enemies and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
so far as is consistent with the Publick Good.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64816:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Love for love is but Justice and Gratitude; Love
for no love is favour and kindness; but Love for
hatred and enmity is a most Divine Temper, a
steddy and immutable Goodness that is not to be
stirr'd by provocation, and so far from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
that it is rather confirm'd by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
For if Hatred and Enmity do not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
Love, what can? This is Goodness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
not only without Merit and Obligation,
without Invitation or Motive; but against all
reasonable expectation, and in despite of all
Temptation and Provocation to the contrary.</p>
            <p>So that to return good for evil and love for
hatred, is one of the greatest arguments of a
great Mind, and of deep wisdom and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
For naturally our <hi>first</hi> inclinations and
thoughts towards our Enemies are full of Anger
and Revenge; but our <hi>second</hi> and wiser thoughts
will tell us, that Forgiveness is much more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
than Revenge. And a more glorious Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
cannot be gain'd over another man than
this, that when the Injury began on his part the
Kindness should begin on ours. If both the
wayes were equally in our power, yet it is a
much more desirable Conquest to <hi>overcome evil
with good,</hi> than with <hi>evil.</hi> By <hi>this,</hi> we can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Conquer our Enemy, and may perhaps fail
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64816:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in that; but by the <hi>other,</hi> we certainly Conquer
our selves, and perhaps our Enemy too; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
him in the noblest manner, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him gently till he be cool, and without
force effectually subduing him to be our Friend.
This,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Barrow.</hi>
               </note> as <hi>One</hi> fitly compares it, is like a great
and wise <hi>General,</hi> by Art and Stratagem, by
meer dint of Skill and Conduct, by Patience
and wise delay; without ever striking a stroke,
or shedding one drop of blood, to vanquish an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and to make an end of the War without
ever putting it to the hazard of a Battel.</p>
            <p>Revenge is blind and rash, and does alwayes
proceed from impotency and weakness of Mind.
'Tis Anger that spurrs men on to it; and Anger
is certainly one of the foolishest Passions of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, and which commonly betrays
men to the most imprudent and unreasonable
things.<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 29.</note> So <hi>Solomon</hi> observes, <hi>He that is hasty of
spirit exalteth folly;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 9.</note> and again, <hi>Anger resteth in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of Fools:</hi> But to be able to bear provocation,
is an argument of great Wisdom; and to forgive
it, of a great Mind: So the same <hi>Wise-man</hi> tells us,
<hi>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 32.</note> 
               <hi>and he
that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a City.</hi> It is a
greater thing, in case of great Provocation, to
calm a mans own spirit, than to storm and take
a strong City.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:64816:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Whereas the Angry Man loseth and lets fall
the government of himself, and lays the Reins
upon the neck of the <hi>Wild Beast,</hi> his own brutish
Appetite and Passion; which hurries him on
first to Revenge, and then to Repentance for
the folly which he hath been guilty of in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
so unreasonable a Passion. For it very
seldom happens that any man executes an act of
Revenge, but the very next moment after he hath
done it, he is sorry for it, and wisheth he had
not done it: Whereas Patience and Forgiveness
do wisely prevent both the mischief to others,
and the trouble to our selves, which is usually
consequent upon Revenge.</p>
            <p>IV. If we consider the perfection and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the <hi>Examples</hi> which the <hi>Gospel</hi> proposeth
to us, to allure and engage us to the practice of
this Duty. And they are the <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>God</hi>
himself, and of the <hi>Son of God</hi> in the Nature of
Man.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Example of</hi> God <hi>himself. The</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>doth frequently set before us the goodness of
Gods common Providence to Sinners, for our
Pattern. And this is the Argument whereby
our Blessed</hi> Saviour <hi>presseth the Duty in the</hi> Text
<hi>upon us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 45.</note> 
               <hi>in the</hi> Verse <hi>immediately after it;</hi> That
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64816:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ye may be the children of your heavenly Father, who mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Sun to rise on the evil and the good, and his Rain
to fall on the just and the unjust. <hi>The same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
Seneca <hi>also urgeth to the same purpose.</hi>
How many <hi>(sayes he)</hi> are unworthy of the light, and
yet the Day visits them? <hi>And speaking of the</hi> Gods,
They bestow, <hi>(sayes he)</hi> their benefits upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful,
and are ready to help those who make a bad
construction <hi>and use</hi> of their kindness. <hi>And almost in
the very words of our</hi> Saviour, Etiam sceleratis
Sol oritur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Sun riseth even upon the most
vile and profligate persons, and the Seas are open to
Pirates.</p>
            <p>Thus is God affected towards those who are
guilty of the greatest provocations towards
Him. He bestows upon them the gifts of his
Common Providence; and not onely so, but is
ready to forgive innumerable Offences to them
for <hi>Christ</hi>'s sake. This Pattern the <hi>Apostle</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
to our imitation,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Be ye kind, tender-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
forbearing one another, forgiving one another, even as
God for Christs sake hath forgiven you:</hi>
               <note place="margin">chap. 5. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Be ye therefore
imitaters of God as dear children.</hi> This temper and
disposition of Mind, is the prime excellency and
perfection of the Divine Nature; and who
would not be ambitious to be like the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and best of Beings? And so our <hi>B. Saviour</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64816:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
concludes this Argument, in the last <hi>Verse</hi> of
this <hi>Chapter, Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father
which is in Heaven is perfect,</hi> which St. <hi>Luke</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<hi>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father which
is in Heaven is merciful.</hi> So that in that very
thing which we think to be so hard and difficult,
you see that we have Perfection it self for our
Pattern. And this <hi>Example</hi> ought to be of so
much greater force with us, by how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reason there is why <hi>we</hi> should do thus to one
another, than why <hi>God</hi> should do thus to us.
Our Offences against God are more and greater,
than any man ever was or could be guilty of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us: Besides, that there are many Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
which ought to tye up our hands, and
may reasonably restrain us from falling furiously
upon one another, which can have no place at
all in God. We may justly fear, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of our Revenge may return upon our
selves, and that it may come to be our own
case to stand in need of Mercy and Forgiveness
from others: And therefore out of necessary
caution and prudence, we should take heed not
to set any bad example in this kind, lest it should
recoyle upon our selves. We who stand so
much in need of Forgiveness our selves, ought
in all reason to be very easie to forgive others.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64816:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But now the Divine Nature is infinitely above
any real injury or suffering. God can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
stand in need of pity or forgiveness; and yet
of his own meer Goodness, without any interest
or design, how <hi>slow</hi> is he <hi>to anger,</hi> and how <hi>ready
to forgive?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, which comes yet nearer to us, there is
also the <hi>Example</hi> of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> our <hi>Blessed
Saviour;</hi> who in our Nature, and in case of the
greatest Injuries and Provocations imaginable,
did practise this Vertue to the height: And all
this for our <hi>sakes,</hi> as well as for our <hi>Example.</hi> So
that he requires nothing of us, but what he
himself submitted to with the greatest Patience
and Constancy of Mind; in our <hi>stead,</hi> and
wholy for our advantage.</p>
            <p>He <hi>render'd good for evil</hi> to all Mankind, and
shew'd greater <hi>Love</hi> to us, whilst we were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Him, than ever any man did to his
Friend.</p>
            <p>He <hi>pray'd</hi> for those <hi>that despitefully used him and
persecuted him.</hi> And this, not upon cool consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
after the injury was done, and the
pain of his Sufferings was over; but whilst the
sense and smart of them was upon him, and in
the very Agony and bitterness of Death: In the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64816:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
height of all his anguish, he pour'd out his Soul
an Offering for the Sins of Men, and his Blood
a Sacrifice to God, for the expiation of the
Guilt of that very Sin whereby they shed it;
pleading with God, in the behalf of his Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the only Excuse that was possible to be made
for their <hi>Malice,</hi> that is their <hi>Ignorance;</hi> and
spending his last breath in that most charitable
Prayer for them, <hi>Father forgive them, for they
know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last Declaration which he made of his
mind, was <hi>Love</hi> to his <hi>Enemies;</hi> and the last
Legacy he bequeath'd was an earnest Request
to God for the <hi>Forgiveness</hi> of his <hi>Persecutors</hi>
and <hi>Murderers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if any <hi>Example</hi> ought to be dear to
us, and effectually to engage us to the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, this of our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> should;
since the Injuries which he suffer'd have saved
us from suffering, and the greatest <hi>Blessing</hi>
and <hi>Happiness</hi> that ever befel Mankind is due
to this excellent <hi>Example:</hi> And then with what
Confidence, nay with what Conscience, can we
pretend to share in the Benefits of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
without imitating the Vertues of it?</p>
            <p>Can we seriously contemplate the excessive
Kindness and Charity of the Son of God to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64816:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sinful Sons of Men, after all our bitterest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
towards him, and most cruel and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Usage of him; and all this Charity exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
towards us, whilst he was under the actual
sense and suffering of these things: and yet not
be provok'd by an Example so admirable in it
self, and of such mighty advantage to us, <hi>to go
and do likewise?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithstanding the power of these <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>
to perswade to this <hi>Duty,</hi> I must not
dissemble some <hi>Objections</hi> which are, I believe,
in many of your minds against it; and to which
for the full clearing of this matter, it will be
fit to give some satisfaction. And they are
these:</p>
            <p>1. That this Precept in the <hi>Text</hi> does not
seem so well to agree with another of our
<hi>Blessed Saviour</hi>'s, in another <hi>Evangelist, If thy
brother trespass against thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 17. 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>rebuke him; and if
he repent, forgive him. And if he trespass against
thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day
turn again to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt
forgive him. Here</hi> our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> seems
not to require Forgiveness, unless he that hath
done the Injury declare his Repentance for it:
but the <hi>Text</hi> plainly requires us to forgive those
who are so far from repenting of their Enmity,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64816:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they still pursue it, and exercise it upon
us. Thus our <hi>Lord</hi> teacheth us, and thus <hi>He</hi>
himself practised towards his <hi>Persecutors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this appearance of Contradiction will
quickly vanish, if we consider that <hi>Forgiveness</hi>
is sometimes taken chiefly <hi>for abstaining from
Revenge;</hi> and so far we are to forgive our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
even whilst they continue so, and
though they do not repent: And not only so,
but we are also to pray for them, and to do
good offices to them, especially of common Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity:
and this is the meaning of the Precept
in the <hi>Text.</hi> But sometimes <hi>Forgiveness</hi> does
signifie a <hi>perfect Reconciliation</hi> to those that have
offended us, so as to take them again into our
<hi>Friendship;</hi> which they are by no means fit
for, till they have repented of their Enmity,
and laid it aside. And this is plainly the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>other Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is further objected, That this seems
to be a very imprudent thing, and of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
consequence to our selves; because by
bearing one Injury so patiently, and forgiving
it so easily, we invite more; and not only
tempt our Enemie to go on, but others also
by his Example to do the like: Which will
make ill natur'd Men to provoke us on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64816:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with a crafty design to wrest benefits from
us: For what better Trade can a man drive,
than to gain Benefits in exchange for Injuries?
To this I answer <hi>three</hi> things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is to be feared that there are but
few so very good, as to make this kind return
for Injuries: Perhaps, of those that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Christians,</hi> not one in a hundred. And
he is not a cunning man that will venture to
make an Enemy, when there is the odds of a
hundred to one against him, that this Enemy of
his will take the first opportunity to take his
Revenge upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is also on the other hand to be
hoped, that but very few are so prodigiously
bad, as to make so barbarous a return for the
unexpected kindness of a generous Enemy.
And this is encouragement enough to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of this Duty, if there be a probable hope
that it will have a good effect; and however,
if it should fall out otherwise, yet this would
not be reason enough to discourage our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
especially since the kindness which we do
to our Friends is lyable almost to an equal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
that they may prove ungrateful, and
become our Enemies: it having been often
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64816:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
seen that great Benefits, and such are beyond
requital, instead of making a man more a Friend
have made him an Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> never intended by this
Precept, that our goodness should be blind and
void of all prudence and discretion, but that
it should be so managed; as to make our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
sensible both of his own fault, and of our
favour; and so, as to give him as little encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
as there is reason for it, to hope to
find the like favour again upon the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.
Our <hi>Saviour</hi> commands us to do
the thing, but hath left it to our prudence
to do it in such a manner as may be most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
both to reclaim the Offender, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to secure ourselves against future and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Injuries.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Lastly,</hi> It is objected, What can we do
more to our best Friends, than to love them
and bless them, than to do good to them and
to pray for them? And are we then to
make no difference betwixt our Enemies and
our Friends?</p>
            <p>Yes surely; and so we may, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Precept: For there are degrees of
Love, and there are Benefits of several rates
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64816:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and sizes. Those of the first rate we may
with reason bestow upon our Friends, and
with those of a second or third rate there is
all the reason in the World why our Enemies
should be very well contented. Besides that
we may abstain from Revenge, yea, and love
our Enemy, and wish him and do him good;
and yet it will not presently be necessary that
we should take him into our bosom, and treat
and trust him as our intimate and familiar
Friend. For every one that is not our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is not fit to be our Friend; much less one
that hath been our Enemy, and perhaps is so
still. There must be a great change in him
that hath been our Enemy, and we must have
had long experience of him, before it will be
fit, if ever it be so, to take him into our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p>All that now remains is to make some <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi>
from the Discourse which I have made
upon this Argument, by way of Application.
And they shall be these <hi>four:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. If we think it so very difficult to demean
ourselves towards our Enemies, as the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Religion doth plainly require us to do; to
forgive them, and love them, and pray for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64816:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, and to do good offices to them, then
certainly it concerns us in prudence to be very
careful how we make Enemies to ourselves.
One of the first Principles of Humane Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
in the conduct of our Lives, I have ever
thought to be this, To have a few intimate
Friends, and to make no Enemies, if it be
possible, to ourselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> St. <hi>Paul</hi> lays a great
stress upon this, and presseth it very earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For after he had forbidden Revenge, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
to no man evil for evil.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 17.</note> As if he were
very sensible how hard a matter it is to bring
men to this, he adviseth in the next words,
to prevent, if it be possible, the occasions of
Revenge,<note place="margin">V. 18.</note> 
               <hi>If it be possible, and as much as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in you, live peaceably with all men:</hi> That
is, if we can avoid it, have no Enmity with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man. And that for two very weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> I have already intimated; because
it is so very hard to behave ourselves towards
Enemies as we ought. This we shall find to
be a difficult Duty to Flesh and Blood; and
it will require great Wisdom, and Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Humility of Mind, for a Man to bring
down his Spirit to the Obedience of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
For the fewer Enemies we have, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64816:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
less occasion will there be of contesting this
hard Point with ourselves.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>other</hi> Reason is, I think, yet plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more convincing, because Enemies will
come of themselves, and let a man do what he
can, he shall have some. Friendship is a thing
that needs to be cultivated, if we would have
it come to any thing; but Enemies, like ill
Weeds, will spring up of themselves without
our care and toil. <hi>The Enemy,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi>
calls the <hi>Devil,</hi> will sow these <hi>Tares in the night,</hi>
and when we least discern it, will scatter the
Seeds of Discord and Enmity among men; and
will take an advantage either from the Envy,
or the Malice, or the Mistakes of Men, to
make them Enemies to one another. Which
would make one wonder to see what care
and pains some men will take, to provoke
Mankind against them; how they will lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, and snatch at opportunities to make
themselves Enemies, as if they were afraid to
let the happy occasion slip by them: But all
this care and fear surely is needless; we may
safely trust an ill-natur'd World, that we shall
have Enemies enough, without our doing
things on our part to provoke and procure
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:64816:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But above all, it concerns every man in
prudence to take great care not to make
personal Enemies to himself; for these are the
<hi>sorest</hi> and the <hi>surest</hi> of all other, and when
there is an opportunity for it, will sit hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
upon us. Injuries done to the Publick
are certainly the greatest, and yet they are
many times more easily forgiven, than those
which are done to particular Persons. For
when Revenge is every bodies work, it
may prove to be no bodies. The general
Wrongs which are done to Humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
do not so sensibly touch and sting men,
as personal Injuries and Provocations. The
<hi>Law</hi> is never angry or in passion, and it is
not only a great indecency, but a fault, when
the <hi>Judges</hi> of it are so. Heat of Prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
belongs to particular Persons; and it is
<hi>their</hi> memory of Injuries, and desire to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
them, and diligence to set on and
sharpen the Law, that is chiefly to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And if the truth were known, it is
much to be fear'd that there are almost as
few private as publick <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Oblivion</hi>
pass'd in the World; and they commonly
pass as slowly, and with as much difficulty,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64816:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not till the grace and good effect of
them is almost quite lost.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we ought to be thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
towards our Enemies, how great
ought our kindness, and the expressions of
it, to be to others? To those who never
disobliged us, nor did us any Injury by word
or deed; to those more especially, who
stand in a nearer relation to us; to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Kindred, and to our spiritual Brethren
to whom we are so strongly link'd and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
by common Bond of Christianity; and
lastly, to our Benefactors, and those who
have been before-hand with us in obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For all these are so many special Ties
and Endearments of men to one another,
founded either in <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> or in
common <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Gratitude.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
between all these and our Enemies we
ought to make a very wide and sensible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
in our Carriage and Kindness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. And if we do not do so, we
represent our <hi>Saviour</hi> as an unreasonable
Law-giver, and do perversly interpret this
<hi>Precept</hi> of his contrary to the reasonable and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64816:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
equitable meaning of it. For whatever
degree of Kindness is here required towards
our Enemies, it is certain that so much
more is due to others, as according to the
true proportion of our tie and obligation
to them they have deserved at our hands:
nothing being more certain than that our
<hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> the Founder of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
did never intend by any Precept of it
to cancel any real Obligation of Nature,
or Justice, or Gratitude; or to offer Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in the least to the common Reason of
Mankind.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hence we learn the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
and the Reasonableness of the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion,</hi> which hath carried our Duty
so high in things which do so directly tend
to the Perfection of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and to
the Peace of <hi>Humane Society;</hi> and, which if
all things be rightly consider'd, are most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the clearest and best Reason
of Mankind: So that those things which
were heretofore look'd upon, and that
only by some few of the wiser sort, as
Heroical Instances of Goodness, and above
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64816:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the common rate of Humanity, are now by
the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> made the indispensable
Duties of all Mankind. And the Precepts
of no other Religion, that ever yet appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the World, have advanced Humane
Nature so much above itself, and are so well
calculated for the Peace and Happiness of
the World, as the Precepts of the <hi>Christian
Religion</hi> are: for they strictly forbid the
doing of Injuries, by way of prevention;
and in case they happen, they endeavour
to put a present stop to the progress of
them, by so severely forbidding the reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them.</p>
            <p>And yet after all this, it must be aknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to be a very untoward <hi>Objection</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Excellency and the Efficacy of
the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> that the Practice of
so many <hi>Christians</hi> is so unequal to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of these Precepts. For who is there
in the Changes and Revolutions of Humane
Affairs, and when the Wheel of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
turns them uppermost, and lays their
Enemies at their Feet, that will give them
any Quarter? Nay, that does not greedily
seize upon the first opportunities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64816:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and like an <hi>Eagle,</hi> hungry for his Prey,
make a sudden stoop upon them with all
his force and violence; and when he hath
them in his <hi>Pounces,</hi> and at his Mercy, is
not ready to tear them in pieces?</p>
            <p>So that after all our Boasts of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of our Religion, where is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it? This, I confess, is a terrible
<hi>Objection</hi> indeed; and I must entreat of you,
<hi>my Brethren,</hi> to help me to the best An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to it: Not by any nice <hi>Distinctions</hi> and
<hi>Speculations</hi> about it, but by the careful and
honest Practice of this Precept of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>This was the old <hi>Objection</hi> against <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
that many that were Philosophers in
their Opinions were faulty in their Lives:
But yet this was never thought by wise
men to be a good Objection against Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
And unless we will lay more weight
upon the <hi>Objections</hi> against Religion, and
press them harder than we think it reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to do in any other Case, we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
likewise, that this <hi>Objection</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Religion is of no force. Men do
not cast off the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi> because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64816:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Physicians</hi> do not live up to their own
Rules, and do not themselves follow those
Prescriptions which they think fit to give
to others: and there is a plain reason for it,
because their swerving from their own Rules
doth not necessarily signifie that their Rules
are not good, but only that their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
are unruly, and too hard and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong
for their Reason: Nothing being
more certain than this, That Rules may be
very reasonable, and yet they that give them
may not follow them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> IV. The <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>last Inference</hi> from
this whole Discourse shall be this, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
convinced by what hath been said upon
this Argument, of the Reasonableness of
this Duty, we would resolve upon the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it, when ever there is occasion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
for it in the course of our Lives. I
need not to put you in mind, that there is
<hi>now</hi> like to be great occasion for it: I shall
only say, that whenever there is so, nothing
can be tied more strictly upon us than this
Duty is.</p>
            <p>It hath often been a great Comfort and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64816:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Confirmation to me, to see the <hi>Humanity</hi> of
the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> so plainly discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self, upon so many occasions, in the
practice of the Professours of it. And set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aside all other advantages which <hi>our</hi>
Religion hath been evidently shewn to have
above <hi>Popery</hi> in point of Reason and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
I cannot for my life but think <hi>that</hi>
to be the best Religion which makes the
best Men, and from the nature of its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
is apt to make them so; most kind,
and merciful, and charitable; and most free
from Malice, and Revenge, and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>And therefore our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> who
<hi>knew what was in man</hi> better than any man
that ever was, knowing our great reluctancy
and backwardness to the practice of this
Duty, hath urged it upon us by such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
and almost violent Arguments, that if
we have any tenderness for our selves, we
cannot refuse Obedience to it. For he
plainly tells us, That no Sacrifice that we
can offer will appease God towards us, so
long as we our selves are implacable to Men;
<hi>Verse</hi> 23d of this <hi>Chapter, If thou bring thy
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64816:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gift to the Altar, and there rememberest that
thy brother hath ought against thee, leave thy
gift before the Altar, and go thy way: first go
and be reconciled to thy brother, and then come
and offer thy gift.</hi> To recommend this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
effectually to us, He gives it a preference
to all the <hi>positive</hi> Duties of Religion: <hi>First
go and be reconciled to thy brother, and then
come and offer thy gift.</hi> Till this Duty be
discharged, God will accept of no <hi>Service,</hi>
no <hi>Sacrifice</hi> at our hands. And therefore
our <hi>Liturgy</hi> doth with great reason declare
it to be a necessary Qualification for our
Worthy Receiving of the Sacrament, that
we be <hi>in Love and Charity with our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;</hi>
because this is a <hi>Moral</hi> Duty, and of
eternal Obligation, without which no <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi>
part of Religion, such as the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are, can be acceptable to GOD;
especially since in this <hi>Blessed Sacrament</hi> of
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Body and Blood we expect to have
the Forgiveness of our Sins ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to us: Which how can we hope for
from GOD, if we our selves be not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to forgive one another?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He shall have judgment without mercy,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64816:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
says St. <hi>James, who hath shewed no mercy.</hi>
And in that excellent <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> which
our <hi>Lord</hi> himself hath given us, <hi>He</hi> hath
taught us so to ask Forgiveness of God,
as not to expect it from Him, if we do not
forgive one another. So that if we do not
practise this Duty, as hard as we think it
is, every time that we put up this <hi>Petition</hi>
to God, <hi>[Forgive us our Trespasses, as we
forgive them that Trespass against us;]</hi> we
send up a terrible <hi>Imprecation</hi> against our
selves, and do in effect beg of God not to
forgive us. And therefore, to imprint this
matter the deeper upon our minds, our
<hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> immediately after the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of this Prayer, hath thought fit to add
a very remarkable enforcement of this <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,</hi>
above all the rest; <hi>For if,</hi> says He,
<hi>ye forgive men their trespasses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>your heavenly
Father will also forgive you: But if ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
not men their trespasses, neither will your
Father forgive your trespasses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath likewise in his
<hi>Gospel</hi> represented to us, both the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of this Duty, and the Danger of
doing contrary to it, in a very lively and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64816:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
affecting Parable, deliver'd by him to this
purpose:<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 23.</note> Concerning <hi>a wicked Servant,</hi>
who, when <hi>his Lord</hi> had but just before
forgiven him a vast Debt of <hi>ten thousand
Talents,</hi> took his poor <hi>Fellow-servant by the
throat,</hi> and, notwithstanding his humble
Submission and earnest Entreaties to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to him, haled him to Prison for
a trifling Debt of an <hi>hundred Pence.</hi> And
the <hi>Application</hi> which he makes of this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
at the end of it, is very terrible, and
such as ought never to go out of our
minds;<note place="margin">V. 35.</note> 
               <hi>So likewise,</hi> says <hi>He, shall my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father do also unto you, if ye do not
from your hearts forgive every one his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his trespasses.</hi> One might be apt to
think at first view, that this <hi>Parable</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
done, and wanted something of a due
<hi>Decorum;</hi> it being hardly credible, that a
man after he had been so mercifully and
generously dealt withall, as upon his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Request to have so huge a Debt so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forgiven, should whilst the memory of
so much Mercy was fresh upon him, even the
very next moment, handle his <hi>Fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
who had made the same humble
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64816:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
submission and request to him which he
had done to his <hi>Lord,</hi> with so much rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and cruelty, for so inconsiderable a
Sum. This, I say, would hardly seem
credible; did we not see in experience how
very unreasonable and unmerciful some men
are, and with what confidence they can
ask and expect great mercy from GOD,
when they will shew none to Men.</p>
            <p>The greatness of the Injuries which are
done to us, is the reason commonly pleaded
by us why we cannot forgive them. But
whoever thou art, that makest this an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
why thou canst not forgive thy
Brother, lay thine hand upon thy heart,
and bethink thy self how many more and
much greater Offences thou hast been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of against God: Look up to that Just
and Powerful Being that is above, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
well, Whether thou dost not both
expect and stand in need of more Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Favour from <hi>Him,</hi> than thou canst
find in thy heart to shew to thine offending
Brother?</p>
            <p>We have all certainly great reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that as we use one another, God will
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64816:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
likewise deal with us. And yet after all
this, how little is this Duty practis'd among
Christians? And how hardly are the best
of us brought to love our Enemies, and to
forgive them? And this, notwithstanding
that all our hopes of Mercy and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
from God do depend upon it. How
strangely inconsistent is our practice and our
hope? And what a wide distance is there
between our expectations from GOD,
and our dealings with Men? How very
partial and unequal are we, to hope so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
to be forgiven, and yet to be so hard
to forgive?</p>
            <p>Would we have GOD, for <hi>Christ</hi>'s sake,
to forgive us those numberless and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
provocations which we have been
guilty of against His Divine Majesty? And
shall we not for <hi>His</hi> sake, for whose sake
we our selves are forgiven, be willing to
forgive one another?</p>
            <p>We think it hard to be oblig'd to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
great Injuries, and often repeated;
and yet <hi>Woe</hi> be to us all, and most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
shall we be to all Eternity, if GOD
do not all this to us, which we think to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64816:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be so very hard and unreasonable for us to
do to one another.</p>
            <p>I have sometimes wonder'd how it should
come to pass, that so many persons should
be so apt to despair of the Mercy and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of GOD to them; especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
what clear and express Declarations
GOD hath made of his readiness to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
our greatest Sins and Provocations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our sincere Repentance: But the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will be very much abated, when we
shall consider with how much difficulty
men are brought to remit great Injuries, and
how hardly we are perswaded to refrain
from flying upon those who have given us
any considerable provocation. So that
when men look into themselves, and shall
carefully observe the motions of their own
minds towards those against whom they have
been justly exasperated, they will see but
too much reason to think that Forgiveness is
no such easie matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But our comfort in this case is, That</hi>
GOD <hi>is not as</hi> Man; <hi>that</hi> his ways are not
as our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts;
<hi>but</hi> as the Heavens are high above the Earth,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64816:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so are his ways above our ways, and his
thoughts above our thoughts.</p>
            <p>And the best way to keep our selves
from despairing of GOD's Mercy and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
to us, is to be easie to grant For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
to others: And without this, as
GOD hath reason to deny Forgiveness to
us, so we our selves have all the reason in
the World utterly to despair of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It would almost transport a</hi> Christian <hi>to
read that admirable Passage of the Great</hi>
Heathen <hi>Emperour and Philosopher</hi> M. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius
Antoninus,<note place="margin">M. Aur. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni. <hi>lib.</hi> 7.</note> Can the Gods, <hi>says he,</hi> that
are Immortal, for the continuance of so many
Ages, bear without impatience with such and
so many Sinners as have ever been; and not
only so, but likewise take care of them, and
provide for them that they want nothing:
And dost thou so grievously take on, as one that
can bear with them no longer? Thou, that
art but for a moment of time; yea, Thou that
art one of those Sinners thy self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will conclude this whole</hi> Discourse <hi>with
those weighty and pungent</hi> Sayings <hi>of the
wise</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> Sirach,<note place="margin">Eccl. 23, 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> He that revengeth shall
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64816:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
find vengeance from the Lord, and he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
retain his Sins. Forgive thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
that hath hurt thee, so shall thy Sins also
be forgiven when thou prayest. One man bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
hatred against another, and doth he seek
pardon of the Lord? He sheweth no mercy
to a man like himself, and doth he ask forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his own Sins?</p>
            <p>Enable us, <hi>O Lord,</hi> by thy Grace, to
practise this excellent and difficult <hi>Duty</hi> of
our Religion: And then, <hi>Forgive us our
trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us:</hi> For thy mercies sake, in <hi>Jesus
Christ;</hi> to whom with Thee, <hi>O Father,</hi> and
the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> be all <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration</hi>
and <hi>Obedience,</hi> both now and ever.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
