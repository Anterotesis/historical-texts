         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Trees,</hi> ioyned together, and those

            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:6557:19"/>
This <hi>Edgar</hi> was the second sonne of
King <hi>Edmund,</hi> who having reigned two
yeeres over the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northumbers,</hi>
in the dayes of <hi>Edwin</hi> his elder Brother,
at sixteene yeeres of age, was by an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimos
consent elected to succeed in all
his Dominions: being indeed the first
that could truely write himselfe an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Monarch of this Island; for there
were divers <hi>Reguli</hi> in those times, who
were small Kings, and had absolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over divers Provinces.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to tell you how, or
into what parts this Land was divided,
let it suffice to know so much onely:
<hi>That hee by his valour made himselfe sole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
and all the rest were his Liegemen
and Tributaries. The entire Monarchy, and
all the royall Titles of the Kingdome, falling
under his Scepter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee was the Thirteenth King from
<hi>Brute,</hi> and though a great Souldier, as
may appeare by his many battailes and
victories, yet the <hi>Chronologers</hi> of those
times gave him the Characters of <hi>Iust,</hi>
and <hi>Peaceable;</hi> for that is the true end of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6557:19"/>
               <hi>Warre,</hi> to prepare and confirme a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and setled peace.</p>
            <p>He was first crowned at <hi>Kingstone</hi> upon
<hi>Thames,</hi> by <hi>Otho</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
in the yeere of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Fabian,</hi> and others, 940. in the fift
yeere of <hi>Lotharius</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and yet
not admitted for absolute King till twelve yeeres
after, when he was againe crowned, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
in the Citty of <hi>Bath</hi> by <hi>Dunstane,</hi>
Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Oswald,</hi>
Arch-bishop of <hi>Yorke.</hi> The cause why his
annointing was so long delay'd, (as the most
write) was by reason the King grew much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amored
of a beauteous Virgin call'd <hi>Wilfryd,</hi>
who to avoyd his many temptations, put on her
selfe the habite of a Nunne, who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
was at length brought to the Kings Bed,
for which act he was by Bishop <hi>Dunstane</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
seven yeeres pennance, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Concerning those Kings whom you
may perceive to lye prostrate under his
Horses hoofes, they were <hi>Kynadus</hi> King
of the <hi>Scots; Malcolme,</hi> King of <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and of the petry Kings of <hi>Wales,
Dufnall, Grifith, Huval, Iacob, Iudithil.</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:6557:20"/>
He moreover surprised by Sea a Prince of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose name was <hi>Maxentius,</hi>
who had done many out-rage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon the
<hi>Ocean,</hi> and was the greatest Arch-pirate
that those times afforded. He also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<hi>Ludwallus,</hi> prime Prince and King
of <hi>Cambria,</hi> which is <hi>Wales,</hi> (because he
would have all the ravenous and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageous
beasts to be destroyed through
his Land) to pay unto him yearely by
way of Tribute, three hundred Wolves
skinnes: by reason whereof within the
space of foure yeares after, in <hi>England,</hi> or
<hi>Wales,</hi> both which (but especially
<hi>Wales</hi>) who before were miserably infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with that kind of beast, there was
scarcely to be found one Woolfe alive:
and so much for the Princes over which
he had s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>His Navy<note place="margin">King <hi>Edgars</hi> Navy.</note> Royall consisted of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
and six hundred Ships, (such as they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in those dayes) yet not any of them but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
either for Fight, or bearing victuall,
and munition, to furnish the Navy, which hee
divided into three parts, appointing to every
of them a severall Squadron: and this hee did
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6557:20"/>
to secure Navigators, from <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Sea-Rovers,</hi>
as also from all other neighbour Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
who might challenge any interest in these
our <hi>foure Seas.</hi> And therefore every <hi>Spring</hi>
and <hi>Summer,</hi> he in person sayled with those
in the <hi>East-parts,</hi> to them that lay hovering
in the <hi>West.</hi> And sending them backe againe
with their charge, would with the <hi>West qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant,</hi>

of which he was sole <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi>
being at his only charge, both quieted
and secured, he did (as iustly he might) write
himselfe <hi>Lord of the Foure Seas.</hi> And
therefore his sacred <hi>Maiesty,</hi> claiming this
unquestionable <hi>Title from Him,</hi> and being
his <hi>true</hi> and <hi>undoubted Successour;</hi> and
this <hi>claime</hi> being this thousand and odd yeares
not any way controversied. I do not see but this

may genuinly to <hi>Him</hi> be approbriated,
and to <hi>Him</hi> alone. But if any man shal either

Concerning his particular <hi>valour,</hi>

those subiected Kings, whom the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
calleth <hi>Kinadus,</hi> a very personable
and proper Gentleman, and of a strong
and able constitution, rowing upon the
River, when King <hi>Edgar</hi> himselfe, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but of a low stature, and as wee
phrase it a middle-siz'd man) steered the
Barge, whispered to him who sate next,
him, and sayd, <hi>Observe you not the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and pride of this Dwarfe, whom Fortune,
not Valour hath raised to this Eminence? I
vow, if I had him singly, and alone in the field,
I would cut him into peeces, and eate him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
This being told the King, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to take no further notice thereof,
than to say, <hi>That losers had liberty to speake
freely;</hi> and no question but hee was able
to performe as much as he had boasted:
neither did hee once change his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
upon him who had thus threatned
him, but calling one of his owne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
unto him whom he most trusted,
commanded him to provide two <hi>swords</hi>
of equall size and fashion, suitable to his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6557:22"/>
strength, and such as hee was well able
to weild: which done, he layd them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and the next day he invited <hi>Kina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
to a Feast, and gave him more than
ordinary welcome. Much familiar dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
past betwixt them, and more
than custome. Dinner being ended, the
King desired him to walke abroad, and
take the ayre; to which the other wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
assented, neither of them having
more than one servant to attend them:
All the way they enterchanged pleasant
discourse, till at length comming to a
<hi>Grove,</hi> King <hi>Edgar</hi> commanded those
who then waited upon them, to retire,
and leave them.</p>
            <p>When entring the Thicket, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a convenient place fit for a single
<hi>Duell, Edgar</hi> drew from under his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
those two <hi>Swords,</hi> and desired <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadus</hi>
to take the choice of them, saying
unto him, <hi>Wee are now single, and alone;
now proove thy courage with mine, and let us
try which of us is most worthy to be subiect to
the other: It becommeth not any generous spirit
to boast that in private, which hee will not make
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6557:23"/>
good in the Field: Here I am according to thy
wishes, first cut me into peeces if thou canst,
and then I will give thee leave to eate me at thy
pleasure.</hi> Which having spoken, hee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc'd
himselfe from him, and bravely
stood upon his guard; which the other
perceiving, and knowing that hee was
guilty of that language, withall, seeing
the very fire of Anger sparkling in his
eyes, he also out of an enterchangeable
brave humour began to meditate, and
consider with himselfe, both how unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
he had spoken, and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the condition of so great and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
a spirit: therefore casting his <hi>sword</hi>
away, he desired to imbrace him, and
sayd, <hi>Now I perceive O Royall King</hi> Edgar,
