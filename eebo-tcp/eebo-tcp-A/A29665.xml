            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The first I <hi>need not</hi>: For if the Ten Kings must hate the <hi>Whore,</hi> Eate her flesh, and Burne her with her fire; Will not every good Christian offer himselfe a ready Servant to This Worke, a Willing Souldier under this Standard?</p>
            <p>The Second, I <hi>cannot</hi>; without questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning my owne Diligence, or (which is worse) my Readers Gentlenesse: Either of which every Writer carefully shunneth.</p>
            <p>The third I <hi>will not,</hi> left I be injurious to my selfe: For, Humane Nature is ever <hi>Novorum avida</hi>; and the Soule of vast comprehension; the Booke therefore would seeme but <hi>Crambe bis cocta,</hi> to All that read the Epistle; and but create a <hi>nausea</hi> to Those that had already gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all, by viewing the Breviate.</p>
            <p>If it be the Glory of a King's Daughter to be clothed in <hi>Needle-worke</hi>; surely This
<pb facs="tcp:94761:3"/>
poore Birth will need more then <hi>Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves,</hi> to make it Beautifull. When it is Cloathed with its Best Robes, It will not be worthy to appeare in so Great a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. How much lesse then, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented only in a bare and naked <hi>Sceleton</hi>?</p>
            <p>The Worke then of These Lines, is to lay prostrate at Your Feet (most Noble Lords, and Gentlemen) the <hi>Retirements</hi> of Your Humble Servant in the Last <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</hi>

            <p>If you shall aske mee, how I dare take the boldnesse to interrupt Your more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Thoughts, with These Things of Little Worth: All I shall plead for my selfe is but This, the bow must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unbent; and if then This Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet may be called for, it is all I aspire to.

                  <p>This <hi>last</hi> is a <hi>Bishop,</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> Institution; of Christs allowance; setled in divers Churches, even in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times.</p>

                  <p>This is now our <hi>Adversary</hi>; One monstrously compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, of different, yea opposite Offices; and those the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, both <hi>Ecclesiasticke</hi> and <hi>Civill</hi>: for which he seemes no way able, no way fit; and that for many reasons, which may be brought from <hi>Scripture, Church-Antiquity, State-Policy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94761:6"/>I shall begin with the last, (as that I now ayme at most.)

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antecedents</hi> to his Office, are his <hi>Birth, Education, Election, Ordination, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Concomitants,</hi> (or rather <hi>Ingredients</hi>) we may call, that almost illimited power, both <hi>Intensive,</hi> in sole Ordination; Jurisdiction (<hi>Directive</hi>; by Injunctions, Canons, &amp;c. <hi>Corrective,</hi> by Excommunication, Suspension, Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) As also <hi>Extensive,</hi> over so vast a <hi>Diocesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hither also wee may referre his power <hi>Iuridicall</hi> or Legislative, in Parliament; Judiciall in many Great, yea Civill Tribunals.

                  <p>By <hi>Consequents</hi> I meane his <hi>Relations,</hi> (acquired by his office) both <hi>Vpward,</hi> to his Soveraigne, Creator, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; as <hi>Downward,</hi> to his owne family, Creatures, and hang-by Dependants.</p>

                     </gap>;) must needes make as great a <hi>Chasme</hi> in <hi>Politickes,</hi> as such <hi>leapes</hi> use to doe in <hi>Naturalls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A great Evill must it be, and that both <hi>in himselfe,</hi> and <hi>to himselfe</hi> from <hi>others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>others</hi> eye, his honour will be the object, not so much perhaps of envy, as scorne: while every man of lowest worth, will still value himselfe at as high a rate, and still conceive he wanted not the <hi>vertuous desert,</hi> but <hi>fortunate reward,</hi> a Bishop had. Now every Action will from hence displease, sith unexpected, sudden happinesse, is oft times <hi>fault enough.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now That fitting deportment, which may but expresse the just dignity of his place, &amp; answere the majesty of his high calling, shall be esteem'd but pride, insolence, and at best but affection. And from some such displeasing action, or gesture, (though but surmis'd on some groundlesse fancy,) oft his very person comes to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasted: and then adieu all effectuall good, which his words or actions, else, might soone effect.</p>
                  <p>Sure the chiefe Dominion of Gospell Ministers should be in That, the Lord and master of the Gospell so much requires; <hi>My sonne, give me thy heart.</hi> If a Minister once come to lose the heart, and affections of his people, he may indeede study some way to force their bodies; but shall scarce ever winne a soule, or save a sinner. <hi>Homo duci vult, cogi non potest</hi>: if you can fasten any <hi>force</hi> on his whole person, it must be that of <hi>Love.</hi> For sure the Gospell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, is onely that of <hi>Love. The love of Christ constraineth.</hi> This, and this onely is an irresistible Attractive, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable constraint. Thus is the Minister, the <hi>Bishop</hi> hurt, in regard of Others.</p>
                  <p>In regard of <hi>Himselfe</hi>: sudden great changes are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in Nature: the skilfull Grasier, the expert Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, will not translate from barren to an over-fruitfull soile; for this suffocates the Spirits, and destroyes the Plant. The sudden unexpected newes of a sonnes life,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94761:7"/>
(which was reported dead) was the death of the Parent, as we read in Roman Histories.</p>
                  <p>High places cause a swimming in the braine: your Faulkners seele a Pigeons eye, (when they would have her soare high) to prevent a <hi>vertigo.</hi> I conceive from this Reason, and mainely from this, it was the good pleasure of the Spirit, that under the Law, when the Church had an influence into state affaires, the High Priest should be chosen out of one eminent family, of the stocke of <hi>Levie</hi>: and some of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> are reproved by God, for that they chose their Priests out of the meanest of the people. He that is to goe in and out before the people, and is their guide, must be without blemish.</p>
                  <p>Those Horses which are designed to a lofty Ayre, and generous manage, must be of a Noble race. <hi>Non bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniunt, nec in una sede morantur, Majestas &amp; Origo plebeia.</hi> The Vapours which by the sunne are raised to a great height, even to the second Region, being of so meane a Progeny, are but the matter of hayle, snow, raine, storme, and tempest, which by Historians are observ'd to bee the frequent Prognostickes, or at least companions of Wars, and confusions.</p>

                  <p>BUt some will say, this defect (in <hi>Birth</hi>) may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in <hi>Breeding</hi>: else we shut the doores of hope, (and by Consequence of <hi>Industry</hi>) to <hi>Cicero, Marius,</hi> and such other Worthies; who though but of a low Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, may advance themselves even to the Helme, and there approve themselves men admirable, in the way of Government.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, <hi>Art</hi> oft-times helpeth <hi>Nature</hi>: some men of smal beginnings, by their vertues have deserved for a Motto, and impreso, the Poets words,—<hi>Et quae non fecimus ipsi,</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94761:8"/>
Vixea nostra voco—
But when was this seene in a Bishop?</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore, in the next place, examine their <hi>Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>; and see whither in probability, that be not as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious to their Office, as their <hi>Birth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Education, (if we intend service in way of Civill Policy) must be in converse with those who are therein <hi>Arts Masters</hi>: or in reading their writings: or lastly, and mainely, in an happy <hi>use</hi> of both. Neither of the two former, hardly both together, can make us so expert, as Practice. <hi>Scribendo discimus scribere.</hi> Long, Active, costly, and dangerous Observations, are the onely way to make a wise States-man.</p>
                  <p>Now when these Gentlemen, I meane, the most refined wits amongst them, (for others come not within our question;) designe the Ministeriall Function, they either lay aside <hi>Divinity,</hi> and so God is displeased: or else they labour seriously in the more spirituall pathes; and then the Common Weale is by them deserted. For, these two (so different) studies, cannot goe forward <hi>pari passu.</hi> A Minister cannot serve <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know other men think otherwise, (of these Studies) but I conceive the case is cleare: For sure the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of good men, Canòns and Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Councels (forbidding Ministers to meddle in State affaires) and the Answers of our owne breasts prove this truth more then sufficiently.</p>
                  <p>You shall have St. <hi>Austin</hi> (in his 81. <hi>Epist.</hi>) complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that worldly affaires distracted his thoughts from his calling: and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> apprehends, those great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecutions were but just consequences of the Clergies guilt in this kinde. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great was much troubled to feele himselfe under that load.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Canons and Councells discover their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fully in this point; so <hi>Can.</hi> 6.8. and 83. of the Apostles. <hi>Councells</hi> also doe the same; <hi>Con. Carthag. Can.</hi> 16. <hi>Counc. Calced. Can.</hi> 3. and thus still they did
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94761:8"/>
while Canons and Councels did at all study the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Christs Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>I confesse of later times, Ministers (like Water-men) have looked one way and row'd another; so that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps now you may finde Canons of another straine.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, (which may answer all Objections) let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Minister examine but his own breast, his own heart; and then let him speake.</p>
                  <p>I am sure, to those who maintaine such Prelaticall Bishops, this absurdity will follow; that to one man the whole power may be given, both <hi>in Civilibus, &amp; Ecclesiasticis</hi>: a Thing, which God thought Christ <hi>onely</hi> fit for; and so on His shoulders onely, did he place the Worlds Government.</p>
                  <p>Yet some will perhaps affirme,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Object.</hi>
                     </note> Both these compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and this by example from Gods owne Injunctions, to some of the Ministers, under the Law, in the Jewish Polity.</p>
                  <p>But I answere,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> first; There are Two maine things in which our Ministery, and the Jewes (of old) doe differ.</p>
                  <p>First, all their solemne externall worship, (at least most part of it) lay in Bodily Work, in such things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the minde &amp; brain was but little exercised; as in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Sacrifice, burning Incense, divers washings, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That which made their members uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of comming into their assemblies, was outward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse, (as touching of a dead body, Leprosy, want of Legall washings, &amp;c.) and from hence their Ministeriall watch (one of the greatest works) became as Easy, as Outward and Visible; so that even of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Levites, were made <hi>Porters</hi>; and to these, the Office of restraining unmeete persons, from their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did belong.</p>
                  <p>But, now, the Worke of our Ministers under Christ, differeth <hi>toto Caelo</hi>; and that both in publique and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94761:9"/>In publique, it is Preaching, Expounding, Chate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising, &amp;c. which require mighty workings of the braine, and inward man: specially fith these must be done with Majesty and Authority, (<hi>Let no man despise thy youth</hi>;) and yet with all sweetenesse and gentlenesse, (<hi>for a Bishop must not be fierce.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>In private, his Worke is to compose differences, (that they breake not out into publicke) to visite the sicke, to comfort the afflicted, (for <hi>Who is sicke</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>and I am not troubled? who is weake or offended, and I burne not</hi>? Yea and many more workes of this Nature. And all this, besides the care of his Family, and besides his private study, a worke too great for any man.</p>
                  <p>If you then con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ider the quantity, the variety, or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality, of the Ministeriall Worke under the Gospell; you cannot but acknowledge it great, very great, and much greater than that of old under the Law. Indeede they dispute sometimes, who have not tryed; but a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Preacher still cryeth out, <hi>Who is sufficient, who is fit, for These things</hi>?</p>
                  <p>In the Censures of the Church (though indeede the <hi>Keyes</hi> be entrusted with others as well as himselfe, yet) by his learning, piety, and prudence, he must steere all: so that hee must alwayes be awake. <hi>Caveat Dictator ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid detrimenti capiat Respublica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Will any man now say, that the Case of a Priest, and a Minister, is all one? for, suppose the Priests of old, did intermedle with secular affaires, shall any Minister now from this example, (when the calling is so vastly different) take upon him <hi>both</hi> functions? If he doe, let him take heede he be not as one that hath taken up the Plough of the Kingdome of Heaven, and then doth the worke of the Lord negligently: If so, his judgement will be intolerable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 2.</note>But, in the second place, I answere confidently, and I hope truely, that <hi>these two</hi> Offices, or Callings, did not under the Law, meete in <hi>One,</hi> except in some <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Cases, and persons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94761:9"/>First, the old Patriarchs, I confesse, did exercise <hi>Both Functions,</hi> in some sense, and in some sense they did not: (I meane as a <hi>Calling.</hi>) <hi>Abraham</hi> indeed swayed the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but his whole Kingdome was limited to his owne Family; and so he was a King, and no King; for every Master of a Family must in the like case keepe up Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>I confesse he offered Sacrifice; but then, when there was no Law, no Priest: and others might have done it as well as He, had they beene so well inclined. Thus he was a Priest, and no Priest; for in his Priestly Office, hee did but what every good man would doe; at least might have done: and in his Kingly Office, he was but as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of a Family. And so it was in the rest of the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; so that little can be urged from these examples. To which may also be referr'd, that old instance of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech</hi>; if at least he were a man, and not the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Trinity, in mans forme; as <hi>Cuneus, Molineus,</hi> and many others hold.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I finde Two Judges that were High-Priests also; <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Ely</hi>: but it seemes they were thus, by some expresse, particular, Extraordinary Command: for God saith to <hi>Samuell, These have not rejected Thee, but Me</hi>: intimating that he had particularly appointed him to judge, as in an Extraordinary Case, which may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee no president for Ordinary men, in Ordinary Cases. <hi>Samuels</hi> speciall calling appeares not onely from his being devoted before his Birth, and strange call of God, after: but most clearely in that he was not (as all the Priests were to be) of <hi>Aarons</hi> house; as appeares by 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. Compared with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. Yea and <hi>Ely</hi> too, though of <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet was not of the eldest sonne; (whose Line by right ought to have had the High-Priesthood) as the Jewes discourse at large; and of late <hi>Cloppenburge,</hi> in his Excellent <hi>Schoole</hi> of Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Hoseah</hi> may by speciall License take a wife of Adulteries; <hi>Abraham</hi> Sacrifice his childe; the Jewes bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94761:10"/>
Jewels of the Aegyptians, and <hi>Phineas</hi> doe justice by an extraordinary command or instinct, but we may not follow these presidents.</p>
                  <p>Some say that inferiour <hi>Levites</hi> did intermeddle in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affaires. But I answere, there were <hi>Levites</hi> of two sorts; out of one sort, <hi>Priests</hi> were chosen, (out of <hi>Aarons</hi> Line;) the others were like the <hi>Seculars</hi> among the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites.</hi> And these last did (as the Seculars do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) performe the <hi>Civill</hi> part of those <hi>Religious</hi> Services; and nothing else, that I can finde in Scripture, or Story.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for the High Priests after the Jewish Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was broken in pieces, I hope no body will bring them for a president: there being then no Vision for spirituall things from God, no more Government for Civill things, according to the Rule of God.</p>
                  <p>Of those times <hi>Ios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus I suppose they will get but little from Gods injunctions among the Jewes.</p>
                  <p>But some still will say, that one of these Studies may fit for another.<note place="margin">

                  <p>WEE have seene our Bishops <hi>Birth,</hi> and <hi>Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> with all his Studies, and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his Office; to which we have now brought him; onely that his <hi>Election,</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> Interpose. Of which I might speake much; but because This is the common Theame of all complaints, I shall passe it here; the rather because it may perhaps be better examined by <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> than <hi>State Policy,</hi> in which I now am.</p>
                  <p>Yet by the way I cannot but propose it as worthy of State consideration; how like the inferiour Clergie is to yeeld true <hi>Canonicall Obedience,</hi> to one (that <hi>nescio quo jure,</hi> requires it by <hi>Oath</hi>) though he be oft forc'd on them against, and never with, their expresse will; which they cannot expresse, having neither positive, nor nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive votes in election. Except perchance the whole Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of a <hi>Diocesse</hi> or <hi>Province,</hi> may be fully represented by a Cloistred Chapiter, among which are usually the very dregges of lowest men. Who yet indeede (themselves) have no Elective votes; but after the solemne dirge of <hi>Veni Sancte Spiritus,</hi> are as sure to finde the Spirit in a <hi>Conge d' eslire,</hi> as others not long since, in the Tridentine Post-mantile.</p>
                  <p>Certainely, it is to be desired, that Christians would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94761:11"/>
shew as much care and conscience in setting heads over whole Churches, as some Heathen Emperours did in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Governours over private Townes; which yet they would not doe, till at least free liberty was given to the Citizens complaint and rejection, if not Election, of the party propounded. And this <hi>Antoninus</hi> learnt from the Jewes, and Christians choyce of Their Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in Those Times: though now Latter ages are growne Wiser. But I must leaue This subject.</p>
                  <p>We are now come to view our Bishop <hi>in his Office.</hi> Though we may complaine (as one once of <hi>Lewes</hi> the II.) he cannot be fairely limn'd, because still in <hi>Motion</hi>: which yet in it selfe might be, at least excusable; were he not <hi>nimium Dilig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>His deportment in <hi>Both,</hi> we may guesse by his <hi>Maximes</hi> or <hi>Rules</hi> by which he goes; which once seene, wee shall quickely perceive how well he squares his <hi>Practise</hi> by his <hi>Principles</hi>; and how consonant both be to true Church or State Policy.</p>
                  <p>I shall instance but in one or two, for we may know <hi>Ex ungue Leonem.</hi> The <hi>Climax</hi> runnes up thus.</p>
                  <p>First, the Church hath power in all Indifferents.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Church is Judge what is Indifferent.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Bishops (and their Creatures) are This Church.</p>
                  <p>If a Prince hath power to Command the persons and estates of his Subjects in case of <hi>Necessity,</hi> and the same Prince be sole judge of <hi>Necessity,</hi> it will be no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to me, if That People be ever <hi>Necessitous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Church have power <hi>in Adiaphoris,</hi> and the same Church be Judge <hi>Quid sit Adiaphoron</hi>; and This Church be the <hi>Bishops</hi>; I shall not wonder to see those things that are purely <hi>Indifferent,</hi> made <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable burden of all mens consciences.</p>

                     </note> did they confine the pressing of these, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the confines of the <hi>Church,</hi> they could not so proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to the dispute in hand: but they run over; For the <hi>Maxime</hi> is very large. It is not onely Indifferent things in the <hi>Church,</hi> but Indifferent things in generall, <hi>All-Indifferent things</hi>; and so they may take in, what they will.</p>
                  <p>Againe, they doe really set Lawes in <hi>State</hi> matters, under the notion of Indifferent; so that all the <hi>Subjects Liberty,</hi> or propriety in goods. They compasse with their <hi>Net</hi> of <hi>Indifferencie</hi>; which they make heavie with the plummets of greatest penalties.</p>
                  <p>Yea, though they medled not at all, with such Things as these, without their <hi>Horizon</hi>; yet if they make those Things to be <hi>Indifferent</hi> which are <hi>sinnefull,</hi> (as they doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I feare) and to These <hi>inforce obedience</hi> with pretence of <hi>Church Policy,</hi> They overthrow all <hi>Civill</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>I take such <hi>Maximes,</hi> to be the very <hi>Hinges</hi> upon which our Bishops Practice turneth. I shoote not Arrowes of Scorne: For truely I have not in my intentions, either by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>outs, or jeeres, or by a factious Spirit, to deale with This Adversary. <hi>Michael</hi> himselfe would not <hi>revile</hi> the <hi>Devill</hi>: It much lesse becomes me, so to behave my selfe towards These Men (with whom I treat) among whom I know so many truely Eminent: I desire to speake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Truth.

                  <p>If these then be their <hi>Tenets,</hi> (as I suppose they will confesse them to be) Is there any thing more <hi>Vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable?</hi> more <hi>Vnbrotherly?</hi> more savouring of <hi>Selfe,</hi> than These <hi>Positions</hi>?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:94761:12"/>
                     <hi>Vnreasonable</hi>? For, allow the <hi>Church</hi> hath all power in <hi>Indifferents,</hi> (which I dare not yet yeeld,) who hath made the <hi>Church a Iudge</hi> (beyond appeale) <hi>what is Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent?</hi> Is not this, to bring <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> things all under one notion, If the Church shall judge <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> things to be <hi>necessary,</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> to be indifferent? which would to me be a sad story.</p>
                  <p>But you will say, if the Church bee not the Judge of what is <hi>Indifferent</hi>; who may be That Judge?</p>
                  <p>I tell you, asking of questions is no answering of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, (because I love to deale plainely,) I will tell you who shall be Judge: In expounding of Scripture, the <hi>Scripture</hi>; but in finding out what is <hi>indifferent, Recta Ratio</hi> must be Judge.</p>
                  <p>But who shall tell us what is <hi>Recta Ratio</hi>? I answere, <hi>Recta Ratio</hi>; Will any man, if the Church shall judge That to be <hi>indifferent,</hi> which is not, say it is indifferent? or that my conscience is bound in this case? <hi>Ex. grat.</hi> I doe confesse the <hi>houre</hi> when the Congregation shall meete, is <hi>indifferent</hi>; if the Church will appoint hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Eleven</hi> of the Clock at night, and <hi>Five</hi> in the morning (in this <hi>Latitude</hi> under which we are) I hope no man will say but that it is ill done of the Church; and that neither my conscience, nor my outward man, is bound further in This, than to a <hi>passive</hi> obedience; certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all force upon me, in this case, would be sinne in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Object.</hi>
                     </note>But they will say, this is a thing in its selfe <hi>Vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and so commeth not into the nature of <hi>indifferent</hi> thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi>
                     </note>But the Church having such power, as is claimed, who may dispute it?</p>
                  <p>But secondly, this action must be considered either in the universall nature of it, or else as it is presently to bee put in practise. If you value and ballance it in this last sense, nothing is indifferent, no substantiall, nor cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94761:12"/>
Being. For we being bound to doe That, which <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> is best, That which is so with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, will be our guide, and the Church will have, can have, no power against This.</p>
                  <p>But if you consider things in the universall nature, (not cloathed with these and these circumstances) then it seemeth to have some <hi>Indifferency</hi>; and then, if ever, it is in the <hi>Churches</hi> power; and yet even then, the <hi>Church</hi> can goe no further, than what will be according to <hi>Reason.</hi> For, for a Church to say, I will, because <hi>I will,</hi> is most <hi>Papall,</hi> Tyrannicall, and altogether displeasing to Christ: but of This, more in another place.</p>
                  <p>Thus their Tenets seeme to me very <hi>Vnreasonable</hi>; They will doe more than <hi>Adam</hi> did: He gave <hi>Names</hi> to Things according to their Natures; they will give <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> according to their owne fancies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, very <hi>Vnbrotherly</hi>; in that they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the <hi>Church,</hi> excluding all others: in which act, (according to their Tenets) they exclude all others from Salvation; for they say, in an ordinary way, there is no Salvation out of the Church; and They in this, admit none into the Church, but themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> was, upon a mistake, reproved by the Jewes, in that he made himselfe a <hi>Iudge,</hi> though in that decision he released a Jew. Truely I know not by what authority these <hi>Bishops</hi> stile themselves the representative Church; for <hi>they</hi> must doe it either <hi>Iure humano,</hi> or <hi>Divino.</hi> By the <hi>last</hi> we doe not yeeld; That is the Question in hand: by the <hi>first</hi> they cannot; for where doe the people, either implicitely or explicitely, elect them and resigne up their power to them?</p>
                  <p>Is it in their <hi>Convocation,</hi> that they obtaine this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge? That, by the Lawes of this Land, is not at all obligatory till confirmed by <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>people</hi> choose not <hi>These</hi> Convocation men, but the <hi>Clergie,</hi> and so they cannot represent the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94761:13"/>Thirdly, the Clergie have no <hi>free election,</hi> for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop will appoint whom they must choose; and this too <hi>Sub poena anathematis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Angells</hi> (for the whole Ministery of the Church) in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> seeme to receive some particular honour from the Spirit; yet not the power of a <hi>Representative Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>: but <hi>Quo jure humano, aut Diuino,</hi> Twenty sixe men shall challenge to themselves, as <hi>proper,</hi> That which is not so much as by a <hi>figurative</hi> right, given to those Angels, I know not. And is not this <hi>Vnbrotherly,</hi> to intrude my selfe, and exclude all others from <hi>Their Right</hi>?</p>
                  <p>But lastly it savoureth very much of <hi>Selfe.</hi> For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely he that will out-doe the <hi>Pope,</hi> is growne to a pretty height of <hi>pride.</hi> Now in the Papacy it is a dispute, whether the Pope alone; or the whole <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls</hi>; or a Generall <hi>Councell</hi>; or the <hi>People</hi>; or <hi>All</hi> These; or <hi>Some</hi> of These, with their joynt forces, may stile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the <hi>Church.</hi> But <hi>Our men</hi> without dispute, (like the <hi>Lyon</hi> in the Fable) challenge <hi>All</hi>: of whom the Poet is verified; <hi>Aetas Patrum, pejor avo, tulit progeniem nequiorem.</hi> And yet, whoever takes up Errour at the Second hand, will have an ill bargaine; though he buy it cheape; hee will be no gainer. Error being like the <hi>Ierusalem-Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choake</hi>; plant it where you will, it over-runnes the ground and choakes the Heart.</p>
                  <p>Thus having with the chaines of <hi>Indifferency</hi> bound up the Peoples <hi>Liberty</hi>; they deale no better with their <hi>Prince.</hi> Onely <hi>Polyphemus</hi>-like, they leave <hi>Vlysses</hi> for the last. For, when the People are devoured, Kings cannot escape. But because Kings are of more prying Spirits, they steale in upon them, with Sugared Baites: such as That of Theirs, <hi>No Bishop, No King.</hi> But of This more anon.</p>
                  <p>I might instance in many other of their <hi>Maximes,</hi> which I conceive very prejudiciall, both to <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State Policy.</hi> But I will rather view their <hi>Practise,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to These <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Indifferency.</hi> In this I shall be very short, not meaning to upbraide them with many
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94761:13"/>
monstrous miscarriages of late; the rather, because I am confident that God, his Maje<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tic, and The Parliament, will not permit them longer to transgresse in This height.</p>
                  <p>Onely I cannot but intreat you to observe, how by Their <hi>Injunctions</hi> founded on Those <hi>Maximes,</hi> They have imposed as <hi>necessary,</hi> many things that are but <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> some things that are <hi>Vnlawfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First many Things but <hi>Indifferent,</hi> they have injoyned as <hi>necessary.</hi> Some to <hi>Ministers,</hi> as Cassockes, Gownes, Tippets, Hoods, Caps, Canonicall Coats, Blackes, and many other. Some to <hi>People,</hi> as Sitting with their hats off; Standing up at <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and other parts of service. Weighty matters indeed, for Grave, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Holy, Reverend Divines, to spend their time and thoughts upon.</p>
                  <p>I might perhaps goe a little higher; though I must confesse in some other things (now prest as <hi>necessary</hi>) They have had Authority above their owne (though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, none for such rigid imposall;) I meane the Highest, granted by the whole representative State Civill and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall: which yet (with all duty to that wombe which bare mee, and Those Breasts That gave mee suck hath thought some things indifferent, which (I could scarce ever apprehend such: at least as of late they have beene enjoyned on greatest penalties. It hath oft made my soule bleed, to see the greatest sinnes daily committed, without more than a paper check, (that I may not say countenanced) while thousands must sigh in private, with losse of eares, goods, estates, livings, liberty, all; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for refusall of Those things, that at best can be but Indifferent.</p>
                  <p>But However these things may be in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves: sure I am, our Bishops have pressed them not only beyond the Laws intention, but also much against the meaning of those good men; who in the first <hi>Reformation,</hi> did (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps erroneously) what Christ once lawfully permitted,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94761:14"/>

                  <p>Yea and some things <hi>unlawfull,</hi> by their owne power They have forced upon <hi>Minister</hi> and <hi>People</hi> under the maske of <hi>Indifferent.</hi>

                  <p>On the <hi>Ministers,</hi> the Reading of the Booke of <hi>Sports,</hi> (first invented by themselves) that monstrous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious late <hi>Oath,</hi> with divers new <hi>Canons,</hi> not enjoyned by <hi>Parliament,</hi> or any other Legall authority. I might adde their bare bidding forme of Prayer, <hi>Second Service</hi> at the <hi>Altar,</hi> (though it could not be heard) an illegall Oath of <hi>Canonicall</hi> Obedience, (blind devotion) and a new forme of subscription before Degrees, Orders, Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Them</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> placing the Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Altar-wise</hi>; Railing it in; Bowing to it; Receiving at it, &amp;c. For I will now passe over their most unchristian <hi>Oath Ex Officio,</hi> (fouler than the foulest dregges of that cruell <hi>Inquisition</hi>) at one blow cutting asunder all the nerves, not onely of <hi>positive,</hi> but <hi>morall, naturall</hi> Lawes; all which (being tender of the least graine of mans liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) have entrusted us with this <hi>Vniversall</hi> maxime, <hi>Nemo tenetur se prodere.</hi>

                  <p>BUt that we may no longer be impos'd upon, by This principle of <hi>Indifferent,</hi> give me leave to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my thoughts in these <hi>two</hi> particulars.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Some call those things <hi>Indifferent</hi> which are neither forbidden, nor commanded: but here they tell us onely what 'tis <hi>not,</hi> and <hi>Negatives</hi> make no <hi>Definition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those also who affirme that to be <hi>Indifferent,</hi> which may, or may not be done, leave us as much to seeke, as the former.</p>
                  <p>I must intreat the Reader to remember, that wee are now upon <hi>Morall beeings</hi>: where the Two maine <hi>Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, Matter</hi> and <hi>Forme,</hi> can be but <hi>Metaphysically</hi> Notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and therefore it will be hard to give an exact <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition:</hi> Seeing even in <hi>Naturals</hi> (whose matter <hi>occurrit sensibus)</hi> 'tis difficult enough.</p>
                  <p>Before I assay to give the nature of it in a Definition, give me leave to present you with some kind of <hi>Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the word <hi>Indifferent,</hi> the preposition <hi>In,</hi> is (They say) purely <hi>negative,</hi> though in other compounds (as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere, inflammare, incitare, influere,</hi> &amp;c,) it beareth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sense, which they call <hi>augmentative.</hi> But in the word <hi>Indifferent</hi> it must <hi>deny</hi> a <hi>Difference,</hi> as much as <hi>non dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But under favour of our learned <hi>Critickes,</hi> I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that particle in This place wholly <hi>negative.</hi> Nor can I thinke <hi>Caninius, Martinius,</hi> or other good Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians (when they call this preposition <hi>privative</hi>) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make it wholly <hi>negative</hi>: but to <hi>my</hi> eye, to <hi>my</hi> sense; in <hi>such,</hi> and <hi>such</hi> circumstances.</p>
                  <p>When a <hi>man</hi> is said to be <hi>Imprudens, incautus,</hi> or the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94761:15"/>
like; we may not judge Him altogether, <hi>sine prudentia, sine cautela</hi>: for <hi>Animal Rationale</hi> cannot be quite devoid of <hi>these.</hi> And therefore if we take <hi>Imprudens</hi> (in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <hi>Hic homo est imprudens</hi>) in a pure negative sense, the <hi>Predicate</hi> is destructive to the <hi>Subject.</hi> So that I dare not thinke our Ancesters and learned men would give <hi>Epithets,</hi> or mak <hi>Compositions</hi> contrary to all reason.</p>
                  <p>Such Propositions are then thus farre <hi>Negative,</hi> as by way of figure, to deny any <hi>caution,</hi> any <hi>prudence,</hi> whereas indeed they must allow both; except in such or such a particular, such or such a sense.</p>
                  <p>Such doubtlesse is the sense of this Preposition, in the word <hi>Indifferent</hi>: not purely <hi>Non differens,</hi> but in <hi>such,</hi> or <hi>such</hi> a respect, it <hi>Differeth not.</hi> Though in another respect, it may, and doth <hi>Differ</hi>; even from the very same Thing with which yet in other respects it <hi>Differeth not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Etymologie I chuse the rather, because I see the Criticks, in all their Etymologies, love to give to each part (in the composition) a <hi>Positive signification.</hi> Which I cannot do here, unlesse I translate <hi>Indifferens, Differing,</hi> and yet <hi>not differing</hi>: a sense which also the <hi>Greeke</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> will fully beare; For (if by other imployments I have not lost the smattering once I had in that Tongue) the phrase seemes best applyable to a <hi>Medium,</hi> that doth <hi>not fully,</hi> or <hi>wholly, carry it selfe off</hi> from <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Extremes,</hi> but <hi>participates of either.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such an <hi>Indifferent-difference</hi> hath cleerly place in all those <hi>Natura's,</hi> which betweene two positive <hi>extremes</hi> (such as <hi>Blacke</hi> and <hi>White; Hot</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi>) have a positive <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Participationis</hi> (because it participates of both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes) and <hi>Negationis</hi> too, because it is <hi>neither.</hi> This <hi>Medium</hi> is properly <hi>Indifferent</hi> to either <hi>Extreme</hi>; from which it <hi>Differeth,</hi> and yet it <hi>Differeth not</hi>: because it is <hi>neither</hi> of the Two <hi>Extremes,</hi> yet <hi>participates</hi> of <hi>Both.</hi> Thus Lukewarme, as Warme, Differeth not from <hi>Hot,</hi> yet Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth as Coole: and therefore is <hi>Indifferent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This sense of <hi>Indifferent,</hi> being thus made good in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94761:15"/>
                     <hi>Naturals</hi>; some would borrow and apply to <hi>Morall, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall Beings</hi> also. So that betweene <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they fancie an <hi>intermediate</hi> Entity, neither <hi>Good</hi> nor <hi>Bad,</hi> but <hi>Indifferent</hi> to either. As once a <hi>Moderator</hi> in the Schooles, being to determine whither <hi>Eucretia</hi> did well in stabbing herselfe; seeing that Action Good in many respects, and Bad in as many more, concluded thus, <hi>Nec</hi> bene <hi>fecit, nec</hi> male <hi>fecit, sed</hi> Interfecit.</p>
                  <p>But I conceive, such <hi>Indifference,</hi> will not, cannot be found in <hi>Morals,</hi> as it is in <hi>Naturals.</hi> The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the two <hi>extremes</hi> are not here (as in many <hi>Naturals</hi>) Both <hi>Positive Beings</hi>; so that a <hi>Medium</hi> may really parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of <hi>Both. White</hi> and <hi>Blacke</hi> indeed are <hi>Both positives,</hi> but so is not <hi>Evill</hi>; but onely the privation of <hi>Good,</hi> which is the other extreme.</p>
                  <p>Moralists dispute how <hi>Passions</hi> are <hi>Indifferent,</hi> but they are put on great straits; and limit it onely to passions <hi>in specie</hi> (indeed onely in a <hi>Notion</hi>) which yet <hi>in sensu compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sito</hi> cannot be said to be ever <hi>Both Good</hi> and <hi>Bad,</hi> or <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Good</hi> nor <hi>Bad,</hi> but being still <hi>Good naturally,</hi> may be morally either <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Bad, in individuo,</hi> but <hi>in sensu di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso,</hi> not <hi>Composito.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the same individuall action, or passion (in man) cannot be said both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> (take it in <hi>actu exercito</hi>) in the same respects; yea, if in any <hi>One</hi> morall respect, it be <hi>truly Bad,</hi> it cannot at all be said to be <hi>properly Good.</hi> For an <hi>Error</hi> or <hi>Defect</hi> in any one <hi>Morall</hi> (though but so much as a <hi>Circumstance</hi>) truly donominates the <hi>whole acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Evill</hi>; but onely a perfect and universall concatenation of all essentials and circumstantials too, denominates it <hi>Good.</hi> Even as in <hi>Logicke,</hi> any one negative proposition makes the <hi>whole Syllogisme</hi> such; when to an <hi>Affirm'd</hi> Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme, every part must be affirm'd. So 'tis in <hi>Morals</hi> too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And hence perhaps the old Stoickes affirm'd, <hi>Omnia pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata</hi> to be <hi>paria</hi>

It is well observed by <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that as a Body is not perfectly set <hi>in suo bene esse naturali,</hi> by a bare <hi>forme</hi> without <hi>Accidents</hi>; so neither an Act <hi>in bene esse morali,</hi> by onely <hi>object</hi> and <hi>end,</hi> rightly fixed: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept also every <hi>Morall circumstance,</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

rne</hi> Climates.</p>
                  <p>From all these premises, we will now assay to draw some conclusions that may helpe us in judging what may be <hi>Indifferent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, it must be in it selfe <hi>Good, whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y Good.</hi> For if it have but one dram of <hi>Evill,</hi> it is <hi>wholly Bad</hi> (as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before) and so not <hi>Indifferent.</hi> We have found the <hi>Genus</hi> of it; it is <hi>Good, Lawfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the second place, to make our approach a little neerer (if we can) and to descend more particularly into the <hi>Differing nature</hi> of it; We must confesse it lies mainly in the seeming <hi>equality</hi> of <hi>Vse.</hi> So that it may be thus described, a thing <hi>Lawfull</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> which (as we think) <hi>may be Vsed</hi> or <hi>not: may</hi> or <hi>may not</hi> be done.</p>
                  <p>But here wee must take heed we lose not our selves in <hi>Termes</hi>: For if they meane that some things at one time may be done, and at another may not; I yeeld this True:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94761:16"/>
For perhaps This yeare I may not marry, and yet next yeare I may, and in some circumstances must, else I sinne. But in this Hypothesis Marriage is not generally <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> because not generally <hi>Lawfull</hi>; but at some time lawfull, at sometime not.</p>
                  <p>If they meane the same Thing, (the same Act) at one and the same time by the same person, <hi>may,</hi> or <hi>may not,</hi> be done <hi>ad placitum,</hi> without offence: I must crave leave to dissent, till I see more, than now I see.</p>
                  <p>For I conceive two direct contraries, (as to marry, and not marry) at the same time, to the same person, cannot be so equally circumstantiated, that one of them, at least in one circumstance (which is enough) shall not be <hi>Better</hi> than the other. And if one be <hi>Best,</hi> I conceive it past scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that I may not reject that <hi>Best,</hi> and chuse the <hi>Worst.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, if I mistake not, I am neere the <hi>Apex</hi> of this question, which yet (<hi>Pernassus</hi>-like) hath a double <hi>Vertex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The one is, whether in two contraries (as <hi>Doing, not doing</hi>) one must not needs be <hi>Better</hi> than the other.</p>
                  <p>The second is, whether in this <hi>case</hi> I am not tied to take, and doe the <hi>Best,</hi> but am equally <hi>Indifferent</hi> to <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I will begin with this last first. In this I know I have many opposites, who stifly maintaine, that <hi>Optimun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>I thinke it a subtile dispute, worth the discussing; for if they meane thus, That which is <hi>Best,</hi> is not at all times <hi>Lawfull</hi> to be done while it is best; This sense cannot be true: for here the <hi>Predicate</hi> is destructive to the <hi>subject</hi>; For, that which is <hi>unlawfull</hi> is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

must consider, what is Best possible to <hi>me</hi>; because I cannot do the Best <hi>in Re.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I suppose then they meane that which is <hi>Best,</hi> and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to me, is not still <hi>necessary</hi> to be done, even while it is best: but though I <hi>may do</hi> it, yet I may also leave it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> and do that which is <hi>lesse</hi> good.</p>
                  <p>Here also they may deceive us with <hi>Termes.</hi> For they may meane either <hi>Best</hi> in <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>Best</hi> to <hi>appearance.</hi> And when these two cannot be reconciled by all my search, I must consider that which <hi>seemes</hi> (though perhaps <hi>is not</hi>) the <hi>Best.</hi>

                  <p>We shall now soone joyne issue. And the case is; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when I must of necessity either <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>not doe,</hi> or when I must do either <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That</hi>; I be not bound to do what <hi>is Best,</hi> (or at least on exactest search, <hi>seemes</hi> Best) if it be <hi>possible</hi> to be Done by mee.</p>
                  <p>If they take the <hi>Negative</hi> part (of this question so sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) I hope yet they will give mee leave to hold the <hi>affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,</hi> and yet without offence, till my judgement may be better inform'd.</p>
                  <p>My grounds briefly are these, First it is <hi>Lawfull</hi> to doe This <hi>Best</hi>; else it is not Good, much lesse Best, as was said before. Againe, it is <hi>expedient</hi> to do this <hi>Best</hi>: or else some thing (at least some one Ciocumstaice of <hi>Expedience</hi>) is in the other good, which is not in This, and so <hi>This</hi> is not <hi>Best,</hi> but <hi>That,</hi> at this time, though at another time, perhaps, <hi>This</hi> may be <hi>Best,</hi> it is not <hi>Best</hi> now, because not best expedient and most convenient.</p>
                  <p>And now this case comes not to our question, which is of <hi>Best</hi> in all circumstances; for wee know one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance may so alter the case, that now <hi>That</hi> may be <hi>worst, which else</hi> would have beene <hi>best,</hi> as was said before. So that at this time, <hi>This</hi> cannot be <hi>Better</hi> than <hi>That,</hi> except <hi>This</hi> be not onely in it selfe <hi>expedient,</hi> but also <hi>more</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient than <hi>That</hi> is at this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94761:17"/>I demand now how I can be determined to That which is <hi>lesse expedient</hi>? though supposed <hi>equally lawfull</hi> by <hi>Right Reason?</hi> All Philosophers yeeld, (and it needeth no dispute) that the <hi>Vnderst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nding</hi> rectified still dictates to the <hi>Will Optimum faciendum.</hi> And how is it possible I should do well, if I follow not the Dictate of <hi>Right Reason? Video meliora, proboque; deteriora sequor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See now to what a strait I am brought; If I follow the Dictate of <hi>Right Reason,</hi> I must still doe what is Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as now <hi>Best.</hi> And Right Reason must still (where some Action is necessary) dictate <hi>That</hi> to be done, which <hi>is</hi> (at least, <hi>seemes</hi>) Best.</p>
                  <p>For, if Right Reason should ever (though but once) dictate, that This which is Best, is not Now to be done, but somewhat <hi>Worse</hi>; It may much be suspected Right Reason may <hi>never</hi> dictate the <hi>Best</hi> to be done.</p>
                  <p>For, by this Case (of one such Dictate) it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that when ever <hi>Reason</hi> doth happen to dictate Right, it is but by <hi>chance,</hi> or some <hi>fancy</hi> of its owne; not by any certaine constant Rule, taken from the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Things,</hi> rightly stated in such and such circumstances; For if so, it must still judge <hi>eodem modo,</hi> of That which is so circumstantiated. And, if it once vary from this Rule, it will seeme to have no Rule, but its owne fancy. And in this Case, we shall bee under <hi>Reason,</hi> as under a most <hi>corrupt Iudge,</hi> that will follow no constant Rule (founded on the Nature of Things) but onely his own humor; which will give very Different judgements on the very same, or like Cases, in all circumstances.</p>
                  <p>I see but Two Things can helpe them out of This straite. Either, that (though Right Reason cannot but dictate that the Best in all circumstances, must still bee done, yet) we are not bound to follow <hi>Right Reasons Dictates,</hi> when we see them. Or else, we be not bound to <hi>aske</hi> Right Reason, what it will dictate; but may doe (hand over head as they speake) without any Dictate of Reason, Right or Wrong.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:94761:18"/>But, Both These seeme to me very strange Doctrine. For,</p>
                  <p>First, If I may but once goe against the Dictate of <hi>Right Reason,</hi> and yet not sinne; I may goe ten thousand times, yea <hi>Ever</hi> against it; and so all my acts may be <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationall,</hi> and yet not sinfull: a strange Tenet: and sure a Case never to be found but in a distracted man; who sinnes not though all his Acts be against Reason, because His Reason is not able to direct him; or at least He not able to follow Reason; and in this case God requires it not.</p>
                  <p>And the Case is even the same; when I Act without asking Reasons Dictate, as if I acted against Reasons Dictate. For till I see I act <hi>with,</hi> for ought I know, I act <hi>against</hi> Right Reason; and so I sinne.</p>
                  <p>Not yet, that I thinke a man bound before Every (though the most common) Action, to stay disputing for some houres or dayes, till Reason hath given its fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Dictate. For, this were to turne all practise into bare and nice Speculation. There are many Things by common use, and by themselves, so cleare that at first view Reason presently determines. Yet if there rise but the least scruple at the first glimps; Then, man is bound to discusse it, till Reason rectifi'd dictate the Action Lawfull, and Best to be done: And till This Dictate, the Act must be suspended. For I still thought That a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Maxime in State policy; first, to <hi>Doe</hi> matters (not like to sound well) and then to <hi>dispute</hi> Them: and it sounds worse in Matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>I have done with the first Great Question, whether <hi>Optimum sit semper faciendum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come to the Next, whether amongst divers Things (to be done) There be still One <hi>Optimum.</hi> I must meane whether there be any <hi>Optimum,</hi> for more than <hi>One</hi> there cannot be at one time.</p>
                  <p>We may briefely State the Question Thus. Whether at one any time Two, or more Things, (suppose to Marry,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94761:18"/>
and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t to Marry) can possibly be so <hi>Equally Good</hi> to me, that <hi>One</hi> of them is not Better than the <hi>Other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Thinke not. For, I dispute thus; I must be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to one of these Two, (having no <hi>medium</hi>) I must Marry, or not Marry. Now I aske what shall determine me to either? Right Reason (they must answere) or my owne Fancy, Will, or other Thing.</p>
                  <p>I rejoyne; if Right Reason determine me; either it doth so on no good ground; (and then I doe a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse unreasonable Act, in following Reason) or on some Ground, whose foundation is in <hi>Re.</hi> For, if we once grant <hi>Reason</hi> any Rule, or Ground, but that Certaine, Constant Truth, which is fixt in the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Things</hi>; we shall make it, of all Judges, most uncertaine, most corrupt. If once I see my <hi>Reason</hi> judge point blancke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Reall Truth,</hi> I shall suspect it still.</p>
                  <p>Well then, it must be granted, Right Reason hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me (not to Marry) on some good Ground, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Nature of Marriage; (not in Generall, for This would deceive me, but particularly considered with all circumstances <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc;</hi>) so that it must also be granted, There was one or more circumstances, which made Marriage more unfit than <hi>non</hi> Marriage (else Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath <hi>made,</hi> not found a Ground <hi>in Re,</hi> which it must never doe;) <hi>Ergo,</hi> of Marriage and Non-Marriage, One still is <hi>Best in re,</hi> (at least to Reasons eye) else Reason doth unreasonably determine me not to Marry, or to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>And if Right Reason have not, or cannot, determine me; to which side so ever I incline, and rest, I sinne; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I act <hi>Vnreasonably</hi>: being determined by humour, fancy, passion, a wilfull Will, and not Right Reason; The Candle of God, which He hath lighted in Man, left man groaping in the Darke should stumble, and fall.</p>
                  <p>I may now step a little higher; and affirme, that of Two Contraries, or any Two Extreames, <hi>Both</hi> are so farre from being <hi>Equally</hi> Good, that <hi>pro hoc statu,</hi> in these
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94761:19"/>
Circumstances, Both cannot be Good at all or Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>For, if of These Two, One must be <hi>Best,</hi> and but One; and this One now necessary to be done (because Best) as was proved before; It will follow that the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame is now, in these circumstances, not Good at all to me; because unlawfull to be done, while now there is a better in view; though else in it selfe, with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, it would have beene Lawfull, Good, and Best.</p>
                  <p>If Right Reason determine it be better not to Marry; at this time, and I be still bound to doe what Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shall dictate Best (as was prov'd before:) Now, in these Circumstances, Marriage is unlawfull to me, and so <hi>not Good at all,</hi> at this time, because lesse Good than Non-Marriage. so <hi>Achitophels</hi> Counsell was Bad, being not good for That time, because not Best.</p>
                  <p>For as Moralists say, if it be possible Man could be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to chuse <hi>One</hi> of <hi>Two</hi> Evills; in That case the <hi>Lesse evill,</hi> would be Good: So, when I am necessitated to chuse <hi>One</hi> out of <hi>two</hi> (supposed) <hi>Goods,</hi> the <hi>lesse Good</hi> would be <hi>Evill,</hi> and unlawfull to me, who am still bound (for ought I can yet see) to doe <hi>Optimum pro hoc statu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conclusion</hi> I ayme at, through all these <hi>Premisses</hi> is This. There is no One Thing, no One Act, in all the World, That I <hi>may doe,</hi> or <hi>not doe, ad placitum,</hi> all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances considered.</p>
                  <p>For, This Act (so propounded) either is Best for that time, and so must needes be done: or not Best, and so must not be done; because in these Circumstances, at This Time, it is <hi>Vnlawfull</hi>; as not being <hi>Good</hi> while a <hi>Better</hi> is in eye: as hath I hopefully beene proved.</p>
                  <p>From This, results our finall Determination concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Indifference</hi> (which is our Subject in hand:) No Thing, No Act, is <hi>Indifferent</hi> in <hi>Se,</hi> in <hi>Re</hi>: but either <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> to be done (if <hi>Best</hi>) or <hi>unlawfull</hi> to be done, if <hi>Bad,</hi> or <hi>lesse Good, pro hoc statu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What shall we say then; hath the World talked so
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94761:19"/>
much of <hi>Indifference,</hi> and the <hi>power in Indifference,</hi> And yet no <hi>Indifference,</hi> at all, be in the World?</p>
                  <p>Give me leave here freely to propound my owne thoughts, without offence; being still more desirous to learne, than to Dictate.</p>
                  <p>I conceive that all the <hi>Indifference</hi> (in the world) lyes in our Understandings, and the Darkenesse thereof, (which makes them wavering sometimes, and doubtfull whether to doe or not, so that in Them seemes some <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference</hi> to either extreme) but there is none in the things themselves, or Actions; which are still either <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,</hi> or <hi>necessary</hi> (if Lawfull, at this time in these Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances;) never <hi>Indifferent</hi> in Themselves.</p>
                  <p>As then it is in the point of <hi>Contingence,</hi> every thing is either True or False; Certainly <hi>to Be,</hi> or <hi>not to Be</hi>; and in one of these still <hi>Necessary</hi> in <hi>Re,</hi> and never <hi>Contingent</hi>; yet to <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e,</hi> (who cannot see the whole <hi>Chaine</hi> of <hi>Causes</hi>) some things <hi>seeme Contingent,</hi> that <hi>are necessary.</hi> So for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference.</hi> All Things, All Acts, are <hi>in Re,</hi> either <hi>Necessary</hi> to be done, or <hi>Vnlawfull</hi>; but to my blind judgement, (while I cannot discerne whether I may Act, or may not) some things <hi>Seeme,</hi> but <hi>are not Indifferent</hi>; and so we thinke (but erroneously) that These may be done, or not, as we please.</p>
                  <p>For example sake, suppose an unskilfull Physitian have two <hi>Simples</hi> by him, one of which is poyson, and the other a pretious Cordiall; will any man living say, These are <hi>Indifferent</hi> for a sick mans cure; so as he may use them, or not, <hi>ad placitum,</hi> without perill? And yet now suppose the Physitian ignorant of both their Natures: they may be said to be <hi>Indifferent</hi> (though not in themselves) yet to Him; who not knowing either, is <hi>Indifferent</hi> to Both; and thinkes he may apply which he will, without offence; yet if he apply the one he erres, because 'tis <hi>poyson.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So it is in all the Things, or Acts we thinke <hi>Indifferent.</hi> In themselves they are poysons, or cordials, very Good (and so <hi>necessary</hi>) or very Bad, and so unlawfull: But
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94761:20"/>
while our judgements are clouded, so that we see not the Nature of these Objects, or Acts: we are <hi>Indifferent</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wavering) betweene <hi>Them</hi>; but <hi>They</hi> are not so <hi>in se</hi>; or Really to us.</p>
                  <p>I may conclude then, Nothing is Indifferent <hi>in Re, in se</hi>; but to our <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> some things seeme so, for want of Good light.</p>

                  <p>I Have now done with the Nature of <hi>Indifference,</hi> in which I have beene the more large, because I found it more abstruse than it seemed at first view. I come now shortly to examine <hi>What power may determine in Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and <hi>where this Power is fixed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To All, I may answer briefly thus. <hi>By Divine Right, This Power is, and is not, in the Church.</hi> The Church hath, and hath not, power in <hi>Indifferent</hi> things.</p>
                  <p>First, the <hi>Church</hi> hath <hi>no power</hi> to make any one thing <hi>Indifferent</hi> in it selfe: (that is, to make it, at one, and the same time, lawfull to be done, or left undone, <hi>positis omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus circumstantiis.</hi>) For all Things and Acts, are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves necessarily Good or Bad, and cannot be Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>in Re,</hi> as hath beene proved at large.</p>
                  <p>Againe, we cannot say the Church hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what is <hi>Indifferent.</hi> If at least All <hi>Indifference</hi> comes onely from the <hi>Darknesse</hi> of our <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> (as before;) It then lyes not in the power of all other men living, to determine what <hi>seemes Indifferent</hi> to one mans Understanding, since He may perhaps not see, what they all see; <hi>&amp; e comrario.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are now reduced into a narrow compasse, having onely left to be considered, Those Things which <hi>general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeme Indifferent</hi> (For there is no <hi>Indifference in Re,</hi> but onely in <hi>appearance</hi> unto us;) because neither Scripture
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94761:20"/>
without, or light within, hath fully cleared, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such things should be done, or not: or if done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in such, or such a time, place, &amp;c. and in such cases only Things <hi>seeme Indifferent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in These <hi>seeming Indifferents</hi> (which sure are not so many as some pretend) the <hi>Church</hi> hath, and yet hath not, power to determine.</p>
                  <p>All (though but Seeming) <hi>Indifference,</hi> is as it were <hi>in medio,</hi> betweene Two <hi>Extremes,</hi> as was said before. Now, when <hi>Neither</hi> of these extremes is <hi>necessary,</hi> There, (speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where <hi>Both</hi> extremes are doubtfull) I conceive the Church hath not power to determine to <hi>Either</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme.</p>
                  <p>As suppose <hi>Blacke</hi> and <hi>White</hi> colours should be <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> whether both or either, or neither, were <hi>Lawfull</hi>: In this case (for ought I yet see) the <hi>Church</hi> hath no power to determine (any one so doubting) to either <hi>Blacke</hi> or <hi>white.</hi> The Reason is, because Neither of These extremes are <hi>necessary,</hi> there being so many <hi>intermediate</hi> colours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Both.</p>
                  <p>But when One of the extremes (betweene which we waver as <hi>Indifferent)</hi> is <hi>necessary</hi> to be imbraced, (as in most cases it is;) Here all the Power Lawfull, I conceive, can do no more but resolve which of the Two extremes is <hi>Best</hi>; whether it be safest to Do, or not to Do (whereof one is necessary;) to do so, or so, if I must do.</p>
                  <p>This Power (whereever it be) must be very warily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised: since of All <hi>Two</hi> extremes, <hi>onely One</hi> (as was proved) can be <hi>Lawfull</hi>: so that one is wholsome, but the other poyson.</p>
                  <p>In These also the Church <hi>hath,</hi> and <hi>hath not</hi> power. If you please, Thus; It hath a power <hi>Iudicative,</hi> (or if you will <hi>Iuridicall,</hi>) but not <hi>Legislative.</hi> It may and must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; (for ought I know, beyond all externall appeale) yet againe it must not determine, <hi>What,</hi> and <hi>How it Will, because it Will.</hi> No, It also hath its bounds, a Rule to goe by, a constant Law (and that <hi>non factam, sed natam) Right Reason.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:94761:21"/>So that the Church is like the <hi>Iudges</hi> on the Bench in <hi>Westminster Hall</hi> (that have a <hi>Iudicative,</hi> or <hi>Declarative</hi> power, being entrusted with the explication, application, &amp; execution of the Laws:) but not as the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> who have a <hi>Legislative</hi> power: and so not only to declare what is Law, but to make new Laws. And yet even This High Court hath one Rule, or Law to go by, (and this is also the Law of the Church, even <hi>Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>) And if they or the Church, should erre from This Rule, (which God forbid) we must obey indeed, but <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiendo,</hi> I will, I must give <hi>Passive</hi> obedience to Lawfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; even there where I dare not, I cannot, I may not, give obedience <hi>Active.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Church</hi> here I meane, not onely One, or Two, or a Few, of what Ranke soever; but All, even every True Member of the whole Church. For I conceive every such Member hath <hi>de jure</hi> a Vote in This Determination.</p>
                  <p>But what if after the Determination, I yet dissent from the judgement of the greater part of the Church, which in all doubtfull causes, seemes justly to challenge (even by the law of Nature) a decisive power; What shall I do in This Case? shall I make a Rent, Schisme, Faction that may fire Church or State?</p>
                  <p>God forbid; no, I must Read, pray, discourse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with all humility s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bmitting my selfe to the Reason of any man that will teach me; much more to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of many together eminent for learning and piety. And yet if after all This, I cannot be satisfied in my Doubts (which must be Reall, and not pretended scruples of a factious spirit) In this case, which sure will be very Rare (where Right Reason is made supreme Judge) I must suspend till my judgement be cleered, left That which to another is Lawfull, become sinne to mee: Who cannot Act in Faith, while I act against or with Doubts, or Scruples.</p>
                  <p>However in the meane time, I must quietly deport my selfe without faction, turbulent commotion, or unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

censure of Those who dissent from me, both in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Practice; wel knowing that the same thing may be Lawfull and necessary to one that sees it so; which yet to me is unlawfull, while I so doubt.</p>
                  <p>In This Case, I conceive no Power on Earth ought to force my <hi>Practice</hi> more than my <hi>Iudgement.</hi> For I conceive the Churches utmost compulsive power (which must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so very warily, and bu: rarely be used) is but Expulsion, or <hi>Excommunication</hi>: which yet I suppose may scarce ever be exercised on one that <hi>so doubteth</hi>: much lesse <hi>Fine, Imprisonment, losse of member, or life</hi>: Except his dissent in practice hath necessarily with it a destructive influence into the State also, and Body Politique. Which case I thinke hardly ever possible, in Those Things which can be objects of Rationall Doubts: which are onely such, as the Scripture hath not determined. And in all things not determined by Scripture, (which sure must needes be of lesse consequence) One that Doubts with reason and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, (may not for ought I yet see) be forced by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                  <p>Give mee leave by some Instances to cleare my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in all the premisses concerning the power in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Things.</p>
                  <p>Time, Place, and Deportment of our selves in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, are the maine, if not sole Things, which beare this acceptation of <hi>Indifferent</hi>: The Scripture not having laid downe expresse Rules for all particular cases of This Nature. So that wee seeme least <hi>Indifferent</hi> to the use of This or That Place, This or That Time, This or That Gesture, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In These Things (not determined by Scripture) there must be some determination, because one of the extremes is necessary, (We must use some Place, some Time, some Gesture) else all limitation here were needlesse, if not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, as was said before.</p>
                  <p>The Church then Doubtlesse hath power to resolve here, What Time, what Place, what Deportment, &amp;c. and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94761:22"/>
what they do herein (though it should prove to be Evill) They do by power which God hath entrusted them with.</p>
                  <p>And yet againe, The Church here must not command what she will, because she Wil; but must goe by her Rule, which is <hi>Right Reason</hi>: if she swarve from This, she erres. And He that seeth Her error, or Doubteth, sinnes also, if (while he so doubteth) he yeeld her more than <hi>Passive Obedience</hi>: and if she force one so Doubting, I thinke she sinneth more.</p>

                  <p>For though I should grant (which I never shall) that onely they, and their Creatures, were the whole Church: Yet would they be so farre from a power of Making things <hi>Indifferent,</hi> (which yet some seeme to challenge or at least to exercise) that indeed they have no power to determine what is <hi>Indifferent</hi>: since it may be very easie for some men to thinke That <hi>Indifferent,</hi> which to others seemes clearly either <hi>unl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, in things seeming (generally) <hi>Indifferent,</hi> they have no power peremptorily to determine to one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, when there is a <hi>medium</hi> betweene both extremes, and so neither is <hi>Necessary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In things seeming Indifferent, where One extreme is necessary, They cannot determine <hi>pro arbitrio,</hi> (but by a constant Rule of Reason) much lesse by a Tyrannicall club Law force us to do (though we rationally, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly doubt whether it be Lawfull) what they first <hi>Make,</hi> rather, than <hi>find</hi> Indifferent; and then (by their wonted maximes in <hi>Indifferent</hi> Things) make <hi>Necessary,</hi> on paine of Imprisonment, losse of Eares, yea life it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Which yet might be more tolerable, if they onely tooke a Dictatorlike power to direct our judgments, in things that seeme most abstruse, or doubtfull (in which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94761:22"/>
yet they make themselves Gods; for none but God can fully cleare (much lesse force) my Judgement;) But they scruple not, point blanke to contradict our Reason, and force our consciences, in things extremely manifest; as in Bowings, and many other things, which one as blind as he that so much commended <hi>Rhombus,</hi> may see to be <hi>unlawfull.</hi>

                  <p>WE have seene the <hi>Antecedents, Concomitants,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients,</hi> to Our Bishops Office. Let us a little view some of the <hi>Consequents,</hi> that result from his Office.</p>
                  <p>We shall consider but Two, or rather One with Two Heads, (like himselfe,) at least looking two wayes; His <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> both <hi>upward</hi> and <hi>downward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Vpward. Nescio quo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fato,</hi> Our Bishops have still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on an others Beck. In the time of Popery, they were wholly moulded to the Popes Will; which oft pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced such wilfull and stubborne deportment (both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Soveraigne and equals) that wise men of those times began to perceive how insufferable such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine dependance would still be in any free State.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Winchester</hi> was not the first, though One, that in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the first</hi> Time, professed such universal Obedience to his Creator the Pope, that he quickly learned to refuse (that I may not say, disdaine) to call the King his <hi>Lord.</hi> And his Treasons against the Kings Person, made all men see how easie it was, and still would be, to reduce such Principles into Practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward the third</hi> summoned a Parliament to enable himselfe for the warres he designed: But the <hi>ArchBishop Stratford</hi> (fearing it might injure the Popes Title if hee might not be permitted there <hi>to erect his Crosse</hi>) refused to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94761:23"/>
come, detained his Bishops, and prided himselfe in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his Soveraignes designe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Norwich</hi> handled the <hi>second Richard</hi> with the same pride and Insolence; Levying Souldiers at the charge of the Kings Subjects to fight the Popes Battles.</p>
                  <p>We have not forgotten <hi>Becket,</hi> and divers other of his temper, but reserve them to another place.</p>
                  <p>Under the Reformation; if they have indeed cast off the <hi>Pope,</hi> (which may be doubted in most, but is past doubt in some) yet they have ever beene at their command, by whose favour they stand, though (with that unhappy bird) they designe the Death of Those that give them Life.</p>
                  <p>This Dependance appeares in a threefold Gradation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 The <hi>Calling</hi> (of the Bishops now in dispute) being onely <hi>Iure Humano,</hi> they must therefore comply, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fixe their <hi>Persons,</hi> but their <hi>Callings.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 When they are invested in their Sees, the smile or frowne of the Court, addeth or detracteth much from their splendor, comfort, and emolument.</item>
                     <item>3 Their further advancement, either to a better Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke, or Archbishopricke, wholly depends on the Princes Will.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Naturalists observe, there is not so much appearance of change in many degrees of Entitie, acquired by a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> motion; as in one degree, at the first step from <hi>Non Ens,</hi> to <hi>Entitie.</hi> But Moralists find that one little step of new preferment makes more impression upon low spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, than their first Creation out of Nothing. Both are well reconciled in our Bishops Rising. For what can so sudden unexpected advancement (from Nothing to such an Height of Beeing) seeme but a new Creation? so that hence such a dependance must needs result, as is that Relation which Nature fixeth in the Creature to his Creator.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Courtesies</hi> and <hi>Hopes</hi> are the most oylie <hi>Bribes,</hi> and Bribes blind the eyes of the most wise. With what nature
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94761:23"/>
soever <hi>Obligations</hi> meet, they have an irresistible force. If they descend so low as men of base spirits, They there get a species of <hi>Profitable</hi>; and so become like Lime-twigs to Little Birds. It was doubtlesse most feelingly spoken by the <hi>Slave</hi> in <hi>Plautus, Esculenta Vincula sunt firmis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they meete with men of high rais'd, Generous, Noble thoughts; they yet worke much more, (though out of a more ingenuous Principle) while a true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spirit cannot breath under the least shadow of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude: having first learned that old Proverb, <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum si dixeris.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>How hardly then a Bishops Conscience, Judgement, Reason, or Will, can bee <hi>his owne</hi>; under not onely so many <hi>Obligations,</hi> (for the greatest engagement past) but Hopes also for new favours to come, (either in high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advancement, or at least in continuance of His smiles, whose first frownes may quickly reduce Them to their first principles of Nothing) I leave it to wise men to judge.</p>
                  <p>To whom also I humbly propound, (as worthy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Consideration) how fit these Spirituall Lords may be to sit as Law-makers in That Highest Court, by whose fundamentall Orders (as also by the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) None ought to have Vote, but <hi>Free men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how can They possibly be deemed Free, that wholly depend on anothers Thought, (for I neede not say, Beck, Smile, or Frowne) not onely for their first Creation, but continuall Preservation in This State, and power of giving Vote in that Court?</p>
                  <p>But They say, This may be also objected against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lords, Created by his Majesties favour; Especially Officers of Court, which yet are not Excluded from Votes in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>I answer first, <hi>Incommodum non solvit argumentum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, If the Case were alike in all These (which I yeeld not) Because we are under One (perhaps invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94761:24"/>
Difficulty) must we needs runne and plunge our selves into another? Or being once in, may we not get out if we can?</p>
                  <p>But Thirdly, There is a Vast Difference betweene Those who cannot but still be affected with Noble, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and most vertuous deportment; (being still to live in their Names, Honours, Posterity) and Those, who in Their height, are but as <hi>Meteors,</hi> that must quickly blaze out, vanish, fall, and be no more. Betweene Those whose Birth and Breeding hath filled their veines with Heroick noble blood; and Those that are so much disadvantaged both by their <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Breeding</hi>: though Their <hi>Birth</hi> is nothing so Ignoble as their <hi>Education</hi>; Compared with that Breeding a true <hi>States-man</hi> should have.</p>
                  <p>For, will any wise man living thinke them fit to give Counsell in Princes Closets; to make Lawes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and sit Judges in the Highest Tribunals of Civill Justice; that all their life time, (before the <hi>Conge d'eslire</hi> diverted their thoughts) were wholly taken up in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (rather then reading) <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> with some other schoole Trifle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> in the <hi>Countrey.</hi> In Cases of Conscience, they have studied lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but how, with most <hi>compendium,</hi> to digest the Oath of Direct and Indirect, in point of <hi>Simony</hi>; and to swallow the Vow of thrice <hi>Nolo Episcopari,</hi> when God and their owne Consciences well know, many of them are not so solicitous for Heaven, as for a Bishopricke. And are These men fit, not onely to rule the whole
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94761:24"/>
Church; to Ordaine, Censure, Suspend, Deprive, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, <hi>ad placitum</hi>; to governe our Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by Articles, Canons, Oathes, (and what else a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <hi>Convocation</hi> may invent;) but also to direct and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (I might say more) in the Privie Juncto's; to sit at the Helme, to dictate Lawes; <hi>&amp; tantum non</hi> to sway the Scepter; which if they forbeare to touch, It is but as <hi>Mercury</hi> once spared <hi>Iupiters</hi> thunder-bolts, which he dirst not steale, lest they should roare too loud, or at least burne his fingers.</p>
                  <p>In the last place my Answer shall be thus. Though the Birth, Blood, Thoughts, Breeding, and all, of a Bishop were as noble as any One, or all the <hi>Peeres</hi>; (which none dare say) Yet are not, cannot, Bishops be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly so <hi>free,</hi> (and so, not so sit, to fit and Vote in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) as other Lords, and members of that Great Body.</p>
                  <p>For First, They that have large Estates by Inheritance, and to continue their Names and Families to the same Inheritance, are in all reason probable with more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall freedome to provide for the Good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth in generall; than those that having little or no Estate of their owne (at least, to leave to posterity) are not like much to looke after the Weale-publike, or Good of posterity; but rather will seeke to humour the present times, (being truly <hi>Filii unius Horae</hi>) espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to insinuate themselves into more and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with their Creator, and Preserver, on whose smile wholly depends more than their <hi>Bene Esse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Judgement in This is much confirmed by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of a truly Noble Gentleman, and most-high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-well-deserving States-man, (R.Ea. of E.) who said, <hi>he had now served thirty yeares in Parliament, and in all that time never knew but Two or Three Bishops stand for the Common-wealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, though all the Branches of <hi>Nobility</hi> first sprouted out from the Roote of <hi>Royal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94761:25"/>
being in all Good States, Appendices to Majesty, and wholly disposed by the Royall hand;) Yet Estates and Revenues did not; which are the Parliaments and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of Noble Honours. And These also in Bishops, depend on the Princes Will.</p>
                  <p>Yea, Our Honours and Baronies, though first they were granted by the King; yet now being so invested in Our blood, and become Hereditary, They cannot be revoked. In This therefore we are <hi>Freer</hi> then any Bishop, whose Baronies are onely annexed to their Office, and not invested in them by blood.</p>
                  <p>We have seene our Bishops Relation upward; Let us now view it looking downe to his owne Family, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Dependencies. We shall see all these <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,</hi> as unsutable to <hi>State policie,</hi> as were the <hi>Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> and <hi>Antecedents</hi> to his Office.</p>
                  <p>A Bishops Title and Place is High and Splendid, but his Estate (for the most part) Meane and Low: at least That which may be left as Inheritance to posterity.</p>
                  <p>Now to what unworthinesse will not Ambition and Avarice carry them? When they looke on themselves as <hi>Peeres</hi> and <hi>Grandees</hi> of the Kingdome, and againe reflect on their Wives and Children, as those which (after Their Decease) must soone bee reduced from such an h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Or suppose, by penurious Living they may in many yeares gleane up a meane Estate to leave to their House, to preserve their name: how miserable and sordid must be their deportment? how base their House-keeping? how Little their Hospitality? Which yet not onely by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94761:25"/>
Scripture, but Reason, seemes much (if not most) to be required of the Clergy. Such a Bishop must be as much given to Hospitality, as Blamelesse in other particulars. But alas, how can Ours be so? Except, They can bee content to live without any Retinue of Attendance; or bee Curst by Posterity, brought up perhaps as Lords, but left as Beggers.</p>
                  <p>Except then it might be with our Bishops, or Bishops Children, as once it was with that <hi>Roman Dictator,</hi> who being brought from the Plough, was content againe to returne to the Plough, (after he had with all humility, fidelity, and successe, served the Common-wealth in the Highest Office That State at that time did afford) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see why They should so ambitiously desire a Lordly Prelacie; which they can neither leave to posterity; nor carry downe to the Grave; nor yet are sure to keepe all the time they live: for of all Riches, Those of a Bishop, may soonest fly away.</p>
                  <p>If therefore Our Prelates would seriously reflect on their owne Peace, Credit, and Esteeme; Or the Good of their Family and Posterity; (though they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the Church, and trample on the State, with the Weale, peace, and flourishing prosperity thereof) sure they would leave the Common-wealth to States-men; and thinke it honour more then enough to serve the Church, and waite on Gods Altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I meane That Holy Table, which may be served by Them that attend the Word and Sacraments; though they must not neglect This, and serve any Other <hi>Tables.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Venales Animae</hi> will doe any thing to Rise. Yet I hope Our Bishops doe not, at least Will not doe so any more. If so, Let them know the <hi>Wheele</hi> of <hi>providence</hi> can runne as fast backward as ever it did forward. In its descent, they may perhaps sadly reflect on a serious dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing speech of one of themselves; <hi>Had I served my God, as I have served my Prince, I should not have beene so deserted now.</hi> Though I must confesse I doubt they have

                  <p>Our first Reformation was much opposed by Bishops. <hi>Gardiner, Bonner,</hi> and some others were no Changelings.

                  <p>But I am content to follow them Here also. Yet I must first sift out their meaning, lest they deceive mee with words.

                  <p>To say then that <hi>Monarchy</hi> cannot stand without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall Discipline in the Church, is to weaken (if not to breake) the nerves and ligaments of supreme power: nay to say that such a government will best suit with <hi>Monarchy,</hi> is to vaile the lustre and Majesty of monarchy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which like an healthfull stomach, can easily assimulate all things to it selfe; but is not changed by any.</p>
                  <p>If they would but speake their owne Thoughts, They would turne the Proposition thus, <hi>Church-Monarchy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

stand without Civill.</hi> Here the <hi>Mystery</hi> is unmasked. It is true, <hi>This Discipline</hi> cannot stand, but where <hi>Princes</hi> will uphold it. For That which hath no Footing in <hi>Scripture,</hi> must leane upon <hi>Humane Right</hi>; and thus it discovereth its owne weaknesse. <hi>Divine Institution</hi> is able to bottome it selfe upon it selfe; but <hi>Humane</hi> is like the weake <hi>Vine</hi> or <hi>Hop,</hi> which without a pole, must creepe, and so rot, upon the earth. Yea some inventions of Men (specially in matters of Religion) are like the weake Fruitlesse <hi>Ivy,</hi> that must be propt up by some <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Our Bishops foreseeing This, (for They are wise in their generation,) thought best to invert the propositions; and instead of this, that <hi>Church Monarchy cannot stand without Civill</hi>; They affirme <hi>Civill Monarchy</hi> cannot stand without That of the <hi>Church.</hi> Thus they delude Silly people.</p>
                  <p>But to come a little neerer to their Best meaning, (Who stand so much for <hi>Church Monarchy</hi>) I would gladly be shewed by Reason, what there is in Church government, why it may not derive it selfe into severall Corporations; where either more or fewer may beare the sway; still sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing to those things which are left by Christ to the Civill government, or Monarchicall power. We see hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Corporations are thus mannaged: And what there is <hi>in formali ratione</hi> of Church government (essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to Church government that will not endure This; <hi>mihi non liquet</hi>; Truly I do not yet know, I cannot yet I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine.</p>
                  <p>Wee see ever since the reformation of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> the Churches of Christ have had another discipline than ours; under Elective and Successive, under Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

and Catholique Princes, as will appeare clearely in <hi>Poland, Denmarke,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> I do from my heart agree that <hi>Civill</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are <hi>Custodes utriusque Tabulae</hi>: but what the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magistrate hath to doe in Church matters, till the Church hath done her utmost, I could yet never learne.</p>
                  <p>The government of Christ is spirituall; and Hee will have his worke wrought in a sweete way; by the power of the Spirit, not by force.</p>
                  <p>If I erre in This, I shall upon better reason recant; In the interim, hoping that the clearnesse of my thoughts shal with the candid Reader receive gentle interpretation, I shall freely declare my opinion in This point.</p>
                  <p>Christ (as I shall more fully prove hereafter) hath cleerly unfolded to us the Two main things of Church affaires:

                  <p>So long as the <hi>Church,</hi> in her <hi>Church</hi> Tenets, intermedleth not with <hi>State</hi> matters under the notion of Religion, I suppose the <hi>Civill</hi> power is not to interpose.</p>
                  <p>It is most true, if the <hi>Church</hi> will broach (with the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi>) that they will have no <hi>Governours,</hi> nor Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: This is a point not of Divinity, but Policie; and here the Scepter must set a rule. or with the <hi>Adamites</hi> (if there be any such) allow Communion of wives: This takes away property, The sword must divide this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. or with the Papists, that it is lawfull to <hi>kill Kings</hi>: that faith is not to be kept with <hi>Heritiques</hi>: I conceive in all these, (and cases of the like nature) the decision lyeth in the <hi>Magistrate</hi>; for These tenets overthrow either Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Government, or civill converse; The Church must not goe out of her bounds.</p>
                  <p>But if the Question be, how you will expound such a Scripture: what Gesture you will use in such an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: what man is fit to be excommunicated: what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth excommunication: what is Idolatry: what is wil-worship: what superstition: what is the punishment of those crimes: who shall judge but the Church?</p>
                  <p>The Prince hath granted to such a Body by Charter, such priviledges, such offices, who can interpose but the power instituting? Christ hath given us a platforme of Church government, with the offices, and officers; who may here intermedle, but Christ himselfe?</p>
                  <p>It is most true when the Church findeth any refracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thereupon doth excommunicate him, he fals into

the hands of the Civill Magistrate, if he continue perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious, and not before.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Parliaments</hi> do consider matters of Religion, they do it to deliver the <hi>Church</hi> from some who would impose upon her; who would take the keyes from her, that by the help of these keyes, they may wrest the <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> out of the hand of <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> which God forbid.</p>
                  <p>And whilst <hi>Parliaments</hi> labour thus for the <hi>Church,</hi> dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling no further in the affaires of the Church, than by <hi>Scripture</hi> they may, certainly they do well; but if they once exceed their bounds, the issue will be <hi>Confusion</hi> insted of <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> government differ as much as the <hi>Sexes</hi> Yet as there may betweene These be an happy union: (Both keeping their bounds whilst the Husband hath the supremacie;) So may there be between the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State</hi> a sweete harmony. The State having Committed to it the custody of the 10. commandments, and yet the Church preserving to her selfe Her rights.</p>
                  <p>If the Church swallow up the State, as it is in Popery, &amp; Episcopacy, the issue will be slavish, grosse superstition, and stockish Idolatry. If the State overtop the Church, there will be ignorance and atheisme: But give to <hi>God</hi> that which is Gods, and to <hi>Caesar</hi> that which is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Place I meane, is that which of old in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church was wont to be more perused, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, than I thinke it is now, or hath beene of late: and I cannot much wonder, sith I see all men view the <hi>Sea,</hi> and well consider it at distance, from the top of a Cliffe or Rocke; but when they are once fallen into it, they shut their eyes, winke, and care to see as little as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Being come so farre (without any Reall opposition) I now demand, Who This <hi>Man</hi> (<hi>Compages</hi> or <hi>Systeme</hi> of <hi>Men</hi>) is, or can be?

In this last (which yet is one of the most fundamentall points of controversie now betweene us) I see many of them comming so neere the Truth, that one must have a quick sharpe eye to see where they come short, for many of them yeeld Our workes do not properly <hi>merit</hi> as Ours, but as <hi>Tincta sanguine Christi</hi>; yea and some are not rigid in pressing the phrase <hi>Merit,</hi> in its proper sense: so that perhaps Their most refined opinion in This, may be the more dangerous in the Consequence, than substance or forme of it.</p>
                  <p>Nay, before the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (before which yet <hi>Popery</hi> had beene long in the world) most of their Tenets were so much indetermined, that scarce any of them knew what he was to hold and beleeve yet he was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist then, and is so still, and yet to this Day I thinke there is scarce one Doctrinall point in which they all agree.</p>

                  <p>This Tyrannicall Prelaticall Power and Dominion, which the Pope ufurpeth and excerciseth (contrary to Gods Word) over Clergy and Laity, Princes and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in their estates and consciences, is in Him, (as in His Clients, <hi>yeelding</hi> and <hi>submitting to this Popish Prelacy) True Proper Popery.</hi> And This is the Giving, Imprinting, or forcing of a Name, Character or Number, on the Popes part, as Receiving This on the part of <hi>Papists</hi>: though I have not now time, at least not opportunity, to discusse how much the Popes <hi>Name, Character</hi> and <hi>Number</hi> may differ. I doubt not but all are parts of That Prelaticall, usurped Power which is truly <hi>Popish</hi>; and received by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> as Servants, and Souldiers of old received their Lord's and Commanders <hi>Tessera,</hi> or Character in their hands and foreheads.

                  </p>
                  <p>God hath beene pleased to parcell out <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> as severall and distinct Governments: yet so that Princes should be <hi>Custodes utriusque Tabulae,</hi> as was said before.</p>
                  <p>God hath beene pleased to make, appoint, and leave the Ministers of the Gospel <hi>Brethren,</hi> and hath permitted none of them a Lordly Prelacy above another.</p>
                  <p>But now the Pope comes, with a wide mouth, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes downe at once, all <hi>Civill</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> power; Challengeth to himselfe, not onely the <hi>Keyes,</hi> but the <hi>Sword</hi>; not onely Papall Dominion in <hi>Ecclesiasticis,</hi> but Regall also in <hi>Civilibus.</hi> This Usurpation of His, is

                  <p>As every sinne breakes all the Commands, (the whole Law) yet some sinnes do more properly intrench on some particular command: so also is it in all Hereses and errors. All someway oppose the whole Law of Christ, and all the three Offices of <hi>Christ</hi>: yet some more properly One of these Offices, some another.

This is the Pope; and this is Popery.</hi> Yea I may adde, This is truly and most properly <hi>Antichrist</hi>; though indeed perhaps not That <hi>Antichrist</hi> of whom S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes in his first Epistle Chap. 2.22. and 4.3. who, it may be, was <hi>Ebion,</hi> or <hi>Cerimbus,</hi> or some other: though perhaps also Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> might speake that of some Lordly Prelacy, which began (though but to dawne, if I may so speake of that darke mystery begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to shew it selfe) even in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> daies: for in some respect wee will not stand to yeeld a Bishops Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree might perhaps extend so high: for even then Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ was conceiv'd.</p>
                  <p>However, I doubt not to affirme the <hi>Pope</hi> is now most Really, Truly, and properly, The Grand <hi>Antichrist.</hi> For such is Hee most properly, that encroacheth on <hi>Christs Regall Office.</hi> This being It which now (of all the three) is most proper to him in his <hi>Glory</hi>: and This he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as a most glorious Reward (if I may so speake) for all his sufferings in his humane Nature: and This I think the Scripture Language (<hi>Esay</hi> 53.12. <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27.) His <hi>Priestly</hi> worke was for the most part accomplisht in his <hi>Death</hi>; His <hi>Propheticall</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94761:35"/>
as it were resigned over to his Holy <hi>Spirit</hi>; But his Kingly Office is his owne propriety, (till the end come) and so He that opposeth This, is most truly <hi>Antichrist.</hi> This is the <hi>Pope,</hi> and this is <hi>Popery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now on the other part if any man please to survay <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy</hi> with an unpartiall eye, he shal find this kind of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy,</hi> &amp; <hi>Popery</hi> to be all one in <hi>Re,</hi> for they have the same <hi>Rise,</hi> the same <hi>Media</hi> of their progresse, and the same <hi>End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The rise of Popery, was by overthrowing Christs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and setting up of his owne. That this may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the more distinctly, give me leave to shew you the Bishops boldnesse in the particulars of it.</p>
                  <p>Christs ordinances in the New Testament are either concerning <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Discipline.</hi> I confesse the <hi>Pope</hi> hath made great assaults upon the doctrinall part; but what he hath done in that kind, he hath done many times by gathering up the negorgements of others, and so they are not his owne: or as an <hi>Heretique,</hi> but not as <hi>Pope,</hi> for the reasons which I have even now mentioned.</p>
                  <p>But he hath plaid his part mainly in point of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: This most properly belonging to Christs Royall Office, as Doctrine to his Propheticall.</p>
                  <p>In the Discipline there are two things considerable,
<list>
                        <item>1 That which concerneth the Officer.</item>
                        <item>2 That which concerneth the Nature of his office. In the case of the Officer, you have his <hi>Accesse</hi> to his Office, and his <hi>Execution</hi> of the Office. In the first <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> are considerable.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>By Gods rule his <hi>Election</hi> is to be <hi>by the people</hi>; his <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from the people</hi> by the hand of the <hi>Presbytery.</hi> By the rule of <hi>Popery</hi> a Minister is <hi>Ordained</hi> by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and his substitute, and is <hi>elected</hi> by the same power and in the same way. And as their Schoole darkens (with a mist of their termes) what they cannot <hi>cleere</hi>: So do These; to cloud their swarving from Christs rule, They raise up new termes, and instead of <hi>Election,</hi> have <hi>Presentation, Institution,</hi> &amp; <hi>Induction.</hi> The first is done

                  <p>In the execution of his O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ce there are Acts of 2. sorts: some wherein he hath a <hi>Ioynt</hi> power with other; some wherein he is a <hi>sole Agent</hi>: he is sole in Church preaching and in administration of the Sacraments: he is coadjutor to others in Admission of members, in Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Under the Papacy the Minister or Priest hath the power of Preaching, and Administration according to Gods Law (and this onely with relation to the Bishop who in his Church superintends:) But in the other hee hath no power at all; it is wholly given up to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and by him committed to the Bishop. And thus the Pope may truly (while he is <hi>Dominus Dominorum</hi>) stile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <hi>servum servorum:</hi> for hee impropriates all offices to himselfe; and in liew of coadjutors given by God to the Minister, the Bishop hath Officers appointed him by the Pope.</p>
                  <p>The Coadjutors of the Ministers by the Word, in some cases were the <hi>People,</hi> in some cases the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> and sometimes people, Elders and Deacons: but the Pope in lieu of these hath instituted another generation of helpers; and lest that true name should reduce true Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, he hath given them yet another title, as <hi>Apparitor, Surrogate, Chancellour, Officiall, Commissaries, Deanes, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens, Overseers</hi> of the poore. In all which <hi>Episcopacie</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> have so twin-like a frame, that seeing one, you see both; <hi>Nec Sofia Sofiae similior, nec simiae simia.</hi> And so I leave that point, which concernes the <hi>Officer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Nature of his office it is considerable, 1 What the worke of his Office is: Secondly, from what power: and thirdly, in what manner he doth it.</p>
                  <p>For the first, the subject matter of his office is Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments, Preaching, Admission of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94761:36"/>
members, Excommunication. In reckoning these, the <hi>Pope</hi> conformeth to Gods Word, and so doth <hi>Episcopacy</hi>; for if we will erre, we must sometimes goe right, and then we may transgresse with lesse suspicion.</p>
                  <p>But Consider from what power the Minister of the Gospell Acts. He ought not to borrow his Commission from any but from Christ, from Scripture; and he ought to keepe close to That: now the Papacie is wholly stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Traditions, Decretals, Councels, Canons, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Cardinals, and the Pope in the Chaire, where he cannot erre in matters of Faith. The Pandects of the Civill Law are too too boystrous, and of too great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for any Civilian to comprehend; and yet that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their learning is boyled up to such a degree, that it runnes over, and no memory is able to attaine it, more than to compasse perfection in the learning of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es,</hi> where the A. B. C. amounts to 10000 letters. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions crosse one another, and almost all fight against the Gospell of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Doth not Episcopacie (<hi>Si magna licet componcre parvis</hi>) according to its <hi>modicum,</hi> do the same? I confesse, with them the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the rule: but who must expound this Scripture? Synods, Councells, Convocations, Bishops, Archbishops. Some of these sometimes, sometimes All of them: And though by their owne confession, These bind not mens Consciences, yet They bind them to obedience: which obedience they doe precisely Challenge, and when they faile thereof, they doe without the least scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of conscience, proceede to excommunication, fine, imprisonment, deprivation, and what not? In the meane time it is held a sinne for a Lay man at all to thinke of these studies. The <hi>Priests</hi> lips (they say) must preserve knowledge: It is a sad case (say they) when men with unhallowed hands will touch the <hi>Arke,</hi> and with unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified eyes, pry into these mysteries. and so These men, making the Scripture a Rule in appearance, do in truth Monopolize all to themselves: This is just and flat Popery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94761:37"/>In the last place, The <hi>Manner</hi> which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, is that every thing be done in decencie and in order: with what singlenesse and plainnesse may be: without any addition of mens inventions. The <hi>Pope</hi> carrieth on his Jurisdiction with pompe and much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward glory; They have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missions, Injunctions, Charters, Seales, Secretaries, Clarkes, and 1000 other inventions, to grind the face of the poore. <hi>Episcopacie</hi> hath its Courts, Summons, Clarkes, Seales, with other Ceremonies of the like nature.</p>
                  <p>Christs rule is that Ministers of equall ranke, shall all have equall power. Apostles indeed were above Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, and Evangelists above Pastors; and Teachers: but one Apostle was not above another, nor one Pastor did not superintend another. The Pope hath Priest, Bishop, Archbishop, Primate, Patriarch, Cardinall, Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Episcopacie hath Ministers (now called Priests) Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Bishops, Archbishops, Primates, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture commandeth Preaching in season and out of season, but with the Pope, and our Bishops, All preaching is now out of Season, I am sure out of fashion in themselves; and cryed downe in others: for with them Ignorance is the mother of Devotion.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture alloweth but two Sacraments; the <hi>Pope</hi> addeth five; and our <hi>Bishops</hi> are ambiguous: <hi>Two onely</hi> (they say) are <hi>generally Necessary to salvation</hi>; which may clearly intimate, that there are <hi>More than Two</hi>; though perhaps not absolutely <hi>Necessary</hi> to Salvation, or though necesary, yet not <hi>Generally</hi> necessary, to all men, in all times, states and conditions whatsoever. and so much the Papists yeeld of Their five Sacraments, nay of fixe of their seven: For, onely <hi>Baptisme</hi> (they say) is absolutely and generally necessary to salvation; the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi> even with them, is not Necessary to Infants, much lesse <hi>Matrimony, Orders, Confirmation, Penance, V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ction.</hi> In what do our Bishops then differ from Papists in This?</p>
                  <p>How do they differ in Baptisme? Both Pope and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94761:37"/>
hold it necessary, absolutely necessary to salvation. Yea the most Moderate of Both, maintaine a <hi>generall Baptismall Grace,</hi> Equally confer'd to all partakers of that Sacrament. Indeed Our Bishops doe not openly use <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Spittle,</hi> but yet they retaine the <hi>Crosse,</hi> (perhaps much worse) and beginne to Claime spirituall alliances as the Papists doe.</p>
                  <p>In the Lords Supper, the Pope <hi>makes</hi> (rather than <hi>findes</hi>) an <hi>Hostia,</hi> an <hi>Altar,</hi> a <hi>Priest</hi>; and This Priest must offer for the sinnes of the Quick and Dead. Our <hi>Bishops</hi> must have <hi>Priests, Altars,</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice, Corporals,</hi> and what not that Papists have? to say nothing of their Times and Gestures, which sure the Scripture never so determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, much lesse excluded any that could not yeeld to such and such circumstances, which none ever thought could be more than <hi>Indifferent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all Ordinances the Scripture now speakes of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Holinesse, then That which is Spirituall, Rationall, the Holinesse of the whole man. The Pope hath found out new Holinesse, which he puts on <hi>Places, Times, Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Bels, Tapers, Water, Wafers, Copes, Basons, Pots,</hi> and <hi>Cups,</hi> with other Vtensles.</p>
                  <p>And doe not our Bishops so also? What meanes such rigid pressing of Holy dayes? Bare heads in Churches? Holy Surplices? What meane they else by their Holy Chalices? Holy Knives? Holy Patents? Holy Vten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sles? all which may be so sanctified by a devout Priest, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>at they may become profitable to the Soules of those that use them. How then doe our Bishops differ from Papists in administring Sacraments, Manner of all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances?</p>
                  <p>And is there any Greater Difference in <hi>Admission</hi> of <hi>Members,</hi> and <hi>Excommunication?</hi> This last being the last and Greatest Censure of the Church, by both Bishops and Pope is made not onely most Common (as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour moves them) but also most Ridiculous; being the usuall appendix of one groat short in our Reckonings
<pb facs="tcp:94761:38"/>
with our Lord Bishops Register, Proctor, or Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritor.</p>
                  <p>I would not be mistaken here; I bring not in These Things of Doctrine, or Discipline, as if by agreeing in One or Many of These, I might convince Bishops and Papists (or the Pope) were all one. The maine thing I drive at in all this, is the Originall fountaine from whence All These spring, and all the bankes that keepe in These Rivulets; That vertue and power which moves and actuates all these in their proper Channels: And This is <hi>Papall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, what ever the Pope doth of his owne head, by his owne Power, Dictating to his Vassals, as Head of the Church, This is truly Papall, and such is the Power by which They usurpe so much over mens persons, and consciences, in injoyning and pressing such or such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Discipline.</p>
                  <p>So that a Bishops wearing a Surplice, Cope, Miter; using the Crosse, Bowing to the Altar, and many such Things (though they may be Errors, yet All These, or One of these) makes him not a Pope, a Popeling, or properly Antichristian: But Receiving These from the Popes Dictates, doing them because he commands, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his power in commanding; This makes a <hi>Papist</hi>: and Commanding them, Pressing them on Others, in such Despoticall power, makes a true <hi>Pope,</hi> a <hi>Reall Antichrist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor may Our Bishops Evade by This (which I easily see will be answered) that though indeed they doe these things, and command these Things; yet they neither doe them from the <hi>Popes Command,</hi> nor Command them in the <hi>Popes Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though I should grant This, which yet many wise men will not grant, (for, Our Bishops first Power came from the Pope, and of late also We have found letters, advice, commands, Dictates from the <hi>Pope,</hi> to some of our Bishops; and that in Matters of greatest Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94761:38"/>
both for Church and State; But grant all They say, yet they may be Antichristian, and so such in <hi>Re,</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> is; though not literally <hi>Romanists,</hi> Except they doe, or command, in the Power of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I shall be bold to affirme, and maintaine, till I see better Reason, that He (whoever he be) that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the least title of Doctrine or discipline, meerely <hi>Ex imperio Voluntatis,</hi> in his owne Power, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; without Licence or Warrant from Scripture, or Right Reason, (where the Scripture hath beene si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent) though the Thing he so commands should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be good in it selfe: Yet He in his so Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is not onely <hi>Tyrannicall,</hi> but <hi>Antichristian,</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Antichristian</hi>; Encroaching on the Royall Office of Christ, which is truly High Treason against God; and most properly <hi>Antichristianisme.</hi> I care not whether we call him a <hi>Pope, Papist, Romanist,</hi> or any other name; I call him <hi>Antichrist</hi>: and if you will call <hi>Antichrist</hi> by the name of <hi>Pope,</hi> I call such an Imperious Commander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, (though he have no shadow of Dependance on Rome, or Romish Pope) an <hi>English Pope</hi>; I meane an English <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I neede not spend much time in shewing by what <hi>meanes</hi> Either the Pope or Our Bishops beganne, and continued to be so Antichristian: <hi>Du Plessis</hi> and Others, have sav'd me This labour. In a word, they have beene These. With One hand they have laid Pillowes under Princes, and all Governours (appointed by God) that so they might fall softly, while they thrust them downe with the Other (the stronger) Hand, Arme and all. When These have beene so surely, though gently, laid downe asleepe; They have beene bold to tread on them, (yet with Plush Slippers, lest they should chance to wake, stirre, and get up againe) and by Them, as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny staires or steps, mount up themselves into this Height of Tyranny. Thus have they still <hi>opposed, and advanced</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94761:39"/>
themselves, against and above All that is called <hi>God,</hi> or is <hi>worshipped.</hi> And If with your owne thoughts you will please to goe on in the Chapter, you will finde some other <hi>Media</hi> (as Lying Wonders, and others) by which they have ascended.</p>
                  <p>I shall not neede to parallel Popish and Episcopall <hi>Media</hi> to Their Height. All the world sees them now, For, they were not done in a Corner.</p>
                  <p>What meanes their Crying up an unjust and illimited power in Princes? Is not This their bleating out of an illegall unwarranted Prerogative (with which all Our pulpits have rung of late) intended to tickle Princes till they be luld asleepe? or to sow pillowes under them, till. They themselves can thrust them downe; not onely from that Tyranny which Bishops would perswade them to usurp; but also from their wholsome and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prerogative.</p>
                  <p>What meaneth their Buzzing in Princes Eares, That Kings cannot stand without such Bishops? that if they should be put downe, the Church and State too, must needs be Ruined? to This purpose they cry Blood, Blood; They can never fall without Blood: so some of them have vaunted. But Let them remember what Christ said to One (to whom they so much pretend) <hi>He that smiteth with the sword, shall perish by the sword.</hi> They know also whose Coat was sent home to their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, with this Inscription (written with his owne blood) <hi>Iudge Holy Father whether This be Thy Sonnes Coat or not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have not forgotten how they have dealt with the People, Ministry, Gentry, Nobility, All sorts of men: For they have many staires to step up by, to such an Height; but Princes are their highest steps, their first Aime.</p>
                  <p>That which they have most sounded in the Peoples Eares, is the Church, the Church, the Temple of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94761:39"/>
Lord, the Temple of the Lord! by This, as by a stalking horse, they have come much neerer then else they could. But now their Vizard beginnes to fall off; and Men beginne to see the true power of the True Church; and the Tyranny of that Antichristian Mock-Church; which under the Maske of <hi>Indifference,</hi> hath brought in most abominable Superstitions, and most intolerable slavery on the Persons, Liberties, Bodies, and <hi>Soules of Men.</hi> For they have pressed Consciences, even unto Gasping: yea, and would not be satisfied, though they daily heard the sighes and groanes of those bleeding hearts, which themselves had stabd with the poysoned sword of <hi>Church-Indifference.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed they have used Both hands, and have stricken with Both. What the <hi>Keyes</hi> could not break, the <hi>Sword</hi> hath cut. And it had been much more tolerable, If This Sword had pierced no farther then the Eares of Men: with which they have yet beene much more busie then He was, whom they bragge to have beene their first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor. Yet methinkes it was a sad Omen that this Sword should cut off the Eare of <hi>Malchus,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies (they say) a <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Kingly Authority.</hi> At This they strike indeed, through the Eares, and Hearts of so many Loyall Subjects.</p>
                  <p>We neede not seeke their End, in all This. It cannot be doubted, but by all These <hi>Meanes,</hi> they aime at One End, (which is also the <hi>Popes</hi>) to pull downe all Other Power, and set up their owne. Thus, Thus they <hi>Oppose,</hi> and <hi>Exalt</hi> themselves above <hi>All</hi> that is called <hi>God,</hi> or is <hi>Worshipped</hi>; as is more fully represented in another place of this Discourse.</p>
                  <p>Now let any man Living speake: Are These Bishops, These Usurping Prelates to be suffered in a Church, or State, where there is any respect to Right Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or True State Policie? since it is Evident They are truly <hi>Papall,</hi> most properly <hi>Antichristian</hi>; and
<pb facs="tcp:94761:40"/>
as Antichrist must Oppose and Exalt themselves above all that is Worshipped, or Called God: Which is most True <hi>Popery,</hi> (as hath beene demonstrated) And as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, Destructive to all Church and State Policie.</p>
                  <p>Doubtlesse some such Apprehensions as This, wrought in their Breasts, who being offered, have refused Bishop-ricks; and being possessed, could not rest till they had <hi>Disinvested</hi> themselves againe.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving cleerly proved how uncompatible <hi>Our Episcopacy</hi> is to Civill Government in <hi>State Policy</hi>; let us now consider whether It may shelter it selfe under the Mysterious Covert of <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could heartily wish, that in matters which receive their being from <hi>Scripture,</hi> so immediately as Church Discipline doth, wee might make the <hi>Scripture</hi> (which is a sufficient rule) our sole guide, our sole mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator. But as Heretickes in the day of Judgement shall cry to the mountaines to cover them; so <hi>Heresies</hi> now also, fly to the craggy rocks of remotest times: and in such darke corners hope to shelter themselves.</p>
                  <p>Thither also wee will follow them, <hi>quo fata trahunt,</hi> we will advance. Not doubting but to unkennell those little Foxes: hoping even with <hi>Goliah</hi>'s sword to lay <hi>Goliah</hi> in the dust, and bring the five uncircumcised Princes of the <hi>Caenaanites,</hi> to their just censure, before the King or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a most Reverend man, famous for learning, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially for that learning which is not open to every eye) hath taken upon him the defence of This Cause: I shall
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94761:42"/>
therefore in few words present to Him my thoughts upon those His determinations; Concluding with <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> that if I can but win the <hi>chiefe City,</hi> the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is gained: Then I shall see whether Those things which are pressed by others, be not altogether ineffectuall to determine the point which they dispute. And so I shall leave the decision of This, to the judgement and opinion of the learned.</p>
                  <p>Before I consider that Treatise in the parts of it, give me leave to say that which is most true, and I hope will satisfie all men; If every word of that his booke were true, yet it is little to the point: For the Question is not, Whether there have been Bishops ever since Christs time; but, Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these have had power over their brethren: or, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one Bishop hath had Jurisdiction over another. And this Question is double:</p>
                  <p>First, Whether they have had any superintendence one above another.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whether this hath beene mixt with that Lordlinesse which now is used; forcing obedience by the edge of the Sword, where the Keyes can give no entrance: And of this, in the whole booke there is not the least hint, <hi>ne gry quidem.</hi> Though this also were not enough for our Question; which is not only of their Lordly power in <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticis,</hi> but also in <hi>Civilibus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the first Querie, we shall quickly joyne issue; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our Antagonists, that there have beene Bishops (<hi>viz.</hi> Ministers of the Gospel) who have had a Scripture power in matter of Government, over particular flocks; but the other wee doe absolutely and confidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                  <p>First, He endeavoureth to prove the succession of seaven and twenty Bishops, in the seat of <hi>Timothy</hi>: and this hee essayeth by one single (not to say simple) witnesse, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine man named <hi>Leontius</hi>; whose writings have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him famous to us for learning, nor his exemplary holinesse (mentioned by others) famous for pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:94761:42"/>Truly, a man of greater authority than he, (as <hi>Papias, Ignatius, Polycarpus,</hi> who, almost all, knew the Apostles) shall not bee of credit sufficient to sway my faith in this point: Not but that they were most worthy men; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all Antiquity hath passed the refining pot of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex expurgatorius,</hi> I shall consider well before I subscribe. And shall I then give credit to an unknowne Author, in those things that were acted almost five hundred yeares before his birth? Let the world judge whether it bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this Author quoted, from witnesse of his owne; but out of a Councell. Now, how Councells have beene abused, those who have ever had place or note in great Assemblies, can too well tell: where there is almost no <hi>Order</hi> drawn up, but after a serious review, reducing the mistakes of the Clerks, to the sense of those who did frame the <hi>Order,</hi> which might else come forth most disorderly.</p>
                  <p>By what I have already said, That other testimony brought from a fatherlesse Treatise of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, cited only by <hi>Photius,</hi> (a learned man, who lived seven or eight centuries after Christ) will be of no weight: for <hi>Photius</hi> doth but say he <hi>read</hi> it. Hear-say in matter of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature is no good testimony: and reports in matter of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, at the second hand, are good to amuse those who defie venerable Antiquity; but will never edifie those who desire to bottome their resolutions upon sound Reason.</p>
                  <p>The testimonies of <hi>Faelix, Iohn</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> are not of age sufficient to bee registred among the Ancients, or to be valued, because they are old. I confesse, I set a greater value upon <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who affirm, <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was made Bishop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> by St. <hi>Iohn</hi>; but this must not be of undeniable authority.</p>
                  <p>For of <hi>Ignatius</hi> I shall affirme this, that All those who are any whit learned in Antiquity, know that five of his Epistles are spurious; and how unmingled those are which wee allow to be his, wee doe not know, who look upon Antiquity at such a distance. But allow it to bee true, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94761:43"/>
                     <hi>Onesimus</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus, Polycarpus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Smyrna, &amp;c.</hi> This may be true, but evinceth in no measure the Question in dispute: Which is not of a Bishop in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, but such a Bishop.</p>
                  <p>The Authority of <hi>Tertullian</hi> also, is of the same credit: Hee tels us that <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was placed by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>; and at <hi>Rome Clement</hi> by St. <hi>Peter.</hi> This no body will dispute; (though I am not bound to beleeve it.) But where is the stresse of this Argument?</p>
                  <p>In the last place, that of <hi>Clement Alexandrinus,</hi> is as much questioned as all the rest. But allow it to bee true, that <hi>Iohn</hi> did appoint Bishops, they have gained nothing; for I shall allow that Christ also hath instituted Bishops, and that Bishops are <hi>Iure divino</hi>; yea, I will allow that they are to feed <hi>Christs</hi> flock, to rule <hi>Christs</hi> inheritance, in <hi>Christs</hi> sense; but I shall never allow of these Bishops, which are now the subject of our dispute.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>Three sorts</hi> of Bishops, as <hi>Beza</hi> saith: There are of <hi>Gods Institution,</hi> and they are those who have a power over their proper flock, with the rest of the Church, and no other. There are also of <hi>Mans Institution</hi>; and this ever overfloweth into the Neighbour parish. And lastly, there is a <hi>Demonicall Bishop</hi>; and this is hee who challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Sword, as well as the Keyes.</p>
                  <p>This last may well be stiled <hi>Demonicall</hi>; for sure God never erected This order; nor <hi>Man</hi> in his right senses: Where it will then fixe, is cleere enough. Even on him, Whose darke Mysteries, most of these men have been very well acquainted with.</p>
                  <p>The long Robe and the Sword doe not well agree. To see a Lawyer tyed to his Sword till hee put off his Gowne, is not so comely; but to see a paire of Lawne sleeves to stifle a Scepter, if it were but on a stage, I would cry out,</p>

                  <p>THus having run through that little Treatise, (yet with some wonder, that a person of his profession, piety, and known learning, should doe That, which might in any sense, seeme to impose on those whom hee loveth.) I proceed to some other things, which I finde produced from Antiquity, by the greatest Patrons of that kinde of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> which wee now oppose.</p>
                  <p>Yet by the way, I must note here also, That either none seeme to state the Question (between us) right; or else, all seem to dissert it.</p>
                  <p>Our Question (as I have often said) is not of the name of <hi>Bishop,</hi> or his power in <hi>Ecclesiasticalls</hi> only; but also, and mainly, of his <hi>Civill</hi> power, and <hi>Temporalls.</hi> Which all the Patrons of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> seeme to shun, as a dangerous Rock; and hovering aloofe off, goe about to prove by Antiquity, that Bishops had this <hi>Name,</hi> and some power even in the Primitive Church; which (though I thinke none can force me to beleeve, yet) I dispute not: But de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Whether any Bishops had <hi>such</hi> power in <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticis, &amp; Civilibus,</hi> as ours now have in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet; because they insist so much on Antiquity, for <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Episcopacy,</hi> I will be content to follow them there also; beleeving wee shall finde no one foot-step (in true Antiquity) of such a <hi>Bishop</hi> as wee now have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished in <hi>England,</hi> though wee should strip him of all <hi>Civill</hi> power, and consider him only in <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticis.</hi>

                  <p>It is true, that after the Apostles, and purer times of the Church were gone, the Clergy began to lord it over the people, and to bereave them of their due priviledge; yea oft times agreed among themselves to choose One Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant (as we may call him) whom they called Father, and Bishop; and in This perhaps they did not amisse, if This Bishops power rested only on the Clergy, and never reached to the people; who else sure by all reason should have had a vote in choosing any Officer, much more such a great Commander.</p>
                  <p>But let all the Patrons of Episcopacy produce mee one found Antiquity for such Election as is now in use with us. Let them from undoubted Antiquity for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after Christ, (nay much more, for I easily see their evasion) let them, I say, shew me but one instance of our <hi>Conge d' eslire</hi>: It is the Thing I speak of, not the Word.</p>
                  <p>Let them shew me (except in the dark times of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery) power given to ten or twelve Men (except all the Clergy explicitely consented) to choose such a Bishop. And yet This is not halfe that which lies in our Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whcih indeed are not at all made by so much, as the Chapiter of any Cathedrall, but received only by Those who dare not refuse it: but of this I spake before in the first Section.</p>
                  <p>I am content to passe their Election, (which I perceive none of them care much to examine;) and come to the Execution of their Office. In which I might instance in two or three maine points; as sole Ordination, sole Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, Delegation, &amp;c.</p>

Times; as appeares by that of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> on whom were laid the <hi>Hands</hi> of the Presbytery; not of the Presbyterate, or one Presbyter, as learned Mr. <hi>Thorndick</hi> not onely yeelds, but proves; who yet is no enimy to Bishops.</p>
                  <p>Neither could I ever finde one good Antiquity against <hi>Ordination</hi> by Presbyters, or for <hi>Sole Ordination</hi> by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.

                  <p>I might adde, that some Great men of good Note, have strongly maintained, all those Councels erred, which so Unpreisted Those that had beene <hi>Ordained</hi> by a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Presbyters, without a Bishop. Amongst These are some of Note in the Popish Church; It being a Common Instance among the School-men, disputing, Whether <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> once confer'd could be annul'd; and they all conclude the contrary. Yea, and many of These also strongly prove, that Priests may as well <hi>Ordain</hi> as Bishops; and their Reason seemes very good; for, say they, Seeing a Preist can Consecrate, and by Consecration Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate, (which is more,) Why can hee not also Administer the Sacrament of <hi>Orders,</hi> which is lesse?</p>
                  <p>Yea, and some of them dare affirme, Neither Bishop nor Pope can licence Priests to give <hi>Ordination,</hi> except The Power of <hi>Ordination</hi> bee <hi>de jure,</hi> in Presbyters: For, They all yeeld the Pope himselfe cannot licence One that is not a Preist, to Consecrate the <hi>Hoste</hi>; because none but Preists have That Power of Consecration.

                  <p>I Shall now passe from this kinde of Church Antiquity, and passe to the best Antiquity, the infallible Truth of God, in Holy <hi>Scripture.</hi> In it I shall shew there is little for, much against Bishops; whether we consider the <hi>Name,</hi> or <hi>Office</hi> of a Bishop, as now it is setled.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Name,</hi> I finde but foure times in all the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: In Two of which, the <hi>Name</hi> is so indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used, that it maketh nothing towards an issue of This Question. Those are, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. And what can be gained from hence, truly I see not.</p>
                  <p>In the other places it maketh against them, as I shall shew more at large by and by.</p>
                  <p>But the Word <hi>Elder,</hi> (a true Bishop) is used twenty severall times in the New Testament. And you shall find the Apostles honouring This <hi>Name</hi> so much, that one of them stiles himselfe an <hi>Elder,</hi> but none calls himselfe a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. Indeed, <hi>Iudas</hi> is so called; Who (as it were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically) behaved himselfe so, that his <hi>Arch-Bishoprick</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:94761:48"/>
was given to another. I doubt not but the Spirit fore-saw this Word would bee quickly mounted high enough; so that it brands <hi>Iudas</hi> first with This stile.</p>
                  <p>Of much more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ajesty is the Word <hi>Presbyter,</hi> which signifies <hi>Senior.</hi> Under the Law Youth was bound to pay Tribute to Gray haires; and <hi>Senatus</hi> of old was so stiled, <hi>à Senioribus</hi>; Whereas <hi>Episcopus</hi> signifies nothing but an <hi>Overseer:</hi> And such indeed Bishops have beene for many yeares.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the <hi>Name</hi> of Bishop is sometimes (though rarely) used, that the wilfully blinde might stumble: But the <hi>Name</hi> Presbyter very frequent; that Those who love Truth and Light, might still see such a Glympse that might Enlighten them in the midst of Egyptian darknesse: from which, I doubt not, but God will deliver all Christendom in due time.</p>
                  <p>I can finde as little also for the <hi>Office</hi> of a Bishop, as for his <hi>Name</hi> in Scripture, yea much lesse. I can finde our Saviour rebuking his Disciples, striving for precedency; saying, <hi>Hee that will bee first shall bee last.</hi> I can finde St. <hi>Peter</hi> saying, <hi>Lord it not over the flock of Christ:</hi> And St. <hi>Iohn</hi> branding <hi>Diotrephes</hi> with seeking the <hi>Preheminence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But where shall wee finde the usurped <hi>Office</hi> of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in all the Scripture? Can they finde it (by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying glasse) where ever they see the <hi>Name</hi> of Bishop, though but in a Postscript, of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I see many of them fly for their owne Name.</p>
                  <p>I must confesse I have found <hi>some Praescripts</hi> of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes (and other Texts) to bee now part of Scripture; but never yet found any <hi>Postscript</hi> of such Authority. I dare not therefore give it unto These;</p>
                  <p>Which first, were never (that I could learn) received by the Church for <hi>Authentick</hi> Scripture; nor ever fully joyned to the Scripture, but by some distinctive note, till our Bishops times. Yea, some Antient Copies have them not at all; as one very old Greek Copy in Oxford Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if I be not mis-informed.</p>

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:94761:48"/>Againe, These <hi>Postscripts</hi> have many Improbabilities and some repugnancies; as many Learned men observe.</p>
                  <p>As, That of the first to <hi>Timothy; From Laodicea the cheifest City of Phrygia Pacatiana.</hi> Which sure was never so subscribed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who would not have spoken of a <hi>First</hi> Epistle, when as yet there was no <hi>Second,</hi> nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any. Againe, the Epithet <hi>Pacatiana,</hi> came from <hi>Pacatianus</hi> a Roman Deputy, 300. yeares after St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote.</p>
                  <p>The Epistle to <hi>Titus</hi> is thus subscribed, (or rather su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscribed,) <hi>To Titus, ordained the first Bishop of Creet; from Nicapolis of Macedonia:</hi> but it should have beene added; <hi>Whither St. Paul meant to come after the Epistle, but was not there at his writing</hi>; as appeares very probably from the third of the same Epistle <hi>verse</hi> 12. But what meanes that Phrase, Bishop of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Creet?</hi> was there but one <hi>Church</hi> in all <hi>Creet?</hi> This sounds not like the Scripture stile; which alwayes expresseth Nationall Congregations by <hi>Churches</hi> in the <hi>Plurall.</hi> But it may very well be, <hi>Titus</hi> was Bishop (or Pastor) but of one <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Creet:</hi> so that wee shall not need to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout This.</p>
                  <p>Our Adversaries themselves yeeld, there cannot bee much urged from these <hi>Subscriptions. Baronius, Serrarius,</hi> and the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> will ingenuously confesse so much; and Bishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> also against Mr. <hi>Cartwright.</hi>

                  <p>But what if so? Will they bee content to bee limited to This Power? if so, wee shall the sooner agree. I think no man ever thought, Good <hi>Titus</hi> had a Commission heere to draw the <hi>Civill Sword</hi>; or so much as to strike with his <hi>Church Keyes.</hi>

The contrary is not proved, and so This must till then, be Ineffectuall to them.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly and lastly, I beseech you consider by what power he did it; by the power of an <hi>Evangelist.</hi> There are two sorts of them,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Who write.</item>
                     <item>2. Who proclaime the Gospell in an extraordinary way, as coadjuters and messengers to the Apostles in this great worke.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Of this last sort certainly he was<note n="*" place="margin">See 2. Cor. 8.23.</note>. A Bishop he was not;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94761:49"/>
for our adversaries doe all agree, that it is the duty of a Bishop <hi>curae sue incumbere,</hi> to watch over his charge: now this he did not, for if <hi>Creet</hi> was his Charge (which in no way, neither by Scripture nor Antiquity is proved) he did not attend it; for we finde him continually journeying up and downe; he leaveth <hi>Creet</hi> and commeth to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> from thence he is sent to <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nth,</hi> after that into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> from <hi>Macedonia</hi> he is returned to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Neither is it to be found in History that he ever returned to <hi>Creet.</hi> Thus if I mistake not, the Text is lesse advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous than the Postscript.</p>
                  <p>Some thinke to finde Episcopacy established in that example of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> writing to the <hi>Angels</hi> of the seven Churches. But this is <hi>Argumentum longè petitum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Because <hi>Paul</hi> endorseth the Letter of a Corporation, or an Assembly, to the most eminent man in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Therefore He shall have sole Jurisdiction; therefore the Maior shall have sole power without the Aldermen, <hi>est par ratio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the Church of the Thessalonians (1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. v. 27.) commanding That Epistle to be read to all the holy Brethren; the Church of the Thessalonians should have Jurisdiction over other Churches: which truely I doe not thinke to be a strong Argumentation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Word is taken collectively for the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly and charge of Ministers, and not for One, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth evidently, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. v. 24. He saith, speaking to the Angel, <hi>To you</hi> and to the rest in <hi>Thyatira:</hi> he puts the <hi>Angel</hi> in the plurall number, which hee would not have done had he written to a single Bishop.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, these Epistles are written to the whole Church for the threats and promises are read to them, and the <hi>Epiphonema</hi> of every Epistle is this, he that hath an eare let him heare, what is spoken to the Churches.</p>
                  <p>But yet if this superscription could give any advantage to the Angel, it would but extend to his owne congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:94761:50"/>The <hi>Laodicean Angel</hi> hath no influence upon the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphian,</hi> or the <hi>Smyrnite</hi>; and if that be not proved, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is gained in the point of Episcopacy, except it could be proved, that these Angels had in their care many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations under these particular Churches: which never hath, nor ever will appeare. I hope it is manifest to all men that they cannot establish <hi>Episcopacy</hi> by Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is much in Scripture against them; For the word <hi>Elder</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> is all one, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>For this cause left I thee in Creet, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordaine Elders in every City, as I had appinted thee; for a Bishop must be blamelesse, as the Steward of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, he sheweth <hi>Titus</hi> what manner of man an Elder must be, <hi>viz Blamelesse</hi>; and now proveth it, because a Bishop must be blamelesse. As if I should write to <hi>Thomas</hi> to live soberly, because a <hi>Man</hi> must be sober; it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily followeth that <hi>Thomas</hi> is a man.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. he writes to the Bishops and Deacons at <hi>Philippi.</hi> Is it probable that a little Towne in <hi>Macedonia</hi> should have many <hi>Bishops,</hi> when one Bishop must have many Cities, in his Dioces? Those <hi>Who translated the Bible,</hi> foresaw This: And therefore <hi>Acts</hi> 20. They have translated the word <hi>Episcopus</hi> an <hi>Over-seer.</hi> Yet in other places they translate it <hi>Bishop.</hi> And the Jesuites say <hi>Piae fraudes sunt licitae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The carriage of the Apostles, in severall places is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable: when they come to a City (as <hi>Acts</hi> 20.) They send for the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church, never thinking of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> he is so inconsiderable a man. These places I hope make cleerely against them; So now I will endeavour to shew what the Scripture holdeth forth for Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

                  <p>IN this search you will agree that the Government is fixed there, where you shall see setled the plenary and absolute power of Election of Officers, Decision of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, and Excommunication of those that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse.</p>
                  <p>This you will find ministerially in the Officers, But <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiativè, virtualiter, &amp; conclusivè,</hi> in the People.</p>
                  <p>The Officers are called Overseers, Rulers, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Some of these are to preach and administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, others to watch over mens manners, others to serve Tables, and looke to the poore: All these are chosen by the People: but whensoever by their industry any delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency is discovered, the whole matter is brought to the Church, and there the people and Elders doe passe their definitive sentence.</p>
                  <p>Examine but where election of Officers, decision of controversies &amp; excommunication of members are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and you shall have them all in the Church; not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative,</hi> but in the whole Church, consisting of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and other members.</p>
                  <p>As first for <hi>election, Acts</hi> 1.15. <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh to the People, and telleth them they must choose one in <hi>Iudas</hi> his place, and <hi>ver.</hi> 23. It is said <hi>They</hi> appointed Two. It is true the lot divided which of them two should be the man, (a course in the like case, not unlawfull to us at this day:) But the reducing of it to Two, was the act of the <hi>Church</hi>; though <hi>Peter</hi> was amongst them. So afterwards <hi>Timothy</hi> received his Evangelicall gift by the Imposition of Presbyteriall hands; which Presbyters were in this worke, the servants of one present Congregation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Decision of Controversies, either in cases of Conscience, or in point of manners. In cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94761:51"/>
when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had no small difference about Circumcision, they sent to Jerusalem where the <hi>Apostles, Elders,</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> meeting together, joyntly returned that answer which you finde <hi>Acts</hi> 15.23.24.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Some would presse this place, this act of the Apostles further, and give to every Synod a Commanding Power; because it is said <hi>Act.</hi> 15.28. <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay no further burden upon you.</hi> Therefore they say a Synod hath a commanding and burdening Power.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot consent to that: for then the major part of the Churches in <hi>Europe, Africa, Prester Iohns</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, might meet and command all the Churches of Christ (which God forbid,) in what they pleased; and that <hi>jure divino:</hi> for God when hee giveth a rule to his Church, hee speaketh to the whole Church of Christ, and not to any particular Congregation. I only presse it thus farre, That the <hi>People</hi> were joyned even with the <hi>Apostles,</hi> in that Great Synod.</p>
                  <p>The Commanding power of the Synod lay in this, that the Apostles speak the minde of the Holy Ghost. But such authority is not left in us; and therefore no such Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon others: Truly if there were such a power left us, I should with much scurple resist any act of such Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereof I could make a good construction; For many times the power Commanding is more dangerous than the thing Commanded: but there is no such power. Neither, as I said before, doe I presse it with such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</p>
                  <p>In cases of Civill converse, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. Wee must make our addresses to the Church; and hee that will not heare the Church must be as a Publican.</p>
                  <p>In that place the greatest dispute will be, What is meant by the Church? for some will say, Here is meant the Church <hi>representativè</hi>; either in <hi>more,</hi> as the Presbytery, or in <hi>one,</hi> as the <hi>Bishop</hi>; and not the Church at large.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94761:51"/>
But I would labour to evince the contrary. Weigh either the Context, or the generall signification of the word <hi>Church,</hi> and I hope the true sense will be manifest.</p>
                  <p>For, Let us see how <hi>Church</hi> is taken in the Scripture; It is used sometimes <hi>figurativè</hi>; and sometimes <hi>properly. Figurativè,</hi> as when a particular house is called a <hi>Church</hi>; As, <hi>the Church in his house, Rom.</hi> 16.5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When by <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> the head is put for the whole; as Christ is called the <hi>Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Collectivè,</hi> When all the Churches of Christ are called the <hi>Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. It is used perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some other figures, but it will bee long to quote them all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is used Properly in two phrases;</p>
                  <p>First, When the Congregation is called the Church; as the Church at <hi>Ephesus, Corinth, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, When the Congregations are called <hi>Churches</hi>; as the <hi>Churches of Galatia,</hi> and of <hi>Iadea.</hi> Thus it is used <hi>Properly,</hi> Thus <hi>Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively</hi>; but no where <hi>Representativè: scil.</hi> the Ministers, the Presbyters, or the Bishops; or all these, for the Church. You shall finde these and the Church contradistinct; as, <hi>To the Saints, the Bishops,</hi> and <hi>the Deacons,</hi> 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>To the Church,</hi> and <hi>the Elders, Act.</hi> 15.4.</p>
                  <p>I conceive wee are bound to take a word in that sense which is currant in Scripture; except that sense cleerely crosse the scope and spirit of the text.</p>
                  <p>You shall meet with that word 48. times in the New Testament, and no where signifying that which wee call the <hi>Representative Church</hi>; Very often for the Saints themselves: As, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 15.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. Why should we not then take it in the same sense? Are not wee then bound to expound the word <hi>Church</hi> in some of those significations which are frequent in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and not in that sense, which is so far from being found in the text, that a Contradistinct phrase is, as I said before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ather used?</p>
                  <p>Againe, From the text and context that will appeare to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94761:52"/>
be the meaning of the Spirit, and no other: The text is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>If hee shall neglect to heare Them, tell the Church; but if hee neglect to heare the Church, let him bee to thee as a heathen man, and a Publican.</hi> The context is in the 15. and 16. verses, <hi>If thy brother shall trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone: If hee shall beare thee, then hast thou gained thy brother; but if hee will not heare thee, then take with thee one or two more; that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the context and the text there are three things to bee examined, before the true sense can bee found out: First, Who are meant in that <hi>Gradation,</hi> in the 15, 16, 17. <hi>v.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Who is meant by <hi>Them, v.</hi> 17. (if hee will not heare <hi>Them.</hi>) Thirdly, What is meant by <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Who is meant in that <hi>Gradation.</hi> In the first place is meant the Party; in the second is meant the Elders, or the Bishops, the Officers of the Church.</p>
                  <p>If you say, They are not there understood: yet I am confident you will not, I am sure you cannot, say, they are there excluded. If then the Spirit pointed at <hi>them,</hi> with the other members of the Church, or <hi>them solely</hi>; It would be an unnecessary thing, to bring <hi>him</hi> afterwards to <hi>them</hi> againe, as to the <hi>Representative</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By <hi>Thee,</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 17.) is not meant only the Party, but every Christian, every Church member, to whomsoever the newes of such a miscarriage shall come: Else this will bee a meanes to nourish particular parties sidings, (which the Scripture doth exceedingly shun,) If by Gods Law hee should bee a Publican to one of the Church and not another: If hee be so to every member of the Church, this will bee a hard case, That if a Bishop, or an Elder, one, two, or more, shall passe the bitter sentence of Excommunication, hee must be so to mee also, though I know nothing of it.</p>
                  <p>But some will say, that must be done before the Church.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94761:52"/>
To which I answer, The word saith no such matter. And thus those who mis-expound the Scripture, must eck out the Scripture, to make good their own imagination.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, Why should it be complained of, before the Church, if the deciding power be in the Officers? <hi>Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra fit per plura, quod fieri potest per pauciora.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thirdly and lastly, If you will have the whole Church heare; it seemeth to mee against all reason in the world, that the party deputed should have power, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deputing being present. The Steward of a Court Leet, or Court Baron, is annihilated, if the Lord bee there. All Officers vaile bonnet, when the party giving them power is present.</p>
                  <p>Why are Parliaments the representative body of the Kingdome, but because the Plough cannot stand? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e can containe the whole body? But if all the people could meet in <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> should Those who now are but servants, then bee more than servants? surely the whole Church being present, foure or five by Gods Law shall not rule all, seeing Gods Law never appoints any standing Laws against the rules of nature.</p>
                  <p>In the third place wee must enquire after the sense of <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Publican: sc.</hi> the most odious of men. Is it possible that any Christian shall bee to any Christian the most odious of men, for the sentence of a Judge which hee never heard, neither hath right to heare?</p>
                  <p>Thus if you will bee bound either by <hi>text</hi> or <hi>context,</hi> or the <hi>common acceptation</hi> of the word in the Scripture; by <hi>Church</hi> must bee understood the whole Congregation.</p>
                  <p>Againe, for excommunication of members, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. S. <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth Them, (<hi>sc.</hi> the whole Church) to put away that wicked person, and to deliver up such a one to Satan. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. They restore him, They forgive him.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see every where, That in election of Officers, in decision of Controversies, in cases of Conscience, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, the whole Church disposeth everything, not the Bishops, not the Presbyters alone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:94761:53"/>I doe not observe the Church hath power in other things, but in these, and in all these, in election of Officers, in decision of controversies and excommunication of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, the whole power is in the Church.</p>
                  <p>I conceive then I have cleerely and briefly proved these three things:
<list>
                        <item>1 That there is little in Scripture for Episcopacy; much lesse for such an Episcopacy as Ours.</item>

Yea, I doe professe the distraction of <hi>Heresies,</hi> the most miserable of all Civill conquassations, disjoynt the outward estate; but <hi>Heresies</hi> distract our soules, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our Churches, stave off Iew and Gentile, who know not whether part to believe, shake the weaker, cause heart-burning amongst the stronger, doe exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoke God to wrath and displeasure. But first, let us consider whether it be possible to be without Heresies and Schismes. Secondly, whether Episcopacy be not the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause of the most grievous Schismes, and Heresies. Thirdly, whether Those which may justly be feared upon the removall of Episcopacy, be of such dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as to weigh downe the keeping up of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, rather than to hazard what inconveniences may there-hence follow.</p>
                  <p>And 1 to the first of these.</p>
                  <p>It will bee cleere both from experience, and Scripture, and reason, that Heresies must come. Look over all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all times, and you shall finde them distracted with difference of opinions: How many severall Sects doe you heare of amongst the Jewes, and some of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame grosse? the Sadduces, the Pharisees, the Esseans, Herodians, with many more; though a great Critique reduce them to Three. Christ had no sooner committed the care of his Church to the Apostles, Disciples, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ministers; but they were over-runne with Heresies: Yea, in their time, some were of <hi>Paul,</hi> some of <hi>Apollo,</hi> some of <hi>Cephas</hi>; in the interim <hi>Christ</hi> quite laid aside. In the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> were there not some that held the Doctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi>? In <hi>Thyatira</hi> did not some of the Church listen to the Prophetesse <hi>Iezebel,</hi> who taught them to commit fornication, and to eate things offered to Idolls? <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were
 at some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: the Doctrine of workes was pressed upon the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> and the resurrection from the dead questioned by the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>

had you not the <hi>Peripatelickes,</hi> the <hi>Sceptiques,</hi> the <hi>Platonists,</hi> the <hi>Epicureant,</hi> and many other <hi>Sects</hi>? The Pope and Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, have beene much turmoyled with Schismes; and these Schismes have produced great confusions amongst them.</p>
                  <p>In the yeare of the Lord 420. <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chosen, the Clergy chose <hi>Eulatius,</hi> and there they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed one another Heretickes; <hi>Simmachus</hi> and <hi>Lawrentius</hi> caused the same distraction in the yeare 499.760. Pope <hi>Custantine</hi> being convinced of Schismes and berest of both his eyes, he and <hi>Philip</hi> (another Pope) were deposed, and <hi>Stephen</hi> elected in their places. Thus it was 958.973.995.1047.1058.1062.1083.1100.1118.1124. in the yeare of the Lord 1130, the disputes betwixt <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> (Both chosen Popes) were so famous that it was growne a Proverbe and recorded in this verse.</p>
                  <p>Petrus habet Romam, totum Gregorius orbem.</p>
                  <p>Every twenty yeares had such changes as these, even till of late, that Church hath beene vehemently turmoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all their Learned. Amongst the Schoolemen, some are <hi>Scotists,</hi> some <hi>Thomists</hi>: among the <hi>Polemiques,</hi> some <hi>Iesuites,</hi> some <hi>Dominicans.</hi> And all these wrangle each with other.</p>
                  <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1400. there was a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about the Originall sinne of the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene 1215. and 1294. was that great Faction betweene the <hi>Guelsians</hi> and <hi>Gibelines</hi> (though both were Papists) One desending the authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the other of the <hi>Emperour.</hi> In some points of Controversie, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (one of their ablest Writers) is not to be read without restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and not without Licence of superiors.</p>
                  <p>If we survey all Antiquity, we shall finde no one Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury free from <hi>Heretickes. Ebion, Cerinthus, Marcion, Samosatenus, Novatians, Sabellians, Nepotians, Maniches, Arrians, Pelagians,</hi> with many others, have troubled the Church from time to time.</p>
                  <p>If you descend so low as our daies, even among
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94761:55"/>
Protestants you shall meet with too too many Divisions. <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>; and the English Church betweene both; a <hi>Calvinist</hi> for Doctrine, a <hi>Lutheran</hi> for Discipline. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> are divided in <hi>Rigidiores, &amp; Molliores,</hi> and these differ <hi>toto Coelo.</hi> The <hi>Calvinists</hi> have many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes: How fiercely doth learned <hi>Erastus</hi> contend with <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> about <hi>Excommunication</hi> denying the Church any such power?</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> hath three maine Divisions; The <hi>Conformist,</hi> the <hi>Non-Conformist,</hi> and the <hi>Separarist.</hi> The <hi>Conformist</hi> hath the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Divine, contending with the <hi>Arminian, Socinian, Pelagian, Anabaptist,</hi> and divers others; who yet All stile themselves Sonnes of the Church of England. The <hi>Non-conformist</hi> is uncertaine what he scrupleth; for some can dispence with one of the three Grand Nocent-innocent Ceremonies; some with another, some with neither. The <hi>Separist</hi> is subdivided too (as they say) into <hi>Seperatist,</hi> and <hi>Semi-seperatist.</hi> Many other Divisions there also be, will be, in Churches here.</p>
                  <p>Yea, it is cleare in Reason, that Divisions, Sects, Schismes, and Heresies, must come; For, many are apt to advance themselves and undervalue all others: and Mens Braines being fertile of errors, after they have conceived they must bring forth; though the Gospell suffer never so much by it. And while This Temper is among men, you must still expect <hi>Schismes</hi> and <hi>Heresies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Scripture hath put this out of all doubt, it saith, <hi>Heresies must come.</hi> Christ came to set a Sword, not only betweene the Good and Bad, but even among Professors of the same Christian Religion; that Those who hold out to the End may have their Honour and Reward. It is to be marked that Christ doth not presse his people to seeke their freedome, till <hi>Rome</hi> bee falling, and then he saith, <hi>Come out of her my People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, the Scripture foretelleth of one <hi>Heresie</hi> that is not yet (perhaps) come; it may be it is now in the Birth;

                  <p>Expositors all agree This misery to be in the Waine: But in their agreement they differ very much; for some conceive the <hi>Papist</hi> is here understood; others apply it to the late Troublers of Israel, the <hi>Arminian, Socinian,</hi> and the worst sort of Episcopall men, that under the Notion of indifferent Ceremonies would have brought us to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low downe all <hi>Popery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But under favour, I doubt neither of These, reach the full meaning of the Text. It cannot be the <hi>Papist,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not to rise till the <hi>Last Dayes.</hi> Indeed <hi>Popery</hi> is cleerely expressed in the 1 of <hi>

                     </gap>(as that most Learned and Reverend man Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> hath fully cleered in his most excellent peece on that Text) yet there they are said to rise in the Later Times (<hi>viz.</hi> of the Roman Empire;) but here these new Hereticks come not out till the <hi>Last</hi> (not only <hi>Later) Dayes,</hi> not only <hi>Times,</hi> but <hi>Dayes</hi> of those <hi>Times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, it seemes not to be the <hi>Arminian</hi> (or any of that Rable I mentioned but now.) For first, the Character of their Times is Perillous, as if it would intimate men indeed should be in danger, but yet escape, the Times
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94761:56"/>
being only perillous: But while Popery bore all before it, forced the whole Church into the Wildernesse, cloathed the Witnesses with Sackcloth, and at last prevailes to kill them: sure these Times are more than perillous. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there is no pressing force in This.</p>
                  <p>In the second place let us consider the Character of the Persons. First, they are expressed as Breakers of the Lawes of <hi>Civill Converse</hi>; and then as <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi>: the first of these beginneth at the second, and contiueth to the fifth verse: The second is in the fifth and si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th verses. Let us view some passages in both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lovers of themselves, Covetous, Proud, &amp;c.</hi> And have not men beene such ever since <hi>Adam</hi>? Why then doth the Spirit speake of This as a strange thing in the <hi>Last Dayes</hi>? Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> saw this Objection, and therefore oft affirmes (that the Scripture may not seem to speake <hi>Frigidè</hi>) Here must be some new strange Crew of Men that act all These in a most eminent manner, even to the eye of all men.</p>
                  <p>But some will say, Are not the <hi>Papists</hi> so? Is not the corrupter part of <hi>Prelates</hi> such? Are not the <hi>Arminians</hi> of this temper? Certainely they are such, and in an eminent manner; and yet to me they seeme not the men the Spirit pointeth at in this place.</p>
                  <p>The maine Thing in which these men (here exprest) pride themselve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, is not Learning, or Parts; But (if I bee not much mistaken) somewhat beyond and within all these: That, I suppose, which seemes to them to bee the Spirit. This, I conceive, is the <hi>Basis</hi> of all their vanity, pride, and insolence. They have the Spirit, and so know more than all the Learned, Pious, Godly Men in the world. They have the Spirit, they cannot sinne, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre; they will not pray, but when that Spirit moves. <hi>Adultery</hi> is but an act of the Flesh, but they are all Spirit, and no flesh. What should these men doe with Naturall affections, they are all Spirit? in this case if they be Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, High-minded, Heady, &amp;c. Who will wonder? What may they not be carried up to, by the imagination
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94761:56"/>
of the Spirit? But let them take heede, if they have any thing of God in them; let them be wise in this their day, for the time may come when it will bee too late. In the meane time I will say as <hi>Peter</hi> did to <hi>Simon, Pray</hi> (that if it bee possible) <hi>this wickednesse of heart may bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we look on the other part of their Character, <hi>Having a forme of Godlinesse, but denying the Power thereof, Creeping into the houses of silly women, Laden with divert Lusts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>How can these be spoken of <hi>Arminians, Socinians,</hi> or our Prelates? It were to be wished that most of These had so much as a <hi>Forme</hi> of Godlinesse. Sure the World is now growne too wise to take Duckings, and Cringings, Crossing, and Crouching, with all of this kinde, to be so much as a <hi>Forme</hi> of Godlinesse.</p>
                  <p>Doe These creep into Womens houses? the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> attempt no such pranks, that I know of. And the Patrons of Episcopacy use not much perswasion, but Club law: All else is in Corners.</p>
                  <p>It seems very probable to me, that the Holy Ghost in This text points out some such, as the <hi>Family of Love,</hi> the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and <hi>Grindletonians</hi> are, if (at least) they are not much belyed. And to these, I think, every piece of This Character will most properly belong. Yea and the Close of it also, or the Issue of That Sect. <hi>They shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther, for their folly shall be made manifest to all men,</hi> which can hardly be understood either of <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,</hi> or <hi>Prelacy,</hi> since <hi>That</hi> in severall names, <hi>This</hi> in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall dresses, hath been in the world above 1000. years.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see <hi>Sects, Schismes,</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi> will still come, and must come: And therefore if by keeping such Bishops we think to keep out all Divisions, we are much deceived. Which yet I spake not to take away watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Church-Governours, (who are still bound to suppresse Divisions as much as they can) but to convince men of This (if I can) that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is never like to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94761:57"/>
prevent Schismes: which I hope to cleere more fully in my subsequent discourse.</p>
                  <p>I could never conceive more than Two wayes, that in probability may be like to quiet us in respect of Divisions. One of These we have no minde to try, and the other we may not if we would.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniard indeed by his cruell <hi>Inquisition,</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined his Subjects to a kinde of <hi>Vnity</hi>; but an Vnity of Darknesse and Ignorance: so that the Remedy proves worse than the Disease. Neither will, or can Tyranny ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Civill, or Ecclesiastick, bring forth better fruit.</p>
                  <p>The other <hi>Way</hi> is That of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> (in the Low Countreyes) who let every <hi>Church</hi> please her selfe in her owne way, so long as she leaveth the <hi>State</hi> to her selfe. And how Religion doth flourish There, is known to most men. I will not dispute This now; only I wish heartily, men would remember, that even <hi>Nature</hi> her selfe as much abhorres a <hi>forced violent Vnion,</hi> as a <hi>Rent</hi> or <hi>Division.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUt in the next place, let us seriously consider, whether the Bishops (as now they be setled here) be not the Cause of most Sects, Schismes, and Heresies now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us.</p>
                  <p>Some of them will not deny themselves to be <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>; and others cannot deny themselves <hi>Socinians.</hi> If at least they think we can understand their writings, printings, yea and Sermons, though These bee very Rate.</p>
                  <p>Yea some doe not deny, but they may (at least) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Orders; they meane a Pale, Mitre, and Cardinalls Hat, if they come. All which we may yet better construe by their carriage to Priests and Jesuites, both in publique and private, which now we know more than by bare sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. Many of These they countenance openly, and never question any, though it be certainly knowne: we had
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94761:57"/>
(they had) more such in London, than were good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in all England almost.</p>
                  <p>All the Livings under most of our Bishops have been committed to the Cure and Care of superstitious Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, Arminians, Socinians, Papists, or Atheists. Yea the Universities are much corrupted by their malignant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; for, <hi>Nero</hi>-like they think they have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, till they have murdered their owne Mother. In a word, through the whole Kingdome, Preaching, Praying, Expounding, and the like exercises, both in publick and private, are severely suppressed, and in many places alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether forbidden (except such and such, more pernicious than profitable;) and all This by the Fathers of our Church, the Lords our Bishops. And is not This the most compendious way possible to beget and encrease <hi>Heresies?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They cry out of Schisme, Schisme; Sects and Schismes; and well they may: They make them, and it is strange they should not know them. When they laid such stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks (Reall Scandals, not only <hi>accepta,</hi> but <hi>data</hi>) in the way of good men, whose Consciences they have grievously burdened, and wounded with Things (vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently pressed on the greatest fines) that are so farre from being indifferent, that many of them were point blank unlawfull: have they not by This even forced their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to separate themselves in Judgement and Practice, till they could finde some remote place that might sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their bodies also? Was not This in Them the readiest way to produce Divisions, Separations, and (as they call it) <hi>Schismes</hi> in the Church? Rents are bad, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, where ever they be violent; but yet then worst, when most out of the eye. <hi>Schismes</hi> in the <hi>Conscience</hi> are of greatest danger; and to prevent These, if I am forct to That, which they please to call a <hi>Schisme</hi> in the Church, Woe to Him that so forceth me. Scandals, Schismes, and Divisions must come; but woe to him by whom they come. God forgive them in This paticular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:94761:58"/>I professe I take no pleasure in ripping up their foule, loathsome sores; I would they could bee throughly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without launcing and opening. I could give you a strange account of sad Divisions, which themselves have caused both to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State:</hi> I could tire you and my selfe in This, though I should begin but little higher than mine owne Time, mine owne Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>In Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Time, many good men were cut off from the <hi>Church,</hi> some from the <hi>State,</hi> a sad Schisme! Some by violence laid asleep; Many suspended, silenced, deprived, cut off (by a strange Schisme,) from liberty, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, (that I goe not higher;) And all This for one word, of their owne compounding, <hi>Non-Conformity</hi>: While they themselves are indeed the greatest <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> to all the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, It would have savoured more of Humility, of Christianity, if they had suspected their owne Judgements and Opinions; allowing something to the Judgement, Learning, and Piety of those holy, worthy, pretious Saints, <hi>Calvin, Beza, Bucer, P. Martyr, Oecolampadius, Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> with many more, great, famous, and eminent Lights, in their times.</p>
                  <p>If they will stand for <hi>Conformity</hi>; Let any man living judge, whether it bee fitter for some few Bishops, newly come out of grosse Popery, (and still retaining their old Popish Ceremonies,) to <hi>reforme,</hi> and <hi>conforme</hi> themselves to the Judgement and Practice of all <hi>Reformed Churches</hi>; or all Churches to subscribe to Them.</p>
                  <p>As they began, so they continued: Christ and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like <hi>parallel</hi> lines, though they should run out <hi>in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,</hi> they would never meet: Nay rather, like the <hi>Crura</hi> of a <hi>Triangle,</hi> the farther they run (out from the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>) the more they differ, and are distant each from other.</p>
                  <p>Under King <hi>Iames,</hi> in a few years, four or five hundred Reverend men were divided from their Livings, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery: And was not this a cruell Schisme? Now also
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94761:58"/>
by Them was first forged that sharpe <hi>Rasor,</hi> (or, <hi>Book of Sports</hi>) with which they have since made great <hi>Divisions</hi> of <hi>heart.</hi>

                  <p>But in our Gracious Kings Reigne, they have come to Cutting off Eares, Cheeks; and have yet struck deeper, and estay'd many <hi>Soule-Schismes</hi>; not only in the Hearts and Consciences of thousands of good men; but whole States also and Kingdomes, as much as in them lay.</p>
                  <p>While I heare the sad groanes, and see the bleeding wounds of Three Kingdomes at once, by their Schismes; I have almost forgotten the parting sighs, and farewell teares of ten thousand poore Christians, by Their Tyranny forc'd to abandon their native Country, and dearest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; while others were here violently detained in Fetters, some smoothered in Dungeons, some Dismembred, some driven out of house and Living, and forced to beg: All which yet would have bin born patiently, had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all Good men, but Goodnes it self, Learning, Religion, Piety, All that speaks any worth, been altogether, not only discountenanced, but suppressed, smoothered, and by most exquisite Tortures almost forced to breath its last.</p>
                  <p>Yet that these Glorious Princes (under whom such Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies have beene committed) may not suffer in your thoughts, Give me leave to speake some things on mine owne knowledge and experience, others from best intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when shee heard of Their miscarriages, fell on Them in most sharpe language, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Them, if they should ever doe the like againe to her Subjects.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> offered faire discourse to the <hi>Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>; honoured Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and others of them; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Book of Sports: And being asked, why hee made so many Bad Bishops, answered ingenuously, with a strong asseveration, <hi>That hee was very sorry, but could not helpe it; For, no good men would take the Office on them.</hi> And our Gracious Soveraigne (since some light hath dawned out of darknesse,) hath delivered our
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94761:59"/>
Sister Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> from that unhappy Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>For, now I hope the Clouds begin to breake away; Light springeth up, while Dark Iniquity is forced not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shut her mouth, but hide her selfe and disappeare. Now the Sun againe mounteth up in our <hi>Horizon,</hi> and quickeneth the drooping spirits; so that now many that were Bed-rid some moneths since, now begin to take up their Beds and walke, leaping up and blessing God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> may bee restrain'd, but <hi>Light</hi> cannot; It will in at every cranny: and the more it is opposed it shines the brighter: so that now to stint it, is to resist an <hi>enlightened, enflamed Multitude</hi>; which still was, and still will be <hi>Durissima Provincia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their mad outrage in all the three Kingdomes, of late, hath so incensed the Common People, that in all mens eyes they are become most vile: and while all men reflect on their constant trade of mischeivous practices, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest begin to conclude, The very Calling hurt the Men, as much as These disgrace the Calling.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have, by too too long, great, and sad experience, found it true, That our Prelates have beene so farre from preventing Divisions; that they have been the Parents and Patrons of most Errors, Heresies, Sects and Schismes, that now disturbe This Church and State.</p>

                  <p>BUt it may bee, the <hi>Remedy</hi> will yet bee worse than this <hi>Disease.</hi> Let us therefore, yet more exactly weigh all the Inconveniences that may attend the Change of This Church-Government, which wee now dispute.</p>
                  <p>The Dangers which some have fancied may hence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to the State, have beene discussed in the former Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94761:59"/>
to which more properly they doe belong. We have here only to consider, such Evils as may have bad influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into the Church, and Polity thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arminianisme, Socinianisme, Superstition, Idolatry, Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> will pack away with Them; being Their Attendants, as was shewed before. What is there then to be feared? <hi>Anabaptisme, Brownisme, Separatisme</hi>; nay every body, every Lay man will turne Preacher.</p>
                  <p>Suppose all This be true, (which can be but supposed;) Would it not bee much better to hazzard the comming in of all These, than still to suffer our soules and bodies, to be groun'd to powder by these Tyrannicall, Antichristian Prelates, that under pretence of keeping out <hi>Separatisme,</hi> introduce downe-right <hi>Popery,</hi> and a sinck of almost all Errors and Heresies? Yea, and these Errors of the Right Hand (which These pretend so much to oppose) owe their birth to our Bishops also; as was but now, and might yet more fully, be cleered. Wee all know, that within these ten yeares, all the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> in England, could not amount to more than one or two hundred: And now how many thousands there bee, (yea of such that rise one pin higher than Old <hi>Non-Conformity,</hi>) Themselves, perhaps, know much better than I: Yet our Bishops never were more active, than in all this time. Whence then ariseth this New <hi>Non-Conformity,</hi> or <hi>Separatisme,</hi> but out of our Bishops Commotions? I will not say, as the Fathers did of old, <hi>Ex martyrum sanguine pullulat Ecclesia</hi>; yet I must confesse, I begin to think there may bee perhaps somewhat more of God in these (which they call new <hi>Schismes,</hi>) than appeares at first glympse.</p>
                  <p>I will not, I cannot, take on mee to defend That, men usually call <hi>Anabaptisme:</hi> Yet I conceive that Sect is Twofold: Some of them hold <hi>Freewill; Community</hi> of all things; deny <hi>Magistracy</hi>; and refuse to <hi>Baptize</hi> their Children. These truly are such Hereticks (or Atheists,) that I question whether any Divine should honour them so much as to dispute with them; much rather sure should
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94761:60"/>
                     <hi>Alexanders</hi> sword determine here, as of old at the Gordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an knot, where it acquired this Motto, <hi>Que solvere non possum, dissecabo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another sort of them, who only deny <hi>Baptisme</hi> to their Children, till they come to yeares of discretion, and then they <hi>baptize</hi> them; but in other things they agree with the Church of England.</p>
                  <p>Truly, These men are much to bee pitied; And I could heartily wish, That before they bee stigmatiz'd with that oppr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>brious brand of <hi>Schismatick,</hi> the Truth might be cleered to them. For I conceive, to those that hold wee may goe no farther than <hi>Scripture,</hi> for Doctrine or Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, it may bee very easie to erre in this Point now in hand; since the Scripture seemes not to have cleerly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined This particular.</p>
                  <p>The Analogy which <hi>Baptisme</hi> now hath with <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi> in the old Law, is a fine Rhetoricall Argument, to illustrate a Point well proved before; but I somewhat doubt, whether it be proofe enough, for that which some would prove by it: since (beside the vast difference in the Ordinances,) the persons to bee Circumcised are stated by a positive Law, so expresse, that it leaves no place for scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but it is farre otherwise in <hi>Baptisme</hi>; Where all the designation of Persons fit to bee partakers, for ought I know, is only, <hi>Such as beleeve.</hi> For this is the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that, with exactest search, I find the Scripture require, in persons to be <hi>baptized:</hi> And <hi>This</hi> it seemes to require in all such persons. Now, how Infants can bee properly said to <hi>beleeve,</hi> I am not yet fully resolved.</p>
                  <p>Yet many things prevaile very much with mee in this point.</p>
                  <p>First, For ought I could ever learne, It was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant custome of the purest and most Primitive Church, to baptize <hi>Infants</hi> of beleeving Parents; For I could never finde the beginning and first Rise of this practice: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is very easie to track Heresies to their first Rising up, and setting soot in the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:94761:60"/>Againe, I finde all Churches (even the most strict) have generally beene of this judgement and practice: yea though there have beene in all ages some, that much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted novelty, and had parts enough to discusse and cleere what they thought good to preach; yet was this scarce ever questioned by men of Note, till within these Last Ages. And sure, the constant judgement of the Churches of Christ, is much to be honoured, and heard in all things that contradict not Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Nor can I well cleere that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.) <hi>Else were your Children Vncleane, but now are they Holy.</hi> I know some interpret it thus, <hi>If it be unlawfull for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever to live in wedlock with one that beleeveth not; Then have many of you lived a long time in unlawfull marriage; and so your very Children must be Illegitimate, and these also must be cast off (as Base-borne:) But it is not so; for, Your Children are Holy</hi>; that is, <hi>Legitimate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confesse, This seemes a very faire Interpretation; yet I much question, Whether This be all the Apostle meanes by that phrase <hi>Holy</hi>; especially when I reflect on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding words, <hi>The Vnbeleever is Sanctified by the Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> Nor yet can I beleeve any <hi>Inherent Holinesse</hi> is here meant; but rather That <hi>Relative Church-Holinesse,</hi> which makes a man capable of admission to <hi>Holy Ordinances,</hi> and so to <hi>Baptisme</hi>; yea and to the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> also, for ought I see; except perhaps Infants be excluded from This Sacrament, by That Text, <hi>Let him that eateth, Examine himselfe, aod so let him eat.</hi> As <hi>Women</hi> are excluded from Church-Government and preaching in Congregations, by That of the same Apostle, <hi>I permit not a Woman to speak; Let Women keep silence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second thing we feare so much, is <hi>Separation,</hi> or as some tearme it <hi>Brownisme</hi>; for I am not so well studied in these, as to give an exact difference betweene them, or properly to state or phrase either. Yet I thinke this also
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94761:61"/>
hath Latitude, and admits of difference. Before you passe any severe censure, be pleased to Heare these Poore men (you call <hi>Separatists</hi>;) Know their Tenets, and then Judge.</p>
                  <p>Their maine Tenets (for ought I could ever learne) are about some few Points in <hi>Discipline,</hi> in which sure there is lesse danger, than in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> of which they dispute not.</p>
                  <p>First, they would admit none as members of their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, generally to partake with them in all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, but such which seeme <hi>Beleeving Saints,</hi> and so members of Christs true Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they conceive every severall Congregation (rightly constituted) hath within it selfe <hi>the power of the keyes,</hi> committed to it, without dependance on other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: Yet not denying the lawfull association of severall Churches, not refusing the advice and counsell of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells and Synods.</p>
                  <p>I shall crave leave to scan the first, and see how much it differeth in truth, from the received Tenets of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doe conceive that <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, even <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe will agree in this, that a Church is <hi>Cetus Fidelium, Gathered together in the Name and power of Christ, to waite on him, in the way of his Ordinances revealed in his Word.</hi> In this I suppose we all agree; where then is that <hi>Chasma,</hi> that great Gulfe of difference, which brands so many with the black spot of <hi>Separation</hi>?</p>
                  <p>All the difficulty lies in Stating who are beleeving Faithfull Saints, for of these only all agree, a true Church consists. I beseech you let us call him a Beleever, and a Saint whom the Scripture calls so, and wee shall soone agree.</p>
                  <p>The Pope saith, he is a faithfull Saint, and a true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church; <hi>Who beleeveth as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> saith, he is a Beleever (enough
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94761:61"/>
to make a Member of that Church) that <hi>professeth the truth,</hi> though in his life he deny it.</p>
                  <p>Those men say he is a faithfull Saint who <hi>professeth the truth,</hi> and to all appearance (for we cannot see the heart) practiseth as he professeth.</p>
                  <p>Now all men will agree, this last is a Beleeving Saint: And these will have none but this to be a Saint; and so none but this to be a Member of Christs Church.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you: Is this such an error, to desire <hi>Profession</hi> and <hi>Practise</hi> to be conjoyned in one that is to be a Member of the Church of Christ?</p>
                  <p>When I desire a good Wife, a faithfull Servant, a constant Friend, a familiar Companion; Am I not as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to know the Heart as well as the Head, the Will as well as Skill, Affection as well as Profession? And why then may I not doe as much in choosing my Spirituall Friends; my constant Companions in the worship and service of God?</p>
                  <p>Can any man by right, force me to marry such or such a woman, to take such a servant, to dwell with such a friend, to choose such a companion? And may any man force me then to bee companion, in the neerest and most intimate converse of Spirituall Ordinances, with any one or more, whom I dare not, I cannot, I may not trust, to be either friends to God or me; because what ere their lips professe, their life and waies deny God, trample on the blood of Christ, despise, at least profane all his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                  <p>I could heartily wish some pitty might bee shewed to these poore mens soules. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to his owne Soule.</hi> And is it not then much better to keepe these men off (as they doe in <hi>Scotland</hi> and other Reformed Churches) till they give the Church satisfaction upon good ground of their Repentance and Faith; that so they may not hurt themselves by Gods holy Ordinances?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sacraments confirme,</hi> but doe not conferre Grace; if they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94761:62"/>
did so, the case were altered; but now they are like the <hi>Paradise</hi> of God, guarded with the <hi>Flaming Sword</hi>; so that the Tree in the midst of the Garden, (which is Christ) cannot be Touched by prophane hands.</p>
                  <p>The other Grand Heresie (men so much cry against) in <hi>Separation,</hi> is the <hi>Independence</hi> of their Congregations, as it was stated before.</p>
                  <p>But why should the <hi>Independence</hi> of One Assembly, to a <hi>Province,</hi> or <hi>Nation,</hi> be more <hi>Schismaticall,</hi> than that of a <hi>Province,</hi> or <hi>Nation,</hi> to the whole <hi>World</hi>? Why may not <hi>Geneva</hi> be as <hi>Independent</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>France</hi> may bee to the other parts of <hi>Europ's</hi> Continent? In <hi>Geneva,</hi> why may not one Congregation, be as independent to All <hi>Geneva</hi> besides, as <hi>Geneva</hi> is to all <hi>France</hi> besides? Doth indeed such a Wall, or River, or Sea, so limit and bound the Church within it, that it may bee independent on any Church without it; and may not one Congregation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this River bee as well independent on all other Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, within the same River or Sea?</p>
                  <p>Are there not some sparklings of this Truth even amongst us in <hi>England</hi>? Have not we <hi>Peculiars</hi>? some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations exempt from the Jurisdiction of the Bishop within whose Diocesse they be? And I thinke no Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist desireth more than this, That all Parishes (I meane all Congregations) should be <hi>Independent Peculiars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppose an East Indi- Merchants Ship be cast on some Remote Iland beyond <hi>China</hi> where there shall be no Inhabitant; may not in this Case, the men of this Ship gather together, choose out some one or more (of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) to Read, Preach, Administer the Sacraments? is not this a true Church, and so to bee reputed while they beleeve the Truth, and doe what they beleeve? Is there any one Essentiall part wanting to this Church, so Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted?</p>
                  <p>If it be answered affirmatively, that there is yet wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting some Essentiall; I rejoyn, then it is not a true Church;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94761:62"/>
nay so farre from being <hi>vera Ecclesia,</hi> that it is not <hi>vere Ecclesia</hi>: For He is not <hi>vere Hom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>If it be yeelded that in such a Case there is nothing Essentiall wanting to This Church: I will againe sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that within a yeare or Two, another English Ship be cast on the same very Iland, and have such another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or Church; I demand now whether it be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that Both These Churches must needs joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at least depend One on the Other.</p>
                  <p>If it be <hi>not necessary,</hi> I have what I desire. If it be <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>; Then was not the former Church a <hi>Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e Church</hi>; because it wanted something <hi>Essentiall</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> to a <hi>Church</hi>; to wit, <hi>Dependance</hi> on some other Church.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, This Church did before depend on the whole <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> I will not gain say it; so They meane onely Thus much, that <hi>This Church was a true member of the True Church or Body of Christ</hi>; which is but made up of so many particular Congregations, as mans Body, of its particular members. And so This will be no more then to say, All the members of the Body are Parts of the Body, and <hi>conjoyned</hi> together, but onely <hi>subordinate</hi> to the Head. For, I suppose no man will say One of my <hi>hands</hi> is dependant on the Other; but both (as all the other members) dependant on my <hi>Head</hi>: so are all particular Churches (I meane Congregations) dependant on their Generall Head, <hi>Christ,</hi> but not on other of their fellow members.</p>
                  <p>If any man shall say, that <hi>Hands</hi> depend not onely on the <hi>Head</hi>; but also on the Armes, <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and <hi>Necke</hi>; which are betweene Them and the <hi>Head,</hi> on whom they ultimately depend.</p>
                  <p>I answer, It is true, the <hi>Hands</hi> are <hi>conjoyned</hi> to the <hi>Armes</hi>; These to the <hi>Shoulders</hi>; and Both by the <hi>Neck</hi> to the <hi>Head</hi>: but yet They <hi>depend</hi> not on any but the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94761:63"/>
                     <hi>Head.</hi> I meane they are not directed and guided by the Dictates of <hi>Arme, Shoulder,</hi> or <hi>Necke,</hi> but onely by the Commands of the <hi>Head</hi>: so that there is onely a bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outward Continuity, and no vertuall <hi>Dependance,</hi> but on the <hi>Head.</hi> The <hi>Head</hi> sends out <hi>Animall Spirits,</hi> and by them guides my <hi>Hand,</hi> as my fancie pleaseth. This Guiding or Directing <hi>Depends</hi> onely on the <hi>Head,</hi> not <hi>Arme,</hi> which (when I meane to move my <hi>Hand</hi>) is but as it were my <hi>Hands Servant,</hi> that must goe and call, and lead my <hi>Hand</hi> (as a Gentleman Usher) but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.</p>
                  <p>So are also all the Churches, all severall Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; They are all members, and are all outwardly conjoyned One to another (through all the world) by the <hi>tendons</hi> and <hi>ligaments</hi> of Rivers, Seas, Hils, Vallies, and the like. Yea and some of These are neerer to Christ their Head, as they keepe themselves purer, and walke more closely in dependance on Him. Yet All these Churches are but <hi>Coordinate,</hi> not among themselves <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi>; They are but conjoyned each to other, not dependant each on other, but All on their Head; which alone can command and move them. Yea though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some One Church may come betweene Christ and another Church (as the Arme betweene the Head and Hand) yet it is there but as a servant to call on, leade, helpe, uphold, (being so commanded by the Head) but not to command, dictate, or over-top its fellow member.</p>
                  <p>You see here what Power we give to Synods and Councels, or all other Churches over one particular Church; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o wit, a counselling, perswading (which sure is very prevailing) but not commanding Authority.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but Christ doth sometimes require One Church to incite, exhort, admonish, and perswade ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fellow Church (though This be not required of any one Angel in the Apocalyps, towards another Church or Angel, yet I suppose it may be in some Cases) yea and so
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94761:63"/>
that the Other Church may haply sinne if shee doe not follow This Call and Counsell: yet not because it comes from her fellow Church, (or any Synod) but because It comes from Christ her Head, that speakes through This Church to her fellow. As the Hand might justly bee sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led rebellious that rejects the Animall Spirits sent from the Head, though they come <hi>through</hi> the Arme; Which is here in this Case, not onely a servant to the <hi>Head,</hi> but to the <hi>Hand</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>Yet doth not the <hi>Hand</hi> rebell, because it refuseth That which comes from the <hi>Arme,</hi> but because it came from the <hi>Head,</hi> but through the <hi>Arme</hi> as an Instrument. For if ever the <hi>Arme</hi> impose ought on the <hi>Hand,</hi> which comes not from the <hi>Head</hi> (as it doth sometimes in a flux of putrid humours from an ulcer in the <hi>Arme</hi>) in this Case the <hi>Arme</hi> erres in so imposing on the <hi>Hand,</hi> but the <hi>Hand</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels not in rejecting what the <hi>Arme</hi> so sends: because it comes not from the <hi>Head.</hi> On which (and on which alone) all the members vertually <hi>depend,</hi> and not on any one or more fellow members.</p>
                  <p>All this while, though we dispute the Independan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Churches among themselves; yet we have not the least shadow of a Thought to withdraw any Church from the <hi>Civill Magistrate</hi>; Nay, These men (whom our Bishops brand so with Separation) most cordially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that if <hi>Episcopacie</hi> can prove greater or better <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> or but equall to Them, They will not scruple to subscribe to Them.</p>
                  <p>But alas, if we once give way to <hi>Dependance</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> must not the Church of <hi>England</hi> Depend on the <hi>Dutch</hi>; or the <hi>Dutch</hi> on <hi>England</hi>; as much as one Church in <hi>England</hi> must Depend on a <hi>Provinciall</hi> Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or <hi>Nationall</hi> in all <hi>England?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if the English Church must Depend on the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> on <hi>English,</hi> which shall be <hi>Inferior?</hi> This or That? by This Dispute of <hi>Precedencie,</hi> we shall at length <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94761:64"/>
Bishops Sees were heretofore, for superiority. <hi>Pompejus non admittit superiorem, Caesar non parem.</hi> And now I conceive <hi>Yorke</hi> is Inferior to <hi>Canterbury, Durham</hi> to <hi>Yorke,</hi> not by any Law Morall, or of Nature, but positive of State.</p>
                  <p>Yea, by This <hi>Dependance,</hi> will follow a farre greater Evill than This dispute and confusion about <hi>Precedencie</hi>: For if One whole Church must so depend on another, then must also the Officers of This depend on Those of That Church, And if so, shall not all Church Officers returne to the Pope at length, as to One Supreme Head on Earth.</p>

                  <p>Perhaps All the <hi>Inconveniences</hi> that can be objected on <hi>Independance,</hi> though they could not be answered (as I conceive they may) will not ballance This One Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of <hi>Dependance.</hi> But no more of This.</p>
                  <p>The next Grand Inconvenience that may be feared on the removall of our Prelates, is <hi>Licentia praedicandi</hi>; not onely in that sense in which This phrase is used be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, and was in that sense forbidden under our Last Royall King' <hi>Iames</hi>: That was <hi>Licentia quoad Materiam</hi>; This <hi>quoad Personam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now they say, Not onely Every <hi>matter</hi> will be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, what every Minister pleaseth, but also Every <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> will turne <hi>Preacher</hi>: Even Shoomakers, Coblers, Felt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, and any other.</p>
                  <p>God is the God of Order, and not of Confusion. And if <hi>Order</hi> is to be observed any where, It is sure in matter of <hi>Worship</hi>: For if through the Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault Disorder breake in, at any craney: you shall finde the Breach grow wider and wider every day: Except
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94761:64"/>
the Cleft be stopt, the Ship may quickly sinke. And therefore I shall wholly agree, and joyne with Them that indeavour with the first, to allay the very semblance and apparition (lesse than the least bubling up) of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Onely this I could heartily wish, that Fire and Fagot may not determine this Controversie; that These men may not be dealt with, as were some of the Martyrs in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies; For oft when the Bishops could not reply, They would start up and sweare by the <hi>Faith of their Body,</hi> that This was a dangerous, grosse, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall opinion: and All This was but a Prologue to That Tragedy, whose Epilogue was Flame and Fagot, or at least the <hi>Fasces</hi> to younger men.</p>
                  <p>We have oft seene some of These Preachers before the highest Tribunall in This Kingdome; For we thought it unreasonable (with Those in the <hi>Acts</hi>) to condemne any before they were heard.</p>
                  <p>I was not their Judge alone, nor will I be at. This time. Onely that it may appeare I attended their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (as it becomes any in a Court of Justice) I will give the world an account, what Those men say for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and so I shall leave them to be judged by wise men.</p>
                  <p>First, they conceive there be some Ordinances which are proper onely to the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Church-Officers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing onely to Church Assemblies (such as is the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Sacraments, the Conferring of Orders, and all of this nature) These they thinke <hi>Sacred,</hi> such as may not be touched by any but Church-Officers; and of These they say, let <hi>Vzza<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     </hi> take heede how hee touch the <hi>Arke,</hi> though it shake.</p>
                  <p>But there are other Ordinances (they say) of a Middle nature; as they are exercised in a Church Assembly, by Church-Officers, They may truly be called <hi>Church-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>; yet are such as may be used Out of Church As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and therefore probably by Other th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n Church-Officers;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94761:65"/>
As Praying, Reading the Scripture, Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, Exhortation, and the like; which (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) are not confined to the <hi>Church</hi> onely, or <hi>Church-Officers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because Heathens and Publicans may be admitted, nay ought to be invited, to These <hi>Ordinances.</hi> And it seemes no Mortall sinne, for a Lay-man in <hi>China,</hi> to call together a company of Heathens, and preach to them the Christian Religion, yet here is no True Church, till a Congregation will Embrace This Doctrine, and joyne in serving God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They conceive Our State, by publike authority, hath and doth allow so much as This. For they see Clerkes (even in publike Assemblies) Read Psalmes, Prayers, and oft some parts of Scripture; Deacons preach, yea and Baptize, and helpe to administer the Lords Supper, and yet no man takes them for complete Ministers: yea of old, and perhaps now also by Law, they are not at all Clergy men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Former Preachers have taught them, that every Master of a Family, may and must read, pray, Catechise, and the like, in his owne Family, if he have none there that can doe it better than himselfe. Therefore These seeme rather to come under the Notion of Private Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties rather than Publike Church-Ordinances; though sometime they be performed in Churches, yet other times they may be performed out of Churches, and by Those that are not publike Church Officers.</p>
                  <p>Therefore These poore men (through their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) thinke such Ordinances Free to be performed by any Christian, whether of the Clergy, or Laity. And their Zeale makes them conceive, If God give gifts of Understanding, Memory, Judgement, &amp; Utterance; and an Earnest Desire to doe good with These (lest they wrap up their Talent in a Napkin) They have the Maine (to wit, an inward) Call to performe these duties in their owne Families: or else where, if They have an outward Call too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:94761:65"/>For they solemnly professe, they hold it not fit to presse or intrude themselves on any Congregation: But if any will come of themselves, either to their owne Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: or send for them, and desire to heare them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong some Good men, they take this for a Call, an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Call, to performe Those duties, to that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, they thinke the wayes of Gods Spirit are free, and not tied to a University man; so that having an Inward call, they conceive the desire of any One Congregation, is Outward call sufficient, though the Bishop call not.</p>
                  <p>Yea, some Exercises in Gods worship, They thinke there be, which are warranted from the Gift that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, and not from the Call that invites: so that a man whom God hath enabled with Parts and Gifts, might use them, though no man Living call him. And this also is the Judgement of many Learned men; as of That Ingenuous, Worthy, Learned man Master <hi>Thorndick,</hi> of late Touching on That of the <hi>Corinths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So long then as they Encroach not on Ordinances appropriate to <hi>Church-Officers,</hi> they thinke they sinne not in performing other duties, where there are none that can, or will, performe them better. They have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Latine Enough to say, <hi>Bonum quo Communius, eo melius.</hi> They have read of <hi>Moses,</hi> wishing all the Lords People were Prophets; and that God would poure out his Spirit on them all.</p>
                  <p>Yea they have heard that God promised to poure out his Spirit upon all Flesh, all Beleevers (as well Lay as Clergie) so that Young men should see Visions, and Old men dreame Dreames, and though This were begunne to be accomplished Even in Our Saviours time, yet They (perhaps through ignorance) Expect it should be yet still more and more accomplished every day, till Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Cover the Earth, as Waters fill the Sea; even till there be no more neede that any man should teach his neighbour, for all men shall know the Lord; and They
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94761:66"/>
poore men Expect a new Heaven, and a new Earth, wherein there shall neede no more Temples of stone, but all Good men shall be Prophets, Priests, and Kings. In the meane time they say Waters must flow out of the bellies of all that beleeve, till at length the Great Waters of the Sanctuary flow forth without measure.</p>
                  <p>Yea, they are much encouraged from the Practise of the Church in the <hi>Acts,</hi> where all the members, Every beleever,<note place="margin">Acts. 8.4, 11, 19.</note> being scattered by persecution, went about Preaching.</p>
                  <p>If it be Objected that This was an Extraordinary Case; at the first beginning of the Church; and in time of Persecution, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>They Answer, that they conceive almost as Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary a Case in This Land, at This Time; Where the Church is so much unsetled, and hath beene so much persecuted. In some places they see no Ministers; scarce any in some whole Shires, as in <hi>Cumberland, Westmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Northumberland,</hi> and especially, in <hi>Wales</hi>: Where the Church is even yet scarce (<hi>&amp; ne vix</hi>) so much as well begunne to be planted, or the Gospel Preached.</p>
                  <p>In Other places, where there is some shew of a <hi>Church,</hi> some Ordinances, some <hi>Ministers</hi>; Yet even here, they thinke the Church calleth for many more Ministers, at least for much more, and much better preaching then it yet hath.</p>
                  <p>Specially since the late Cruell Tyranny of some Lording Prelates, hath almost quite put downe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, silenced Good Ministers, and forbidden Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; Having so detained the Truth (and smothered it) by unrighteousnesse, that there is scarce left the Face of a True Church. They conceive This an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Time, an extraordinary Case, and Call, for all that are Enabled by God, with Parts and Gifts, fit for such Exercises.</p>
                  <p>And they conceive 30. or 40. or an 100. Good men of any one or more Congregations, to be as Fit Judges
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94761:66"/>
of their parts and abilities every way, as One Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and his Ignorant (perhaps Drunken) Chaplaine; who make scruple of admitting any to Orders, but Bowers and Cringers, sincks of Superstition; Yet when they please, they can poze in an Alehouse, and lay hands (well quickned with angels) on Tapsters, Coblers, Butchers, and many such, that are so farre from the smell of a Colledge, that they never saw an Abcee or Primer to purpose, much lesse a <hi>Ferula</hi> in a Grammer Schoole.</p>
                  <p>In the last place they solemnly professe they are ready to heare or read, any that either by writing, preaching, or private discourse shall informe them better than now they see or know. They would thanke any man that will satisfie their Consciences, and convince their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For, they professe they are not acted by vaine-glory, or faction, but Conscience and desire of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Truth, and spreading the Gospel, as God shall give them opportunities.</p>
                  <p>And supposing such parts, gifts, and abilities, fit for those duties; They conceive no man may upbraid them with poverty, or former living in a trade; which yet they thinke not altogether incompatible to Preaching: for they have read of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (and others) intermixing his Sermons with making of Tents.</p>
                  <p>Yea though they have not such parts and gifts as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>; yet they thinke the worke of Preaching much more compatible with all works of the Hands, than with any one other study of the braine, or minde: and yet they see many <hi>Civill Lawyers</hi> take Livings, and have Cure of Soules: Yea, and all their Lord Bishops have Two Callings, Two severall (opposite) Studies; and yet for all Those Two, They can spend as much, or more time at Cards and Dice (or worse) than at either of their Callings.</p>
                  <p>Nor are they so tied to their Outward Callings, but if the Church shall thinke it fit, they are ready to give
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94761:67"/>
up all, and apply themselves wholly to the study of Scriptures, and worke of the Ministery.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time they follow their <hi>Callings,</hi> (not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving idlely, or going up and downe Tatling as Busibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) but being diligent to serve God both with their hands, hearts also, yea and tongues too, if God shall call them, and give opportunity as well as abilities.</p>
                  <p>I would not be mistaken by my Reader. All this time I am speaking <hi>Their words,</hi> not <hi>my owne</hi>; All that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is, that they may have a faire Hearing, before they be severely censured. And I move this the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are still ready to say, Most that condemne them never heard them: I could not but doe what in me lies, to remove This scandall.</p>
                  <p>It may be Expected I should now shew my owne Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and answer all These Things, which Those poore men say for themselves. But I must confesse I am already almost tired with relating the Arguments of One part onely; so that I dare not set on the Other.</p>
                  <p>Neither indeed doe I thinke it needfull: Most of That which They say, being such, that it is not like to doe much hurt; and so I thinke it not needfull to refute it. What must be refuted, may much better bee done by Others of better Parts, and founder judgements: for I know some that in One poore discourse of <hi>Truth,</hi> are by their wit able to finde all the seventeene <hi>Intellectuall Sinner</hi>; how much more in a discourse of Error?</p>
                  <p>Only by the way, I cannot but shew how weakly These poore Preachers answer some strong objections brought against them.</p>
                  <p>As This in the First place: That by This Course, All Errors and Heresies shall quickly come to be vented and maintained in the Church, when every man may Preach that <hi>will,</hi> and what he will, without Controule.</p>
                  <p>To This Argument, All Their Answer, that I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, is This.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:94761:67"/>First, that They maintaine not that Any man may Preach that <hi>Will.</hi> No; They say it must be One of Parts, Gifts, and Abilities fit for a Preacher; and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his owne fancie, but in the Judgement of many Godly men: Who (being many) are as like to be fit and able to judge of Abilities on Their Triall, as any One Bishops Chaplaine; that yet useth to present to his Lord, after little or no posing, One whom he never heard speake, (much lesse Preach or Pray) before he came for <hi>Holy Orders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they say, They maintaine not that any such man (so Gifted, and Called, being judged fit by the votes of many) may yet Preach <hi>what he will.</hi> No, they are as much limited, and kept within bounds, as if they were licenced by the Bishop.</p>
                  <p>For, if he Preach false Doctrine, Either in matters of Church or State, they say the Bishops Keyes, or at least his Long Sword, may reach him as well in a Parlor, or some little Pulpit, as if he were a <hi>Licentiate</hi> in a Great Cathedrall. And if he Preach no false Doctrine, must he suffer (say they) for Preaching True?</p>
                  <p>It is true, No wise man living will blame (much lesse punish or fine) a man that speakes a good True Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse of <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Physicke,</hi> though he be <hi>Licentiate</hi> in neither; But These poore men consider not, the Case is not the same in Preaching a True discourse in Divinity. Yet let us give way, and they will speake more.</p>
                  <p>Againe they say, Suppose they did hold (which they doe not) that Any man Living might Preach that would, and what he would; yet perhaps there would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low so great Inconvenience as some imagine.</p>
                  <p>For, All such supposed Preachers, are either <hi>Wise</hi> men or <hi>Fooles.</hi> If <hi>Wise,</hi> they will Preach <hi>Wisely,</hi> and so doe <hi>Good.</hi> If <hi>Fooles, Foolishly,</hi> and so doe <hi>no Hurt,</hi> or at least very little hurt: For, it is not for a <hi>Foole</hi> to broach an Heresie, and maintaine it, or spread it much. No, <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Pelagius, Arminius,</hi> and such, were men of the Greatest Parts, but set wrong.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:94761:68"/>Yea suppose some of These <hi>Non Licentiate</hi> Preachers be men of the greatest parts possible, and so possible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dangerous Heretiques; Doth the Heresie spread it selfe the more for not being <hi>Licensed</hi>? Might not This Great man doe as much hurt (yea much more) if he were Licensed, than now he is not?</p>
                  <p>If any answer, It is True, He is like to do more hurt, if Licensed; but therefore the Bishop in wisedome will not License him.</p>
                  <p>They rejoyne: First, is it probable One Bishop in This case will shew more care and conscience, than twenty or thirty Good men in a Congregation, where This parted Man would preach?</p>
                  <p>But againe, Suppose there be never a Good man (in all his Auditory;) or that all the Good men there, will not have care to suppresse This man from doing hurt: How shall, how can the Bishop do This? How can he keepe him from venting, and spreading his Heresie?</p>
                  <p>First, when this man comes for a License to the Bishop, No man can tell how he meanes to Preach, (when hee is Licensed) except the Bishop perchance be a Prophet also, as well as a Priest and King?</p>
                  <p>Either he hath Preached, (before his comming for This License) or he hath not. If he have not, No Bishop can tell how he will preach; nor can any wise man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commend him to the Bishop, as fit to make a Good Preacher: since He that is the Best Scholler living, and perhaps as good a man as any, yet may prove but an ill preacher.</p>
                  <p>If he have preached before, and done well, without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, then it seemes it is lawfull to preach without a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense: for probation no doubt, (though most of late have denyed This) But I aske how long shall he be a Probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? how many yeares, months, weekes? Though he preach ten good Sermons, no man tan tell, but in the next he meanes to broach an Heresie.</p>
                  <p>But alas These poore men see not how weake all This
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94761:68"/>
is. For, Is it not easie for three or foure men, or a Bishops Chaplain to commend a man (be he Scholler, or Groom, or Butler, or what he will:) let the Bishop without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or smelling This man, give him his blessing blindfold, and seale him a <hi>Licence,</hi> What hurt is in all This? For, if This man preach well, the Church will get good: if ill, cannot the Bishop as soone pull him downe, as he set him up?</p>
                  <p>They answer, Suppose he may, (which is hard to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, since Orders once given, leave an <hi>Indelible Character</hi>) why may not ten or twenty men, Good men in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as well set up a man, and try how hee will prove? For if Well, it is Well; he will do good: If ill, These ten or twenty men can as easily pull him downe againe, as set him up.</p>
                  <p>Not so. For the Bishop is still a very wise, discreete, Good, Holy man and being entrusted by the Church, will have a speciall care, even more than an hundred others, to set up a good man, or else pull him quickly downe againe.</p>
                  <p>To This they yet answer, The Bishop cannot tell how or what he preacheth when he hath set him up, (except hee can be present in all places, at least many at Once, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eare all young preachers, that he Liceuseth;) and therefore though he would pull him downe, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not because he cannot be still present to heare him.

                        </gap>iora.</hi> And so I leave This, and come to another great Question, that is wont still to be propounded to These poore <hi>Non Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed</hi> Preachers.</p>
                  <p>It is This, why (if indeed they be fit, or seeme fit, or do but thinke themselves fit to be Ministers, why then) do they not enter into <hi>Orders</hi>? or at least present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, shewing their desire to be in Holy <hi>Orders,</hi> if indeed they may be found fit for the Ministery, as they thinke themselves? Why do they halt betweene Two? either let them serve the Church wholly, and so be in Orders; or else let them forbeare, and not meddle with dispensing of Holy Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>This seemed to mee a very serious Question, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I much desired to heare their Answers.</p>
                  <p>Some of them say, they know not yet whether they be worthy, or fit to take on them Those Greater Offices which follow Orders, onely they desire they may have leave (as Probationers) to exercise, or keepe Acts, before the Church; 'till the Church shall approve of them, and call them out (judging them faithfull) for higher im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, or generally to dispense all the Ordinances. In the meane time, They meddle onely with such Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as they conceive not proper to Church Officers onely, but in some sort common to all Christians, yea to all men, as was said before.</p>
                  <p>Others say, they would gladly (with all their Hearts) be consecrated to God, and wholly give themselves up to his service and worship in the Ministery; but they are afraid to take <hi>Orders,</hi> as <hi>Orders</hi> are now conferred, in This State. And yet in the meane time, they dare not abstaine
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94761:71"/>
from Preaching, (where they have opportunity, and a Willing Auditory) lest they should detaine the Truth, God hath revealed to them; and should be guilty of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Talent in a Napkin. For they thinke they may do many Things belonging (though not proper) to a Minister; though they be not, nor can be (as things now stand) in holy Orders. Their Instance is <hi>David,</hi> who was a <hi>King,</hi> and of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and so could be neither <hi>Priest</hi> nor <hi>Levite</hi>; yet they find King <hi>David</hi> often <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi>; else they understand not the meaning of Those Phrases, O <hi>come hither and I will shew you what God hath done for my poore soule,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>If these men in This be serious, and do not pretend Conscience where it is some other Principle that acts them, to some low end: I cannot but much pity them; that if they be fit, they neither may be licensed, nor yet preach without License. But let us see why they dare not enter into <hi>Orders,</hi> and so be Licensed Ministers.</p>
                  <p>They answer that they have not so much against <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> conferr'd by our Church, or the manner of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them (though under some Bishops, This hath beene very strange, and not warrantable either by Law of God or man, they conceive) as they have in their judgment and consciences, against the <hi>Power</hi> conferring them.</p>
                  <p>For they doubt not to affirme, that He (who ever he be) that taketh on himselfe power, which the Scripture hath not given him, to appoint, dictate or command, any one Thing either in Doctrine or Discipline: though the Thing it selfe might possibly be good, yet He that so dictates, is <hi>Antichristian</hi>; encroaching on the <hi>Regall</hi> Office of <hi>Christ</hi>; and so a <hi>Traytor</hi> in Religion.</p>
                  <p>Now they dare not touch That, which (how Good soever in it selfe, yet) comes in Power and Vertue of an Antichristian Traytor. Yea though such an one should command them a Thing very lawfull in it selfe, (as to weare a blacke cloath) yet if Hee have not Commission to Command, from Scripture, they conceive He incurres
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94761:72"/>
a <hi>Premunire</hi> with God; because he takes on him to do that (as an O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ficer) for which he is not <hi>fore-armed with lawfull authority.</hi> In this case they thinke they ought not to obey Him so commanding: because though the Thing in it selfe be lawfull to be done, yet they thinke him an unlawfull Commander, and so dare not obey; if for no other Reason, yet for This, that by obeying here, they shall betray not onely their owne Priviledges, (which yet are very precious) but also the Liberties and priviledge of all the Subjects of Christ, even of the whole Church; so that they become Traytors to their spirituall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
                  <p>They give This Instance in Civill Things. Suppose a Sheriffe, that is a lawfull Officer, come and command me to give him forty pound, of his owne head, without lawfull Authority to beck his command. they say, if in This Case I give him forty shillings, I betray not onely my owne priviledge, (which perhaps I may do) but also the whole Liberty of the Commonwealth, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (<hi>in Re</hi>) a Traytor to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e State: though in it selfe it be lawfull to give forty shillings to any man that askes, yet now I must not do it, because This officer commands it by unlawfull Authority, and so without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
                  <p>Not yet that they thinke it necessary to stay disputing the Authority of a Commander, there where is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Ground for a Doubt. But if once they see and know the Command is grounded on no lawfull Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; or do but really doubt whether the <hi>Power Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> or the <hi>Thing Commanded</hi> be Lawfull: They conceive themselves bound to abstaine till their judgement be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, (which they professe to desire, and by all lawfull meanes to endeavour) lest while they doe, they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in their owne consciences, because they do not act in <hi>Faith: and what is not of faith is sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:94761:72"/>I must leave These Things 'to be discussed by men of better judgements. In the meane time I humbly desire againe I may not be mis-understood; for it is not in my thoughts to abet the least miscarriage in any one of these poore men: nor by any meanes to countenance any of them, in a way of exercising those Duties that are too high for their parts, and abilities which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them. yet if there be any of them that have extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary parts, and endowments of judgement, memory, and utterance; if God stirre up these to improve their Gifts to the best advantage, yet with all meeknesse, and humility; I dare not condemne them till I heare them: for I know the Spirit of God is not tyed to our Fancies, but yet the <hi>Spirit of the Prophets is subject to the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I take not on me to warrant all the paths which some cut out to themselves: Yet I most affectionately intreat men not to contemne all things in those they now brand with their usuall staine of <hi>Separatisme</hi>; which phrase many use in such scorn, as if with one stab (of that Italian dagger) they could run through Body and Soule at once.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Light</hi> was one of the first Creatures, and yet not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected till the fourth Day, (and perhaps not fully then) so was spirituall <hi>Light</hi> the beginning of <hi>Reformation,</hi> That <hi>New Creation</hi>; yet it was not perfect at first dawning, but increaseth still by degrees, till it have quite chased away darknesse, and there be no more Night. All men yeeld there must be an increase of light in the world; Now whether That be more probable to be in <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,</hi> judge yee.</p>
                  <p>At the first Rising out of Popery, the Church-lesse Church of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> &amp; <hi>Waldenses,</hi> (Holy Good men) began an admirable Reformation. This was much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Hus. Luther</hi> had many grosse errours, yet must not lose his place among These glorious Lights. After these appeareth <hi>Calvin,</hi> shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning yet brighter both in Doctrine &amp; Discipline. Since
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94761:73"/>
Him Our God hath raised up a more glorious Light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong These Northerne Iles. And yet some went from us lately with a candle burning, brighter perhaps than Ours; though it were lighted here. Thus Light dilating, &amp; enlarging it selfe, seemeth to become more pure, more Light, more Glorious; and yet it seemes not to be Noone. The Light still will, must, cannot but increase; why then do we shut our eyes? Let it not be said of us, that Light came in, and grew up among us, yet we would not use it (for we cannot but receive it) because wee loved darknesse.</p>
                  <p>Godly men may not onely neglect, but abuse light; Yea they may both <hi>grieve,</hi> and <hi>quench</hi> Gods Holy <hi>Spirit.</hi> A sad case! yet are they not still in some part <hi>Carnall</hi>? and the <hi>Flesh</hi> not onely lusteth, but warreth against the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are too too apt to sleight the sweet breathings of Gods Spirit, which Hee is pleased to communicate to others when we are destitute of the same Workings. Some Christians are as it were wholly legall; they Fast, they Pray, receive Sacraments, heare Sermons, pay every one his owne, live inoffensively: This is well done, but This is not All; yet This they take for enjoying God in Christ Jesus. But alas! <hi>Quantum distat ab illo? Non est vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, sed valere vita.</hi> These men may well be saved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but in the meane time, they lose the sweetest part of their life here.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, if God please to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in any manner of sweetnesse, so that a man begins to taste and see how Good Communion &amp; acquaintance with God is; how easily it is interrupted by loose wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; how sweete it is while enjoyed; so that it ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the soule, and filleth the whole Heart, that it cannot but flow out at the Lips, in sweete breathings of, for, and after God in Christ Jesus, God in Christ Jesus. This man is presently stained with a taint of <hi>Madnesse,</hi> and I know not what <hi>Enthusiasme.</hi> If one that hath tasted and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94761:73"/>
found the sweetnesse of Peace of Conscience, &amp; knows how unpossible it is to keep it, but by close wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God; how easily it is broken; and how hardly it is made up againe when broken: so that he is content to leave Friends, Living, Liberty, All, rather than to breake his Peace, wound his Conscience, sinne against God, in sinning against Light, or acting against Doubts. O this man is beyond all Rule of Reason; He hath a Tang of Phrensie; one puft up with a spirit of selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; a Ranke <hi>Separatist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But sure it should not be so among Christians. Can we not dissent in judgement (specially in These lower points of <hi>Discipline,</hi> while we agree in <hi>Doctrine</hi>) but we must also dis-agree in <hi>Affection</hi>? A Hard Case!</p>
                  <p>I confesse there are many now that turne the Light of Truth, into a Life of Loosenesse, vanity, and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and we are all too too prone to This. There are some Enthusiastickes, who prophane the Spirit. This I would resist with all my might. But let not all suffer with the wicked. Some without warrant runne away from their callings, and take up a bare, empty, fruitlesse Profession of Christianity, without the least dramme of life or power; These men my soule hateth.</p>
                  <p>But when God shall so enlarge his Hand, and unveile his face, that the poore Creature is brought into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and acquaintance with his Creator; steered in all his wayes by His Spirit; and by it carried up above shame, feare, pleasure, comfort, losses, grave, and death it selfe; Let us not censure such Tempers, but blesse God for them. So farre as Christ is in us, we shall love, prise, honour Christ, and the least particle of his Image in Others: For we never Prove our selves true members of Christ more, then when we embrace his members with most enlarged, yet straitest Affections.</p>
                  <p>To This end, God assisting mee, my desire, prayer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour shall still be, as much as in mee lyes, to follow Peace and holinesse. and though there may haply be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94761:74"/>
some little dissent betweene my darke judgement, weake conscience, and other Good men, that are much more cleare and strong; yet my prayer still shall be, to <hi>keepe the Vnity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi> And as many as walke after This Rule, Peace I hope shall still be on Them, and the whole Israel of God.</p>
