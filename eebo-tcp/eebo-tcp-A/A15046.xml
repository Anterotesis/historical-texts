            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orthy Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I haue presented vnto your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acceptaunce, a worke so worthlesse, (in respect of the homely handling thereof) as will (I feare) neither content you in reading, nor any wayes commend my paines in writing: &amp; yet I am right wel assured (curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contentment set apart) it importeth necessarie matter of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for vnstayed youth, who hauing the raines at libertie, are so hote <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n expence, as that they be many times surfited with incumberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yea, tyred out right with prodigalitie, before they be brought into any perfect order of spending. For whose behalfe and forewarning, I haue collected together a number of my vnlearned deuises (inuented for the most, of experience) and more boldly, then well aduised, haue guarded them, with the title of the Rocke of regarde: not for that it conteineth only needefull matter, but for that you, hauing noted the discommodities of the vnnecessarie, might reade the necessarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations with more regard. And for that it behooueth the maister of euery feast, to prouide diuers dishes, to please the diuers appetites of his diuers guestes: the like consideration now moueth me, who hauing inuited a number to peruse my vnpolished labours, as neare as I can to vse such <hi>Decorum</hi> in my doings, as euerie desire may be satisfied. And sure I hold it necessarie, that matters of aduise (to worke atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) be sometimes mingled with delight: and further, for that I know the most part of youth (to whome I chiefly dedicate the fruite of my trauell) are so carelesse of their commoditie, as they set light of sound aduise, vnlesse such persuasions be sauced (in some respect) with their owne desires, so that to win them to the reading of that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, I haue likewise presented them with matter of honest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And yet, least they lighting on some discourse of worth, shoulde by and by be led away, with the sight of some wanton deuise, I haue published my trauell, vnder these foure following titles.</p>
            <p>The first is, the <hi>Castle of delight.</hi> Wherin (to ioyne commoditie,
<pb facs="tcp:12011:3"/>
with the readers pleasure) are many morall and needefull considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For who so noteth there, the issue of the Countesse of <hi>Zelants</hi> hate, may happely feare to execute a strumpets bloudie reuenge. In <hi>Cressids complaint,</hi> the subtilties of a Courtisan discouered, may forwarne youth from the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of inticing dames. The aduentures of <hi>Rinaldo</hi> (which may verie well be termed a Laberynth of loue) discourseth the inconueniencies of iealousie: and by the ouerthrowe of <hi>Frizaldo,</hi> is showne the reward of lawlesse lust and trecherie.</p>
            <p>Some there be, that hauing eyed my former vnthriftinesse, doe gape (percase) to viewe in this booke, a number of vaine, wanton, and worthlesse Sonets, in some respectes I haue satisfied their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, moued to suffer the imprinting of them, not of vaine glorie, but of two good considerations: the one to make the rest of the booke more profitable, and (perhaps) lesse regarded, the better saileable. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; chiefest, in plucking off the visard of self conceit, vnder which I somtimes proudly masked with vaine desires. Other yong gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may reforme their wanton liues, in seing the fond &amp; fruitles successe of my fantasticall i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maginations, which be no other then Poems of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest loue: and yet for that the exercise we vse in reading louing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, sildome (in my conceit) acquiteth our paines, with any thing beneficiall vnto the common weale, or verie profitable to our selues, I thought the <hi>Garden of Vnthriftinesse,</hi> the meetest title I could giue them.</p>
            <p>The third is, the <hi>Arbour of Vertue,</hi> the which I chiefly publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, for the delight of vertuous Ladies and Gentlewomen: and yet (my lustie Gent.) it conteineth matter very needfull for you to note: As in making choice of a wife, rather in owed with vertue, then mony, as Syr <hi>Vlrico</hi> did. And in reading the complaint of <hi>Alberto</hi> and <hi>Vdislao,</hi> you may see how foule a fault it is, rashly to iudge ill of womens behauiours.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, the <hi>Ortchard of Repentance,</hi> the which for the most part, I planted with experience: the fruits therin growing (think I) be hoalsome, although to curious appetites, not greatly toothsome. But what for that? the smarting wound is cured with fretting plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. Euen so, abuse is to be refourmed with sharpe reprehension, then sure it were not <hi>Decorum,</hi> in inueying against a Cousener, Cheter, Dicer, Quareler. &amp;c. (who for the most part) liue without good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

Thus continually visited with passionate fits (of the beholders mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked, of his maistresse misliked:) time in the ende, forced him and the rest from dauncing, whiche done, the maskers were inuited vnto a costly banquet, who (marching with their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) with manly force encountred with many a monster, whose grose bodies, were tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sformed into a sugred substance. The maskers nowe (on easie request) did off their visardes, as wel to make them selues knowne vnto their maistresses, to manifest their zeale towardes the Lorde of the house, the bridegrome and his faire bride, as to shew their desire, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the whole companie. <hi>Rinaldo</hi> (greatly ashamed of his disordered masking) with blushing chéekes oftentimes, very earnestly behelde faire <hi>Giletta,</hi> Maistresse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In the chiefest hope of my wel doing, quoth <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> (distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing her tale) you haue truly described my present condition: for being reft of heart the only stay of life, and dying through despaire, I am in no better state then a shadow. Well quoth <hi>Giletta,</hi> since your wit serues you to flourish on euery worde figuratiuely spoken, I will deliuer the rest of my minde in more plaine speaches. First I must confesse, my inabilitie, and vnworthinesse, to entertaine such a seruant: then graunt your wisdome to be such, that you will not bestowe your able seruice, but where you sée sufficient abilitie, for your well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing zeale to haue deserued hyre. Nowe to your verses I thus muche conceiue, that to colour that, your owne colour bewrayes, I meane your loue else where bestowed, for that I (vnhappily) ministred some speaches of mistrust, to dymme mine eyes with a vaine flourish, til time fits your better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, you vse this fonde profession of loue. Thus much I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both by your wordes, and workes, and thus much I had thought to haue deliuered in, in embassage, vnto this teltale paper, (making shew of the letter she had written) but know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing (quoth she) letters to be very blabs, I am glad opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie so serues, that I may deliuer in wordes, both what I thinke of you and your suite, with this she put vp her letter againe, I thinke for that she woulde not discomfort <hi>Rinaldo</hi> with the sharpnesse thereof, who faine would haue fingered the same, onely to haue bestowed his skill in answere: but to shew his able force to incounter her in wordes, in déed quoth he, letters are but to be vsed in necessitie, &amp; yet where griefs can not otherwise be vttered, necessarie instruments. But I find this benefit in my bondage, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if I were both bard of tong and pen, my flaming sighes, my frosen teares, my wan lookes, and withered fleshe, would witnesse with what deuotion I serued: which zeale through my chaunging colour by you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

My good seruaunt (quoth <hi>Giletta</hi>) I thinke your cure stands not vppon such necessitie, but reason in time may qualifie your raging fire, and wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome warme your frosen feares, or at the least wise warne you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such vntemperate affections. O, no (quoth <hi>Rinaldo</hi>) time hath made both extréemes more extréeme, for when as reason would haue quenched, my burning loue, with the thought of my vnwoorthines, the remembraunce of your worthines, made my heate more feruent: when hope would haue warmed my frosen doubtes with the knowledge of your great pitie and compassion, the consideration of my base desert, streight made my cold more cruell: So that intertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning time with these thoughtes, time hath brought both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, now to such a mischiefe, that necessitie (perforce) commaundes mée to séeke qualification at your handes, in whose good will, the termperature consisteth.</p>
                     <p>I thinke (quoth <hi>Giletta</hi>) my milde disposition, in very déede, makes you a great deale more desirous, yea your knowledge of my inward lyking by my outward lookes discouered, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes you so earnest a suter: But if I were persuaded your loue to be as great in zeale, as in showe, yet for that I know not whether it tends to honestie or my dishonour, I can hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly aunsweare your sute, if any way, with the spoile of my good name, you seeke to féede some foule affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, your loue I loth, and so you sue in vaine.

yet doubtful, I meane hope and despaire: for I earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding your lokes, when as you said, they shewde you loued, in very déede to my iudgement I sawe in them the very I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of loue: therewithall (quoth I) to my selfe: <hi>Loue cannot hate the welwillers of loue.</hi> But as I was continuing this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, with the continuaunce of other your comfortable spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, on the soudaine, an <hi>Yf,</hi> distrusting my loyaltie, cleane altered the case: For trust mée (swete mystresse) my faithful loue, vnspotted with villanous desire, when you vsed those speaches, streight murmured at your suspicion, yea dread still persuades mée, your ouer often mistrust, will hinder the acquitall of my deserte, and yet hope destrous of victory, wills mée not to bée discomforted thorough your wise misdoubte, least silence in mée, should woorke in you a greater suspicion: wherefore before God and you, I protest with my heart, yea if you please, to vse the world for after witnes, I wil sweare vnto you all, I neuer had the thought, that tended vnto your dishonour: then dashe (good Lady) this hard condition of foule desire, from out the other couenaunts of loue, and take my vow of faithfulnes, for the warrantyse of my honest and true intent. Sutes must haue an end, &amp; sorrowes a salue, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the benefite of fortune, or violence of death: For I, thorough the extremitie of sorrow, being now brought to the exigent of desperation, am forst to sue vnto you for attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, presenting vnto mee in this case, both the image of good fortune and death: of good fortune if you loue, where you are loued: of death, if you hate where you are honoured. Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient triall you haue had of my loyaltie. Since so (good Lady) say yea, or no: either answere wil worke appeasement of my sorrowes, the one with death, the other with delighte. Soft (quoth <hi>Giletta</hi>) haste makes waste, your Haruest is yet in grasse, you may very well stay for aunsweare.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Rinaldo</hi> (vnhappily) matched with an ague, through the extremitie of his malladie, was forst to kéepe his chamber, so that by this accident exiled from the sight of his faire mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, the furie of his feuer was no sooner ouerpaste, but streight hée was charged with feareful fancies,<note place="margin">

By this time a sighe had vntyde <hi>Rinaldoes</hi> tongue, who very softly for feare of suspicion, thus replied: In very déede swéete mystresse (quoth hée) if I had had the vse of my hart, longe or this my griefes had béene eased: but, ah, my hart else where attends, it is <hi>Giletta</hi> (and none else, that may dispose y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same.

I sée wel good seruaunt (quoth shée) that our company (although wée came for courtesie) is rather a cumber then a comfort to your sorrowes, and therefore wée will now betake you to God.

But in the waye homeward, hee pincht <hi>Giletta,</hi> with this scoffinge request: Away with this Rosemary (quoth hée) lest it hide some infection (being sometime sicke <hi>Rinaldoes</hi>) That maye offende you, (quoth <hi>Giletta</hi>) if it were any wayes infected, by this time the open ayre hath purged it, but if before this time, I my selfe am infected, it smally helpes to throwe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this poore braunch, and so your counsel is out of season, and yet for the same I courteously thancke you.

with malice against <hi>Frizaldo,</hi> for his too apparant trecherie, with feare, for <hi>Rinaldos</hi> absence, who she little thought to be the instrument of this discouerie. <hi>Frizaldo</hi> perceiued (by the alteration of countenances) what harts were won from him, by <hi>Rosinaes</hi> too true a tale: and although he found him selfe guiltie, yet he began to cleare him self with this shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse answere.

straight a crosse blowe makes him lose his aduauntage. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of conscience nothing weakeneth <hi>Frizaldo,</hi> but <hi>Rinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> honest cause doubleth his strength, so that the longer he fought, the fearcer he was, and yet <hi>Frizaldo</hi> valiantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines his dishonest quarrell. But what doth might auaile, when God assistes the right. <hi>Frizaldo</hi> for all his force, in the end beganne to faint: which <hi>Rinaldo</hi> espying, and eying his Ladies beautie, assaild him with such furie, that ere long he sent him dead to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth. The battell thus fortunately won, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> vnarmes him self, &amp; clames <hi>Giletta</hi> as his wife, the people at the sight of <hi>Rinaldo</hi> shoke the earth, with clamors of ioy. <hi>Giletta</hi> (that lately wondered at <hi>Rinaldos</hi> absence) now charged her father with his promise: the Lorde <hi>de Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> with the rest of his friends, agréed <hi>Rinaldo</hi> and <hi>Gilet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> should forthwith be married. The courtly companie that came to honor <hi>Frizaldos</hi> marriage, had his dishonest actions in such disdaine, as now they would not vouchsafe to sée him honestly buried. But with all their prouision of brauerie, on <hi>Rinaldo</hi> they willingly attended, glad was be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> could with any curtesie present him. The marriage rites solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, these faithfull louers repaired to <hi>Bologna</hi> castle, where they were welcomed, with what pleasure might be had: yea, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, for to worke satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their long mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, there wanted nothing, that coyne, cunning, or credit might compasse.

The Hungarian barons helde opinion, there was no woman so chaste, but might be won to wantonnesse. Vlrico (in his Ladies behalfe) reasoned to the contrarie.

Vlrico accepted of their lay, the wager beeing set downe in writing, the King and Queene were both wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the match.

The Lady fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his humour, by policies (as a theefe that sought to rob her honour) caused him to be imprisoned, where to bridle his wanton affections, she made him to spin for his victuals. Alberto (in hope of libertie) discouered to the Lady the whole wager, and how that the Lord Vdislao would come about that enterprise, who in very deede shortly visited her castle: whome she likewise made foorth comming, and in penaunce of his offence, hee reelde the thread Alberto spon: the King and Queene hearing of their successe, had the Lady in high estimation, awarded Vlrico the lande, and banished the barons for their slaunderous opinion.</p>
