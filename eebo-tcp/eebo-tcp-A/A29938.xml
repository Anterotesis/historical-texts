            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IN the following paper you have the Solution of one of the greateſt Secrets in Nature, a manifeſt reaſon given for all the Mutations obſerved in the Seas, and that by ways ſo natural, plain and Eaſie, that you and every man may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the manner, and muſt conlcude it to be ſo. As first, A reaſon is given why we have two Tides upon all ſhores in <hi>24</hi> hours. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Why thoſe Tides fall exactly ſo many Minutes later every day, as the Moon doth. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By what meanes theſe Tides are made to Increaſe &amp; decreaſe every ſeven days &amp; why they are always higheſt when the Moon is in Conjunction or Oppoſition with the Sun, and lowest when in a Quadrature, or <hi>90</hi> Degrees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The true cauſe why the Spring-tides are higher in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September</hi> then ordinary And Fiftly, Why upon ſome ſhores the waters riſe to a very great height, when on Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſhores they are hardly diſcernable, with other Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the Flux and Reflux of the Seas. And all theſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly different motions of the Seas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſolv'd by one most eaſie, ſimple, and before (for any thing I know) unthought-of motion of the Earth. But now I must tell you that I am a Seaman, and then me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and order will not be expected; being rarely found amongſt men of my Profeſſion; and I ſhall not ſcruple to confeſs, that I have had ſome trouble to patch it up as it is, finding by this little tryal, that tho men unlearned may ſometimes think of ſuch things as theſe not unſucceſsfully, yet they ſhall not without a great deal of trouble and diſadvantage be able to communicate their thoughts to others, as you may too plainly ſee by this; but (I hope) in a little time you may ſee what is here wanting made good by an able pen. In the mean time I have promiſed you much, and with more then uſual Confidence, perſwading my ſelf that the hopes of being made acquainted with this great Secret, will engage you to take a little pains more then ordinary to underſtand my meaning, which if you once do, you and I ſhall quickly be agreed; you will then ſay <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that you know the true cauſe of the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34229:3"/>
If you think that I have made more words then needed about ſome things, impute it to my fear that otherways I ſhould not be understood, or to my Ignorance not knowing the moſt expreſſive words, the ſhortest way. If in other things I am as much or more too ſhort, be ſo kind as to excuſe me by thinking what your ſelf would do in the ſame caſe; and in this I am ſure you will be of my mind, that is, that he that knows he does not ſpeak well, ſhould ſay as little as he can. And upon that account I have not troubled you, nor concerned my ſelf with any thing that I could any ways avoy'd.</p>
            <p>Amongſt many other defects you will find that my Ignorance in the Mathematicks, as well as other parts of Learning, has forc't me instead of Terms of Art (which would have been much better understood) to make uſe of ſuch Words and Terms as being known to me, I thought might best expreſs my thoughts to others: perhaps you will think that a very little time and pains in that Study might have enabled me to have ſet this off much more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, I am of the ſame mind, but the circumſtances I ſtand in have not yet afforded me that time. But I tell you again, you ſhall find the thing it ſelf to be true, and then ſurely you will not be angry with me for theſe things For if a man should tel me that he would preſently bring me to a place where lay un-own'd &amp; before Concealed Treaſure, if now the way he led me was none of the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, &amp; withal much about, &amp; incumbred with Bryars and Thorns, yet if at laſt he put me in poſſeſſion of the promis'd and much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd Riches, I would certainly, by acknowledging the kindneſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his making Excuſes for not ſtaying to inform himſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the way before he undertook to be my guide. The ſame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Conditions is expected from you, by</p>

               <p>THE Arguments brought by Learned Men to prove that the Earth may have Motion has ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, that it will not be look'd upon as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy now to aſſert it; So that I do not fear but that the Motion I ſuppoſe the Earth to have (when well conſidered) will willingly be admitted; for if it may have any, it may have this. But becauſe the Motion and <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> upon which it is founded, is altogether new; it will (I think) be convenient, to endeavour to leſſon a little (if I can) the ſtrangeneſs of it to prevent your throwing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by as a raſh and wide conjecture, before you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand my meaning. For I queſtion not but that you will be ſupriz'd when you ſhall hear me ſay, that the Moon and Sun give the Earth Motion, as they are carried round our Globe, but content your ſelf, and in two or three hours time (if you have but patience to read ſo long, and be not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a Stranger to the Heavenly Motions) you will find the Motion I ſuppoſe the Earth to have to be ſo far from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing you have yet heard or fancied to your ſelf, and ſuch agreeableneſs between that and the Motions of the Seas, that what but juſt before you thought ſtrange, if not fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, you will then think not only eaſy but reaſonable.</p>
               <p>In the mean time you may conſider that the Tides keep ſuch equal pace ſo exactly obſerve the Motions of the Moon, (even to a minute of time) that no wit or reaſon of man is able to exclude the Effects of that Planet. It is moſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34229:4"/>
certain, (and very wiſe and Learned men in all Ages, have been compelled to acknowledge it) that the Moon by ſome ſecret vertue muſt give the Seas motion. So that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may ſafely, be brought to this ſhort Iſſue, one of theſe two things muſt of neceſſity follow: Either the Moon muſt at the ſame time move the Seas all over the World, and the Earth be yet immovable; Or elſe give the Earth motion, and by that means, at the ſame time univerſally move the Seas.</p>
               <p>Now if all thoſe Learned men that have aſſign'd the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of the Seas to the Moon (upon the conſidera ion of the manifeſt agreement that is found to be between the Motions of the Ocean and that Luminary) have thought it not impoſſible for the Moon to give the Seas Motion; Why may it not be thought at leaſt as poſſible for the Moon to give the Earth motion, and by conſequence at the ſame time univerſally move the Seas? As at the ſame time to move the Seas all over the world, and let the Earth ſtand ſtill. And ſo much the rather, ſince it is certainly true, that Nature in all her opperations makes uſe of the moſt facil and ſimple means. For take a Boat, ſet the head and ſtern North and South, place in this Boat 15 or 20 veſſels of water, now if you ſhould bid one to move the water in all thoſe veſſels at the ſame time with a conſtant regular motion, you would think him no wiſe man, if he ſhould attempt to do it any other wayes than by giving the Boat motion. Nay he could not otherwayes do it without a great deal of help. But if with one hand onely he ſhall lift up the ſide of the Boat a little, and then depreſs that ſide as much below the level as before he rais'd it, and ſhall for ſome time continue thus to move it from Eaſt to Weſt, and Weſt to Eaſt; he ſhall with as much eaſe, and at leaſt with as conſtant a motion, at the ſame time move all the waters in all thoſe veſſels, as he can by any other wayes move all the water in any one of them. So it muſt be confeſt that the Moon by onely giving the Earth (the containing veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34229:4"/>
motion, may at the ſame time, and with as much eaſe move all the waters in the <hi>Indian, Atlantick, Paci<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tick,</hi> nd all other Seas, as by any other ways, or means that may or can be thought of, move all the water in any one of thoſe Seas.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Nature commonly makes uſe of ſome inward Principle, for opperations that are to be conſtant and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, as the motions of the Seas are known to be; but if it ſhould be granted that the Moon might by ſome occult qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſome unknown Principle, give the Seas motion, and the Earth be yet immovable, the difficulty would remain; for no ſatisfactory reaſon has or can be given, how by any influence or opperation the Moon may or can be ſuppoſed to have upon the waters <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould cauſe thoſe different viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes that are found in the Tide of the Seas. Then if the appearance cannot be ſolv'd (as in truth they cannot) by any influence the Moon may or can have upon the Waters. And that the ſame mutations muſt of neceſſity enſue upon the motion of the Earth, and that it is as poſſible for the Moon to move the Earth and Seas together, as to move the Seas alone, and beſides much the more facil and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er way, why ſhould it appear ſo ſtrange a Paradox to affirm that the Moon gives the Earth motion? Nay who can doubt but that the Moon by ſome inward Principle gives the Earth motion? And then you ſhall have this advantage into the bargain, that you ſhall not be to ſeek for a Principle; for the Magnetick vertue or force of attraction upon ſolid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies has been long known; And you cannot deny the Earth to be a Magnetick Globe, except you will deny that to be in the whole, which more or leſs is manifeſtly to be ſeen in almoſt every part, but moſt wonderfully in the Load-ſtone which is apart of the true Primary and integral ſubſtance of the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſince there has alwayes been acknowledged to be a very great Affinity between the Moon and Earth, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of parts, I think the Moon may reaſonably enough be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34229:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
concluded to be ſo too; And then theſe two great Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates hanging in the thin Air, muſt eaſily admit of motion, ſo that I cannot ſee where the difficulty ſhould be, or what ſhould hinder but that the Moon may give the Earth, and the Earth the Moon (if the Moon may be thought to have need of it) motion. If you ſhall think the diſtance too great, conſider that if a ſmall Loadſtone will give a Librated Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a very ſwift motion at the diſtance of ſix or ſeven foot, or more, what diſtance may be thought great enough to give bounds to the Attractive Vertue of Load-ſtones ſo immenſly great as the Tereſtrial Globe and Moon. And beſides it is not improbable but that the Moon may conſiſt of ſuch parts, that the Appetite and Deſire of Union may be much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er between the Earth and Moon, then between the Loadſtone and Iron. Nay who can tell but that the more in ten parts of this our Globe may be indewed with a much more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full attractive vertue then any piece of ſtone yet found, or perhaps that may be found upon or near the ſurface of the Earth.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add, that though perhaps the excellent uſe that is made of the Load-ſtone in Navigation may ſeem to ſome men ſufficiently to anſwer the ends of its Creation, yet it cannot be denyed but that the World was grown Old before the uſe of it was known; ſo that Nature may be ſaid to have indued the Magnet with thoſe admirable Vertues, from the beginning of the World till within a few years laſt paſt, to no purpoſe (for I think there was little uſe made of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) But now if you ſhall look upon the Terreſtrial Globe and the reſt of the ſuperior Bodies, to be nothing elſe (as it is certain that the Earth is nothing elſe) but great Magnates or Load-ſtones, you cannot think but that wiſe Nature lodg'd theſe wonderfull vertues in them for far more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful uſes, and that it would be unreaſonable to think that thoſe vertues have not been kept in Exerciſe ever ſince the Creation. And you ſhall not need to trouble your head to think how, for you ſhall be forc't to acknowledge that, by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34229:5"/>
this Magnetick Vertue the Earth and Seas have alwayes been kept in motion. Then if you conſider the many Benefits that we enjoy (which we could by no means want) by the daily Tides you muſt confeſs it to be a very wonderful work of Providence, and that as the ſame has been from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſo it muſt continue ſo long as the Sun and Moon indure.</p>
               <p>And then if thoſe Bodies called Planets be Magnetick Globes or Worlds (as ſurely that man never thought it worth his pains to conſider whether or no they might not reaſonably enough be eſteemed ſo, or elſe his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be yet in its leading ſtrings that thinks otherwiſe) and inhabited, then ſuch a Motion as I ſuppoſe the Earth to have will be neceſſary for them too; which they may very well have, for <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> (which are but the Sun's Moons) may give the Sun, and the Sun them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>But further 'tis very probable that by the force of Attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all thoſe Mundan Bodies not onely keep their firſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſtances, by having a dependancy upon each other, but deſcribe their ſeveral Circles. And then men need not vex themſelves with thinking what matter the Planets Orbs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt off, for they may ſafely take their determinate courſes through the Fluid Air without any danger of looſing their way or interfearing on with another, and too beſides much labour might otherwiſe be ſav'd, but enough and perhaps to much of this.</p>
               <p>The Earth then being a Magnetick Globe or Loadſtone, it's certain that the ſame vertues that are in the Loadſtone,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34229:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are and muſt of neceſſity be much more powerful in the Earth. Now amongſt many other vertues truly admirable in the Magnet theſe following are well known to be peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to it. Firſt, That every minute particle of a Loadſtone will conſtantly look with its determinate parts towards the ſame and determinate parts of the Univerſe. Secondly, That theforce of the Magnet is ſent by infinite right lines through the Stone, the principle vertue reſiding in the middle, the more remote from the Centre, the more faint and weak the vertue. Thirdly, That the greater Stone draws, more forceably than the leſs, the compaſs of it's vertues or of its Activity is greater.</p>
               <p>Let theſe faculties be ſuppoſed to be (as they certainly are) in the Earth it will then be requiſite to fix thoſe lines and points of Attraction. Now I know that a Loadſtone or piece of Iron toucht with a Stone) librated with a thred or any other way: ſo that it be left at liberty to move, will preſently direct it ſelf and point North and South, but the Stone in this way reſpect the Poles of the Univerſe, for it is known that the Needle varies. direction in the ſame place, as here at <hi>London,</hi> ſometimes Eaſterly ſometimes Weſterly in a certain period of time; and this cannot be in reſpect of the Poles of the Earth. And (I think) none has been ſo curious as ſtrictly to Examen whether or no the Poles of the Stone had their Poſition North and South in the Mine, ſo that perhaps it might be their Eaſt and Weſt; for the Earth being at liberty to move in the yielding Air, and its Poles of equal force (as the Poles of no piece of Stone are and being with equal force drawn by either of the Poles of the Univerſe, it may be direct its ſelf to neither of them but to a point equally diſtant between them, that is Eaſt and VVeſt. As we ſee that two Loadſtones placed at a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſtance North and South from a Needle, ſhall draw that Needle that before would willingly alwayes point North and South to point, now Eaſt and VVeſt and is the ſame as if thoſe Loadſtones were in thoſe Poynts. More

might be ſaid to countenance this, and perhaps you will think much more againſt it, let it be ſo for I could as willingly as any man, for reaſons that it may be have not been thought off by many, let the Poles keep the places alwayes. Aſſign'd them but when you ſhall know upon what grounds I have been perſwaded to think that the Earth has Eaſt and VVeſt Points of Attraction, you will find that I have reaſon for it, nay you will think that it muſt be ſo, And then you may take your liberty to judge, whether it may with more reaſon be thought that the Poſition of the Poles in the Terreſtrial (lobe is indeed Eaſt and VVeſt. Or letting the Poles be North and South, The Earth may yet be endued with ſome ſuch-like Magnetick attractive vertue in certain and determinate Eaſt and weſt Poynts (if it may be thought to have any attractive force in fixt Eaſt and Weſt Points it will ſerve me. Then without more ado, I will now ſuppoſe that infinite right lines of attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (like as in the Magnet) run through the Earth from Eaſt to Weſt as in the Figure.</p>

The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I ſay the Moon gives and Increaſes the Motion of the earth as ſhe riſes above the Horizon is plain, for take a Globe, ſet it upon its Poles, and Ballance it ſo that it may allwayes have a Tendency, the ſame way; now if you ſhall fix a Line in the Horizon, As in this Figure.

at any of theſe Lines, and keep your hand to the ſame Point in the Moons Orb it will be in vain, for you ſhall not give it Motion from eaſt to weſt, or the contrary.

And if you ſhall yet carry your hand higher to H and I plucking yet by the Line <hi>E,</hi> you ſhall in uſing but the ſame or leſs Strength give the Globe a greater Motion at H then at G. and I. then at H. So the Moon in the Horizon, cannot give the earth Motion, but as ſhe riſes above it ſhe ſucceſſively every moment drawn by lines more upright (I know not what other Name to give them) from the Centre of the Point of Attraction, or from all thoſe Lines or Points that from all parts of the eaſtern Hemiſphere of the Terreſtrlal Globe dart out Rays of Attraction. But now according to this Rule the Moon ſhould give the Earth a greater Motion at K then at I and greater yet, at L then at K. But Nature has wiſely provided for this by bending (as I may ſay) the Moon forces againſt her ſelf. For the Moon by infinite beams, or Rays of Attraction; has Influence upon that whole Hemiſphere of the Terreſtrial Globe that Reſpects the Moon in her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal Motion.

Now ſuppoſing the Moon in the Horrizon; and then ſhe draws by the Lines H I. (you may imagine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Lines of Attraction more either from the Moon to the Earth, or from the Earth to the Moon; 'tis the ſame thing for Magnetiſme muſt be from a propenſion or mutual iuclination in both Bodies) the Moon in this place can give the Earth no Motion (for as I ſaid before) ſhe is now in the Centre of the Poynt of Attraction, and ſo can give the Earth no Motion; But about an hour after this the Moon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34229:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will be 15 degrees above the Horizon, and then ſhe draws by the Lines K. L. Now you may obſerve that the Line L. reaches 15. degrees Weſt from the Mer idian, and then the Moon muſt have influence upon all thoſe Weſtern Points of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction that are between that Poynt and the Meridian. And on the contrary the Line K. Terminates in a Poynt 15. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees Weſt trom the oppoſite Poynt of the Meridian, ſo that the Moon can have no influence upon all thoſe Eaſtern Points of Attraction that are between the Termination of the Line K. and the Meridian. But the Magnetick vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weak in Poynts ſo remote from the Centre, the Moon notwithſtanding this impediment, by the advantage of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Lines a little more upright from all thoſe other more powerful Poynts gives the Earth little Motion from Eaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Weſt. And for the ſame reaſon continues and increaſes the Motion as ſhe riſes till ſhe is South Eaſt; and then ſhe draws by the Lines M. N. both theſe Lines terminate in Poynts equally diſtant between the Horizantal and Meredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Line<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is in the North Eaſt and South Weſt Poynts of the Globe, where note, that when the Moon comes to be vertical to either of thoſe Poynts ſhe gives the Earth as great a Motion as ſhe does at the Poynt ſhe is now in. So that now the conteſt is at the higheſt, for though the Moon here is more advantageouſly plac't: to give the Earth Motion from Eaſt to Weſt, then at any time ſince ſhe appeared above the Horizon, yet the advantage ſhe has gained upon the Weſtern-ſide of the Globe, is now ſo great that here the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth is Arreſted ſo that as the Moon from this Poynt move towards the Meredian the Earth declynes again, for as the Moon in riſing above the Horizon gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſtthemotion of the Earth till ſhe was South-Eaſt, ſo now after the ſame proportion it is abated as the Moon from the South Eaſt move towards the Meridian. The nearer the Moon aproaches the Meredian the more advantage ſhe has of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Weſtern Poynt of Attraction, and juſt ſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34229:9"/>
much as ſhe gains upon that ſide ſhe muſt loſe upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: ſo that the Earth now muſt move back again from Weſt to Eaſt, and by the ſame eaſie degrees as it was raiſ'd returns to its place, as all other Magnetick Bodies do, when that which forces them from their deſigned Stations or deſired places, is either removed to ſuch places as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it leſs powerful or altogether ineffectual. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>The Earth now has had but three hours motion from Eaſt to Weſt, nor will it ever have a greater motion then now from Eaſt to Weſt, or the contrary; yet hereafter the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will conſtantly be ſix hours from eaſt to weſt, and from weſt to eaſt: for obſerve that the firſt three hours of the motion is alwayes that three hours time in which the Earth is returning to its place from which the Moon before had made it vary. As now all the time the Moon is moving from the South-eaſt to the Meridian, the Earths motion (for the reaſon before ſaid) will be back again from Weſt to eaſt; and when the Moon has reacht the Meridian, then will the Earth be at its Level, and juſt as it was ſix hours before, when the Moon was in the Horizon, for now the Moon being equally plac't between the points of Attraction, draws by the Lines O. P. and ſo muſt have the ſame advantage of drawing from the one as from the other. But now though the Earth be at its Level, yet the motion ceaſes not, for as you can no ſooner ſay the Moon is in the Meridian, but that ſhe is out of it again, ſo this Motion is not interrupted for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time. The Moon no ſooner leaves the Meridian, but by the ſame eaſie motion that ſhe rais'd the eaſtern-ſide of the Globe, ſhe now attracts and turns up the Weſtern ſide, and by that means continues the motion from weſt to eaſt, till ſhe is South-weſt; for the Moon muſt gain juſt as much Advantage as ſhe moves Weſt from the Meridian till ſhe is South-weſt, by approaching every moment nearer the Weſtern Point of Attraction, and being further removed from the contrary; as ſhe loſt for the ſame reaſon, in moving
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34229:10"/>
from the South-eaſt, to the Meridian. Then now the earth has had ſix hours motion from weſt to eaſt, for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan three hours before the Moon reacht the meridian, by letting fall the eaſtern ſide of the Globe, and was continued till the moon was three hours paſt the meridian, by turing up of the contrary ſide. And now the motion will be back again the next ſix hours from eaſt to weſt, for look how much advantage the moon gained by drawing by lines ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively more upright as ſhe moved from the Horizon to the South-eaſt, ſo much ſhe now muſt loſe by drawing by lines more declining as ſhe moves from the South-weſt to the Horizon. So that as the moon from the South-weſt declines towards the Horizon, the motion of the Earth muſt be back again from eaſt to weſt; and when the moon ſhall be in the Horizon, then will the earth be at its Level, and juſt as it was when the moon was in the oppoſite point of the Heavens. But now as when the moon was in the meridian the motion ceaſes not, for the moon without the leaſt ſtay draws down the weſtern ſide of the Globe, and after the ſame manner and for the ſame reaſon continues the motion from eaſt to weſt, for ſix hours, that is, till the moon is three hours beneath the Horizon or North-weſt: The ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is obſerv'd as the Moon moves round the Globe, for the next ſix hours the motion will be back again from weſt to eaſt.</p>
               <p>If I have not expreſt my ſelf ſo as to make you maſter of my thoughts, take a Loadſtone made Spherical, ſet it upon its Poles, and carry another with a very eaſie motion in a Circle round it, and you may ſee (I doubt not) this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very exactly, and as the ſaying is, to the life repreſented. And that you may not think me ſo much wanting as wholly to neglect a tryal, you may know that when I had well conſidered the excellent agreement between the motion of the Earth (as I had ſuppoſed it) and the Seas, It came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in my mind that by making a light Globe, and ſetting it upon its Poles ſo tenderly ballanc't that it might but juſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34229:10"/>
have a Tendancy the ſame way, I might inform my ſelf by the help of a Loadſtone, which would admirably ſuppply the moons place, by drawing by inviſible lines what motion the ſtone, carried in a circle round the Globe, would give it, and how it would agree with the motion I had ſuppos'd the earth to have, but unexpected and ſucceeding, troubles kept me at leaſt three years otherways imploy'd; but then I made a Globe about ſeven Inches in Diameter, with three ſmall Oſier Hoops, repreſenting the Equator, Horizantal, and meridian lines, through the Centre of this; ſrom eaſt to weſt, I fixt an Axis of ſuch Wyer as Mariners, Needles are made of, and upon the ends of the VVyer (which did but juſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear through the Hoops) I Riveted two thin pieces of Iron (each about an Inch long) pointed. I carried this Globe to a mathematical Inſtrument-maker that was maſter of a ſtone (for I had none of my own) and upon tryal found that hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtone either in the eaſt or weſt points, or meridian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, it gave it no motion (which I never doubted) but if it varied never ſo little from thoſe points, either from eaſt to weſt, or the contrary, it gave the Globe motion accordingly; but for want of an Arch to keep the ſtone in all points at the ſame diſtance from the Globe, I could not preciſely obſerve at what point between the Horizontal and meridian lines, it had its greateſt motion, which was the chief thing I made the tryal for. But the Satisfaction I received by this, made me reſolve upon a ſecond, with a Globe more artificially made, but unwelcom accidents have kept me from an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to this day. If any man ſhall think it worth his trouble, I doubt not but that he may adjuſt ſuch a Globe as I have been ſpeaking of, ſo as to repreſent this motion exactly enough; Only let the Equator be made in all parts of an equal weight, for that that I made was ſo heavy in the Eaſt and Weſt points, that when the ſtone came near the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, the Globe would decline with a motion ſomewhat too quick, except I held the Stone very near, and then it carried the Globe round with it. Its not to be queſtioned but,</p>

               <head>That this Motion of the Earth muſt make two Tides upon all Shores, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very 24 hours, or in the ſpace of time the Moon is moving round our Globe.</head>
               <p>AS before, let the Moon be in the Horizon Eaſt, and this to be the firſt time of her going round our Globe the Earth and all Seas now without motion, When the Moon takes her firſt ſteps above the Horizon ſhe at the ſame time gives the earth Motion by turning it a little in the Centre from Eaſt to Weſt, this muſt cauſe an inequality in the ſurface of the water, and that preſently produces a motion; ſo that now the <hi>Indian, Atlantick,</hi> and <hi>Paciffick</hi> Seas firſt began to move, and at the ſame time take their courſe Weſt, the waters leaving the now higher weſtern, and failing upon the lower Eaſtern Shores, and this Motion is continued till the Moon is South-Eaſt, and then is it high-water and the firſt flood upon all Eaſtern &amp; low-water and the firſt Ebb upon all Weſtern Shores. Now this Tide was but three hours for it wanted three hours from a preceding motion, but hereafter every Tide will be exactly ſix hours. For now as the Moon from the South-eaſt moves towards the Meridian, the Earth returns to its level, moving back again from Weſt to Eaſt; and now all Seas take their firſt journey Eaſt, leaving the Eaſtern and falling upon the forſaken Weſtern Shores; and when the Moon has reacht the Meridian, then will the Earth and Seas be at their firſt level, but now the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Motion ſeakes not, for as the Moon in her never-ceaſing motion leaves the Meridian and haſtes away to the Weſt, ſo the motion of the Earth and Seas Eaſtward is continuedfor three hours longer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:34229:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that is, till the Moon is South-weſt, the Moon giving the Earth juſt as much motion now from Eaſt to Weſt; then this Tide was exactly ſix hours. And now the Seas will take their courſe Weſt again, for as the Moon from the South-weſt declines towards the Horizon ſhe lets fall the Weſtern ſide of the Globe, and then all Seas haſte away to waſh and fill the empty Eaſtern Shores. And this motion is continued till the Moon is 45 degrees beneath the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, or North-weſt, and then it will be high-water, and the Second flood upon the Eaſtern; and low-water, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Ebb upon the Weſtern Shores. The next ſix hours the motion of the Earth and waters will be back again from Weſt to Eaſt, that is till the Moon is North-eaſt, and then will they have had two flood upon the Weſtern and as many Ebbs upon the Eaſtern Shore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when about three hours after this, the Moon ſhall be in the Horizon, that is, the ſame point of the Heavens ſhe was in when the motion began, then ſhall the Earth and Seas be at their Level, the waters being juſt as high upon all ſhores now as then. But though the waters now are neither higher nor lower upon the ſhores then when the motion began, yet now it will be called half Flood upon the eaſtern, and half Ebb upon the Weſtern ſhores, for that three hours before by a preceeding motion of the Earth, the waters were ſo much higher upon the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo much lower upon the former, then they were 24 hours before. Then the three hours Flood and Ebb that was then wanting upon thoſe ſhores, is now made good. So that in the ſpace of 24 hours there has been two compleat Tides upon all Shores.</p>
               <p>This is an order eſtabliſht by Nature, plain and without Myſtery, its but a gentle Rocking of the Earth in the Centre from Eaſt to Weſt, and weſt to eaſt, and though it may be hard to ſay preciſely how much motion from eaſt to weſt, or the contrary, the Moon gives the earth, yet without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling your head, you may conclude it to be very little; for let it be ſuppoſed that upon indifferent ſhores the water, riſes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34229:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ten foot (which yet is more then ſome will allow) five foot of this is not to be acconuted for, the firſt three hours of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Flood is but the return of the ſame water that by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motion of the Earth firſt fell from thoſe Shores. For if the Earth was to keep its Level without motion, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would be conſtantly as high upon all ſhores as they are when we ſay it is half flood or Ebb, abating but ſo much as by the advantage of falling upon ſhores that have a ſmooth and eaſie aſſent, or into Bays that open with wide mouths and after are contracted into narrow Corners, or for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt cauſe they are made to mount. Now then what motion can you imagine the earth to have to be little enough to ſwell the waters five, nay ten foot upon thoſe ſhores where the Seas are two or 3000 miles or more over, as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are; I am in the mind you will ſay, (and you may ſafely do it) that this motion muſt be ſo little as to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt altogether inſenſible. So that though I have made a great many words about it, and talkt of ſix hours motion, from eaſt to weſt, and weſt to eaſt, yet when you have well conſidered the matter, you may (without any Prejudice to your Judgment) very well ſuppoſe the Earth always to have had this motion, though you knew it not. As ſhall be abundantly confirmed to you by all that follows, for,</p>

the Sun, that men in all ages have willingly aſſign'd the Empire of the Ocean to the Moon, upon the account of the moſt exact agreement that is found between the Moon and Seas in this Motion of Retardation, which is thus: The Moon comes later to the ſame point of the Heavens one day with another by about forty eight minutes, and the Tides obſerve the ſame. When the Moon is in Conjunction with the Sun, it is always high water at <hi>London-bridge,</hi> at three a clock, but now the ſame Tide will fall later every day as the Moon doth, ſo that when the Moon is in Quadrature with the Sun, the ſame Tide will fall ſix hours later, that is, at nine a Clock; And ſo every ſeven days the ſame tide will fall later by ſix hours till the Moon is in Conjunction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and then the ſame Tide will fall out at three a clock as before. If the Moon comes later to the ſame point of the Heaven, 10, 15, or 20 Minutes this day (as it ſometimes falls out ſo) then the day before, the Tides obſerve the ſame all the World over; and that ſo preciſely, that no rule can be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to know the time of high-water but by knowing the true time of the Moons coming to the South. And which is more, if ſtrong winds keep back or accellerate the Tides (as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it happens) half an hour or more, yet the very next Tide (if it be a calm) ſhall obſerve the due time, it ſhould have done, notwithſtanding this interruption. Then the queſtion may well be askt whether or no the Seas Univerſally may be made thus exactly to keep time with the Motion of the Moon by any other ways or means whatever then by the motion of the Earth; but no man can doubt but that if the Moon give the Earth motion after the manner that I have ſuppoſed it, but that the Seas muſt obſerve the ſame even to a minute of time: For if the Moon ſhall be South-eaſt, South-weſt, North-weſt or North-eaſt, (at which points the Motion of the earth and ſeas from Eaſt to Weſt, or Weſt to Eaſt always begins) this day at 12 a clock, if to morrow the Moon comes later to theſe points 20 or 30 minutes, its certain that the Motion of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34229:13"/>
the Earth cannot begin till then, and by conſequence it muſt be high water ſo many minutes later. This is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that to ſay more would be needleſs. And therefore I ſhall now let you know</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>By what means the Motion of the Earth and Seas are abated and increaſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſeven days.</head>
               <p>I Said before that the Moon and Sun by a powerful Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick attractive Vertue gave the Earth Motion. I ſhall now add, That by reaſon of the exceeding ſwift motion of the Moon, the Sun ſometimes comes to be ſo poſited as directly to oppoſe the Moon in the Motion, and ſometimes to aſſiſt with all his forces. But that you may the better underſtand what I ſay, and at the ſame time fancy to your ſelf, how much the Sun contributes to, or impedes the Motion as he comes to be every day diverſly poſited, I will now examine how much the Sun may be concerned in the Action, which may eaſily be gathered from this, That when the Moon is 90 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from the Sun, the Sun then directly oppoſes the Moon in the Motion; and yet then the Tides here at <hi>London</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly riſe about 12 foot. At new and full Moon the Sun lends his utmoſt Aſſiſtance, and then they riſe about 16 foot, now if when the Sun directly oppoſes the Moon, the tides riſe 12 foot, and whenhe aſſiſts with all his forces they riſe but 16. its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that if the Sun did neither hinder nor aſſiſt, the Moon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone would give the Earth ſo much motion as ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly make the Tides riſe here 14 foot: So that the Suns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt can be but as two to 14. I do not pretend to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in this, for perhaps there may be (eſpecially at ſome times of the year) more then four foot difference between the Neap and ſpring Tides here, and it may be the Neap
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34229:13"/>
and Spring Tides riſe not commonly ſo high as I ſpeak of; but this is not ſo far from the Truth, but that it may ſerve to make a pretty near Eſtimate; Then now if you Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood after what manner I ſuppos'd the Earth was mov'd, and at what points it had it's greateſt Motion, You will eaſily know how that motion comes to be abated or increaſt, which is thus</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the Moon in the Horizon Eaſt, and in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Sun this day, then the Tides muſt be at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, for now the Moon and Sun being carried round the Earth in the ſame Point, they with their United forces muſt give it as great a motion as at any time they can; For the next day, it will be three quarters of an hour later before the Moon reaches the Horizon; and then the Sun will be about 12 degrees above it: So that this day when the Moon ſhall be South-eaſt (the place of greateſt advantage of giving the Earth motion) the Sun will be 12 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees nearer the Meridian, at which point the Sun cannot altogether ſo powerfully aſſiſt the Moon, as the day before when they were both at the ſame time in the South-eaſt Point; So that this day the motion of the Earth is a very ſmall matter abated. And for the ſame reaſon the Motion every day abates, till the Moon is in the quarter; For about three days after change, when the Moon ſhall be in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, the Sun will be 45 degrees above it, then this day all the time the Moon is moving from the Horizon to the South-eaſt, the Sun is moving from the South-eaſt to the Meridian; in all which points, eſpecially near the Meridian, the Sun but faintly aſſiſts the Moon, and in the meridian not at all. But the next three days the Sun does not only leſs aſſiſt, but every day more then other oppoſes the Moon in the motion; For about five days after Conjunction, when the Moon ſhall be in the Horizon, the Sun at the ſame time will be about 60 degrees above it; Then this day when the Moon is South-eaſt, the Sun will be declined 12 degrees Weſt from the meridian: So that all the time the Sun was moving from the meridian to that point, The Sun oppoſed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34229:14"/>
the Moon, by drawing from the contrary point of Attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The next day the impediment will be greater, and when the Moon ſhall be in the quarter, or 90 degrees from the Sun, then will the Sun directly oppoſe the Moon all the time of the motion: For then when the Moon is in the Horizon, the Sun muſt be in the Meridian; ſo that all the time the Moon is moving from the Horizon to the ſouth-eaſt, the Sun is moving from the meridian to the ſouth-weſt: and ſo directly oppoſes the Moon with all his forces; The Sun having in all thoſe points the ſame advantage of giving the earth Motion from Weſt to Eaſt, that the Moon has of giving it motion from Eaſt to Weſt: now if the Sun did attract with equal force, the Earth muſt this day be without motion; but the Moon (by reaſon of her nearneſs) being much more powerful, gives the Earth motion, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Oppoſition. Then now the Tides are at the loweſt, the Earth having now the leaſt motion it can at any time have. For now for the ſame reaſon that the motion was abated from the Moons being in Conjunction till ſhe was in the firſt quarter, it will now be increaſt till ſhe is in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The next day after the quarter, when the Moon ſhall be in the Horizon, the Sun will be 12 degrees Weſt from the meridian; then this day when the moon ſhall be ſouth-eaſt, the Sun will be declined 12 degrees from the ſouth-weſt, at which point the Sun cannot ſo much impede this motion as the day before. And now every day the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment will be leſs, and accordingly the motion of the Earth and Seas will be increaſt, but eſpecially three days before the moon comes into Oppoſition, for then the Sun does not only leſs oppoſe, but for ſome part of the time (every day more then other) aſſiſts the moon in the motion. And when the moon ſhall be in oppoſition, the motion will be the ſame it was when in Conjunction; for then when the moon is in the Horizon eaſt, the Sun will be in the Horizon Weſt; and as the moon riſes above the Horizon, and gives the Earth motion from Eaſt to Weſt, the Sun at the ſame
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34229:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
time declines beneath the Horizon, and aſſiſts the moon in the motion altogether as powerfully as when in Conjunction. As the moon attracts or turns up the eaſtern ſide of the Globe, the Sun at the ſame time pulls down the VVeſtern ſide, which is the ſame thing as if they had been both in the ſame point, and the motion will be as great, and the Tides as high, as at the new moon, The ſame order is obſerv'd till the moon comes into Conjunction again, for as the motion was aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from new moon to the firſt quarter, ſo now for the ſame reaſon and after the very ſame Proportion it will again be abated till the moon is in the laſt quarter, and then increaſt as before for the next ſeven days, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now let any man that takes pleaſure in theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well with himſelf how much every day the motion of the earth ought to be abated or increaſt, (allowing the Sun to have ſuch an intereſt as I ſpake of before) and I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him all the ſatisfaction in it can be expected; for upon Examination he ſhall find the increaſing and decreaſing of the Tides to corroſpond as exactly with it as he can deſire, and much more excellently then I can expreſs it. Three Days before new and full moon, you ſhall find the ſun very aptly plac't to aſſiſt the moon in the motion, and acording<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you will find the Tides to increaſe. Three days after new and full moon the ſun not much leſs aſſiſts the moon (tho every day leſs then other) then upon the ſame day, and then you will find the Tides to decreaſe but leiſurely. Three days before either of the quarters, you muſt think the ſun notably impedes the motion, the Tides then decreaſe a pace. Three days after the quarter, the Tides increaſe but ſlowly, the ſun thoſe days leſs oppoſing, but not at all aſſiſting the moon. There is yet a fourth motion of the ſeas; that is,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:34229:15"/>
               <head>That theſe Spring Tides are made to increaſe and decreaſe every quarter of a year.</head>
               <p>THis motion of the Seas has not I think been much taken notice of here, only Learned men have obſerv'd that the ſpring Tides are uſually higher in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> then ordinary. But in the Mediteranean Sea it has been known long ſince, that the ſpring Tides are conſtantly lower when the Sun is in either of the Tropicks, and higher when in the Equator; and he that ſhall obſerve it upon any ſhore that lies open to the Ocean in any part of the World, (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) will find it ſo; but this place is by no means fit for theſe inquiries, for in <hi>December</hi> Land-floods many times makes the Tides higher then uſual, at other times they are peſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Ice, and that keeps them back, beſides ſtrong winds at Sea often makes the Tides higher or lower then Ordinary, when perhaps its calm here. And then in <hi>June,</hi> tho the ſpring Tides are lower then then uſual, yet it has been thought to be only for want of freſh water coming down ſo plentifully as at other times; and indeed reaſon and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience tell us that when Land-floods happen at the new or full Moon, the ſpring-tides muſt be and are then higher then at that time of the year they are accuſtomed to be; and by Conſequence when the Rivers are empty, the Tides muſt be and are then lower. But then its well known that the waters in <hi>European</hi> Rivers are uſually lower in <hi>September</hi> then in <hi>June,</hi> and yet the ſpring-tides are then commonly higheſt, but by reaſon of the aforeſaid frequent Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this has not been taken notice of, though its diſcernable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34229:15"/>
enough here to a curious obſerver. And the Reaſon why the ſpring-tides are higher at theſe times then Ordinary, is very plain, and may in a few words be diſpatcht. For ſuppoſe the Moon to be in Conjunction with the Sun in the firſt degrees of <hi>Cancer,</hi> they now in their diurnal motion deſcribe the leaſt Circle (except when in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and then it is the ſame) about the Earth; and then muſt give the Earth the leaſt motion. This you cannot queſtion, for if you were to give a Wheel motion upon its Axis, you would not lay your hand upon the Nave, or near it, but upon the Rim, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Circle, ſince you might with uſing but the ſame ſtrength at the Rim give it a greater motion then in any leſſer circle. 'Tis the ſame with the Sun and Moon, about 14 days after this, the Sun will be in the middle of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and the Moon about the middle of <hi>Capricorn</hi> in Oppoſition with the Sun, (which is the ſame thing as if they were in the ſame circle) and deſcribe circles ſo much greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by that advantage give the Earth a greater motion, ſo that this ſpring tide muſt be a little higher then that that happened 14 days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And so every time the Moon ſhall be in Conjunction or Oppoſition with the Sun, they will yet deſcribe greater circles, and by that means give the earth a greater Motion; and accordingly the ſpring-tides will increaſe till the Sun has reacht the Equator. And then being carried directly over the Body of the Earth in the greateſt circle, they muſt needs be thought to give the Earth and Seas the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that now the ſpring-tides are at the very higheſt; for now they will for the ſame reaſon decreaſe again, till the Sun is in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and the next quarter increaſe, &amp;c. And this without doubt is the only cauſe why the ſpring-tides are higher in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> and lower in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>December.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have endeavoured to inform my ſelf how much the ſpring-tides are higher when the Sun is in the Equator, then when in the Solſtices; and by the neareſt Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation I could make here at <hi>London,</hi> there is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34229:16"/>
of near two foot, but I am not ſo well ſatisfied in it as I deſire.</p>
               <p>It will not be amiſs to give you notice here that you ſhall hardly meet with two men that agree at what time the Spring Tides are at the higheſt (I mean thoſe Spring Tides that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at New and Full-Moon) ſome ſaying upon the day the Moon is in Conjunction or Oppoſition, ſome the next day, others will have it the third Tide after, by which it ſhould ſeem the time is not fixt. I am in the mind that for one half of the year the Tides may increaſe a day or more after Full and Change, but not the other half; That is, from <hi>June</hi> to <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> and from <hi>December</hi> till <hi>March;</hi> my reaſon for it is this, in theſe quarters the Sun is returning from the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks to the Equators, and then though the Sun a day after full and change do leſs aſſiſt the Moon in giving the Earth motion then upon the day; yet it is ſo very little leſs, that the diſadvantage is more than recompenc'd by the Moons diſcribing the day after (having a very ſwift motion) a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Circle about the Earth. As the Sun goes from the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the Tropick, it is quite contrary; for then the day after full and change the Moon deſcribes a leſſer Circle than the day before; and then the Tides ſhould not increaſe after New and Full-Moon, at leaſt not ſo long.</p>
               <p>I have made ſome agreeable obſervations about this, but have not had time for a ſtrict inquiry; though I have long thought of it. Thoſe that live near this, or any other River that Ebbs and Flows, may eaſily inform themſelves whether this be ſo or no.</p>
               <p>But now beſides theſe alterations of the Seas, it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon this motion of the Earth: firſt, that when the Tides riſe higheſt, they muſt fall loweſt; Secondly, That the Tides in all Seas muſt ſet Eaſt and Weſt; and Thirdly, That the motion of the Seas muſt begin at the ſame time all over the World.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe you may at your pleaſure obſerve, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34229:16"/>
you ſhall alwayes find that the higheſt ſpring. Tide makes the loweſt Ebb. And all experimene'd men know the Tides ſet directly Eaſt and Weſt upon all the utmoſt Eaſtern and Weſtern Shores in the World. And I think that Learned men are agreed, that the motion begins at the ſame time in all Seas. Thus much is certain, that when the Moon is South-weſt, or in the oppoſite Point of the Heavens, that is North-eaſt, it is alwaies high-water upon all the utmoſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen weſtern Shores of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> from <hi>Nova Zem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla</hi> to the Cape of <hi>Good-hope.</hi> And that when the Moon is South-eaſt or North-weſt, it is high-water upon the utmoſt Eaſtern Shores of <hi>America.</hi> So that when it is high-water upon the firſt named, it muſt be low-water upon the other Shores. When they have the firſt of Ebb upon the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Shores of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> they muſt have the firſt of Flood upon the oppoſite Eaſtern Shores of <hi>America.</hi> By which it is plain that the motion begins at the ſame time in all theſe Seas; and that what we call the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, is nothing but the falling of the waters from off the Weſtern, upon the Eaſtern Shores, and the ſame back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain every 6 hours. But further, when it is high-water upon the Weſtern Shores of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> it is high-water at the ſame time upon the Weſtern Shores of <hi>Italy,</hi> and upon the Shores of <hi>Syria</hi> at the bottom of the Mediteranean Sea, and (take good notice of it) when it is high-water upon thoſe Shores, it is low-water at <hi>Venice</hi> and on the contrary. Now this I take to be a very forceable argument to prove the motion of the Earth, as I have ſuppoſed it, and then the motion muſt begin at the ſame time in all Seas; for it is unconceivable how this ſhould otherwiſe happen: but if you ſhall fancy the Terraqueous Globe to have a little motion from Weſt to Eaſt, you will then ſay that it muſt make high-water upon all the firſt named <hi>Shores,</hi> and low-water at <hi>Venice.</hi> But then let the Eaſtern ſide be turned up, and it muſt make high-water at <hi>Venice,</hi> and low-water upon all the other Shores.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:34229:17"/>
The inſtances that may be taken out of this and other Seas to confirm this motion of the Earth, are every where ſo many and ſo obvious, that they cannot eſcape your notice if you will but take the leaſt pains to inquire into theſe things. Nor can you (I think) meet with any thing that ſhall ſeem to contradict it. A reaſon now ſhould be given,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Why upon ſome Shores they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no Tides, when upon others they have great and almoſt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Floods.</head>
               <p>I will onely name ſome of thoſe places that are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for great Tides, or the contrary, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to give a reaſon why it is ſo, being almoſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that when you have obſerved thoſe places well, you will ſay that the Earth having ſuch a motion, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be ſo. I will begin in the North parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> In ſome Bays upon the Shores of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> it Flows 12. or 14 foot, but in ſome places upon the Neighbouring Shores of <hi>Lapland</hi> they have no Tides at all; and where they have moſt which is (as I remember) near the Bay of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> one two, or three foot. <hi>Pet</hi> and <hi>Jackman</hi> ſearching for a paſſage by the North<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>eaſt to <hi>India,</hi> found the waters in ſome of the Bays upon this Coaſt to be black, and like a ſtanding Pool, without Motion. Note that there are Bays upon thoſe Shores that have the ſame Forms that thoſe have upon the other Shores where they have very great Tides. Upon the Weſtern Shores of <hi>Norway</hi> about 10 or 12 foot, but upon the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Shores, of <hi>Norway</hi> they hardly exceed one foot or two; in the Baltick Sea no Tides. In the Bay of <hi>Bristow</hi> 50 foot. At the Town of <hi>Orange</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> they <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34229:17"/>
80 foot. In the Bay of <hi>Biſcay</hi> 18, 20, or 24 foot. Upon the Weſtern ſhores of <hi>Affrica</hi> 10, 12, or 14 foot. But upon the Southern ſhores of <hi>Guiney</hi> and <hi>Benin</hi> they have very little Tides, every ruffling Gale of Wind diſorders them in many places there. In <hi>Davis's</hi> ſtreight (in ſome places near the Entrance) it flows about 30 foot, At <hi>Port-Nelſon,</hi> (which lies oppoſite to the mouth of the <hi>Streights)</hi> where Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Button</hi> Wintred, 15 foot: but in the South-part of the ſame Bay, where (as I take it) <hi>Hadſon</hi> Wintred, but one foot, obſerve this Bay well. In the Bay of <hi>Foundy,</hi> North-ward from <hi>New-England,</hi> which place I had never heard ſpoken of for great Tides, (though I had been twice in North-<hi>America)</hi> but about two or three years ſince I ſaw a draught of the Sea Coaſts thereabouts deſcribed in very large form, where this Bay was repreſented in ſuch a Figure that I concluded that if the Earth had ſuch a motion as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had ſuppoſed, that then in this Bay there muſt be great Tides. Not long after I met with a Maſter of a Ship that traded into thoſe parts, who upon my asking told me, that it flow'd there 12 or 13 fathom, but becauſe I knew the man to be one that lov'd to make things that were ſtrange ſeem won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, I did not rely upon his Teſtimony, but inquir'd of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who agreed that it flow'd there above 60 foot; I now and alwayes mean ſpring-tides; and in Bays or mouths of Rivers; for where the Land is not indented, the waters never riſe ſo high. In other Bays upon the Eaſtern ſhores of North <hi>America,</hi> two or three fathom; upon the Eaſtern ſhores of South-<hi>America,</hi> 10 or 12 foot, according to the largneſs of the Seas, which are there very unequal. And becauſe this may be a rule for other places, you may obſerve that from <hi>Cape Frio</hi> (which is in the ſouth-eaſt parts of <hi>Braſile)</hi> to the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Magallan,</hi> the Land trenches away ſouth-weſt. Now when the firſt of flood falls upon the ſouth-eaſt ſhores of <hi>Braſile,</hi> the waters riſe conſiderably higher upon the ſhores, (as they do upon all other ſhores) then the ſurface of the Sea at a very little diſtance is, now the waters that next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34229:18"/>
theſe, not finding it eaſie to mount this height, and yet being preſt forwards by ſucceeding waters, are part of them forc't to follow the trenching of the Land at a diſtance from the ſhore. So that if in all this Tract of Land any Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or Head-land that juts it's ſelf farther into the Sea then ordinary, to catch or Arreſt theſe waters in their paſſage, happens to lie on the Weſtern-ſide of any Bay or mouth of Rivers, the Tide in thoſe Bays or Rivers ſhall be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably higher; but if the Land on the Eaſtern ſide be ſtrecht farther out then the Tides in thoſe Bays or Rivers, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be abated. It Ebbs and flows up the River of <hi>Plate</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Purchas)</hi> an 100 miles. In the River <hi>Galegos</hi> near the entrance of the <hi>Streights)</hi> and upon the ſhores of <hi>Fuego</hi> it flows 60 foot. In the Bay that lies between the City of <hi>Martaban</hi> and <hi>Pegae,</hi> in the Gulf of <hi>Bengalia</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> the Tides ſet in with a great deal of fury, and are ſaid to riſe there ſometimes 40 foot. In the Bay of <hi>Cambaja,</hi> great Tides, but they riſe not ſo high, nor is the motion ſo violent as in the former: In the Red-Sea very little Tides: What Tides they have upon the ſhores of New <hi>Guiney,</hi> I cannot learn, but without doubt very notable in that great Bay, upon the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern-ſhore. The greateſt Tides in the Mediteranean Sea, are ſaid to be upon the Coaſt of <hi>Syria,</hi> where (I think) they riſe ſeven or eight foot. At the bottom of the Gulf of <hi>Venice,</hi> 5 foot; upon the Weſtern ſhores of <hi>Italy,</hi> not above a foot: The Waters run through the ſtreight of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and <hi>Caribdis,</hi> ſix hours Eaſt, ſix hours weſt, with a great deal of violence, without riſing or falling, or but very little; the like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens between all the Iſlands in this Sea, only the courſe of the waters is not ſo rapid, the paſſage not being ſo ſtreight.</p>
               <p>Now take a Globe, ſet it upon its Poles, the Horizon to cut the Equator at the points before ſpoken of, and look upon any of theſe places, or any other place that you know; or that Report has made famous for great Tides, or otherways; and if the place be upon a Weſtern ſhore, as the Town of <hi>Orange</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> then imagine the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34229:18"/>
Globe to have a little motion, (you had beſt fancy it to be exceeding little indeed, and your ſelf not near, or elſe the very fear of being overwhelm'd with the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Waters that muſt be crowded into this place, will make you tremble) from Weſt to Eaſt, but if the place be upon an Eaſtern ſhore, as the Bay of <hi>Foundy,</hi> then from Eaſt to Weſt; and the reaſon why theſe things are ſo, will appear ſo manifeſtly, that it muſt be delightful to conſider it; but it would add to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if you had the Figures of thoſe places you had a mind to Examine, deſcribed in the largeſt Forms.</p>
               <p>Take Notice, that in all thoſe places where I have ſaid there is great Tides, that the bottoms of thoſe places are ſandy and ſmooth; which may indeed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the raiſing of the Waters there, but cannot ſo properly be ſaid to be the cauſe of the extraordinary Tides in thoſe places; As the great Tides are the cauſe of that; for where ever the Tides ſets with a direct Courſe into the mouths of Bays or Rivers, they muſt have there alwayes ſandy ſmooth Bottoms. Except in large Bays or Rivers that have narrow Mouths, and in them the quite contrary may happen; for the greateſt ſwelling of the Waters ſhall be near the Entrance, and leaſt of all in the Extremities of thoſe Bays; and they may have very uneven Bottoms, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In a word, there is nothing of Myſtery in theſe things; Nothing but what is Conſonant to the Laws, Principles, and Ordinary workings of Nature, and moſt agreeable to Reaſon, nothing but what you may imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and at your pleaſure ſee exactly repreſented (what alterations happens upon the account of Rivers excepted) by placing in a Boat (as I ſaid before) 10 or more Veſſels of Water, of different ſizes and Figures; let one of thoſe Veſſels be long and very narrow, and ſtand as the Boat North and South: Now make a mark upon the Weſtern ſide of any of thoſe Veſſels, even with the Surface of the Water, and then in three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34229:19"/>
time lift up the Eaſtern-ſide of the Boat ſo high till you raiſe the water half an Inch above that mark; and then in the like Space of time as you rais'd it, let it return to its place, and (without letting the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ceaſe) in three Minutes more (depreſs that ſide as much below the Level as before you raiſed it, that is till the water be fallen half an Inch below that Mark upon the Weſtern ſhore; and now in other ſix Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes raiſe it to its firſt height, and if you ſhall con tinue thus to move it, you ſhall conſtantly give the Boat ſix minutes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> motion from Eaſt to weſt, and from Weſt to Eaſt, and it will be ſaid to Ebb and Flow upon that ſhore where you made the Mark, a full Inch. And you ſhall have two Tides upon al ſhores every 24 Minutes; and you may make thoſe Tides to fall later by three quarters of a Minute every 24 minutes, and to increaſe and decreaſe in what Periods of time you pleaſe. Nay if a Hand, a Sun, on the contrary ſide of the Boat, did ſometimes hinder, ſometimes aſſiſt you, the Motion of the Boat and Waters muſt be abated and increaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; or if you ſhould remove your hand 23 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees on either ſide of the Equator (if I may ſo call it) of the Boat, you ſhall not in uſing but the ſame Strength give the Boat ſo great a Motion at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Declination as in the middle the greateſt Circle; and if you have the Figure of thoſe ſhores deſcribed in ſome of theſe Veſſels, where they have very great or almoſt no Tides, you ſhall ſee the very ſame Alterations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe ſhores. And when you give the Boat the greateſt Motion, you muſt have the higheſt Spring Tides and the loweſt Ebbs. The Waters muſt run directly Eaſt and Weſt, and the Motion muſt begin at the ſame time in all thoſe little Seas. And whatever other Accidents happens in the Flux or Reflux of the Sea, you may plainly ſee, even thoſe Irregular motions (as they are call'd) obſerv'd in the <hi>Euripus</hi> its ſelf (as did
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34229:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I not think that upon ſuch a motion of the Earth as I have ſuppoſed the Reaſon of thoſe Alterations would manifeſtly appear, I ſhould have made ſome words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.) And the motion of the Waters ſhall be in Proportion to the largeneſs of the Veſſels, only it ſhall be inſenſible in that narrow Veſſel that ſtood North and South in the Boat. Then it will not at all ſeem ſtrange to you that the Alterations obſerv'd in other parts of the Ocean are not diſcernable in the Baltick Sea. And I know that you think it would be the ſame thing if that Sea was plac't at either of the Poles, or at the Equator: And that if the Mediteranean Sea ſtood as the Baltick; North and South, that there would be very little or no Tides in that Sea; But to be ſure there could be none where now they have the greateſt Tides, that is, upon the ſhores of <hi>Syria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> and at the Streights mouth. And that if the Baltick Sea was plac't Eaſt and weſt, the tides would be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough in the Extremities of that Sea.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I lately met with a couple of Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations about the ebbing and flowing of the Sea in the Philoſophical Tranſactions of the truly Royal Society, not yet ſpoken of the firſt is: That the water neither flows nor ebbs alike, in Reſpect of equal Degrees, but its Velocity increaſeth with the tide till juſt mid-water or half-flood, at which time its Velocity is at the Strongeſt; and then decreaſeth proportionably till high-water or full Sea.</p>
               <p>If you have underſtood what I have ſaid, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know that the firſt three hours of every flood and ebb is that three hours time in which the earth is returning to its Level; then the buſineſs is to know whether it may be thought that the Moon lets fall the ſide of the Globe with a Motion ſomwhat quicker, then ſhe raiſes it. Or, that the waters falling upon the empty ſhores, muſt be thought to riſe faſter the firſt three hours, then they can when the ſhores and Rivers
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34229:20"/>
are half full. I muſt leave this to the Determination of wiſer men.</p>
               <p>The other Obſervation is indeed very notable, which is, that the morning tides for one half of the year are higher by a foot (where it flows 18 or 20 foot) then the evening tides; and on the contrary the other half year.</p>
               <p>It would trouble a good head to give a Satisfactory Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon how this ſhould happen, if the earth has not ſuch a Motion as I have been ſpeaking of; but that being alow'd, the cauſe of this odd effect is manifeſt enough. Nay I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the ſolving of this doubt would give much Reputation to the Hypotheſis, but becauſe it would ingage me to ſpeak of things that at this time I do not care for med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with, I ſhall now let it alone, but if the Learned ſhall think there is more in what I have already ſaid, then meer Conjecture (as I am under a ſtrong deluſion if there be not) then upon ſome other Occaſion you may know more of my thoughts about this. Till that be known, farewel.</p>
