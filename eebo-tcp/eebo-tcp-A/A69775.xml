            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PRefaces are many times more for faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
than neceſſity, and being eſteem'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as Complements than ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
are as ſlightly paſſed over by the
Reader, as ſuperfluouſly added by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
More eſpecially we might ſeem excuſable, if
we ſhould not comply with the Tyranny of Cuſtom
herein, before this <hi>Volume,</hi> having <hi>preambled</hi> at large
to the other Three; and given not only an account
of the reaſon and <hi>deſign</hi> of this work, but anſwered
moſt of the Objections and <hi>Scandals</hi> commonly caſt
upon it.</p>
            <p>This 4<hi>th</hi> Volume, 'tis true, is not large in bulk,
yet contains the Hiſtory of a very remarkable period;
<hi>viz.</hi> From <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s dawning, to the day-break of
<hi>Luther;</hi> and exhibits not a few choice <hi>Occurrences,</hi>
and moſt fit to be known, as by the Table may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially it demonſtrates us to what a deſperate
degree of <hi>Corruption</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and what a Chaos of Errors, Superſtition and
Impiety ſhe was become; inſomuch that complaints
were daily put forth by all thoſe that had any Sparks
of Grace and Virtue in them, though yet joining with
her in communion: and as theſe abuſes ſhew'd the
<hi>need</hi> and neceſſity of a Reformation, ſo they both led
<pb facs="tcp:57857:3"/>
people to deſire it, and alſo did <hi>juſtify</hi> the ſame when
effected.</p>

            <p>Before the late Troubles in <hi>England,</hi> or the date of
forty one, ſeveral <hi>Godly learned</hi> men have either
<hi>expreſſed</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> of Chriſts perſonal Reign

on <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7.) That (in their opinion) <hi>Popery</hi> ſhall
yet again for a while univerſally or very generally
prevail in many or moſt of theſe Countrys and
Nations out of which it hath been expell'd. With
<pb facs="tcp:57857:3"/>
whom as to this particular, the moſt profound and
Reverend Archbiſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> did dot only concur in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
but ſeems to be very much aſſured, or to have
had a kind of particular foreſight of the ſharp per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
that ſhall attend this laſt effort of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts,
if that Paper call'd his <hi>Propheſy</hi> may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited,
which I never yet heard diſprov'd: to which
we may add that <hi>diſmal</hi> proſpect of affairs which our
eyes behold, it being certain that the <hi>Proteſtant Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi>
throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> was never <hi>lower</hi> ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, than it is at this
Inſtant. And therefore certainly ſince the danger is
ſo near and ſo great, it concerns all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to Arm
themſelves for the Encounter; to ſtudy the points
in Controverſy between us and the Papiſts as far
as their Leiſure and Abilities will give them leave,
and both to eſtabliſh themſelves in the truth, and
be acquainted with the Sophiſms, ſpecious pretences
and inticing <hi>Fallaces</hi> of the Romaniſts, that they may
the better avoid and confute them.</p>
            <p>More eſpecially to warn people from <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> and
ſinful compliances, in caſe Superſtition ſhould ever
prevail to a publick Eſtabliſhment (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid)
we have at large in this <hi>Tome</hi> evinc'd the preſent

            <p>There are too many <hi>Errors of the Preſs,</hi> which

very obvious to a Conſiderate Reader, by the ſenſe

               <p>IN our <hi>three</hi> foregoing <hi>Tomes</hi> we have trac'd the <hi>Roman
Lucifer</hi> from his very <hi>Cradle,</hi> and purſued him in all his
ſubtle <hi>windings,</hi> 'till we found him mounted aloft, exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelf <hi>above all that is called God,</hi> diſpoſing of the
<hi>Crowns</hi> and Kingdoms of Princes at his pleaſure, and trampling
their <hi>Royal Necks</hi> under his audacious Feet. We have alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
conſidered the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Progreſs</hi> of the Apoſtacy, under
what pretences the reſpective Errors, Superſtitions, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries
<hi>crept</hi> into the Church, and how they were entertain'd
and <hi>promoted</hi> from time to time by the Pope and his <hi>Clergy,</hi> in
order to gratifie their own Pride and Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Thus have we follow'd the <hi>Thread</hi> of the Story to the 14<hi>th</hi>
Century, at which time it pleaſed God to raiſe up <hi>Wickliff</hi> an
<hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> who, more loud than any before him, ſounded

the Alarm-Bell of Reformation, and by continual preaching
and writing againſt the lazy Friars and their Fopperies, that
the Impreſſion; (altho his wicked Enemies burnt the good
Man's Bones long after) made in the Minds of Men by his
Doctrines, could never be totally <hi>effaced,</hi> but remain'd more or

                  </gap>nd <hi>lively</hi> Doctrine of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour,
was for the moſt part as unknown to thoſe who call'd themſelves
after his Name, as to the <hi>Heathen</hi> themſelves. The vileneſs of
our <hi>natural</hi> State, the ſtrength and turpitude of <hi>Sin,</hi> the end
and uſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Offices of Chriſt,</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt
the Comforter, the Nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> the true works of <hi>Grace,</hi>
and liberty of a Chriſtian Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were Points neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
nor enquired after. There was rarely a word of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
mentioned; <hi>Divinity</hi> and Learning were both confin'd
cloſe Priſoners to the <hi>Schools,</hi> and there miſerably perverted
into <hi>Cobweb Notions,</hi> and wrangling <hi>Sophiſtry.</hi> Inſtead of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Evangeliſts and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Men ſpent their time and
Brains in ſtudying the <hi>crabbed perplexities</hi> of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and the
<hi>Maſter of the Sentences,</hi> and the World forſaking the vivifying
Power of God's Spiritual <hi>Word</hi> and Doctrine, was altogether
firſt <hi>blinded,</hi> and then <hi>led</hi> with external gawdy Pomp, dazling
Ceremonies, and multiplied humane Traditions. Scarce any
thing elſe being ſeen in the <hi>Churches,</hi> heard in their <hi>Sermons,</hi> or
intended in all their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>evotions; ſo that the People were taught
to worſhip nothing but what they <hi>ſaw,</hi> and they ſaw almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which they did <hi>not</hi> worſhip: Witneſs the multitudes of
<hi>Images, Croſſes, Pictures, Reliques, Shrines, Tombs, Altars, &amp;c.</hi>
all the Objections of their fooliſh Devotions. Inſtead of the
Poverty and <hi>Purity</hi> of Chriſt, here was Pride and Superfluity,
and all kinds of <hi>abomination of Life;</hi> inſtead of the Apoſtolical
Labours and Humility, <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> had ſeiz'd upon the
Prieſts. The ſimple and <hi>unlearned</hi> being far from all knowledge
of the Holy Scripture, thought it enough for them to know
only theſe things which were delivered them by their Paſtors
and Teachers, who were almoſt as ignorant themſelves, and
taught nothing but what they received from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57857:6"/>
whereof the moſt part tended more to the profit of their <hi>Order,</hi>
advancing the Pope's Intereſt, or filling with <hi>Money</hi> his Coffers,
than to the <hi>Glory of Chriſt,</hi> or real advantage of Souls. The
Chriſtian Faith was counted no other thing than to know, <hi>That
Chriſt once ſuffer'd,</hi> that is, 'twas enough for us to know what
the <hi>Devils</hi> alſo knew; Men were ſo addicted to the Hypocriſie
of outward ſhews, that the Religion and Holineſs, even of the
moſt Learned and Pious, ſeem'd altogether to conſiſt in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of <hi>Days, Meats, Habits,</hi> and ſuch vain circumſtances:
Hence aroſe ſo many <hi>different</hi> Orders of Religion, or Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Monks and Friars, with Veſtures of ſeveral faſhions, and
various <hi>colours:</hi> Hence likewiſe came your <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> to <hi>Loretto,</hi>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Compoſtella, &amp;c.</hi> As if St. <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Compoſtella</hi> would
do that, which Chriſt <hi>could</hi> not do at <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Canterbury;</hi> or
as if our Omnipotent Omnipreſent <hi>Jehovah</hi> were not of like
power or ſtrength, and pity and compaſſion in <hi>every</hi> place; or
could not be found, unleſs by running and gadding hither and
thither contrary to his own Requirements. (<hi>Neither at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
nor in this Mountain, but in Spirit and Truth ſhall ye worſhip
the Father, for ſuch he ſeeketh to worſhip him.</hi> John 4. 22.) The
<hi>Holineſs</hi> requiſite all the year was put off to <hi>Lent.</hi> No Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to be counted Holy, but <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> becauſe thereon Chriſt
had walked with his corporeal Feet. Inſtead of taking up the
<hi>true</hi> Croſs of Chriſt by Patience, Humility, Self-denial, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> people go <hi>together by the Ears about the material
<hi>Croſs</hi>
                  </hi> whereon Chriſt ſuffered; and though they knew not
where to find it, yet upon an imagination that it was in thoſe
Parts, all Chriſtian Kings and Princes are ſet <hi>agogg,</hi> many of
them ruin'd, and 'tis believ'd, ſome <hi>millions</hi> of Men ſlain and
deſtroy'd in theſe pretended Holy Wars; who though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
never ſo debauch'd and wicked, are yet aſſur'd to go <hi>to
rights</hi> to Heaven, the meritoriouſneſs of this Expedition expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all their Villanies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was the ſtate of Chriſtendom in thoſe days; and wanted
not the World then an</hi> Hercules <hi>to purge ſuch an</hi> Augaean Stable?
<hi>Yes certainly; and Providence provided him, even</hi> Wickliff, <hi>a
valiant and well-appointed Champion, for whom I may borrow
that</hi> Encomium <hi>which</hi> Syracides <hi>beſtows on</hi> Simon <hi>the Son of</hi>
Onias, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 50. 6. He was as the morning Star in the midſt of a
Cloud, and as the Moon being Full in her Courſe, as the Sun ſhining
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57857:7"/>
on the Temple of the Moſt High, and as the Rain-bow diverting our
fears of a Deluge, as the Flower of Roſes in the early Spring, as
Lillies by the Rivers, or as the Branches of the Frankincenſe-Tree
in the time of Summer.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s <hi>Parentage,</hi> all we can find, is, That he
was born about the fartheſt part of <hi>York-ſhire;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Birckbek</hi>
who was Miniſter of <hi>Gilling</hi> in thoſe Parts, in his Learned Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
Entituled, <hi>The Proteſtants Evidence,</hi> printed 1632. <hi>Centur.</hi>
14. aſſures us, That ſome of the Family remain'd there then,
and probably may continue to this day; his words are theſe:
<q>Our Country-man <hi>John Wickliff</hi> was born in the North, where
there is (near to the place where I live) an ancient and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful
Houſe bearing the name of <hi>Wickliff</hi> of <hi>Wickliff.</hi>
                  </q> But
in <hi>what Year</hi> he was born, is not Recorded, only 'tis certain,
that he was liberally Educated, and became Learned beyond
that Age, and flouriſhed about the year of our Lord 1371.
in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, being then Fellow of
<hi>Merton-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford:</hi> (A <hi>happy Foundation,</hi> Illuſtrious for
breeding many moſt famous Men, as Friar <hi>Bacon, Burley, Scotus,
Occham, Peccham, Bradwardine, &amp;c.</hi>) He was afterwards <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
of <hi>Baliol-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he commenc'd <hi>Doctor,</hi>
and was choſen <hi>Reader in Divinity:</hi> In which public Lectures he
ſhew'd himſelf a deep Schoolman, as in his <hi>ordinary</hi> Sermons a
faithful Paſtor of the Church, for whoſe Edification he ſpar'd
no pains, for he <hi>Tranſlated the whole Bible into the vulgar</hi> Tongue,
<hi>one Copy whereof, written with his own hand,</hi> is, or lately was,
extant in St. <hi>John Baptiſt Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi> He was beloved
of all good Men for his <hi>holy Life,</hi> and admired even by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
for his <hi>Learning:</hi> For we find <hi>Walden,</hi> his profeſs'd and
ſpiteful Enemy, in a certain Letter to Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth,
forc'd to acknowledge, That <hi>he was wonderfully aſtoniſh'd at his
moſt forcible Arguments, the various and pertinent Authorities he
had gathered, with the vehemence and ſmartneſs of his Reaſonings.</hi>
Nor was he unacquainted with <hi>Humanity,</hi> or polite <hi>Civil</hi> Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
(eſpecially he is obſerved to have been well read in our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws) and wrote ſo many <hi>large</hi> Volumes, as well in
Philoſophy as Divinity, as the ſame is almoſt incredible.</p>
               <p>He ſeem'd to follow in the courſe of his Studies the method
of the Schoolmen, and amongſt them was a profeſs'd follower
of <hi>Occham,</hi> by reading of whoſe Works, and ſundry others who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57857:7"/>
lived about the ſame time, or not long before, as <hi>Bradwardine,
Marſilius,</hi> St. <hi>Amore, Abelardus, Armachanus,</hi> and that great
and godly Learned Man <hi>Rob. Groſthead,</hi> and eſpecially and
above all by diligent peruſal of the Holy Scriptures, God gave
him grace and underſtanding to ſee the truth of his Goſpel, and
by ſeeing it, to loath all <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> and the ill precepts and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
of the then pretended Rules of the Church. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
by <hi>Occham</hi> and <hi>Marſilius</hi> he was informed of the Popes <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſions</hi>
and <hi>Uſurpations</hi> upon Kings, their Crowns and Dignities.
<hi>Guido de</hi> S. <hi>Amore,</hi> and <hi>Armachanus,</hi> ſhew'd him the ſundry
<hi>abuſes</hi> of <hi>Monks</hi> and Friars in upholding this uſurped Power.
By <hi>Abelard</hi> and others he began to have a right Apprehenſion
touching the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper. Bradwardine</hi>
taught him the Nature of a <hi>true ſole juſtifying Faith,</hi> againſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritmongers
and Pardoners: Finally, by <hi>Groſthead</hi>'s Work, with
which he ſeem'd moſt converſant, he deſcried the Popes to be
the <hi>very Antichriſt,</hi> by hindering the Goſpel to be preached, and
placing unfit and unworthy Men in the Church, and in making
all Religion ſubſervient to his damnable Policy.</p>
               <p>Being thus enlighten'd, 'tis no wonder if in his Writings and
Preachings he delivered many things againſt the then corrupted
Doctrine of the Church; but his Poſitions were chiefly directed
againſt the ſeveral Orders of <hi>Begging Friars,</hi> (who were his
profeſſed Perſecutors) and all Foreign uſurped Juriſdiction of
the Pope. By which he purchaſed ſome favour, or at leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance
at Court, and got his other Complaints againſt them for
other matters, the more eaſily heard and regarded, for at that
time the Friars Orders, by their manifold and notorious Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
were become exceeding <hi>odious,</hi> and the Popes pretences of
Juriſdiction by Proviſions, Reſervations, and Collations, not only
grievous, but utterly <hi>intollerable.</hi> This made way unto thoſe
excellent Acts of Parliament of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> againſt any that
ſhould appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> or draw the Subjects of <hi>England, ad aliud
Examen, To any Foreign Juriſdiction;</hi> as alſo againſt <hi>Proviſors,</hi>
and the Abuſes of <hi>Begging Friars,</hi> which fobridled and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Pope's Authority, that he could but little prevail in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
during the Raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, or <hi>Richard</hi>
the Second. Towards making which Law, <hi>Wickliff</hi> had no
ſmall Intereſt, by <hi>diſpoſing</hi> ſeveral of the Nobility and the Body
of the Commons thereunto; maintaining no leſs <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57857:8"/>
Magnanimouſly than <hi>Learnedly,</hi> the King's Juriſdiction, Crown,
and Dignity, by the Laws Civil, Canon, and Common. For
which reaſon, the Learned Dr. <hi>James,</hi> in <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Life, tells
us, That he was by <hi>one King ſent Ambaſſador</hi> into Foreign Parts,
and by another <hi>conſulted here at home.</hi> But amongſt all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
he moſt inſiſted upon thoſe, drawn from the <hi>common
Municipal Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> (the beſt <hi>Bull-works</hi> for the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
and Imperial Right of our Kings, againſt all the Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Encroachments of any <hi>Exotic Claim</hi>) for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his Opinions; and the better to enable him therein,
he had good Directions and Advice from time to time from the
Reverend <hi>Judges</hi> and Sages in the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was not ſo much hated of the Monks and Clergy out of
Self-intereſt, becauſe he <hi>oppoſed</hi> their lewd Practiſes; but he was
much <hi>indulg'd</hi> and favour'd by the <hi>Temporal</hi> State for his Piety,
Learning, and Virtue: For not only many of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> but
the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> were his
Friends; which makes <hi>Walſingham</hi> the Monk angry who upon all
occaſions vomits out his Gall againſt poor <hi>Wickliff</hi>) that that
famous <hi>Academy,</hi> where (as he ſaith) <hi>was the very height and
top of Wiſdom and Learning,</hi> ſhould ſo kindly entertain him.
Nor were they <hi>Freſhmen,</hi> or <hi>younger Fry</hi> of Students there, that
were his Admirers, but even the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Chief</hi> of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;
for Mr. <hi>Robert Rigge</hi> Vice-Chancellor, and the two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
took part with him; as alſo <hi>Nicholas Herford, John Aſhton</hi>
of <hi>Merton Colledge, John Aſhwarby</hi> of <hi>Oriel Colledge,</hi> Miniſter
of St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church; theſe all being Preachers, and <hi>Batchelors
of Divinity,</hi> joined with him, and were put to Trouble for the
ſame.</p>

and her <hi>trueſt</hi> Sons, with that opprobrious Title. I appeal to
all the Learned moderate Divines of our eſtabliſhed <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Church, if this be not true; nay, I my ſelf at two hours
warning could give more than 100 Inſtances of it: But I ſhall be
content at preſent only with one, but 'tis of a Pope (who you
know is <hi>Infallible</hi> in his Rogueries) in a Bull againſt Bleſſed
Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> we have theſe words, <hi>Impia Myſteria &amp; Inſtituta
ad</hi> Calvini <hi>praeſcriptum, &amp;c. The wicked Myſteries and Inſtitutes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to</hi> Calvin'<hi>s preſcription, by her received and obſerved, ſhe hath
commanded to be embrac'd by her Subjects.</hi> In a word, 'tis evident this
skulking Author's buſineſs is to <hi>ſcandalize</hi> all the Learned pious
Inſtruments, which God hath made uſe of for the firſt <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
As not only <hi>Calvin, Zwinglius,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> p. 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. but <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Melancton, Bucer, &amp;c.</hi> p. 5. Therefore with what Notion

but <hi>Parſons,</hi> that <hi>Baſtard</hi> of a Jeſuit, ('tis the Complement his

find it too in a Book, Entituled, <hi>The Image of both Churches,</hi>
written by one <hi>Musket</hi> a Jeſuit, and printed in King <hi>James</hi>'s
time; or you may have the effect of it in a Pamphlet, Entituled,
<hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> ſcribbled ſoon after His Majeſty's happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration
by a Popiſh Doctor of the Civil Law; to which, the
Reverend <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> one of the Prebends of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd

100 are) yet all the World knows your <hi>Bolſec</hi> was a moſt proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Liar, and the reſt of your Authors forg'd and Counterfeit.
Nor will, I hope, any that are truly of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
be bubbled with ſuch <hi>ſtale</hi> Shams; but rather take notice <hi>who</hi>
they are that thus blow theſe Coals, and keep ſuch a noiſe againſt

raiſed ſeveral Aſperſions and Calumnies againſt
honeſt <hi>Wickliff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As firſt, they affirm, That his Preaching was not out of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi>
but <hi>ſpite</hi> and deſire of <hi>Revenge,</hi> becauſe (forſooth) he
was put by the Biſhopprick of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> which he aim'd at—
Therefore he declaim'd ſo fiercely againſt the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57857:10"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is only the malicious ſuggeſtion of <hi>Parſons</hi> and
<hi>Brerely,</hi> and ſuch upſtart Pettifoggers for the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>
There is no <hi>ancient</hi> Author (tho moſt of them, as being <hi>Monks,</hi>
rail horribly againſt poor <hi>Wickliff</hi>) that mentions any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Nay, <hi>Parſons</hi> himſelf gives himſelf the Lie, for in his three
Converſions, <hi>Part</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. he ſaith, Wickliff <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
all temporal Goods</hi>—How then ſhould he ſo greedily
affect the Biſhopprick of <hi>Worceſter?</hi> And elſewhere he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes,
That <hi>Wickliff</hi> was in great <hi>favour</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi>
who bore chief ſway during the time of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third; ſo that if <hi>Wickliff</hi> had been ſo fond of a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick,
ſure that Duke's Intereſt might have got him one.</p>
               <p>2. They object, that <hi>Wickliff</hi> taught, That ſo long as a Man
is in <hi>deadly Sin,</hi> he is no <hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Prelate,</hi> neither doth truly
<hi>Conſecrate</hi> or <hi>Baptize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If <hi>Wickliff</hi> did ſay ſo, what more did he ſay, than
what St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> had ſaid before him—<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thou embrace
and follow the good works of a Biſhop, a Biſhop thou canſt not be.—
Ambr. de dignit. Sacerd. cap.</hi> 4. Nay, there is a Vote of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
(if that will help the matter) in a Caſe almoſt to the ſame
effect—<hi>Quicunque ſub Ordinatione Presbyterii vel Epiſcopatûs,
mortali Crimine ſe dixerint eſſe pollutos à ſupradictis Ordinationibus
ſubmovendos eſſe Cenſuimus:</hi> 
                  <q>Whoever coming under Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Presbytery or Eiſcopacy, ſhall be polluted with
mortal Sin, we think it fit, That ſuch be removed from thoſe
Orders, ſaith the Synod of <hi>Valentia,</hi> held under <hi>Damaſcus,</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>cap.</hi> 4. It muſt be remembred, that <hi>Wickliff</hi> lived in a moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Age, when the Clergy were ſo <hi>ſeared</hi> in Impiety, that it
required <hi>ſharp</hi> Launcings, and good ſtore of Vinegar to make
them ſenſible. It was only their <hi>abuſes</hi> he inveigh'd againſt ſo
tartly, for elſewhere he reproves thoſe that would <hi>not obey their
lawful Prelates;</hi> and in his Book of the <hi>verity of the Scripture,</hi>
he thus explains his meaning: <hi>Nomen non facit Epiſcopum ſed
vita, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>It is not the Name, but the Life that makes a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.
If a Man have the Name of a Prelate, and does not
anſwer the reaſon thereof in ſincerity of Doctrine, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of Life, but live ſcandalouſly in open Sin, he is but a
<hi>Nomine-tenus Sacerdos,</hi> A Biſhop or Prieſt in Name, not in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57857:10"/>
Truth.</q> Yet ſtill <hi>Wickliff</hi> did not deny, but that ſuch an ones
Miniſterial Acts were valid; for ſo in the ſame Treatiſe, <hi>p.</hi> 138.
he ſaith— <q>Unleſs the Chriſtian Prieſt be united unto Chriſt
by Grace, Chriſt cannot be his Saviour; <hi>Nec ſine falſitate
dicit verba Sacramentalia,</hi> Nor can he pronounce the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
words without Lying; <hi>Licet proſint Capacibus,</hi> The
notwithſtanding they are available ſo far, that the worthy
Receiver is thereby <hi>nothing hinder'd</hi> from partaking of the
Grace ſignified.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. They pretend, that <hi>Wickliff</hi> maintain'd, That it was
<hi>not lawful for any Eccleſiaſtical perſons to have any Temporal Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,</hi>
or property in any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is <hi>falſly</hi> imputed to him; he only tax'd the <hi>Abuſes</hi>
of the Revenues given to ſo many Abbies, Priories, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries,
tending only to Superſtition, and the keeping ſo many
Drones in idleneſs: And therefore he was of opinion, That
our Kings <hi>might</hi> diſpoſſeſs them thereof, and give them <hi>Genti
facienti Juſtitiam,</hi> to good and godly Uſes. The <hi>Poverty</hi> he
exhorted to, was no other than that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> recommends,
viz. <hi>Having Food and Rayment, therewith to be content.</hi> He did
not debar Miniſters from <hi>actual</hi> having, but from Covetous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the things of this World, which are to be Renounc'd
(ſaith he) <hi>Per Cogitationem &amp; Affectum,</hi> in the Mind and the
Affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. They charge him with aſſerting, <hi>That God ought to obey
the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is ſo <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> and improbable a Slander, that no
Man in his Wits can believe it. And on the quite contrary,
<hi>Wickliff</hi> in his Commentary on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. Expreſly affirms,
<hi>That the Devil can do nothing without God's permiſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. Well, but if they cannot fix <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> upon him,
they will charge him with <hi>Treaſon.</hi> This is a frequent Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
of the Devils and his Inſtruments—<hi>If thou ſuffer this Man,
thou art not</hi> Ceſar'<hi>s Friend,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Jews</hi> of old; not that they
cared for <hi>Ceſar,</hi> but only to gratifie their own Revenge. Thus
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57857:11"/>
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> charge <hi>Wickliff</hi> as a Teacher of <hi>Sedition,</hi> and an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
of Magiſtrates; and that if a Civil Magiſtrate be in a
mortal Sin, he is no longer to be <hi>obey'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is much <hi>craft</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> but very little truth
and no reaſon for this Slander. <hi>Wickliff</hi> indeed, in ſeveral of
his Works, admoniſheth the King (and all other inferiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Magiſtrates) that he beareth not the Sword in vain,
nor hath his Office for nought, but to diſcharge well and truly
the part and Office of a King, by ſeeing wholſom Laws duly
executed, and Juſtice impartially adminiſter'd: And tells him,
That if he be defective in ſuch his Duty, by ſuffering the Sword
of Juſtice to ruſt in its Scabard, and his People to periſh for want
of good Governance, then he is not <hi>properly and truly a King,</hi>
that is, in effect and operation, for ſo the words muſt neceſſarily
be underſtood, being ſpoken by way of Exhortation. But
otherwiſe, ſo far was <hi>Wickliff</hi> from mutinying himſelf, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading
others to any act that was <hi>Rebellious,</hi> that never any Man
in thoſe times did ſo ſtoutly aſſert the King's Supremacy in all
Cauſes, and over all Perſons, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil, againſt
all uſurped foreign Juriſdiction, for which (amongſt many
others) he gives this reaſon: That otherwiſe our Soveraign
ſhould not be King over all <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Regulus parvae partis,</hi> a
petty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Governour of ſome ſmall parts of the Realm.—Nor
does any thing, tending to countenance Rebellion, appear in
any of his <hi>Works</hi> that are extant. But the Friars and proud
Clergy having an inveterate ſpleen againſt <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and there
happening to fall out about the ſame time a grievous Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Commons under <hi>Wat Tyler;</hi> occaſioned chiefly
upon a civil ſcore, about Taxes, Commons, and Servitude, but
much augmented by one <hi>John Ball</hi> a Prieſt, (and one of <hi>Baal</hi>'s
Prieſts too for ought I know, for he does not at all appear to be
any of <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Followers) therefore, in ſpight to <hi>Wickliff,</hi>
they caſt the <hi>odium</hi> of that Frantic Tumult upon him and his
Doctrine.</p>
               <p>But indeed as <hi>Wickliff</hi> was a perſon of extraordinary Learning
and Piety, ſo that in ſubſtance he held and taught the very ſame
Doctrines as are at this day maintained by the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
is demonſtrated by the Learned Dr. <hi>James, Oxford</hi> Library<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper,
in his Book, Intituled—<hi>An Apology for</hi> John Wickliff,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57857:11"/>
                  <hi>ſhewing his Conformity with the now</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1608.</p>
               <p>However to the end the vulgar Reader may better judge of
this reverend man and his Works; I ſhall here produce ſome
few paſſages out of two of his Books, Printed by the ſaid <hi>James</hi>
from the <hi>Original Manuſcripts,</hi> remaining one in <hi>Bennet Colledge
Cambridge,</hi> the other in the Publick Library at <hi>Oxford.</hi> The
Engliſh being excuſable conſidering 'twas wrote above 300
years agoe in his complaint to King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and
his Parliament. <hi>Article</hi> 2. He hath theſe words— <q>Nothing
ought to be damned as errour and falſe, but if it favour errour
or unrightewiſeneſs againſt Gods Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Article</hi> 4. He prays. <q>That Chriſt's teaching O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leave
of the Sacrament of his own Body, that is plainly tawght
by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in <hi>Goſpels</hi> and <hi>Piſtles</hi> mayen be
tawght openlie in Churches of Chriſten People, and the
contrary teaching and falſe beleave is brought up by curſed
Hypocrits and worldlie Prieſts unkunning in Gods Law, which
ſay they are Apoſtles of Chriſt but are Fools.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And he concludes that Article with theſe words— <q>As
Chriſt ſaved the wordle by writing and teaching of foure
Evangeliſts, ſo the Fiend caſteth to Damme the wordle and
Prieſts, for letting to Preach the Goſpel by theſe four; by
fayned Contemplation, by Songs, by Salisbury uſe, and by
worldly buſineſs of Prieſts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in his Treatiſe againſt the Orders of Friars, <hi>Ca.</hi> 4.
runs thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Friars ſayen, that if a man be once profeſſed to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
he may never leave it, and be ſaved, though he be never
ſo unable thereto; for al time of his life, and they wil nede
him to live in ſuch a ſtate ever more, to which God makes
him ever unable, and ſo nede him to be damned. Alas, out
on ſuch hereſie that <hi>Mans Ordinance</hi> is holden ſtronger than
is the Ordinance of God. For if a man enter into the newe
Religion againſt mans ordinance, he maie lawfully forſake it;
but if he enter againſt Gods Ordinance, when God makes him
unable thereto, he ſhall not be ſuffered by <hi>Antichriſt</hi>'s power
to leave it. And if this reaſon were wel declared, ſith no
man wote which man is able to this new Religion by Gods
dome, and which is not able, no man ſhould be conſtrained
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57857:12"/>
to hold forth this new ſect, and thus this new Religion maie
not laſt, but if it be by this <hi>Blaſphemie</hi> to conſtraine a man
unable by Gods <hi>dome</hi> to hold this new ſect, and ſuffer him not
to come to freedome of Chriſts Order. And <hi>Chapter</hi> the 4th.
Friars ſaien, if a man bee profeſſed to there holie Order, hee
ſhal not Preach freelie and generallie, the Goſpel of Chriſtian
men without en <hi>licence</hi> of his Soveraign, for virtue of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be his Soveraign never ſo curſed man of life and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunning
of Gods Law and enimie to Chriſtian men ſouls, and
in caſe a <hi>foule Devil</hi> of Hel; thowgh this man profeſſed have
receaved of God never ſo much cuninge of Gods Law, and
power, and wil, to work after this cuninge; and ſo this
man ſhall needes be damned for miſspending of Gods treaſure.
For ſith Gods Law ſaies, that hee is out of Charity that helps
not his Brother with bodilie Almes, if he maie in his nede,
much more is he out of Charity, that helpes not his Brothers
ſoule, with <hi>teaching</hi> of Gods Law, when hee ſees him runne
to Hel, yea by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

their rotten ſects, they neden men by Hypocriſie, falſeteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſtrong paines, to break Gods heaſts and leeſe Charity.
Out on this falſe hereſie and tyrantrie of Antichriſt, that men
be neded ſtrangely to keep more his Lawes and obaye more to
them then to Chriſt's Commandements ever rightful.</q>

Doctrine was ſpread into Bohemia, &amp;c. His Death. His
Bones dug up and burnt.</head>
               <p>BY a <hi>miſtake</hi> at the <hi>Preſs</hi> laſt week, there was not
only ſome things mentioned in the <hi>Contents</hi> more
than there was <hi>room</hi> for in that <hi>Sheet,</hi> but alſo four
or five Lines happen'd to be twice repeated: For the
<hi>latter,</hi> we beg the Readers pardon; and as to the <hi>former,</hi> ſhall
endeavour now to ſatisfie him, which is, Touching the <hi>Troubles</hi>
and Oppoſition that <hi>Wickliff</hi> met with.</p>
               <p>If the ſtrength or <hi>policy</hi> of Man could have ſtifled thoſe
Truths which he delivered, his Doctrine had long ſince been
<hi>extinct;</hi> for the Pope was ſoon alarm'd therewith, and beſtir'd
himſelf amain to get <hi>Wickliff</hi> ſilenc'd; but ſuch Eſteem had he
by his Vertues and Learning obtain'd, that when <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
in the year 1378. ſent his <hi>Bull</hi> to the Univerſity of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:57857:14"/>
expoſtulating with them for ſuffering him there to ſpread
his <hi>Tenets, Walſingham</hi> the Hiſtorian tells us, <hi>That the Heads of
the Vniverſity were long time in ſuſpenſe, whether they ſhould receive
ſuch the Pope's Bull with Honour, or reject it with Contempt.</hi> Yet
at laſt, the <hi>Reverence</hi> they bore to his Un-holineſs, prevailed
with them to entertain his <hi>Bull</hi> with Reſpect: However, we do
not find, that they did any thing effectually againſt <hi>Wickliff.</hi>
But the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was very violent againſt him;
<hi>twice</hi> he was actually convented before him and other Biſhops,
and <hi>thrice</hi> ſummoned to appear. The firſt time he eſcaped by
the favour of the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who would needs have a
<hi>Chair</hi> for him that he might ſit, which the Biſhops would not
admit in their preſence, and ſo a Quarrel aroſe, and nothing
then was done. The ſecond time he got off by means of a
Meſſenger, who, juſt as they were about to paſs Sentence upon
him, came in from the Queen, charging them immediately to
deſiſt. The third time he prudently abſented himſelf, and did
not obey their Summons, becauſe he had intelligence, that the
Biſhops had <hi>plotted his Death,</hi> by the way, deviſing the means,
and encouraging certain Ruſſians thereunto. However, in his
abſence, the Biſhops, with the <hi>Rabble of Friars</hi> to aſſiſt them,
took upon them to examine and cenſure his Writings, meeting
for that purpoſe at the <hi>Gray-Friars, London,</hi> where, juſt as they
were going about their buſineſs, happen'd a moſt terrible <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi>
which much daunted them; yet at laſt they proceeded
to pick out 9 Articles or Propoſitions, which they condemn'd as
<hi>Heretical,</hi> and 23 others as <hi>Erronious:</hi> And then they got the
King's Letters forbidding his Books and Doctrines to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh't;
yet ſtill he remain'd firm and conſtant, and laboriouſly,
both by <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>writing,</hi> propagated the Goſpel, and God
wonderfully preſerv'd him out of the hands of his Enemies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
Parſon of <hi>Lutterworth</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and ſo died in
peace in a good old Age in the year 1387.</p>
               <p>Nor was his Doctrine confin'd only to <hi>England,</hi> but ſhone and
gave light into Regions far remote. Some ſay, that to avoid
the fury of the Clergy, he himſelf for ſome years withdrew
into <hi>Germany,</hi> and there preached the Goſpel; but I do not find
ſufficient Ground for that opinion, but rather believe, the Truth
might be propagated there by ſome of his Followers; and in

               <p>What opinion the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> had of the Learning

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57857:15"/>
even unto his end being ſufficiently proved by evident
Signs and Tokens, and alſo by lawful Witneſſes of Credit,
therefore the Sacred Synod declareth, determineth, and giveth
Sentence, That the ſaid <hi>John Wickliff</hi> was a notorious obſtinate
Heretic, and that he died in his Hereſie, Curſing and Damning

                  <q>This Synod alſo Decrees and Ordains, That the Body and

Tradition in all <hi>Lutterworth:</hi> A Child finding one of

                  </q> —Thus far the Doctor.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Weeks Task with a Copy of <hi>John Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff</hi>'s
Anſwer or Reſolution to King <hi>Richard,</hi> touching the Right
and Title of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> which was as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57857:15"/>
It being demanded, whether the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> may
lawfully, in caſe of neceſſity, for its own defence, detain and
keep back the Treaſure of the Kingdom, that it be not carried
away to foreign and ſtrange Nations, the Pope himſelf deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and requiring the ſame, under pain of Cenſure, and by
vertue of Obedience.</p>
               <p>To which, <hi>Wickliff</hi> return'd this Anſwer— <q>Setting apart
the Minds of Learned Men, what might be ſaid in the matter,
either by the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> or by the <hi>Law of England,</hi> or the
<hi>Civil Law,</hi> It reſteth, ſaith he, not only to perſuade and prove
the Affirmative part of this Doubt, but the Principles of
Chriſt's Law. And firſt, I prove it thus: Every natural Body
hath Power given it of God, to reſiſt againſt his Contrary, and
to preſerve it ſelf in due Eſtate, as Philoſophers know very
well; in ſo much, that Bodies without Life are endu'd with
ſuch a kind of Power (as it is evident) unto whom hardneſs
is given to reſiſt thoſe things that would break it, and Coldneſs
to withſtand the Heat that diſſolveth it. For ſo much then as
the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> (after the manner and phraſe of the
Scriptures) ought to be one <hi>Body,</hi> and the Clergy with the
Commonalty, the Members thereof; it ſeemeth that the
ſame Kingdom hath ſuch Power given it of God, and ſo much
the more apparent, but how much the ſame Body is more <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
unto God, adorned with Vertue and Knowledge. For
ſo much then as there is no Power given of God unto any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for any end or purpoſe, but that he may <hi>lawfully</hi> uſe the
ſame to that end and purpoſe; it followeth, that our Kingdom
may lawfully <hi>keep back,</hi> and detain their Treaſure for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of it ſelf, in what caſe ſoever neceſſity do require the
ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondarily, the ſame is proved by the Law of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>
for the Pope cannot challenge the Treaſure of this Kingdom,
but under the Title of <hi>Alms,</hi> and conſequently under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the <hi>Works of Mercy,</hi> according to the Rule of Charity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But in the Caſe aforeſaid, the Titel of <hi>Alms</hi> ought utterly to
ceaſe; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Right and Title of challenging the Treaſure
of our Realm ſhall ceaſe alſo, in the preſuppoſed neceſſity: For
ſo much as all Charity hath his beginning of himſelf, it were
no work of Charity, but of meer <hi>madneſs</hi> to ſend away the
Treaſures of the Realm unto Foreign Nations, whereby the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57857:16"/>
Realm it ſelf may fall into Ruine, under the pretence of ſuch
Charity. It appeareth alſo by this, that Chriſt the Head of
the Church, whom all Chriſtian Prieſts ought to follow, lived
by the <hi>Alms</hi> of Devout Women, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 8. He hungred and
thirſted, he was a Stranger, and many other Miſeries he ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
not only in his Members, but alſo in his own Body, as the
Apoſtle witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. He was made <hi>poor for your ſakes,
that through his Poverty you might be made rich,</hi> whereby in the
firſt <hi>endowing</hi> of the Church, whatſoever he were of the Clergy
that had any Temporal Poſſeſſions, he had the ſame by form of
a <hi>perpetual Alms,</hi> as both Writings and Chronicles do witneſs.</q>

                  <q>Whereupon St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> in his ſecond Book to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that
he could not challenge any Secular Dominion by Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
as being the Vicar of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> writeth thus: That if
St. <hi>John</hi> ſhould ſpeak unto the Pope himſelf, as <hi>Bernard</hi> doth
unto <hi>Eugenius,</hi> were it to be thought that he would take it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently?
But let it be ſo, that you do challenge it unto you by
ſome other way or means; but truly, by any Right or Title
Apoſtolical, you cannot ſo do: For how could he give unto you
that which he had not himſelf? That which he had, he gave
you, that is to ſay, Care over the Church; but did he give you
any Lordſhip or Rule? Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(ſaith he) <hi>as the Lords in the Clergy, but behaving your ſelves as
Examples to the Flock.</hi> And becauſe thou ſhalt not think it to
be ſpoken only in Humility, and not in Verity, mark the Word
of the Lord himſelf in the Goſpel, <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles
rule over them, but thou ſhalt not do ſo.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Here Lordſhip and Dominion is plainly forbidden to the
Apoſtles, and dareſt thou then uſurp the ſame? If thou wilt be
a <hi>Lord,</hi> thou ſhalt loſe thine <hi>Apoſtleſhip;</hi> or if thou wilt be an
Apoſtle, thou ſhalt loſe thy <hi>Lordſhip;</hi> for truly thou ſhalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the one of them. If thou wilt have both, thou ſhalt
loſe both, or elſe think thy ſelf to be of that number, of whom
God doth ſo greatly complain, ſaying, <hi>They have Reign'd, but
not through me; they are become Princes, and I have not known it.</hi> Now if it
do ſuffice to Rule with the Lord, thou haſt thy Glory, but not with God;
but if we will keep that which is forbidden, let us hear what is ſaid: He
that is the Greateſt among you, (ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi>) ſhall be made as the <hi>leaſt;</hi>
and he which is Higheſt, ſhall be as the Miniſter; and for Example, ſet a
<hi>Child</hi> in the midſt of them, ſo this then is the true form and inſtitution of
the Apoſtle's <hi>Trade. Lordſhip</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> is forbidden, <hi>Miniſtration</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi>
commanded.—Thus far St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> as cited by <hi>Wickliff</hi> upon

                  <hi>Gregory</hi> being dead, the people of <hi>Rome</hi> flockt to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
preſſing them by all means, that they ſhould chuſe an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>

'twas odds but he would remove the Papal Seat again to <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>

and gives him the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and engages him to be
his Champion. And becauſe this <hi>Charles</hi> had no Money, the
Pope not only ſold to ſeveral of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, the
Proprietaries and <hi>Rights</hi> of many Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the
value of above Fourſcore thouſand Crowns, but alſo expos'd
to ſale the Gold and Silver <hi>Chalices, Croſſes,</hi> and other precious
Ornaments of the Churches and Monaſteries; nay, he made
bold with his <hi>very Gods,</hi> for he melted down many <hi>Silver Images</hi>
of <hi>Saints,</hi> and coin'd them into Money, to pay the Soldiers of

a Man (ſaith the Author) of a <hi>large Conſcience,</hi> and of great

the greater aſſurance we have of the Gentleman's faithful Adherence to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<hi>Supremacy</hi> and the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> the leſs hopes we have of his coming to the
<hi>Imperial Dignity,</hi> or getting ſuch a Senate as will bring our holy Enterprize to
perfection in your Nation.</p>
                     <p>For 'tis diffus'd as a <hi>Maxim,</hi> and generally receiv'd, That no <hi>reſolv'd Papiſt</hi>

(between <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Salerno</hi>) a place no leſs

we told you, was with a great Army, enter'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> on the

at the inſtance of Cardinal <hi>Reatino,</hi> their <hi>Eminencies</hi> held

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:57857:22"/>
by the opinions of many Doctors— <q>That if a Pope ſhould
happen to grow negligent, or be found unfit to govern the
the Church, or to be one ſo ſelf-will'd and conceited, as to
refuſe all wholſom Advice, and thereby brought the Church
(St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Bark) into danger, or were ſo ungovernable a
Cockſcomb, That without the counſel of his Cardinals, he
would raſhly do all things according to his own Fantaſy and
Luſt; that then and in ſuch caſe it was lawful to ſubſtitute by
the Election of the Cardinals, ſome fit <hi>Curator</hi> or <hi>Curators,</hi>
(Governours or Guardians) by and with whoſe direction and
advice the Pope ſhould be obliged to manage all affairs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was concluded by the <hi>Conclave,</hi> as you may ſee in the
Hiſtory of <hi>Theodorie a Nyem, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 24. (whoſe Teſtimony is
ſo much the more to be valued, for that he was Secretary to this

they conclude him ſuch a <hi>Natural,</hi> as to need <hi>Managers</hi> and
<hi>Guardians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the truth is, How much a <hi>Sot</hi> ſoever he were, he prov'd
<hi>too</hi> cunning for them, for having <hi>ſmoakt</hi> their Conſult and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
next time they came (according to Cuſtom) to Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him, he ſeiz'd <hi>ſeven</hi> of the moſt buſie of them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any colour of Law, preſently <hi>confiſcated</hi> all their Eſtates,
and thereby ſo terrified all the reſt, that no man of them durſt
think any more of the <hi>Curatorſhip.</hi> Theſe ſeven that he had
<hi>ſnapt,</hi> he with a Cruelty ſuitable to a <hi>Pope,</hi> thruſt into a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

put them to the <hi>Rack,</hi> and all manner of Tortures, his

his <hi>Captive-Cardinals</hi> under a Guard along with him, and
one of them, broken with Tortures, not being able to follow
him farther, he commanded his <hi>Hangman</hi> to knock out his

Brains, and left his Body in the Fields without <hi>Burial;</hi> the

Monk, whom he gave to King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second of <hi>England</hi>)
Firſt to <hi>Sicily,</hi> and then to <hi>Genua,</hi> and at laſt, that he might not
be troubled with them any longer, he caus'd them (ſaith the
Author) all in one Night to be <hi>beheaded:</hi> But <hi>Platina</hi> ſaith,
they were ſown up in <hi>Sacks,</hi> and ſo flung into the Sea, after the
manner of puniſhing <hi>Parricides</hi> of old, which is probable, ſince
no doubt the Pope would call their Crime <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt their
Spiritual <hi>Father.</hi> But which way ſoever he diſpos'd of them,
all Authors agree, That they were never ſeen afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> dying, the before-mentioned <hi>Charles</hi>
his Son was forc'd to go home thither to ſettle Affairs, where,
by the Treachery of the Queen, he was beheaded, but had
left two Sons, <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> and <hi>John</hi> (Children very young) at
<hi>Ferrara;</hi> whereupon the Pope thirſting after Revenge, and to
wreck his Spleen on theſe two innocent Babes for the Injuries he
pretended to have received from their Father, thinking he had
a fit opportunity, departs from <hi>Genua</hi> to <hi>Lucca,</hi> then to <hi>Sena</hi>
and <hi>Peruſium,</hi> with a deſire, as he pretended, to ſee <hi>Naples,</hi> but
in truth with a deſign to defeat the young Princes of their Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance;
but by the prudence and faithfulneſs of ſome Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
to whoſe Charge they were left, their Lives and Eſtates
were preſerved from his malicious Fury.</p>
               <p>Then he return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made in one day 29 Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
of whom 26 were <hi>Neopolitans.</hi> In the laſt year of his
Popedom, calling to mind of the <hi>vaſt</hi> Gain that the <hi>Jubilee</hi> had
brought to <hi>Clement</hi> the Sixth, in the year 1350. He would
needs (tho againſt all Reaſon, except only that of private <hi>Lucre</hi>)
<hi>abreviate</hi> the Term, and have it kept every 30 years, yet ſo, as
that it ſhould begin at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> Anno Dom. 1388. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a year Incluſive.</p>
               <p>But tho he had laid his <hi>Bait</hi> for Money, yet he did not live to
ſee the Fiſh caught; for being bruis'd by a fall of his Mule as he
was riding to <hi>Peruſium,</hi> he was carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> where after few
days he <hi>died. Paucis admodùm utpote hominis Ruſtici &amp; inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis

wrote a Book in favour of this Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> againſt his Rival <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
as on the other ſide, the Abbot of St. <hi>Vaſt</hi> wrote one for

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> wherein they call each Pope, <hi>Heretic,
Schiſmatic, Tyrant, Thief, wicked ſower of Sedition, Son of Belial,</hi>
and 'tis believ'd they were not either of them much miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> (you have heard) left the <hi>hopeful Crop</hi> of his
intended <hi>Jubilee</hi> to be <hi>reap'd</hi> by his Succeſſor, who was one <hi>Peter
de Thomacellis,</hi> a <hi>Neopolitan,</hi> who was call'd <hi>Boniface</hi> the Ninth;
<hi>Ignorant he was</hi> (ſaith our oft-quoted Author <hi>Theodoric a Nyem,
l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6.) of <hi>writing</hi> and <hi>ſinging,</hi> and ſo unfit for Adminiſtration
of the Affairs of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that whilſt he lived, he
<hi>hardly underſtood the Propoſitions made before him by the Advocates
in Conſiſtory,</hi> in ſo much, that in his time, <hi>Inſcitia ferè venalis
fuit in ipſa Curiâ</hi> 
                  <q>Ignorance was almoſt buyable</q> (as a main
ſtep to preferment) in the <hi>Roman</hi> Court. Yet in all kind of
<hi>Simony,</hi> ſo far he excell'd all his Predeceſſors, that not <hi>one</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
or Biſhop was promoted, without extorting great Sums of
<hi>Money</hi> from them. And indeed ſuch an unreaſonable <hi>Griper</hi>
had <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> before found him, (who only for his Perſonage and
goodly <hi>Stature,</hi> had from a <hi>Vagabond</hi> Clerk preferr'd him to be
a <hi>Cardinal</hi>) That he, for <hi>meer ſhame,</hi> was about to <hi>degrade</hi> him,
if he had not been prevented by Death.</p>
               <p>Of this godly Gentleman's Invention (as ſome Authors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
were the payments to the Pope, call'd <hi>Annates;</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which, it may not be wide of our <hi>mark</hi> to inform the <hi>vulgar
Reader,</hi> what by that <hi>word</hi> is underſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Annates</hi> (deriv'd from <hi>Annus,</hi> a year) are no other than (<hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiae</hi>)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57857:23"/>
the <hi>firſt Fruits,</hi> or profits of every Spiritual Living for one
year, to be paid by the Parſon that is inveſted in it, at his firſt
entrance thereupon; and near of <hi>Kin</hi> hereunto are <hi>Decimae,
Tenths,</hi> (take it in a ſtrict ſenſe) <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Tenth part</hi> of the
firſt Fruits, or of one years value of all Spiritual Livings, and
theſe were anciently paid to the Popes, not only in <hi>England,</hi> but
throughout the Weſtern parts of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> for the Pope as
<hi>Paſtor paſtorum,</hi> claim'd <hi>Decimas decimarum,</hi> and that <hi>Jure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino</hi>
too, (tho never thought of 'till about, or ſome ſmall time
before, this year 1399.) by Example (forſooth!) of the Jewiſh
<hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> who (<hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 16.) was to have <hi>Tenths</hi> from the
<hi>Levites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But tho <hi>Jure Divino</hi> (as in many other caſes of Clergy-cheats)
were the <hi>Gloſs,</hi> yet <hi>Intereſt</hi> was the <hi>Text;</hi> for <hi>Polydere Virgil</hi>
(one of the Pope's own <hi>Publicans,</hi> or <hi>Peter-pence</hi> Collectors)
is not ſhy to inſinuate, <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 2. (tho he refers them to a more
ancient Original) That the firſt Riſe of them was for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Pope's <hi>Grandeur,</hi> and that this Income was one of
the faireſt Flowers in the Triple Crown: But when once the
payment of them had continued ſome competent time, it was
politickly done upon any queſtioning of the Right to refer them
to a <hi>Divine Original,</hi> which was ſure to ſatisfie ſuch, as uſed (in
thoſe times) to take the Pope's <hi>bare word</hi> for far greater matters.</p>
               <p>Yet the payment of theſe, with others, ſo much impoveriſht
the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> (for we are willing to ſum up all <hi>here</hi>
that we have to ſay, occaſionally on <hi>this</hi> matter) that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
ſuch Allegation of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> the ancient Kings of
<hi>England</hi> made <hi>no</hi> ſcruple ſometimes to forbid the payment of
them; as King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third once diſcharg'd the Pope's
<hi>Nuncio</hi> from Collecting the firſt Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were granted againſt the Pope's Collectors, on Complaints
made by the aggriev'd <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> as appears in my
Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Juriſdiction of Courts, <hi>c.</hi> 14. and ſeveral Statutes,
where it is termed once an <hi>horrible Miſchief, and damnable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom;</hi>
and another time 'tis call'd <hi>a very Novelty;</hi> ſee the Acts,
2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1. and 1. <hi>R.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>But ſo <hi>ſubtle</hi> was the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that when ſometimes
the Kingdom complain'd of theſe Burthens, and withall, the
Kings in Exigencies preſs'd for <hi>aids</hi> from their Subjects, they
would in a <hi>frolic of Bounty</hi> yield or aſſign the Firſt-Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:57857:24"/>
for a certain time (a year or more) to the King, whereby they
both <hi>inur'd</hi> the People to the payment, and the Prince to the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi>
of it.</p>
               <p>But in the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, they were given to the
<hi>King</hi> and his Heirs and Succeſſors for ever; and in the 32<hi>d</hi> of
his Raign, a particular Court was erected for recovering them,
which being diſſolv'd in the firſt of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the thing was
<hi>reviv'd</hi> again by 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 4. but the <hi>Court</hi> not reſtored, only
the Firſt-Fruits were order'd to be within the Rule and Adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and a new Officer, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
erected of the Firſt-Fruits and Tenths of the Clergy, who
both taketh all <hi>Compoſitions</hi> for them, and maketh out Proceſs
againſt ſuch as make default in payment. So that every Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
perſon muſt <hi>pay,</hi> or ſecure by Bond, his Firſt-Fruits, before
his actual <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of his Benefices, which Bond is of like force
with a <hi>Statute-Staple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The mode of Compoſition now, is for the Parſon with Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to enter into four Bonds, each condition'd for payment of
the fourth part of the Firſt Fruits, (according to the rate of his
Living, as it was Taxed, <hi>anno</hi> 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. (for that's the Standard)
which is call'd, being <hi>ſo much in the King's Books,</hi> but yet with a
deduction of <hi>Tenths</hi>) the firſt Bond payable at half a years end,
the ſecond at a Twelve months end, the third at a year and half's
end, and the laſt at the expiration of two years.</p>
               <p>This we thought fit to add, out of the Reſpect we have to the
<hi>young Clergy</hi> that are hankering after <hi>Benefices,</hi> to whom this
Diſcourſe at leaſt (whatever our other <hi>Writings</hi> (through ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

Language and termes of Reſpect, <hi>For he is a Civil

'twill be no difficult matter to perſwade you to alter this <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To maintain his <hi>ill-acquired</hi> Soveraignty, he grievouſly <hi>fleec'd</hi>
the Clergy with Subſidies and Exactions; But to make them
part of amends, gave them leave to Extort what they could
from the Laiety; He likewiſe Re-edified the Caſtle of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi>

               <p>You heard before how his Predeceſſor <hi>

the <hi>Money</hi> that accrewed thereby, amounting to a vaſt Sum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But Ten years after, when the year 1400. began to approach,
(which was the year on which the <hi>Jubilee</hi> ſhould cuſtomarily
be kept, as being the Fiftieth year,) He pretended, that what
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> did was Irregular; and therefore he muſt have it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
kept according to the Original Inſtitution: ſo here
were two <hi>Jubilees</hi> held in a dozen years ſpace.</p>
               <p>But a little before the beginning of the ſaid year, <hi>Boniface</hi>
ſubtlely removes to <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> pretending to ſtay there for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time; this Alarm'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> fearing leaſt by reaſon
of his abſence whoſe Buſineſs it was to give the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> the
great <hi>Jubilee</hi> would not be kept at <hi>Rome,</hi> or at leaſt not ſo much
frequented, and ſo they ſhould loſe the <hi>profit</hi> of the Solemnity:
whereupon, they very humbly <hi>Petition</hi> him to return to the
Mother-City. But he had another Game to play, and therefore
they more Intreat, the more Coy he ſeems, and upbraids them
with their Diſreſpectful Carriage, and expreſſes much Averſion
to the City; particularly he Charges them with that they had
refuſed to take Senators at his Nomination, and that of their
own humour they had appointed certain Magiſtrates called

but likewiſe to give the <hi>Pope</hi> a great ſum of Money, which
making <hi>all friends,</hi> he comes to <hi>Rome,</hi> and thence forwards
Rul'd them at his Arbitrary pleaſure as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>We are Arrived at the Year 1400. and the Great <hi>Jubilee</hi> is

Tells us more at large, <q>That innumerable Strangers out of
diverſe Provinces and Kingdoms came thither, and exceeding
rich <hi>Offerings</hi> were preſented to the <hi>Churches</hi> of the City and
Shrines of Saints, the greater part of which came to the hands
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57857:27"/>
of <hi>Boniface</hi> and others that were his Creatures; and yet the
inſatiate Wretch, not Content with theſe voluntary Preſents,
although they amounted to an incredible Sum, yet (being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a <hi>bottomleſs Gulf,</hi> and in Covetouſneſs, none like him,)
ſent his <hi>Money-Huckſters,</hi> or petty Chapmen abroad into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Kingdoms to ſell Indulgences to any that would give as
much for them as it would coſt them to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to fetch
them. The cunning Extortioners <hi>chous'd</hi> ſimple and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
People of vaſt Sums of Money, ſo that by this <hi>Spiritual
Pedlery</hi> they ſometimes brought away clear out of one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or Province more than an hundred thouſand Crowns,
for they would undertake to <hi>forgive all Sins</hi> to all Men that
would pay them, and that too barely on <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
any <hi>Pennance;</hi> for money they Diſpenc'd with all Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities,
ſaying, they had all the Power ſo to do, that Chriſt
had given to <hi>Peter</hi> of binding and looſing on Earth; and by
this means theſe Chapmen being well fatted, returned back
to <hi>Rome</hi> with many fair Horſes, and loaden with Treaſures, and
gave an Account of all their Collections to <hi>Boniface,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was ſo exact and ſevere, that if he detected any fraud
or concealment, he puniſht it with Death.</q> Thus far <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric.</hi>
—Nay <hi>Platina</hi> himſelf relates, That in this <hi>Popes</hi> time, <hi>plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Indulgences were every where ſold ſo cheap, that the Authority
of the Keys and Apoſtolical Letters grew Contemptible; and that</hi>
Boniface <hi>Indulging too much his kindred,</hi> [perhaps from hence we
may date the miſchiefs of the <hi>Nepotiſmo</hi>] <hi>many Simoniacal Acts
were Committed.</hi> And (for a third Evidence) <hi>Crantzius,</hi> l. 11.
ca. 10 and 12. teſtifies, That under <hi>his Popedom were made many
and frequent Tranſlations of Biſhops, a ſuper-abundance of ſuch
kind of Indulgences as were never ſo much as heard of before; and
what he eaſily granted, he as ſlightly revok'd, cauſing himſelf to be
generally ill ſpoken of throughout all Chriſtendom, as one never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied

could fall into ſuch troubles, and be bewildred in them ſo
long: but ſure this was a wound Inflicted by the Almighty to
admoniſh the Clergy in what exceſs and ſuperfluity they lived.
But none took notice of theſe Divine warnings, being all blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

there came down from the <hi>Alps</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> the year before the
Jubilee, a certain Prieſt attended with a great Multitude of

of each Sex; who being cloathed with white Linnen without
any diſtinction whether Men or Women, Clowns or Citizens,
Free-men or Slaves, marcht about the Countty, and like Beaſts,
where Night over-took them, there in the open fields they took
their natural Repoſe. In the Villages they publickly eat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
bringing forth their Victuals as to a ſacred Feaſt; the

that happen'd, all the Company fell a mourning and lamenting,

fearing greater miſchiefs, they are content to receive the Pope,
and invite him back to the City, who then created ſeveral Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the public: And the
rather was this to be expected from him, ſince at his <hi>Election</hi>
he had <hi>promiſed</hi> to lay down, whenſoever things ſhould be adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
with <hi>Rome.</hi> In order to which, he aſſur'd him, That <hi>that</hi>
Pope which ſhould be made in <hi>Rome</hi> after <hi>Innocent,</hi> ſhould do
the like; every one concluding, That if thoſe <hi>Favourites</hi> (one
of <hi>France,</hi> and tother of <hi>Italy</hi>) were but once diſpoſſeſs'd of
the <hi>Keys,</hi> which they both exercis'd at that time, (tho ſure
one of their Keys at leaſt muſt needs be but a <hi>Picklock</hi>) and a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57857:30"/>
third <hi>indifferent perſon</hi> choſen, he would every where be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
the certain and undoubted Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Benedict</hi> gave them the hearing, but gravely anſwer'd, <q>That
he (alas good Man!) valued not the <hi>honour,</hi> and was weary
of the <hi>trouble,</hi> but could not, without offending God, conſent
to the Propoſals, for renouncing the Church, and abandoning
the Flock of Chriſt, which by the common conſent of ſo
many good and worthy Electors, was committed to his <hi>cure</hi>
and <hi>cuſtody,</hi> and was unwilling to bring a thing into queſtion,
which he had ſo <hi>legally</hi> obtain'd. But as for what reſpected
the removal of the <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and reſtoring Concord to the
Church, there was nothing which he more paſſionately deſired;
and he would condeſcend to any <hi>Aſſembly</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> for the
debating or ſetling thereof, provided in a ſecure place in which
every one might ſpeak his mind freely: For his own part he
declar'd, and <hi>ſwore</hi> to it too, That in caſe the Schiſm could
not be taken away by any other means, he would <hi>Renounce,</hi>
upon condition the other at <hi>Rome</hi> would do the ſame, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it would be to no purpoſe to ſolicit it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The three Princes were not ſo ſhort-ſighted as not to ſee
through <hi>Benedict</hi>'s <hi>Veil of Hypocriſie,</hi> and how loth he was to
quit the Chair; and he on the other ſide apprehending, leſt they
ſhould make uſe of more powerful Arguments of <hi>Force</hi> to
oblige him to comply with their Requeſts, fortified himſelf in
his Palace, and was beſieg'd there for five or ſix Months, 'till
being weary of ſo cloſe and tedious a Confinement, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
on certain Gallies on the <hi>Rhoſn,</hi> and ſo eſcap'd into <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi>
which was his own Country: And indeed many ſuppoſe
the before-mention'd Princes were inſtigated by the <hi>French</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
to get him remov'd chiefly for that reaſon, becauſe he was
a <hi>Catalonian,</hi> not a <hi>French-man,</hi> and that they might bring in
one of their own Country-men to ſucceed him.</p>
               <p>Upon the death of <hi>Innocent,</hi> which happen'd in <hi>November,</hi>
1406. the <hi>Italian</hi> and other Cardinals which were at <hi>Rome,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into the <hi>Conclave,</hi> and all ſolemnly <hi>ſwore upon the Holy
Evangeliſts,</hi> which their <hi>Dean</hi> held in his hand, That every of
them reſpectively would, if he were choſen, <hi>renounce the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
provided the</hi> French <hi>or</hi> Catalonian <hi>Anti-pope renounc'd his
Anti papacy firſt.</hi> This was done to ſatisfie the <hi>French,</hi> who
having brought up a cuſtom of <hi>Pope-making,</hi> according to their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57857:31"/>
own mode, it ſeem'd an unſurmountable difficulty to bring
them out of it, with Reputation, unleſs the <hi>Italians</hi> would thus
meet them half way. At laſt in the Conclave at <hi>Rome, Angelo
Corraro</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> and Cardinal of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> was choſen, and
aſſumed the name of <hi>Gregory the</hi> 12<hi>th.</hi> And to make (as they
thought) ſure work, before he came out of the Conclave, they
made him promiſe in Writing under the hand of a Public No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
and alſo gave him his <hi>Oath,</hi> to perform the fore-mention'd
Condition.</p>
               <p>But (<hi>ſee the Faith of Popes!</hi>) no ſooner was he ſetled in his
<hi>Pontificial Gears,</hi> but he found too much <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> in the place to
leave it ſo eaſily; and indeed in this matter only, his Brother
Anti-pope were <hi>well agreed,</hi> for he too, notwithſtanding his
ſaid ſolemn Promiſe, did not care for leaving the <hi>Seat of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
and ſo each of them ſhuffled and cut about the <hi>place</hi> of
<hi>Congreſs,</hi> and whatever Town was nam'd, the other ſide wanted
not Objections, and ſo no Agreement was like to ſucceed.
Whereupon the Cardinals finding themſelves <hi>ſhamm'd,</hi> declar'd
againſt them both as <hi>Faith breakers,</hi> and unfit for the Holy Chair.
And now the Cardinals of the <hi>French</hi> Faction reſolv'd to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<hi>Benedict,</hi> and the <hi>Italians, Gregory;</hi> and to get another
indifferently choſen. In order hereunto, the Cardinals both of
<hi>Avignion</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> met at <hi>Piſa,</hi> and by common conſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
both <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Benedict,</hi> all the Nations (except <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi>
and the <hi>Scots,</hi> and ſome few petty Princes) concurring with
them therein; and having ſo done, they proceed to elect a new
Pope, and make choice of <hi>Peter Philargo</hi> a Fryar Minor, and
Archbiſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> who took upon him the name of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
the Fifth,</hi> who was wont to ſay, he had been a <hi>rich Biſhop,</hi>
a <hi>poor</hi> Cardinal, and a <hi>beggarly</hi> Pope.</p>
               <p>But for all this Decree of the <hi>folks</hi> at <hi>Piſa,</hi> the two old ones
would ſtill be Popes, alledging, That the Convention at <hi>Piſa,</hi>
was neither a free nor a general Council, and that Matters
were not there fairly and Canonically Tranſacted, and therefore
they would not abide by their doings, but would appeal to a
general Council: And to ſecure themſelves, <hi>Gregory</hi> fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Romagna,</hi> and ſtay'd ſome time at <hi>Rimini,</hi> where he was
magnificently entertain'd; And as for <hi>Benedict,</hi> he having held
a <hi>Conventicle</hi> in the City of <hi>Perpignan</hi> by the intervention of his
own Friends, retires into the Caſtle of <hi>Paniſchola.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:57857:31"/>
So that now we had no leſs than <hi>three Popes all in view, and at the
ſame inſtant,</hi> for ſtill the condemned Popes deſiſted not from
exerciſing their <hi>Papal</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Functions; they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
<hi>Biſhops,</hi> and created Cardinals, and particularly <hi>Gabriel
Condolmero,</hi> who was afterwards Pope by the name of <hi>Eugenius
the Fourth,</hi> was by <hi>Gregory</hi> made Cardinal at <hi>Lucca.</hi> Now if a
<hi>Succeſſion</hi> from right and lawful Popes and Biſhops be neceſſary,
it muſt be granted, That if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is not ſuch, but
miſerably <hi>interrupted,</hi> vitiated, and confounded by theſe Popes,
of whom no Man can ſay <hi>which</hi> was the <hi>Right,</hi> and yet their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ordinations paſs'd in the crowd, and multiplied no doubt
in time into many <hi>thouſand</hi> Deſcendents, deriving <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>
and <hi>Prieſthood</hi> from this corrupt Fountain, which ſeem indeed
(according to the Notions which theſe Men advance at another
time) to be but ſo many <hi>Nullities:</hi> And yet where is there any
Biſhop or <hi>Prieſt</hi> in all <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>France</hi> that is <hi>Infallibly</hi> ſure, that
he himſelf holds not by the ſame <hi>crackt</hi> Title?</p>
               <p>But to return to the Story—<hi>Alexander</hi> (ſaith <hi>Theodoric a
Nyem</hi>) was one that <hi>lov'd to live delicately, and to drink ſtrong
Wines;</hi> he was wholly rul'd by <hi>Balthazar Coſſa</hi> Cardinal Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
(the moſt profligate Villain that one ſhall read of) who
ſucceeded him by the name of <hi>John the</hi> 24<hi>th.</hi> (or as ſome reckon,
the 23<hi>d</hi>) The ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> died when he had held the Chair
8 or 9 Months, and <hi>Baptiſta Panaetius</hi> of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> a Cardinal, in
his 56<hi>th</hi> Sermon, tells us, That <hi>the ſaid</hi> Balthazar <hi>caus'd him to
be poiſon'd by</hi> Marſilius de Parma <hi>his Phyſician, brib'd thereunto
with a vaſt ſum of Money,</hi> on purpoſe that he himſelf might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him in his Papacy.</p>
               <p>And how the ſaid <hi>Balthazar</hi> got it at laſt, as to the <hi>manner,</hi> is
very <hi>pleaſant;</hi> for as ſoon as <hi>Alexander</hi> was dead, being at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi>
and having by his former Adminiſtration got the <hi>chief
Power</hi> into his hands, he commanded the Cardinals to Elect a
Pope ſuch as he might approve of; and they offer'd ſeveral to
him, of whom he thought none fit enough: At laſt they reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
plainly to ſhew who he was for? <hi>Give me</hi> (then ſaith he)
<hi>the Cloak of St.</hi> Peter, (a Garment which they fling upon the
new elected Pope) <hi>and I will give it to him that ſhall be Pope:</hi>
Which being done, he put it on his own ſhoulders, and ſaid,
<hi>Papa ego ſum, It is I am Pope;</hi> and was as good as his word:
For tho ſeveral of the Cardinals mutter'd and grumbled, yet
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57857:32"/>
none durſt oppoſe him. This Prank of his is credibly related
by <hi>Johannes Stella,</hi> in his Book <hi>De Pontificibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To fix himſelf firm in his Seat, he courts <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> and gets him elected Emperour, and ſummons a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at <hi>Rome,</hi> where a very <hi>odd</hi> accident fell out, which <hi>Nicholas
Clemangis</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> a Man famous in thoſe times,
delivers as follows— <q>At the firſt meeting of the Council,
Maſs being ſaid after the accuſtomed manner to invocate the

of Calamity, with an horrible voice flew over their heads, and
ſeated her ſelf upon the middle Beam of the Church, with her
Eyes directly fixt upon the Pope. Behold, ſaid ſome of the
lewd <hi>Italian</hi> wits, the Spirit in the form of an <hi>Owl! Balthazar</hi>
the Pope himſelf ſeeing how ſhe glar'd at him, at firſt bluſht
for ſhame, then began to ſweat, and by and by in confuſion
broke up the Council. And at the ſecond Seſſion ſhe was
there again in the ſame manner, and the Pope would have drove
her away by noiſe and clamours, but ſhe would not stir, 'till
aſſaulting her with Pikes and Staves; having receiv'd ſeveral
blows, ſhe fell down dead before them all.</q>

into the Popedom you have heard; nor have you I hope
forgot, that at the ſame time there were actually Reigning two
other <hi>Popes</hi> or <hi>Popelings,</hi> viz. <hi>Gregory,</hi> whom the <hi>French</hi> ſet up,
and <hi>Benedict,</hi> whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſupported; and each of theſe
had his Court, and his Cardinals, and Princes, and Nations that
own'd his Authority and obey'd him. But growing weary of
this ridiculous Confuſion, and the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> having
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57857:34"/>
taken the pains to Travel almoſt all over Europe, to perſuade
them to ſome expedient for healing this <hi>Schiſm:</hi> It was at laſt
agreed, That a <hi>General Council</hi> ſhould be call'd, nor did Pope
<hi>John</hi> ſeem much to oppoſe it, hoping to get himſelf confirm'd
therein by the Intereſt of <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> whom he had procured to
be made Emperour, and you know <hi>one good turn deſerves another;</hi>
but whether the Emperour found him ſo ſcandalouſly <hi>flagitious</hi>
that he was aſham'd to appear in his favour, or whether his
ſolicitations could not be heard I know not, ſo it was, that in the
Concluſion things fell out quite contrary to his Expectation.</p>
               <p>The place agreed upon (after much <hi>bandying</hi>) for this <hi>Congreſs</hi>

Crimes</hi> both before and during his Popedome; the Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him was contained in 54 Articles, of ſeveral Murders,
Poyſonings, Sacrilege, Hereſy, Tyranny, Simony, Infidelity,

That he had cauſed Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> his predeceſſor to be
<hi>Poyſon'd,</hi> to make way for himſelf to uſurp the Papacy. That
he had ſold many Lands of the Churches <hi>Patrimony,</hi> yea he had
ſold <hi>Churches themſelves</hi> in the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> Nay their very
Holy <hi>Reliques,</hi> as for Example he had truck'd away the Head of
St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> for 50000 Ducates [For my part I wonder
where he found out ſuch a <hi>ſilly Chapman</hi> that would offer half
the Money for a forg'd Skull] which had been deliver'd and
carried out of the Nunnery of St. <hi>Sylveſter</hi> where 'twas kept,
if ſome Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> had not diſcover'd it, and ſtopt it by
force; for which he caſt them into Priſon and fined them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully:
That he had Conferr'd Benefices and Eccleſiaſtical
Charges upon his <hi>Baſtards,</hi> and meer Children not above <hi>Five
years old.</hi> That to fill up the meaſure of his wickedneſs by the
perſuaſion of the Devil he obſtinately ſaid, affirm'd and held an
opinion, That <hi>there is no Life Eternal,</hi> or future Exiſtence
after this Life: Yea he ſaid and obſtinately believed, <hi>That the Soul

of Man dyeth and is Extinct, together with the humane Body after
the manner of bruit Beaſts, and that he had ſaid and declared,
That being once dead, even in the laſt day there ſhould be no Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
Theſe and many other the like Crimes being fully proved
againſt him, and he being allow'd liberty, not being able to
make any tollerable <hi>defence</hi> for himſelf, but on the contrary
being Convicted by the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of his own mouth, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to pronounce a definitive Sentence againſt him; That he

following Canon.</p>
               <q>That a Synod Congregated in the Holy Ghoſt making a
general Council, repreſenting the whole Catholick Church
here militant, hath power immediately from Chriſt. To
which power of theirs every Perſon of what State or Dignity
ſoever he be, even tho it be the Pope himſelf, ought to be
obedient in all ſuch things as concern the general Reformation
in the Church, as well in the Heads, as in the Subjects.</q>
               <p>And the ſaid Sentence being ſent to <hi>John,</hi> he himſelf (our
Authors ſay) approved thereof and declared, that he <hi>deſerv'd</hi> it,
and ſo was Depoſed after he had been a Pope 5 years and 15
days. After which he was for ſome years kept Priſoner, but
at laſt in the time of Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> who ſucceeded him
for a great ſum of Money, got not only his Liberty, but alſo to
be made a Cardinal of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and in that quality died in the
year 1419.—And there's an end of <hi>quondam</hi> Pope <hi>John.</hi>
And now 'tis time to ſee what our <hi>Holy Council</hi> does with the
two other <hi>Imps of Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Gregory</hi> the 12<hi>th.</hi> he being abandon'd by <hi>Ladislaus</hi>
King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſeeing it was impoſſible for him to <hi>ſtem the tide</hi>
of oppoſition, thought it would be more Honourable for him
to ſeem to part with his pretended <hi>Popedome freely</hi> of his own
accord, than to be turn'd out; And ſo ſends <hi>Charles Malateſta</hi>
his <hi>Proctor,</hi> to make a Renunciation for him, who to perform the
<hi>Pageantry,</hi> came into the Council all arraid in the <hi>Pontifical</hi> Robes,
and was ſeated in the Chair of ſtate, wherein <hi>Gregory</hi>'s name, he
ſolemnly Renounces the Papacy, and in token thereof, pulls of
all his <hi>Trinkets decently and in order,</hi> which ſo pleaſed the <hi>Reverend
Gray beards,</hi> that they preſently made <hi>Gregory</hi> Legate of <hi>Piſa.</hi>

But the third Gamſter, ſtout <hi>Benedict</hi> defies the People at
<hi>Conſtance</hi> and all their works. He ſwears he is Chriſts Viccar,
I marry is he, and ſo he will continue, in ſpight of their Teeth.
He ſays, <hi>Conſtance</hi> is not a place <hi>fit or free,</hi> and therefore none
of his Subjects ſhall come there.</p>
               <p>However the Synod at <hi>Conſtance, Cite and cite</hi> him again and

contemning their Authority, but thundring out <hi>Curſes,

of Excomunication.</p>
               <p>But all this would not do, for tho almoſt all his Conſorts of

<hi>Wickliff</hi> had reviv'd in the World. For King <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's
firſt Wife, being <hi>Ann</hi> the Daughter of the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> the 4th. and Siſter to the Emperour <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> a <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian</hi>
by Birth, diverſe of her Country-men follow'd her into
<hi>England,</hi> whom ſome becoming Students at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where
<hi>Wickliff</hi> then flouriſht, they were not only hearers of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but carried when they went away, ſeveral of his Books
home with them into their own Country, as theſe <hi>de Realibus
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalibus, de Civili Jure &amp; Divino, de Eccleſiâ, de queſtionibus
variis contra clerum,</hi> &amp;c. It chanc'd about the ſame time, a
Noble Man of the City of <hi>Prague</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> had founded a
great Church Dedicated to <hi>Matthias</hi> and <hi>Matthew,</hi> but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call'd <hi>Bethlem,</hi> Endowing it with large Revenues, for
two <hi>Preachers</hi> every day (Holy day or Working day) throughout
the year. Of theſe two Preachers <hi>John Hus</hi> was one, a Perſon
of great <hi>Learning</hi> in thoſe times, and of excellent <hi>Wit;</hi> but
eſpecially reverenc'd by the People for his blameleſs life <hi>and holy
Converſation.</hi> He happening on ſome of theſe <hi>Books of Wickliffs,</hi>
was preſently convinc'd of the Truth of them, and began to
defend the ſame, not only in the <hi>Schools,</hi> but likewiſe in his
Sermons. At this the Pope and Clergy were mightily <hi>nettled,</hi>
and wrot Letters to the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to puniſh him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was for ſome time <hi>Baniſht</hi> the City of <hi>Prague,</hi> but the
People murmuring that he was unjuſtly dealt withall, and the
King himſelf not finding in him any Crime, he was reſtor'd;
and this general Council coming on, to purge his Teritories
from the ſcandalous ſuſpition of being infected with <hi>Haereſy;</hi>
the Emperour who then was <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the 4th.

Given at <hi>Spire</hi> the 18th. of <hi>Octob.</hi> in the year of our Lord, 1414.</p>
               <p>On the 3d. of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1414. <hi>Hus</hi> came into <hi>Conſtance,</hi> of which
two Noble Men of his Countrey gave notice to Pope <hi>John,</hi>
deſireing his Protection, who promiſed the ſame very freely,
adding that if <hi>Hus</hi> had kill'd his Brother; yet no outrage nor
hurt ſhould be done him in that place.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this he had not been there a Month before they
ſeized upon him, and put him in a baſe and loathſom Priſon, and
this too, before his cauſe was heard in the Council.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of the Articles at laſt exhibited againſt him,
was as follows:</p>
               <p>1. That he had taught Error and Heriſy about the Sacraments
of the Church, and eſpecially about the Sacrament of the Body
of Chriſt, ſaying that it ought to be Miniſtred in both kinds,
and that after the words of Conſecration pronounc'd there ſtill
remaineth material Bread in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>2. He doth Err as touching the Church, for that he doth not
allow and admit that the Church ſignifieth the Pope, Cardinals,
Archbiſhops and Clergy, but ſaith this ſignification was drawn
from the Schoolmen.</p>
               <p>3. That he hath ſaid, That Tempral Princes and Lords may
take away the Temporal poſſeſſions of the Church and Clergy,
without any offence.</p>
               <p>4. He teacheth that all Prieſts are of like power, and therefore
affirms, That the reſervations of the Popes Caſualties, the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57857:39"/>
ordering of Biſhops and the Conſecration of the Prieſts were
invented only for Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p>5. That he erreth concerning the Church, foraſmuch as
through Contempt, he doth not fear Excommunication.</p>
               <p>6. He erreth by holding, That a Man being once Ordain'd
a Prieſt or a Deacon, cannot be forbidden from the Office of
Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe and other the like Articles, the Council proceeded
againſt him in his ſickneſs, and tho he often offer'd to defend
his Cauſe, yet they would neither allow him any Advocats, nor
permit him publickly to be heard. And in their Ninth Seſſion
they declared—<hi>Quod non obſtantibus ſalvis Conductis Imperatoris,
Regum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Poſſit per Judicem competentem de Haeretieâ pravitate
inquiri. That notwithſtanding any ſafe Conduct granted by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
or any Kings, Inquiſition many be made againſt any Man for
Haereſy by a Competent Judge, and proceſs to be made according
to Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To relate the whole proceedings would be too tedious, how
malicious and unjuſt his accuſers were, how ſtout and faithful to
him were ſeveral <hi>Bohemian</hi> Noble Men repreſenting his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to the cruel Fathers, but all in vain, nothing but his Blood
would ſatisfy; and ſo they proceed to paſs the following
ſentence upon him.</p>
               <p>The moſt ſacred General Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> Congregated
together and repreſenting the Catholick Church, for perpetual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the thing. As truth doth witneſs, that an evil Tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth evil Fruit, ſo it cometh to paſs, that the Man of moſt
damnable memory <hi>John Wickliff,</hi> through his peſtiferous Doctrine,
not through Jeſus Chriſt by the Goſpel, as the holy Fathers in times
paſt, have begotten faithful Children, but contrary to the wholeſome
Faith, as a venemous root hath begotten many wicked and peſtilent
Children, whom he hath left behind him ſucceſſors and followers
of his perverſe and accurſed Doctrine, againſt whom this Sacred
Synod of <hi>Conſtance</hi> is forced to riſe up, as againſt Baſtards, and
diligently with a Sharp-knife of Eccleſiaſtical Authority to cut up
Errors out of the Lords field, as moſt hurtful Brambles and Briars
leſt they ſhould grow up to the deſtruction of others. Foraſmuch then
as in the holy General Council lately celebrated at <hi>Rome;</hi> it was
decreed that the Doctrine of <hi>John Wickliff</hi> of moſt damnable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57857:39"/>
ſhould be Condemned, and his Books burnt as Haeretical, yet

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>John Hus</hi> here perſonally preſent in this Sacred Council, not the
Diciple of Chriſt but of <hi>Wicliff,</hi> an Arch Haeretick hath taught
and affirmed the Articles of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> which were Condenm'd by
the Church of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore after diligent Deliberation and full Information,
this moſt Sacred Council declareth and determineth; the Articles
aboveſaid (which are ſound in his Books wrot with his own hand,
and which he hath own'd) not to be Catholick, nor worthy to
be taught but that many of them are erroneous, ſome wicked,
other ſome to be offenſive unto godly Ears, many of them to
be temerarious and ſeditious, and the greater part of them to be
Notoriouſly Haeretical; and doth condemn all and every the
Books which the ſaid <hi>Hus</hi> hath wrot, in what form or phraſe
ſoever they be, or whether they be Tranſlated by others, and
doth decree, That they ſhall be publickly burnt in the preſence
of the Clergy and People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſaid <hi>Synod</hi> doth pronounce the ſaid <hi>John Hus</hi> an
Haeretick, and a Seducer and obſtinate Perſon, and ſuch an
one as doth not deſire to return again to the Lapp of our holy
Mother the Church, neither to abjure the Errors and Hereſies
which he hath openly Preached and defended, wherefore this
moſt Sacred Council decreeth and declares, That the ſaid <hi>John
Hus</hi> ſhall be depoſed and degraded from his Prieſtly Orders and
Dignity.</p>
               <p>Since this ſentence mentions <hi>Degrading,</hi> it will not be amiſs
to conſider the manner how that Ceremony is perform'd: Which
is thus—The party to be degraded is attir'd in all his Prieſtly
Veſtments, and holdeth in the one hand a Chalice filled with
Wine mixed with Water, and in the other a Guilt Paten
with a Wafer. Then kneeling down, the Biſhops Deputy
taking from him theſe Trincats, Charges him to ſay no more
Maſs for the Quick or the Dead: Secondly, ſcraping with a
piece of Glaſs his fingers ends, he Enjoyns him never to Hallow
or Conſecrate any thing, and Thirdly, raſing his ſhaven Crown
and ſtripping <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of his Prieſtly Veſtments, he is Clothed in a
Lay habit, and delivered into the Power of the Secular
Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:57857:40"/>
Thus was poor <hi>Hus</hi> ſerv'd, and withal a <hi>Capp</hi> put on his head
all painted over with <hi>Devils,</hi> and this word <hi>Haeriſiarcha</hi> (or
Ring leader of Hereticks) inſcribed thereon, and ſo was burnt
in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> 1415. He behav'd himſelf at his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
with a wonderful Cheerfulneſs, and ſeems to have had
a Spirit of Prophecy; for whereas <hi>Hus</hi> in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Tongue
ſignifies a <hi>Gooſe,</hi> he told them—<hi>You now roaſt a Gooſe,</hi> but
<hi>after a</hi> 100 <hi>years there ſhall a Swan</hi> riſe up <hi>out of my Aſhes,</hi> which
was fulfill'd in <hi>Luther,</hi> who juſt 100 years after <hi>Hus</hi>'s Death
began to appear in oppoſition to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe during the time of this Council, one <hi>Jerome</hi> a
Learned Godly Man, of the City of <hi>Prague,</hi> hearing of the
manyfold injuries done unto <hi>Hus,</hi> voluntarily came to <hi>Conſtance</hi>
with an intent to defend his Cauſe, but not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
any <hi>ſafe Conduct</hi> there, was returning back again to his
own Country, but taken on the Road and brought bound into
<hi>Conſtance;</hi> and there by the Council Condemn'd and Burnt, and
his Aſhes thrown into the River <hi>Rhyne,</hi> as <hi>Hus</hi>'s likewiſe had
been, ſo Induſtrious were the Romiſh Clergy to deſtroy all
Memorials of theſe faithful Servants of God, whoſe Names do
yet ſurvive all their impotent malice, and remain Regiſtred in
the <hi>Book of Life</hi> in Heaven, and pretious to all good Men on
Earth.</p>
               <p>What eſteem the godly Nobles of that Age had of Mr. <hi>Hus,</hi>
may partly appear by a Letter of 54 Noble Men of <hi>Morauia,</hi>

Cauſes of Hereſie; and conſequently, if the Emperour, or any other

tells us expreſly—Haereticis fides à privato data ſervanda non eſt;
Faith or promiſe made by a private perſon to an Heretick is not to be
kept. And a little after—<hi>Any perſon is bound to reveal an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
to the Inquiſition,</hi> Non obſtante ſide aut Juramento, <hi>the

Pater qui filium habet Haereticum, &amp;c. A Father that has a Son

               <p>According to theſe <hi>Maxims,</hi> 'tis notorious, that the Apoſtate
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Papiſts, have acted; how often have
Popes put Princes upon the breaking of their Treaties, Alliances,
and Covenants? How remarkable is that Story of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> the
fifth King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> about the year 1440. who having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57857:43"/>
a <hi>Peace</hi> with <hi>Amurath</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> for <hi>ten
years</hi> ſpace, and <hi>ſworn</hi> to keep and obſerve the ſame inviolably,
<hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth (who at that time was Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>)
hearing thereof, writes to Cardinal <hi>Julian</hi> then reſident in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
to perſuade the King to break that Peace, alledging and
declaring. That no Peace made with the <hi>Enemies of Religion,</hi>
(and in their eſteem <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are <hi>worſe than Turks</hi>) without
firſt conſulting the Pope, and having his <hi>leave,</hi> was good or valid.
And therefore commanded the King to <hi>fall into Hoſtility,</hi> aſſuring
him, That as for his <hi>Oath</hi> given at the Treaty, he had <hi>diſſolv'd</hi>
the ſame: Hereupon the King, partly by <hi>Intreaties,</hi> and partly
by <hi>Threats,</hi> is prevail'd upon, to become a moſt <hi>perfidious wretch,</hi>
and to the diſhonour of the <hi>Chriſtian name,</hi> treacherouſly to fall
upon the <hi>Turk</hi> at unawares, which <hi>Amurath</hi> obſerving, and
ſeeing his Forces like to be diſcomfited, he draws forth the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Articles</hi> of their League, and looking up to Heaven, cries
out, <hi>Haec ſunt, Jeſu Chriſte! Foedera quae Chriſtiani tui mecum
percuſsêre, per nomen tuum Sanctè Jurantes; Nunc, ſi Deus es,
tuas, meaſque Injurias, te quaeſo, ulciſcere.</hi>—[<hi>Bonfin. l.</hi> 3. <hi>Aenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

<hi>Behold, O Jeſus! theſe are the Covenants which thy Chriſtians ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
ſwearing by thy name, made with me; now therefore if thou
art a God, revenge theſe Injuries to me and thy ſelf, upon their perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
heads.</hi>—And no ſooner had he pronounc'd theſe words,
but the ſucceſs of the Battel was chang'd, the Chriſtians put to
<hi>flight,</hi> and the perjured King, together with the wretched Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
that put him upon't, being both ſlain.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, in the year 1213. in a Letter to
<hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> charges him in <hi>the name of the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi>
and as he expected ever to obtain Divine and Apoſtolical
<hi>Grace,</hi> to abandon the people of <hi>Tholoſe,</hi> (certain honeſt <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſian</hi>
Chriſtians, of whom in our <hi>Third Volume</hi> we have given
an account) nor to afford them any Aid or Countenance as long
as they continued in their Hereſie, <hi>Non obſtante promiſſione vel
obligation quacúnque praeſtitâ: Notwithſtanding any promiſe or
obligation whatſoever</hi> before paſs'd to the contrary.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1538. <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, ſends abroad a Roaring
<hi>Bull</hi> againſt our King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> wherein he admoniſhes and
requires all Chriſtian Princes, That they ſhall not under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<hi>of any Leagues or Obligations,</hi> although corroborated by
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57857:43"/>
frequently repeated <hi>Oathes,</hi> yield the ſaid King directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
any Aid, Favour, or Aſſiſtance; and to take them off
from any apprehenſions of their Duty, pretends to <hi>Abſolve
them</hi> all, from all Oathes or Obligations by them made, or <hi>to
be made;</hi> and pronounces them to be <hi>void</hi> and of none effect.
So likewiſe <hi>Pope Pius Quintus</hi> Abſolv'd not only all the Subjects
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but alſo, <hi>Caeteros omnes qui Illi quomodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque
Juraverunt;</hi> All others who in any manner had ſworn
unto her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After</hi> Henry <hi>the Third of</hi> France <hi>was Barbarouſly Murder'd,
by Frier</hi> Clement, <hi>all the World knew the Right of the Crown
by Lineal</hi> Succeſſion <hi>and Proximity of Blood belong'd to</hi> Henry
<hi>of</hi> Burbon, <hi>but the Popiſh Doctors of the</hi> Sorbon <hi>being intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the People of</hi> Paris <hi>to give their Judgment, whether
it were</hi> Lawful to ſubmit to him? <hi>They anſwered,</hi> That Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
by the Divine Law were forbidden to admit to the Kingdom
<hi>a Sectary</hi> and manifeſt Enemy to the Church; That all that ſhould
Aſſiſt him were guilty of mortal Sin, and would infallibly be
<hi>Damn'd:</hi> And all that did Reſiſt him unto Blood, would dye <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
and enjoy an Everlaſting Reward in Heaven.</p>
               <p>But to prove, That Popiſh Princes who have made never ſo
fair <hi>Promiſes,</hi> did notwithſtanding Perſecute their <hi>Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
with the greateſt Rigour, and act quite contrary to thoſe
<hi>Solemn Engagements,</hi> our Native Iſland affords a ſad, and never
to be forgotten <hi>Precedent;</hi> for when the Men of <hi>Suffolk</hi> upon
the pious King <hi>Edwards</hi> Death, requeſted, that bloody bigotted
and treacherous Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> to know, Whether ſhe would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Religion Eſtabliſh'd in her Brothers days? She aſſur'd
them with all Aſſeverations, That ſhe would <hi>never make any
Innovation</hi> or Change, but be contented with the <hi>private Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi>
of her own Religion. And on <hi>April</hi> the 12<hi>th.</hi> ſhe made
a <hi>Publick Declaration in Council,</hi> That although her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
were fixed in matters of Religion, yet ſhe would <hi>never
Inforce her Subjects, otherwiſe than God ſhould put into their Hearts
a perſuaſion of the Truth ſhe was in.</hi>—But no ſooner was ſhe
ſettled in her Throne, but ſlighting all theſe Engagements, ſhe
no leſs <hi>perfidiouſly</hi> than cruelly, fell to <hi>Burning</hi> her Proteſtant
Subjects, purely for their Religion.</p>
               <p>Nay, do we not at this Inſtant ſee the like Proceedings in our
next Neighbouring Country? where, notwithſtanding many
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57857:44"/>
                  <hi>Edicts</hi> and Solemn Promiſes Ratified, with all the formalities of
Perpetual <hi>Laws;</hi> yet the poor Proteſtants, directly contrary to
all theſe Priviledges, without any colour or ſhadow of Crime,
ſave <hi>only</hi> their Religion, (wherein their Perſecutors deal much
<hi>more Generouſly,</hi> than if with fained Accuſations and damnable
<hi>Subornations:</hi> they ſhould falſly repreſent them as <hi>Rebellious</hi> and
Diſloyal,) are daily haraſs'd, Ruinated and undone.</p>
               <p>Therefore the General Inference from theſe Premiſes is, That
knowing ſo well the Principles and Practiſes of the <hi>Romiſh
Church;</hi> no Proteſtants or men of ſenſe ſhould ever truſt to
any, though never ſo plauſible Promiſes of any perſon of that
Communion: For with ſuch, all the moſt <hi>Sacred Ties,</hi> (beſides

or their <hi>Ghoſtly Fathers</hi> Conveniency ſhall require it.</p>

for Burning of Hereticks.</head>
               <p>WE have purſued the <hi>Papal Hiſtory</hi> beyond the
Seas, down to the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and
burning of <hi>Hus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jerome,</hi> that is, to
about the year of our Lord 1415. which
anſwers to the Third year of the Raign of our King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fifth. 'Twill therefore now be neceſſary to look back and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what Obſervables occurr'd in <hi>England</hi> relating to our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
not already mention'd, during the Raigns of King <hi>Richard</hi>

incens'd Prelates finding their <hi>Spiritual Thunders</hi> unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
them, bethought themſelves to pray in aid of the <hi>Secular
Arm,</hi> and to that purpoſe the King being <hi>young and diſſolute,</hi>
ſo extravagant to his Favourites, that he always wanted Money,
the Biſhops either by fair words, or the Bait of a <hi>Benevolence</hi> to
be given him by the Clergy, prevail'd with him in the Fifth year
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57857:46"/>
of his Raign to conſent to an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of their framing, in
theſe words following.</p>
               <p>For as much as it is openly known, that there be divers evil
perſons within the Realm going from County to County, and
from Town to Town, in certain Habits, under diſſimulation of
great Holineſs, and without the Licenſe of the Ordinaries of the
places, or other ſufficient Authority, preaching daily, not only in
Churches and Church-yards, but alſo in Markets, Fairs, and
other open places, where a great Congregation of people is, divers
<hi>Sermons</hi> containing Hereſies and notorious Errors, to the great
emblemiſhing of the Chriſtian Faith, and deſtruction of the Laws,
and of the Eſtate of the holy Church, to the great peril of the
Souls of the people, and of all the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> as more
plainly is found, and ſufficiently proved before the Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in God the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Biſhops and
other Prelates, Maſters of Divinity, and Doctors of Canon and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Law, and a great part of the Clergy of the ſaid Realm eſpecially
aſſembled for this cauſe; which perſons do alſo preach divers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Slander, to engender Diſcord and <hi>Diſſention</hi> betwixt divers
Eſtatés of the ſaid Realm, as well Spiritual as Temporal, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
of the people, to the great peril of the Realm: Which
Preachers cited or ſummoned before the Ordinaries of the places,
there to anſwer of that, whereof they be impeached, will not obey
to their Summons and Commandments, nor care for their Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
nor Cenſures of the Holy Church, but expreſly deſpiſe them.
And moreover by their ſubtle and ingenious words, do draw the
people to hear their Sermons, and do maintain them in their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
by ſtrong Hand, and great Routs: It is ordained and aſſented
in this preſent <hi>Parliament,</hi> That the King's Edmmiſſions be
made and directed to the Sheriffs and other Miuiſters of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord the King, or other ſufficient perſons Learned, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Certifications of the Prelates thereof to be made in
Chancery from time to time, to arreſt all ſuch Preachers, and alſo
their Faitors, Maintainers, and Abettors, and to hold them in
Arreſt and <hi>ſtrong Priſon,</hi> 'till they will juſtifie them according to
the Law and Reaſon of Holy Church. And the King wills and
commandeth, That the Chancellor make ſuch Commiſſions at
all times, that he by the Prelates or any of them ſhall be certified
and thereof required, as is aforeſaid</p>

This was the firſt pretended Statute that ever was in <hi>England</hi>
for impriſoning Chriſtians for Religious opinions, and by colour
thereof, the Biſhops committed great Cruelties, I call it preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Statute; for tho it be enter'd in the Parliament Rolls, yet it
was no Legal Act, for it never paſs'd the Commons: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at the next Parliament in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term following, the
Commons preferr'd a Bill, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eciting the ſame, and conſtantly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
That <hi>they never aſſented thereunto, and therefore deſired, that
the ſaid ſuppoſed Statute be annull'd, and made void, for they prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
That it was never their intent, that either themſelves, or ſuch
as ſhall ſucceed them, ſhould be farther ſubject, or bound to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
than were their Anceſtors in former times.</hi> And to this the
King gave his Royal Aſſent, in theſe words: <hi>Il plaiſt au Roy,
The King is pleas'd that it be ſo.</hi> Cook, 3 <hi>Inſtit. fo.</hi> 40. Foxes <hi>Acts
and Monuments, fo.</hi> 406.</p>
               <p>But that you may more fully underſtand the fraud and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety
of their Reverences in this Affair, you muſt underſtand,
That before the invention of Printing, the uſual way of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
Acts of Parliament, was to engroſs them in Parchment,
and ſend them with the King's Writ into every County, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the Sheriff to proclaim them. Now <hi>John Braibrook</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> being then Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> he
by a Writ dated 26 <hi>May, Anno Regni Regis R.</hi> 2. <hi>quinto,</hi> ſent down
the before recited Ordinance of the King and Prelates, amongſt
the Statutes that were then lately paſs'd: But no leſs <hi>knaviſhly</hi>
left out in the next Parliamentary Proclamation the ſaid Act of
<hi>Revocation,</hi> whereby the ſaid ſuppoſed Statute was made void,
by which means afterwards the other ſtill paſs'd as an Act, and
was printed continually as ſuch; but the Act that diſannull'd it
was by the Intereſt of the Prelates from time to time kept out
of the <hi>Prints,</hi> the better to give colour to their impriſoning of
the Laity at their pleaſure.</p>
               <p>And farther, to make ſure work, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth having
uſurp'd the Crown, to gratifie the Clergy who had chiefly aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
him therein, in the ſecond year of his Raign, he at their
Inſtigation procured the following <hi>cruel and wicked Law</hi> to be
Enacted, commonly call'd, <hi>The Statute Ex Officio,</hi> which that the
Reader may the better obſerve the Spirit of Popery and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and compare the Times and Actings of Men in paſt and
more modern Times, I hope it ſhall neither be thought tedious
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57857:47"/>
nor unuſeful to recite the ſame at large <hi>Verbatim,</hi> it not being
now extant in <hi>Kceble,</hi> or any of our Common Statute Books.</p>

his ſteps in Miracles and Vertues, living in Humility and a poor

Yoke of our Dominion, unto their Doctrine and Courſe of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
to the great Contempt of our Priſon houſe and Kingdom, and
no ſmall prejudice of our Juriſdiction and Authority, they nothing
dreading to bid defiance to our Forces, and trample upon the Majeſty
of our Eſtate; for then ſcarce did we receive any <hi>Tribute</hi> from the
upper World, neither did the miſerable ſort of common people ruſh
in at the Gates of our deep Dungeon as they were wont to do with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
rapping, but in thoſe days the eaſie, broad, and pleaſant way
which leadeth to Death, was unfrequented, and lay waſt, without

<hi>you</hi> in their ſteads who are the preſent Prelates of the Church, whom

of you—<hi>They have Raigned, but not by me.</hi> Once we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
unto Him <hi>all the Kingdoms of the World,</hi> if he would fall
down and worſhip us; but he would not, ſaying—<hi>My Kingdom is
not of this World,</hi> and went his way when the Multitude would
have made him a Temporal King. But to <hi>You</hi> truly that are fallen
from the ſtate of Grace, and that ſerve us in the Earth, is that my
promiſe fulfill'd, and all Terrene things by the means which we have
beſtow'd upon you, are under your Government. For he hath ſaid of
us ye know—<hi>The Prince of this World cometh,</hi> &amp;c. and he
hath made us to <hi>Raign over all the Children of Unbelief.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Adverſaries before-recited, did patiently ſubmit themſelves

you ſubject to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake:</hi>
And again, <hi>Obey ye them that are made Rulers over you,</hi> &amp;c.
For ſo their Maſters commanded them, ſaying—The Kings of the
Heathen have Dominion over them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I on the contrary think
it long 'till we have poured out our Poiſon upon the Earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fill your ſelves full with the enjoyments thereof; and be you not
only unlike thoſe Primitive Fathers, but alſo clean contrary to them
in your Lives and Conditions. Neither give you to <hi>God</hi> that which
belongeth to him, nor yet to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is his; but exerciſe
you the Power of both the Swords, according to <hi>our Decrees,</hi> making
your ſelves doers in worldly Matters, fighting in our Quarrel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
with <hi>Secular Labours</hi> and Buſineſs; and climb ye by little
and little from the miſerable ſtate of Poverty, unto the higheſt Seats
of all <hi>Honours,</hi> and the moſt Princely places of Dignity by your
deviſed Practiſes, and falſe and deceitful Wiles and Subtlety, that
is, by <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> Flattery, Lying, Perjury, Treaſons, Deceits,
Simony, and other greater Wickedneſs than any which our Infernal
Furies can deviſe. For after that ye have by us been advanced thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
where ye would be, yet that doth not ſuffice you, but as greedy
Stravelings more hungry than you were before, ye oppreſs the Poor,
ſcratch and rake all together that comes to hand, perverting and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
every thing topſy-turvy; ſo ſwoln, that ready ye are to burſt for
<hi>Pride,</hi> living like Letchers in all Corporal Delicateneſs, and by fraud
directing all your doings, you challenge to your ſelves names of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

Holy</hi> perſons.</p>
               <p>Thus either by violence you Ravage, or elſe by ambition, ſubtlely ye

conſuming them as ye your ſelves liſt, and therewith ye cheriſh and
maintain an innumerable ſort of Whores, Strumpets, and Bawds,
with whom ye <hi>ride pompouſly</hi> like mighty Princes, far otherwiſe
going than thoſe poor beggerly Prieſts of the Primitive Church. For
I would ye ſhould build your ſelves rich and gorgeous <hi>Palaces;</hi> that

pleaſanteſt Wines that may be gotten; that ye hoard and heap toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

promiſed unto us by the Prophet, and of thoſe Fathers long ago re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:
Whilſt that Chriſt called thee <hi>Synagogue of Satan,</hi> and
liken'd thee to <hi>the mighty Whore, which committed Fornication
with the Kings of the Earth,</hi> the adulterous Spouſe of Chriſt, and
of a chaſt perſon made a Strumpet. Thou haſt left thy firſt Love,

Multitude flocketh at the ſtrong and well fenced Gates of our Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon;
and doubtleſs ye ſend us ſo many day by day of every ſort and

                  <p>That there was an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> enter'd into by private perſons

that at next Parliament it was confirm'd. Now from that
wholſome Experience, there was ſomething of the ſame kind
propoſed in the Houſe of Commons of the laſt Parliament (but
never deſign'd to be obtruded, without the Concurrence of the
Lords, and the Royal Aſſent). Now this noiſe of Abhorrence
ſeems at bottom not to be levell'd ſo much at the Paper ſaid to be
found in the E. of <hi>Sh</hi>'s Cloſet, as under that name, to vilifie
and expoſe the Proceedings of the <hi>Commons,</hi> and render them

their Eyes and ſee farther than <hi>Popery,</hi> the
Church then, as by Law eſtabliſht, thought

'Tis true, during the Raign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second we
do not find any burnt to Death for the profeſſion of Religion,
but many were impriſon'd, harraſs'd, and in great trouble, and
eſpecially <hi>William Swinderby</hi> a Prieſt, and <hi>Walter Brute</hi> a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
but Learned, and a Graduate of the Univerſity of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
the ſeveral Articles againſt whom, and their Anſwers
thereunto, you may read at large in <hi>Foxes</hi> Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
too tedious here to recite; I ſhall therefore only note,
<hi>That</hi> John Biſhop <hi>of</hi> Hereford <hi>having by ſolemn ſentence denounced
the ſaid</hi> Swinderby <hi>to be an Heretick, Schiſmatick, and a falſe
informer of the People, and to be avoided by all faithful Chriſtians,</hi>
He the ſaid <hi>Swinderby</hi> did thereupon <hi>Appeal</hi> from ſuch the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
Sentence to the King and Council, by an Inſtrument under
his hand, which, both in reſpect of the <hi>Matter,</hi> and of the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſhew me by God's Law, that my Concluſions
or my Anſwers were Errour or Hereſie, I would be amended, and
openly revoke them before all the people; but they ſayden ſingly with
word, That there was Errours in them, and bidden me ſubject me
to the Biſhop, and put me into his Grace, and revoke mine Errour,
and ſhewed me nought by God's Law, ne Reaſon, ne proved which
they weren. And for I would not knowledge me <hi>Guilty,</hi> ſo as I knew
no Errour in them, of which I ſhould, therefore the Biſhop ſate in
<hi>Doom</hi> in mine abſence, and deemed me an <hi>Heretick,</hi> a <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
and a teacher of Errours, and denounced me accurſed, that I
come not to correction of the Church; and therefore for this unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Judgment I appeal to the King's Juſtices for many other Cauſes.</p>
               <p>One Cauſe is, For the King's Court in ſuch matter is above the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's
Court; for after the Biſhop has accurſed, he may not fear by
his Law, but then mote he ſech ſuccour of the King's Law, and by a
Writ of <hi>Significavit,</hi> put a Man in Priſon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Cauſe: For in cauſe of Hereſie there liggeth Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57857:54"/>
of Death, and that doom may not be given without the King's
Juſtices: For the Biſhop will ſay, <hi>Nobis non licet interficere
quenquam;</hi> that is, <hi>It is not lawful for us to kill any man,</hi> as they
ſayden to <hi>Pilate,</hi> when Chriſt ſhould be deemed. And for I think
that no Juſtice will give ſodenly and untrue Doom, as the Biſhop did,
and therefore openly I appeal to hem, and ſend my Concluſions to the
Knights of the Parliament, to be ſhewed to the Lords, and to be
taken to the Juſtices to be well adviſet, or that they given Doom.</p>
               <p>The third Cauſe is, For it was a <hi>falſe Doom;</hi> for no M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n is a
Heretick, but he that <hi>Maſterfully defends</hi> his Errour or Hereſie,
and ſtifly maintains it: And mine Anſwer has always bene Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
as the people openly knows, for ever I ſay, and yet ſay, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
will; that if they cannen ſhew me by <hi>Gods Law</hi> that I have
erret, I will gladly bene amendet, and revoke mine Errours, and ſo
I am no Heretick, ne nevermore in Gods grace will ben en no wiſe.</p>
               <p>The fourth Cauſe is, For the <hi>Biſhop's Law</hi> that they deme Men
by, is full of Errours and Hereſies, contrary to the truth of Chriſt's
Law of the Goſpel. For there as Chriſt's Law bids us <hi>Love our
Enemies,</hi> the Pope's Law gives us leave to <hi>hate</hi> them, and to <hi>ſley</hi>
them, and graunts Men pardon to werren again Heathen Men, and
ſley hem. And there as Chriſt's Law teach us to be merciful, the
Biſhop's Law teachs us to be wretchful; for Death is the greateſt
<hi>wretch</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> mowen done on him that guilty is. There as
Chriſts Law teaches us to <hi>bleſſen</hi> him that <hi>diſeazen</hi> us, and to pray
for him; the Popes Law teacheth us to <hi>Curſe</hi> them, and in their
great ſentence that they uſen, they preſume to <hi>Dam hem to Hell</hi> that
they curſen. And this is afoue Hereſie of Blaſphemy: There as
Chriſt's Law bids us be patient, the Pope's Law juſtifies <hi>two</hi> Swords,
that wherewith he ſmitheth the Sheep of the Church; and he has
made Lords and Kings to ſwear to defend him and his Church. There
as Chriſt's Law forbideth us <hi>Letchery,</hi> the Pope's Law juſtifies the
abominable Whoredom of common Women, and the Biſhops in ſome
place have a great Tribute or Rent of Whoredom. There as Chriſt's
Law bids to miniſter Spiritual things freely to the people, the Pope
with his Law ſells for <hi>Money,</hi> after the quantity of the Gift, as
Pardons, Orders, Bleſſings, and Sacraments, and Prayers, and
Benefices, and preaching to the People, as it is known amongst them.
There as Chriſt's Law teaches <hi>Peace,</hi> the Pope with his Law aſſoiles
Men for money to gader the People, Prieſts and other to <hi>fight</hi> for
his Cauſe. There as Chriſt's Law forbids <hi>Swearing,</hi> the Pope's
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57857:55"/>
Law juſtifies Swearing, and compels men thereto. Whereas Chriſt's
Law teacheth his Prieſts to be <hi>Poor,</hi> the Pope with his Law juſtifies
and maintains Prieſts to be <hi>Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet the fifth Cauſe is, For the Pope's Law that the Biſhops
demen Men by, is the ſame unrightful Law that Chriſt was <hi>demet</hi> by
of the Biſhops with the Scribes and with the Phariſees; for right as
at time they gaven more credens to the two falſe Witneſſes that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
againſt Chriſt, then they deden to all the people that witneſſeden
to his true Preaching and his Miracles: So the Biſhops of the Pope's
Law geven more Leven by their Law to two Hereticks and Apoſtates,
or two <hi>comen Wymen</hi> that woulden witneſſeden againes a Man in
the cauſe of Hereſie, than to thouſands of people that were true and
good. And for the Pope is this Antichriſt, and his Law contrary
to Chriſt's Law, fully I forſake this Law, and ſo I reed all Chriſten
men; for thus by another point of this Law, they mighten conquer
much of this World: For when they can, they by this Law preſent a
a man an Heretick, his Goods ſhulen be forfet from him and his Heirs,
and ſo might they lightly have two or three falſe Witneſſes to Record
an Hereſie again what true man ſo hem liked. Herefore me thinks,
that whatſoever that I am an Chriſten man, I may lawfully <hi>appeal</hi>
from a falſe Dome of the Law, to be Righteo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſly demet by the
trouth of God'd Law. And if this Appeal will n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſerve, <hi>I appeal
openly to by Lord Jeſu Chriſt</hi> that ſhall deme all the World, for he,
I wot well, will not ſpare for no man to deme a trouth. And therefore
I pray God Almighty with <hi>David</hi> in the Sauter Book, <hi>Deus Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium
tuum Regi da, &amp; Juſtitiam tuam Filio Regis, judicare
populum tuum in Juſtitiâ, &amp; pauperes tuos in Judicio:</hi> That is,
<q>O God, give thy Judgment to the King, and thy Juſtice to the King's
Son, to judge thy people in Juſtice, and thy poor ones in Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>What afterwards became of this <hi>Swinderby,</hi> we find not in
Hiſtory; but as for <hi>Walter Brute,</hi> having worried him a long
time, they at laſt prevail'd with him to ſubmit himſelf in a <hi>Scroll</hi>

               <p>I <hi>Walter Brute</hi> ſubmit my ſelf principally to the Evangelie of

               <p>As King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who was the Depoſer of King

               <p>3. That he would rather worſhip the <hi>Bodies of the Saints,</hi> than

               <p>6. That every Prieſt and Deacon is more bound to <hi>preach</hi> the

               <p>The next dying Witneſs to truth was one <hi>John Badby</hi> a Taylor,
of the Dioceſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who was burnt in <hi>Smithfield, Anno</hi>
1409. His only Crime was for aſſerting, That the Sacrament
conſecrated by the Prieſt is <hi>not the very Body of Chriſt, but that
ſtill the Bread remained;</hi> and that when Chriſt ſat at Supper with
his Diſciples, he <hi>had not his Body in his hand,</hi> to the intent to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute
it to his Diſciples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And 'tis remarkable, that when
he came to dye, and was put in a <hi>Tun</hi> or Veſſel, and Fire put to
him, he crying out (to the <hi>Lord,</hi> not to <hi>Men,</hi> as by the Sequel
appear'd) <hi>Mercy, Mercy,</hi> the Prince (King <hi>Henry</hi>'s eldeſt Son)
being preſent, cauſed the Fire to be ſtopt, and made him <hi>large</hi>
Offers, not only of <hi>Life,</hi> but of Preferment too, if he would
change his Opinion; but he with a glorious Conſtancy refuſed
thoſe Temptations, and choſe rather to <hi>Seal the Truth</hi> with his
Blood, than betray it by a baſe Compliance with ſuch worldly
Allurements.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> to confirm his <hi>ill got</hi> Soveraignty, reſolving in all
things to gratifie the Clergy, the Empire of the Pope and his
Party became <hi>ſo ſtrong</hi> in this Realm, that ſcarce any durſt oppoſe
them; the Biſhops having got ſuch an Aſcendant on the King,
and beſides being Arm'd with the <hi>Statute</hi> we formerly recited,
and with additional <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of their own, power of Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
Temporal Sword, Fire, and Fagot, Reigned and Ruled
as uncontroulable; ſo puft up with <hi>Pride,</hi> that they thought all
things ſubject to their extravagant Power, and daily boaſted how
they would utterly extirpate <hi>Hereſie,</hi> (as they call'd the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Truth) out of the Land. And indeed to the Eye of
Humane Reaſon, nothing ſeem'd more eaſie to effect, under ſuch
advantageous Circumſtances. But 'tis the nature of <hi>Truth</hi> to
flouriſh by oppoſition, <hi>Premi poteſt non ſuppremi,</hi> It may be <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,</hi>
but never <hi>ſuppreſt.</hi> All their <hi>kicking</hi> was againſt the <hi>Pricks;</hi>
Providence ſupported <hi>That,</hi> which they with united Councils,
and Force, and Fraud, and Policy, and Power, thought to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
as will appear in the <hi>Sequel</hi> of this Hiſtory. A fair war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

when, how, and in what manner, the Body was found. It might

                  <p>I ſay, That Paper is the perfect Reſemblance, or indeed
a Demonſtration of the whole Genius and Nature of <hi>Popery</hi> in
general, for <hi>what is Popery but Lies and Nonſenſe, obtruded upon
the World with the height of Impudence?</hi> And juſt ſuch is that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The ſhameleſs Author of which oppoſes <hi>Legal Oaths,</hi> and

over and over again with a ridiculous Effrontery things that <hi>half

the Conſtable, who firſt moved the Body, and the Surgeons that
view'd it, and the Maid that waſh'd the Clothes, who have <hi>all
ſworn there was no Blood,</hi> are no competent Witneſſes; and yet

That <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Pacquets are ſtoln.</hi> A charge ſo general and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57857:58"/>
Falſe, that it deſerves no Anſwer, but Contempt or
Pity. But afterwards he comes and Aſſerts, That out of <hi>Foxes
Acts and Monuments,</hi> and the <hi>Magdeburgh Centuries,</hi> I furniſh
this <hi>Weekly Hiſtory.</hi> To this I Reply,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That if any body pretends to give the World an Account
of things Tranſacted Two or three hundred Years or more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
himſelf was Born, 'tis twenty to one, if he will deal like

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He notes ſeveral Paſſages in the Two laſt <hi>Pacquets,</hi>
that are in <hi>Foxe.</hi> 'Tis very true, What then? Do not I there
Cite <hi>Foxe</hi> for them, where is the <hi>Plagiariſm?</hi> I Write to the
Common People, and Publiſh it thus in Succeſſive ſheets, that ſo
it may fall into the more Hands; I pretend, not to Inſtruct the
<hi>Learned,</hi> but to give the Vulgar (ſuch as perhaps never read
<hi>Foxe,</hi> and know nothing of the <hi>Magdeburgh Centuries,</hi>) a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Proſpect of <hi>Popery,</hi> that they may know, and Abhor it:
Thoſe things which in <hi>Foxe</hi> are tediouſly told, I abridge, what
is leſs material I omit, Remarkables I Tranſcribe, and fairly tell
the Reader where I have them: and what <hi>Felony</hi> and <hi>Treaſon</hi>
is there in all this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Why may not I furniſh my Matter from <hi>Foxe</hi> and
the <hi>Centuriators?</hi> I doubt the <hi>Obſervator</hi> has ſome particular ſpite

under a <hi>Popiſh Princſes</hi> (of excellent Vertues, ſetting aſide

And then having ſworn them to ſtand to the Commands of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>In the 11<hi>th.</hi> Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> The Commons of
<hi>England</hi> in Parliament, perceiving how abominably the Clergy
Monks, Fryars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> abuſed thoſe vaſt Revenues which they En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
to all kind of Pride and Licentiouſneſs, Preferr'd a Bill
to the King, to take away their Temporal Lands, and to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the ſame to the better Advantage and Safety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57857:59"/>
Alledging, that the Temporailties then in the Poſſeſſion
of Spiritual Men, amounted to <hi>Three hundred and twenty three
thouſand Marks by the Year.</hi> But as the Clergy had mainly
Aſſiſted that Prince to Uſurp the Crown, ſo he did not think
it ſafe to diſoblige them at that juncture: and therefore put
off this Bill with a <hi>Le Roy S'aviſera.</hi> And about Two Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> dyed, <hi>viz.</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1413. in
the 46<hi>th.</hi> Year of his Age: to whom ſucceeded his Son then
near 30 years of Age, by the name of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth.</p>
               <p>By the Preaching of <hi>Wickliff</hi> and his Followers, the Eyes of
great numbers of the People were in ſome meaſure enlightned
to ſee the Errors and Falſe Doctrines then obtruded in the
Church, which much Incenſed the Prelates with Rage; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
obſerving, that Sir <hi>John Old-Caſtle,</hi> a valiant Religious
Knight of <hi>Kent,</hi> (and who in the Right of his Wife was Lord
<hi>Cobham</hi>) to be a great Favourer of that Doctrine, they reſolve
to take him to task; but firſt of all, Complain of him to the
King, in the firſt Year of his Reign, who ſent for, and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him; to whom the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> declared his Loyalty and
Obedience: but added, That as touching the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi>
he ow'd them neither <hi>Suit nor Service,</hi> for that by the Scriptures
he knew the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which, the King
would talk no further with him.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Arundel</hi> the Arch-biſhop began to Cite him, before him,
and not being obey'd, Pronounc'd him guilty of Contumacy;
at laſt the Lord <hi>Còbham,</hi> drew up a Confeſſion of his Faith,
being an Explanation of the Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> and very Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox;
with which he repaired to the Court, and humbly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it to the King, but he refuſed to receive it; and by the
Kings Commandment, he was ſent to the <hi>Tower:</hi> and in the
23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1413. Conven'd before the Arch-biſhop, and the
Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> The chief Objections againſt
him were, That he held <hi>Erroneous</hi> and <hi>Heretical</hi> Opinions in
theſe Four Points, <hi>viz.</hi> Touching the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Touching
<hi>Pennance.</hi> Touching <hi>Images.</hi> And touching <hi>Pilgrimages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore he delivered in to the ſaid Biſhops a Writing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented,
containing his Opinion in each of theſe Particulars;
which not being long, we ſhall here recite <hi>Verbatim.</hi>

                  <hi>I John Old-Caſtle</hi> Knight, Lord of <hi>Cobham,</hi> Will, That all
Chriſtian Men, Weet and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand, that I Clepe Almighty God

Sacrament of the Altar is Chriſts Body in the Form of Bread,
the ſame Body that was Born of the Bleſſed Virgin our Lady Saint

Death to Life, the which Body is now Glorified in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Alſo as for the Sacrament of <hi>Pennance,</hi> I believe that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to every man that ſhall be Saved to forſake Sin, and do due <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
for Sin before done, with true Confeſſion, very Contrition,
and due Satisfaction as Gods Law limiteth and Teacheth, and
elſe may he not be Saved: which <hi>Pennance,</hi> I deſire all Men to
do.</p>
               <p>And as of <hi>Images</hi> I <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand, that they be not of Beleeve,
but that they were Ordain'd ſith they beleeve was zewe of Chriſt,
by ſufferance of the Church, to be Calenders to Lews Men, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
and Bring to mind the Paſſion of our Lord Jeſu Chriſt, and
Martyrdom and good Living of other Saints: and that who ſo it
be, that doth the Worſhip to dead <hi>Images</hi> that is due to God, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
ſuch hope or truſt, in help of them, as he ſhould do to God, or
hath Affection in one, more than in another, he doth in that the
greateſt Sin of Maumetrie.</p>
               <p>Alſo I ſuppoſe this fully, That every Man in this Earth is a
<hi>Pilgrim</hi> towards Bliſs, or toward Pain: and that he that Knoweth
not, ne will not Know, ne Keep the Holy Commandments of God in
his Living here (albeit that he be go on <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> to all the
World, and he die ſo) he ſhall be Damned: he that knoweth the
Holy Commandments of God, and Keepeth them to his End, he ſhall
be Saved, though he never in his Life go on Pilgrimage, as Men
now uſe to <hi>Canterbury</hi> or to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to any other Place.</p>

               <p>I cannot ſay, whether the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> on the Receipt
of this <hi>Scrole</hi> did more <hi>admire,</hi> or <hi>pity</hi> their Blindneſs. But
on the Twenty fifth of <hi>September</hi> in the before mention'd
Year 1413. he was again Conven'd before them; where the
Arch-biſhop telling him, That he was <hi>Curſed,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeing
him to deſire <hi>Abſolution:</hi> The Knight reply'd, God
had ſaid by his Holy Prophet, <hi>Maledicam Benedictionibus
veſtris.</hi> Mal. 2. 2. Which is as much as to ſay, <hi>I will
Curſe where you Bleſs.</hi> And afterwards kneeling down on
the Pavement, and lifting his hands towards Heaven, he ſaid, <q>I
here Confeſs me unto thee my Eternal Living God, That in
my frail Youth I Offended thee moſt grievouſly, in Pride,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57857:62"/>
Wrath, and Gluttony, Covetouſneſs and Letchery, and many
Men have I hurt in my Anger, and done many horrible Sins,
for which, <hi>Good Lord, I ask thee Mercy.</hi>
                  </q> And then weeping
bitterly, he ſaid to the People, who in great Numbers flock'd to
hear his Examination,—<hi>Behold good People, for the breaking of
God's Law, and his great Commandments, they never yet</hi> Curſed
<hi>me, but for their own Laws and Traditions moſt cruelly do they
handle me, and other Men.</hi>—And being queſtion'd by the Arch-Biſhop
about his Belief, he Anſwer'd,—<hi>I Believe fully and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Laws of God; I Believe that all is true which
is contained in the Holy Scriptures of the Bible.</hi> Then proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Examine him, touching the Four Articles before ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
A Long Diſcourſe happen'd, (which you may Read (and
worth reading it is) in <hi>Foxe,</hi> but too tedious to be here Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,)
his Anſwers were quick and pertinent, and amongſt
others he has this Expreſſion,—<hi>Rome is the very Neſt of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
and out of that Neſt come all the Diſciples of him, the</hi>
Pope <hi>is the Head, the</hi> Prelates, Prieſts, <hi>and</hi> Monks <hi>are the Body;
and theſe pil'd</hi> Friars <hi>are the Tail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, they proceeded to a <hi>Definite Sentence</hi> againſt him,
whereby they Condemn him, as a moſt pernicious, deteſtable,
and obſtinate <hi>Heretick;</hi> and order him to be delivered over to
the Secular Power to be put to Death: in purſuance whereof,
he was carryed back to the <hi>Tower;</hi> from whence he made ſome
means ſhortly after to eſcape, and remain'd for near Four Years
in <hi>Wales,</hi> till he was taken and put to Death, as by and by we

<hi>A Proclamation</hi> Promiſing a Thouſand Marks, to any that ſhould
bring him in; yet (<hi>ſays Baker</hi>) ſo generally was his Doctrine
favour'd, that the Kings offer was not much regarded; till at

After the Diſcovery of the late <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
at the deſire of an Eminent Bookſeller in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet</hi>
Wrote a <hi>Brief Hiſtory of all the Papiſts Bloody Perſecutions, Plots,

by the Bookſeller to Mr. <hi>L' Eſtrange</hi> to <hi>Licenſe,</hi> which being
unwilling to do, he Cavill'd at it, after he had kept it ſome
time in his hands, that the Author had not <hi>Quoted</hi> the Authors
or Books whence he had taken the Relations, and unleſs that
were done he would not <hi>Licenſe</hi> it. The Gentleman at the
Bookſellers deſire, made all the <hi>Quotations</hi> punctually and ſet
them in the Margent, and the Copy was again carried to
<hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi> who nevertheleſs, Reſolving <hi>not to Licenſe it,</hi> put
off the Bookſeller with many delays near Three Months; and
at laſt, told him in plain termes, <hi>It was not fit to make the Breach
wider, betwixt the</hi> Papiſts <hi>and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and there were too many of
ſuch kind of Books already:</hi> Neither could he get the Copy

<hi>Alanus Copus,</hi> but as I ſhall ſum up the moſt material of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſo I ſhall add ſeveral others which to me ſeem of great
weight. Whereof ſome are General and previous conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
As,</p>
               <p>1. It appears that <hi>before</hi> Sir <hi>John Old caſtle</hi> was queſtion'd
by the Biſhops, he was ſo far from being a <hi>Malecontent</hi> or addicted
to Sedition or Diſloyal Conſpiracies, that on the contrary he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57857:66"/>
was <hi>much in the Kings Grace and favour,</hi> ſo that the Prelates durſt
not Convene him without firſt complaining to the King, for fear
of his Majeſties diſpleaſure, and when they had acquainted him
therewith, his Majeſty kindly ſent for him, and diſcourſed him,
perſwading him to ſubmit to the Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which argue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
that he was then of unqueſtion'd Loyalty, elſe the King would
never have Condeſcended to ſuch a particular care and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity.</p>
               <p>2. There was no pretence then of any Charge of diſloyalty,
or any <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> brought or alleaged againſt him by
his Adverſaries, but only for <hi>Heretical Opinions.</hi> And preſently
after Sir <hi>John</hi> was ſent to the Tower, and there was kept <hi>cloſe
Priſoner,</hi> and ſo could have no time <hi>before,</hi> nor opportunity <hi>then</hi>
to Contrive ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ormidable Inſurrection as is laid to his
Charge: Nor could he do it <hi>after</hi> he made his eſcape, for all
Hiſtorians agree, he fled into <hi>Wales,</hi> and lived there ſeveral
years, ſo that he could not be preſent with the pretended
Conſpirators in St. <hi>Gileſes Fields.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It has in all Ages been the method of all <hi>Perſecutors</hi> to
<hi>blacken</hi> the Servants of God tho ſuffering purely for the <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of a good Conſcience,</hi> with the odious Titles of <hi>Traitors, Rebels,</hi>
and diſturbers of the Civil Goverment. Of our Bleſſed Lord
himſelf, they reported that he <hi>was an Enemy to Caeſar;</hi> of his
Holy and peaceable Apoſtles—<hi>Theſe are they that turn the World
upſide down.</hi> So in the primitive and ſucceeding times, <hi>Nemeſion</hi>
an Egyptian Martyr, was firſt accuſed for a <hi>Thief,</hi> and when
that could not be proved, was by the ſame Judicature, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
for a Chriſtian, and yet was <hi>ſcourg'd twice</hi> as much as
the other <hi>Felons,</hi> and at laſt <hi>burn'd amongſt the Thieves,</hi> although
he never was Thief or Felon. Againſt <hi>Cyprian</hi> it was ſlanderouſly
alleadged by no leſs man than <hi>Galenus Maximus</hi> the Proconſul,
<hi>Quod diu Sacrilegâ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That he had long liv'd with a mind full of
Sacrilege, and had gather'd to him men of wicked Conſpiracy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The <hi>only Hiſtorians</hi> of thoſe times were <hi>Monks,</hi> who were
Sir <hi>John</hi>'s moſt bitter Enemies, and therefore no wonder if they
draw him in an hideous and frightfull ſhape. Some of their Lies
you ſhall have particularly examined by and by.—But now let's
hear the Effect of the ſtory as they themſelves (tho much diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
in Circumſtances) related it, and as the Indictment
againſt Sir <hi>Roger Acton</hi> and others imports, <hi>viz.</hi>

That after Sir <hi>John</hi> eſcaped out of the Tower (which <hi>Parſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

St. <hi>Simon and Jude</hi>) ſeveral of his friends and Favorers on the
10 <hi>of January</hi> 1413-14. Aſſembled in the Thickets in St. <hi>Gileſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fields,</hi>
with an intent to deſtroy the King and his Brothers, and ſet up
Sir <hi>John</hi> as Regent, and that the King keeping his Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
at <hi>Eltham</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> about 6 Miles from <hi>London,</hi> having
notice, went <hi>PRIVATELY</hi> [<hi>Parſons</hi> as aforeſaid <hi>p.</hi> 197]
at midnight, and took ſeveral of them, amongſt whom were,
Sir <hi>Roger Acton, John Brown</hi> Gentleman, and <hi>John Beverly</hi>
a Preacher, who with about 30 more [for they do not
agree in the number] being forthwith Tryed were Condemn'd
of <hi>Treaſon</hi> and Hang'd, and Sir <hi>Roger</hi> Drawn hang'd and
Buried under the Gallows, and Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle</hi> being put into
the ſame Indictment and not being found, was outlaw'd for the
ſaid Fact, and ſo being taken 4 or 5 years after was upon that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry
without any further Tryal or Judgment Hang'd and Burnt.</q>
               <p>This is the Tale—The Credit of which depends partly upon
the Teſtimonies of <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> and partly upon that of the
<hi>Records</hi> of the Commiſſion and Indictment. We ſhall conſider
each of theſe, whereby the Reader will more clearly perceive
how <hi>Improbable</hi> it is in all <hi>its parts</hi> and how <hi>ill laid together</hi> in
the <hi>whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. As to the Hiſtorians, <hi>Thomas of Walſingham</hi> is the firſt whom
all latter Authors follow as a Flock doth the <hi>Bell-weather,</hi> and
when we have told you that he was a <hi>Benedictine Monk</hi> of St.
<hi>Albans,</hi> you may eaſily make Judgment of his Sincerity, and
what truth there is in thoſe who take matters from him upon
truſt. Amongſt the reſt I obſerve the Jeſuite <hi>Parſons</hi> makes great
uſe of <hi>John Stow's</hi> Teſtimony, and indeed take notice of any
<hi>Popiſh Author</hi> ſpeaking of modern Engliſh Hiſtory, you ſhall find
commonly <hi>Stow</hi>'s <hi>Chronicle</hi> ſtrutting his Margin; this made me
wonder why they ſhould make choice of him, who was but a
mean Mechanic (being by Trade a <hi>Tayler,</hi> and ignorant of
the Latin Tongue) rather than ſo many other Learned Authors,
till I ſuppoſe at laſt I hit upon the reaſon, in a Treatiſe of Dr.
<hi>Matth. Sutclife,</hi> (afterwards Dean of <hi>Exeter</hi>) Intituled <hi>A Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Anſwer</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>Parſons</hi> 3 <hi>Converſions;</hi> Printed <hi>Anno. Dom.</hi>
1606. where <hi>p.</hi> 3. That <hi>Reverend Author</hi> (who no doubt being
Contemporary with <hi>Stow</hi> had good grounds for his Aſſertions)
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57857:67"/>
ſaith—<hi>John Stow is a ſimple Story-writer</hi> and a <hi>worſe Proteſtant,
For 'tis well known that certain crafty Companions and enemies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were too much Converſant with him to write truely in theſe matters.</hi>
And p. 24. <hi>Stow hath the moſt part of his Lies concerning the Lord</hi>
Cobham, [<hi>alis Sir</hi> John Old caſtle] <hi>out of</hi> Walſingham, <hi>which
underſtanding he underſtood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, being Latin, and he a meer Engliſh
Tailer.</hi>—Now it was no difficult thing if he Imployed perſons
<hi>Popiſhly Affected</hi> to <hi>Tranſlate</hi> for him; for them to <hi>Impoſe</hi> upon
his Ignorance what would make for their Cauſe, and then <hi>twit</hi>
us with the noiſe and pretended Teſtimony of a Proteſtant
Author.</p>
               <p>Secondly that which might lead <hi>ſome Hiſtorians</hi> into an Error,
was that in the ſecond year of this King <hi>Henry</hi> the 5. <hi>an Act</hi> was
made (part of this we recited in our laſt) That all <hi>Convicted of
H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reſy</hi> ſhould forfeit all their <hi>Lands and Goods,</hi> wherefore ſince
they were to loſe both Life and Eſtate, the noiſe went that <hi>Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy</hi>
was then made <hi>Treaſon,</hi> tho indeed it was not ſo. I will give
an Inſtance or two of ſuch <hi>miſled Authors. Thomas Walden</hi> in
the Prologue of his firſt Tome to Pope <hi>Martin</hi> has theſe words
ſpeaking of this very buſineſs, <hi>Nec Mora Longa proceſſint qui
Statutum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nor was it long, but it was publickly Enacted by a
Statute, that all the Wickleviſts as they were Traitors to God, ſo
ſhould alſo be accounted Traitors to the King.</hi> So Roger Wall of the
Acts of King <hi>Henry</hi> 5. <hi>Statuit et decrevit ut quot quot Illius Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

quae dici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>r Lollard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rum, invenirentaer aemuli et fautores, eo facto Rei
Proditorij Criminis in Majeſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tem Regiam haberenter. He eſtabliſht
and Decreed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>That all that ſhould be found Embracers or
favourers of the ſect which is called Lollards, ſhould for that only
Fact, be Adjudged Guilty of the Crime of Treaſon againſt the Kings
Majeſty:</hi> And <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> in the 22 Book of his Hiſtory,
harps upon the ſame ſtring, declaring that <hi>all the Followers of
Wickliffes Doctrine were deemed Hoſtes Patriae, Enemies of their
Country,</hi> which is all one as to ſay <hi>Traitors.</hi> And yet all this while
the Statute does not make them <hi>Traitors,</hi> nor ſpeak any thing of
putting them to <hi>Death</hi> [for in caſe of being Convict of Haereſy
and refuſing to Abjure, they were already to be <hi>burnt</hi> by the
Statute of 2 <hi>H</hi> 4. <hi>Ca.</hi> 15.] But it being ſo vulgarly taken, as
appears by theſe Examples, 'Tis no wonder that knowing Sir
<hi>John Old-caſtle</hi> to be convicted for what they call'd <hi>Haereſy</hi> and
that he was Executed, they delivered to poſterity that he was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57857:67"/>
                  <hi>Executed for Treaſon,</hi> as Imagining Haereſy to be Treaſon by
the Law.</p>
               <p>In the next place as to the <hi>Records,</hi> I willingly acknowledge
there is no kind of <hi>humane</hi> Teſtimony that ought to challeng a
greater Reverence <hi>Probant et non Probantur;</hi> yet even Records
themſelves are liable to be <hi>falſiſied,</hi> and whether ſometime of that
kind is not to be ſuſpected here, may ſtill be a queſtion; there
being not a few Symptomes of Fraud and ill practice. As,</p>
               <p>1. The Commiſſion iſſued to Indict and Try them bears Date
the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Jannuary,</hi> 1414. which was on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> next after
the <hi>Epiphany</hi> [or Twelfth day] And by the Record of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it not only appears, that they were the <hi>very ſame day</hi> Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and the Bill found [which is very much that a Court ſhould
ſit the very ſame day the Commiſſion Authoriſing them, bears
date; for what time was there then for ſummoning a Jury,] <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But alſo in the ſame Indictment it is averr'd that the <hi>very ſame</hi>
10<hi>th of January</hi> too was the day on which the aforeſaid Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
(to the number of Twenty Thouſand) were ſo in Warlike
manner aſſembled in St. <hi>Gilſes-fields.</hi> See both the Records in
<hi>Foxe fol.</hi> 529. Which being ſo, one would expect rather to hear
of Commiſſions Iſſued not ſo much to <hi>try</hi> them, as to raiſe Forces
to ſuppreſs them; <hi>Inter Arma ſilent Leges,</hi> twenty Thouſand
Rebels got together where not like much to value a Commiſſion
of <hi>Oier and Termener.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In the Record of the Indictment it is ſaid, <hi>per Sacramenta
duodecim Juratorum exſtitit preſentatum, by the Oaths of</hi> 12 <hi>Jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
it is preſented.</hi> But the names of the Jurors are ommitted,
whereas I humbly Conceive, if any ſuch Indictment had been
really and <hi>bona fide</hi> framed and found, the <hi>Jurors names</hi> (as in all
other caſes) would have been here particularly Inſerted in the
Record.</p>
               <p>3. The Crimes alleaged in this pretended Indictment are of
ſeveral ſorts, ſome of them Extravagant and all very obſerveable,
for tho there be ſome matters <hi>Treaſonable,</hi> to colour the proceſs;
yet the bottom of all appears to be that they were <hi>Enemies to the
Church</hi>—But take the very words of the Record, and Judg of
them your ſelves—<q>By the Oaths of 12 Jurors 'tis preſented,
that <hi>John Oldcaſtle</hi> of <hi>Coulingin</hi> the County of <hi>Kent Chevaleir</hi>
[<hi>Note, tho he were ſtyled Lord</hi> Cobham <hi>in Right of his Wife, yet he
was no Peer of the Land</hi> and others vulgarly called <hi>Lollards</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:57857:68"/>
who long have raſhly held diverſe <hi>Heritical Opinions</hi> contrary to
the Catholic Faith, and other manifeſt Errors repugnant to the
Catholic Law, to maintain ſuch their Errors, not being able to
Accompliſh their deſign as long as the Royal power and Regal
State of our Lord the King, as well as the State and Office of the
Prelatick dignity within the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in proſperity, falſly and Treaſonably Contriving as well the
State of the Kingdom as the State and <hi>Office of Prelates</hi> and the
Religious Orders within this Kingdom utterly to Annul, and
our Lord the King, his Brothers, the Prelates and other great men
of the Realm to Kill. And to compel the Religious Orders to
leave divine Worſhip and the Obſervation of Religion, and to
follow worldly Occupations, and demoliſh both Cathedrals
and Religious houſes and ſpoil them of their Goods, and to
appoint the ſaid Sir <hi>J. O. Regent</hi> of the Realm, and to ſet up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Governments in the Realm as a people without an Head, to
the final deſtruction as well of the Catholic Faith and Clergy
as of the State and Majeſty of the Royal dignity, did falſly and
Trayterouſly order and propoſe that he with many other Rebells
<hi>unknown,</hi> to the Number of 20000 <hi>men</hi> from diverſe parts of
<hi>England <hi>Arrayed in Warlike</hi>
                     </hi> manner ſhould Privately Riſe,
and on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> next after <hi>Epiphany</hi> in the firſt year of the
King at the Pariſh of St. <hi>Gileſes,</hi> &amp;c. in a great field they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
came together and <hi>met</hi> to fulfill ſuch their wicked
Intent, perſevering therein to Kill the King and his Brothers
<hi>viz. Tho.</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence, John of Lancaſter, and Humphrey
of Lancaſter,</hi> and alſo the Prelates and great men aforeſaid, as
likewiſe to diſinherite the King of his Realm, they came <hi>Riding</hi>
into the ſaid Field, Array'd after the manner of an Inſurrection
againſt their Allegiance, to ſubdue our Lord the King, unleſs
by him with a ſtrong hand they had Gratiouſly been hindered.</q>
               </p>

               <head>Some further Remarks on the Story of Sir John Oldcaſtle. An
Epitaph offered to his memory: The miſerable death of his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
Thomas Arundel Archbiſhop of Canterbury, who made a
Conſtitution againſt Reading the Scriptures.</head>
               <p>LEt us go on to Examine the Matter of <hi>Treaſon</hi> charg'd
on Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle,</hi> &amp;c. And muſt requeſt the Reader
to Remind the Record of the Indictment, recited
in Engliſh in our laſt, in which beſides the unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
omiſſion of the Jurors names and the improbability that the
ſuppoſed Fact ſhould be Committed, and Commiſſion to the Judges,
and their Seſſion, and the Conviction, ſhould all bear date and
happen upon one and the ſame Numerical day, there are theſe
other <hi>Obſervables</hi> that preſent themſelves.</p>
               <p>1. 'Tis therein alleadged that the deſign of theſe Imaginary
Traytors in St. <hi>Gilſes</hi> Thickets was to make Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle
Regent,</hi> and why not rather King? ſince the ſame Indictment
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57857:70"/>
charges him with deſign to kill the King. And yet if he had a
mind to be Regent, why ſhould he deſign to kill the King, for
then preſently his Regency muſt needs expire. The truth is, this
very expreſſion renders it ſuſpicious, that this pretended Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>obbled</hi> up afterwards by the Clergy or ſome of their
Agents, during the Kings Abſence in <hi>France,</hi> at which time
the Notion of ſetting up for a Regent might be probable. But
when this ſuppoſed Inſurrection happened, the King was not
gone, but lay at <hi>Eltham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The number of the Rebels are ſaid to be <hi>Twenty Thouſand,</hi>
and Array'd in Warlike manner; now 'tis very ſtrange and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
how ſo great a Number could get together, and more
ſtrange that they ſhould all be routed and diſperſt meerly by the
Kings coming to them into the Thickets, for we do not read of
any Army leavied by the King to oppoſe them: Nor do we hear
of one perſon kill'd, nor ſo much as a <hi>Broken Pate</hi> or a <hi>Bloody
Noſe</hi> in all this terrible Inſurrection; had there been ſuch a
Forces, their deſigns ſo horrid againſt the Kings Life, he would
have hardly ventur'd himſelf amongſt them ſo ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
               <p>3. It would ſeem by this Indictment, that theſe Twenty
Thouſand Rebells were all Horſe men, for it ſaith <hi>proditoriè
modo Inſurrectionis contra Ligeanceas ſuas Equitavêrunt,</hi> they Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
after the manner of an Inſurrection came <hi>Riding,</hi> &amp;c.
Now this increaſes the Miracle, for 'twas a work of great time
and vaſt Expence to raiſe an Army of Twenty Thouſand Horſe;
But beſides, if they were Horſe what did they do in St. <hi>Gileſes
Thickets?</hi> Sure that was none of the beſt places to Randevouz in;
again, if they came <hi>Riding</hi> thus in Battel Array Twenty Thouſand
ſtrong, how does the other part of the Indictment <hi>hold water,</hi>
where 'tis ſaid <hi>Privatim Inſurgentes, Privately Riſing;</hi> a Clauſe
which ſhrewdly intimates, that ſome of the Clergy have been
tampering with this Indictment, and that it was not drawn
with much Advice of the Kings <hi>Learned Council</hi> at Law, for
they would never have thus contradicted themſelves or inſerted
ſuch impertinent words as <hi>Privatim Inſurgentes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Nor is it leſs pleaſant to conſider, that there ſhould be
Twenty Thouſand Horſe levyed in open Rebellion to perpetrate
the moſt horrid Treaſon that could be Imagined, and theſe
ſhould be all diſcomfited, and ſuch vaſt Numbers of them taken,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57857:70"/>
that our Monkiſh Hiſtorians talk of all the Priſons about

for ſo the Indictment ſayes, <hi>Quam pluribus Rebellibus Ignotis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. A moſt material exception to this pretended Indictment
is, that therein the Kings Brothers are ſtiled <hi>John of Lancaſter
and Humphrey of Lancaſter,</hi> whereas in truth they then were,
and ever ſince the 13<hi>th</hi> year of their Father <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> had
been <hi>Dukes of Bedford and Glouceſter,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Caxtons</hi>
Chronicle; now can any wiſe man imagine, that the <hi>Kings
Council</hi> if they had drawn this Indictment upon ſo great an Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
an occaſion, would have been ſo negligent a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Humphrey?—Credat Judaeus Apella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. If the matter had been <hi>Treaſon,</hi> why were not the offenders
executed in ſuch manner as in caſes of Treaſon the Law requires;
but we do not find that they were Hang'd drawn and quarter'd
but only <hi>Hang'd,</hi> which is not the Judgment in Treaſon.</p>
               <p>7. As for Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle</hi> himſelf, after he was taken and
brought upout of <hi>Wales,</hi> which was about the year 1417.
There being then a <hi>Parliament</hi> ſitting, the Records thereof do
give this following account, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle</hi> of
<hi>Cowling</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> Knight, being Out-lawd in
the <hi>Kings-bench,</hi> and being Excommunicated before by the Arch-Biſhop
for Haereſy, was brought before the Lords, and having
heard his Convictions, [It ſeems the Haereſy was charg'd upon
him there as well as the Outlawry] anſwered not thereunto for
his Excuſe, upon which it was Adjudged that he ſhould be
taken as a <hi>Traytor</hi> to the King and the Realm, and carried to
the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and from thence drawn through the City
unto the New Gallows in St. <hi>Gileſes</hi> without [the old] <hi>Temple
Barr,</hi> and there to be Hanged and burned Hanging. In which
Proceedings we may note,</q>
               </p>
               <p>1. That he was never <hi>try'd by his Peers,</hi> that is by any Jury,
for he was but a Commoner, not a Peer of the Realm, and ſuffered
upon the Outlawry and Excomunication, and therefore when
we ſaid in <hi>our laſt p.</hi> 123. That <hi>without any farther Tryal or
Judgment he was Hang'd and Burnt,</hi> we deſire to be underſtood,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57857:71"/>
intended, of any Legal, common or ordinary <hi>Trial</hi> or Judgment
according to the Courſe of the Laws. For,</p>
               <p>2. If he were duly <hi>Out-law'd</hi> for Treaſon, upon his being taken,
there was no need for carrying him before the Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For by the very <hi>Out-lawry</hi> he would have been Attainted,
and without more ado ſhould have had Judgment in the Kings
Bench as a Traytor. But it may juſtly be ſuſpected that the
Judges of that Court, perceiving what kind of practiſes there
had been in this caſe, declined to be ſo far concern'd therein, and
therefore Certified the Record into the Parliament, which they
did, together with the Biſhops Sentence of Excommunication
filed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Record. A method very ſtrange and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidented.</p>
               <p>3. 'Tis obſervable, that after all this, the Lords did paſs ſuch
Judgment on him as was not due to a <hi>Traitor,</hi> and though it be
true, the Parliament might <hi>by Act</hi> have Attainted him, and
thereupon Ordained a <hi>ſpecial Judgment</hi> as they ſhould have
thought good; yet ſince they did not ſo proceed, ſince he was
before Attainted by the Out-lawry, and thereupon (or elſe
without any Colour of Law) ſuffered, I conceive their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
could not lawfully vary from the common Judgment of
Treaſon.</p>
               <p>4. It is further to be noted, that in the Records of the ſaid
Parliament it is added, that a motion was made, that the
Lord <hi>Powis</hi> [one of the Anceſtors no doubt of that Popiſh
Lord now in the Tower for High Treaſon] might be <hi>thanked</hi>
and <hi>Rewarded,</hi> according to the Proclamation, for his great
pains of taking of Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle</hi> Knight, <hi>Haeretick;</hi> But the
Roll there does not mention, <hi>Traitor;</hi> ſo that it ſeems preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Haereſy</hi> was his greateſt, indeed for ought we can perceive
<hi>main,</hi> and probably (Except breaking Priſon) his <hi>only</hi> Crime.</p>
               <p>Yet we are not ignorant that the Old Monks, and the Modern
Jeſuite <hi>Parſons,</hi> bring ſeveral other <hi>moſt falſe</hi> Accuſations againſt
him, as that he was an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> and would have had <hi>all things
in common,</hi> but this Calumny ſeems to have no other grounds, than
his complaining of the ſuperfluity of the Clergy in thoſe timer
and wiſhing that their abundance had been diſtributed to better
uſes; nay, they bluſh not to write, <q>

<hi>Tho. Erpingham</hi> Adjuring him, that if he ſaw him Riſe from

and diſcourſes in <hi>Fox,</hi> ſavouring of ſuch firm piety, prudence and
ſobriety of mind, and then judge how unlikely he was to be
Guilty of ſuch a phrenſical Extravagance. But poſſibly he
might at his Execution, ſay that though they ſo ſeverely perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
thoſe. <hi>Truths</hi> which he bore Teſtimony to, and ſought by
all means to ſuppreſs and <hi>bury</hi> the ſame, yet they would Riſe

words the <hi>Father of Lies</hi> and his Journy-men the Monks, might

Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who originally cauſed his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and Condemn'd him for <hi>Haereſy,</hi> and who in a ſynod had
forbidden the Scriptures to be tranſlated into, or read in the

the wicked Impoſitions of the no leſs cruel than Idolatrous Papal

ſince we find <hi>precedents</hi> of it in the beſt and moſt approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.

the truer Judgment of thoſe many Tragical <hi>Scenes,</hi> all fill'd with

upon us before the <hi>Medicine</hi> be provided, and <hi>black darkneſs</hi>
ſurround us, e're every body be ſufficiently Acquainted with it's
<hi>Helliſh Nature</hi>) to conſider the three points following, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Whether the preſent Church of Rome ought in any ſort to be
eſteemed a true Church of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>2. Whether any perſon Living and Dying in the Communion of
that Church, and underſtanding her Doctrine and practiſes, and
joyning therein may (ordinarily) be ſaved.</p>
               <p>3. Whether any perſon (<hi>as ſuppoſe a Proteſtant out of fear,
compliance,</hi> &amp;c.) may be preſent at Maſs underſtanding the ſame
without committing of grievous ſin.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Three</hi> particulars, we ſhall endeavour in this and ſome
following <hi>Sheets,</hi> to diſcourſe of with all <hi>plainneſs</hi> and Candor, ſo
far from any violation of <hi>Charity,</hi> that we thereby only deſign a
moſt <hi>neceſſary Caution</hi> to prevent poor miſſed ſouls from preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating
themſelves into endleſs Ruin and Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>firſt Quaery,</hi> touching the preſent Roman Churches
being a <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> two things are to be premiſed and
explained.</p>
               <p>1. What we mean in this debate by, <hi>Church of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. What we underſtand by the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The word Church taken in its full Latitude ſignifies, <hi>the
whole company of all thoſe whom God by his word and ſpirit calls to
the knowledge and profeſſion of his truth,</hi> and from its members
being <hi>called forth</hi> and ſeparated from the reſt of the world,
that live in groſs and avowed <hi>Atheiſm</hi> or <hi>Idolatry,</hi> without the
knowledg and acceptation of thoſe ſupernatural verities, the
Incarnation and Crucifixian of the Son of God for the ſins of men,
upon the terms held forth in the Goſpel, it is termed <hi>the Church,</hi>
in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, derived from the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Evoco,</hi> to <hi>call
out,</hi> or from.</p>
               <p>The Church thus <hi>abſolutely</hi> and ſimply conſidered in this
Latitude is but <hi>one,</hi> as the State and Company of the Kingdom of
great <hi>Britain</hi> is but <hi>one,</hi> ſince all and every one called to this
Grace, of how different eſtate, qualities or condition ſoever,
belong one way or other to this Company; but in this Church
thus conſidered there are ſundry <hi>differences</hi> and <hi>reſpects,</hi> that is,
the perſons called to the Faith of Chriſt are of <hi>diverſe ſorts;</hi> for
ſome part of the Church is already reduced from this mortal life,
and Crowned with that Glory, whereunto they were called when
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57857:75"/>
here on Earth, and thence ſtiled the <hi>Church Triumphant,</hi> the
other part is that which is ſucceſſively abiding in this world,
which for that time, is called the <hi>Church Militant,</hi> becauſe it
lies as it were in the Camp always <hi>alarm'd,</hi> and fighting againſt
Hells Triple League, the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Divel,</hi> under
the Banner of our Lord the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and patiently waiting
for the victory.</p>
               <p>But amongſt theſe <hi>latter,</hi> there are again two ſorts. <hi>Firſt</hi>
ſuch as are <hi>effectually called,</hi> and theſe are the <hi>Elect</hi> only, whom
God not only calls, but chuſes, by his free Grace, inſpiring them
to obey that calling, and to live <hi>Holily</hi> worthy of ſuch their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and who ſhall infallibly be <hi>Saved</hi> in the life to come, and
this Company, we call the <hi>Inviſible Church;</hi> becauſe only God
knows who are <hi>His,</hi> and tho we ſee the men and by their fruits
charitably hope they are Gods <hi>Elect,</hi> yet to ſpeak preciſely no
mortal eye can infallibly diſcern them to be ſuch, ſince many
times the <hi>Briſtol-ſtone</hi> glitters as bright as the <hi>Diamond,</hi> and
<hi>Hypocrites</hi> make as fair outward ſhew as the real Saint. The
<hi>ſecond</hi> ſort therefore of the <hi>militant</hi> Church, are Hypocrites and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound members, who are not effectually called, but diſobey the
truth whereof they make profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe diſtinctions being thus premiſed, we proceed to acquaint
you what we mean by a true Church of Chriſt, and we ſhall do
it in the very words of our mother the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the
19<hi>th</hi> Article of her Faith,—The viſible Church of Chriſt is a
Congregation of Faithfull men, in the which the pure word of
God is Preached, and the Sacraments be duly Adminiſtred accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Chriſts Ordinance in all thoſe things that of Neceſſity are
requiſite to the ſame. So that here we ſee wherever the word of
God is ſincerely preach'd and heard, and the Sacraments Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
according to Chriſts Inſtitution, there is a Church
of God, for thoſe are the marks whereby the Church may
be known. So that the viſible Church, which is alſo <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
[or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi>] under the Goſpel (not confined to one
Nation as before under the Law) conſiſts of all thoſe throughout
the world that <hi>profeſs the true Religion.</hi> And particular
Churches, which are members thereof are more or leſs <hi>pure,</hi>
according the doctrine of the Goſpel is taught and embraced,
Ordinances Adminiſtred, and publick Worſhip perform'd more
or leſs pure in them. And not only the pureſt particular
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57857:75"/>
Churches under Heaven are ſubject both to mixture and <hi>Error,</hi>
but ſome may and have ſo degenerated as to become <hi>no
Churches</hi> of Chriſt, but <hi>Synagoges of Satan,</hi> tho yet there ſhall
to the end of the world be a Church on Earth to Worſhip God
according to his will againſt whom the Gates of Hell ſhall not
prevail.</p>
               <p>Now whether the preſent Church of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me</hi> be not one of
theſe Apoſtatized <hi>Adulterous</hi> Churches againſt whom ſuch a
<hi>Divorce</hi> is ſued out, we ſhall proceed to Inquire, as ſoon as we
have told you what we mean by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that is,
<hi>The whole Church of Rome as it is a Body conſiſting of one viſſible
head the Pope, and of all Papiſts whereſoever, Clergy, and Laity,
profeſſing themſelves members of that Head, and owning the Faith
and Doctrine thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Body or Company,</hi> I ſay, <hi>is not in any ſort to be accounted a
true viſible Church of Chriſt,</hi> which I conceive will appear by
diverſe Arguments of which I ſhall give you one at preſent.</p>
               <p>That Church which over throweth the main and proper cauſe
of our Salvation is no true Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> overthroweth the main and proper
cauſe of our Salvation.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no true Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Major I preſume no man will deny, and for the
Aſſumption 'tis notoriouſly evident, for they have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
the principal and fundamental Article of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the Head and ſumm of all Religion; they
err in the <hi>Efficient Cauſe</hi> of our Juſtification, which is
the free Grace and favour of God, which they deny
building it upon mans merit of Congruity, or works pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory
and diſpoſitory to Juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Coupling it
with mans free-will. They Err in the <hi>material cauſe</hi> Chriſt;
Obedience, this they deny to be our Obedience or the
matter of our Juſtification. They Err in the <hi>Form</hi> of our
Juſtification, which it the Imputation of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
unto us. They Err in the <hi>Inſtrumental cauſe,</hi> to wit,
the Juſtifying Faith, denying is to be a certain particular
truſt or Aſſurance in Gods mercy for the Pardon of our
Sins. They Err in the very <hi>Meritorious cauſe</hi> Chriſt our
Redeemer, ſeveral ways overthrowing all his Offices.
They Err alſo in the <hi>final cauſe</hi> of Juſtification, being the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57857:76"/>
free Gift of Eternal Life, while they ſay the ſame
is merited by the Condignaty. They overthrow the
very Fundamentals of Religion, by denying the ſufficiency
of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> for the Rule of Faith, and the neceſſity
of its being known to Gods people. They deny the right
uſe of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> whilſt they attribute unto them
Grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and teach that their efficacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on the <hi>Intention of the Prieſt.</hi> They deny the truth
of Chriſts <hi>humane Body</hi> by their abſurd whimſey of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
and the vertue of His only and all alone
ſufficient Sacrifice, by their <hi>propitiatory Maſſes,</hi> &amp;c. So that
'tis plain they have Corrupted or abandoned the main and
<hi>proper Fundamentals</hi> of Salvation, conſequently has no Claim
to the Title of a Church of Chriſt.</p>

               <head>Arguments proving the Church of Rome not to be the true Church
of Chriſt.</head>
               <p>IN our laſt we Explain'd the Notion of a <hi>Church</hi> in its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Acceptations, as far as was neceſſary; and offer'd one
Reaſon (then) why the <hi>Roman Church</hi> was not to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>a true Church.</hi> We now proceed to Conſider the ſame
a little further: And our <hi>Second Argument</hi> ſhall for the greater
<hi>Authority</hi> be taken from the Profeſt, Publick Doctrine of <hi>The
Church of England,</hi> (if the Book of <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Homiles</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to Contain her Doctrine, which ſome Mens <hi>Heterodoxies</hi>
and bold Preachments of quite contrary Tenets, whilſt they yet
vapour and boaſt themſelves as the only <hi>true Churchmen,</hi> has
rendred a <hi>Quaere.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 2. The true Viſible Church of Chriſt is a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Faithful Men, in which the pure <hi>Word of God</hi> is Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and the <hi>Sacraments</hi> duly Adminiſtred, according to
Chriſt's Ordinance in all thoſe things that of neceſſity are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:57857:78"/>
But the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is not a Congregation of Faithful
Men, in which the <hi>pure Word of God</hi> is Preached, and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi>
duly Adminiſtred according to Chriſt's Ordinance in
all thoſe things, that of neceſſity are requiſite to the ſame.</p>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is not a true viſible Church of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is the Expreſs Words of the Nineteenth Article
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And leaſt any ſhould ſay, That we may
indeed from hence conclude <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> not <hi>Negatively,</hi> viz.
That where theſe Marks are, There is a Church; but not, that
where they are not, there is <hi>no Church;</hi> be pleaſed to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
That the Church of <hi>England</hi> delivers theſe Words by way
of <hi>Definition</hi> of a Church, deſcribing it by the <hi>proper Marks:</hi>
Now a <hi>Definition,</hi> all that underſtand the Art of Reaſoning
know, is not only <hi>poſitive</hi> in it ſelf, but Excluſive and <hi>Negative,</hi>
in regard of that to which it is Oppos'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r</hi> is alſo declar'd, and aſſerted by our Church in
her <hi>Homilies:</hi> As for Example, in <hi>That</hi> for <hi>Whit-ſunday</hi> (part 2<hi>d.</hi>)
We have theſe Paſſages—Firſt, It [ſpeaking of the Church
of <hi>Rome] wants theſe true and proper Marks of a true Church;</hi>
[having before mentioned theſe very Marks] <hi>For neither are
they Built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the ſound and pure Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus; neither do
they Order the Sacraments, or Eccleſiaſtical Keys in ſuch ſort as
he did firſt Inſtitute and Ordain them. Again, They want the
Spirit of God; if it be poſſible to be there, where the true Church
is not; then it is at</hi> Rome. <hi>Again, He that is of God, heareth
Gods Word; whereof it followeth, That the</hi> Popes <hi>in not hearing
Chriſts Voice, do plainly argue to the World, that they are not of
Chriſt, nor yet poſſeſt of his Spirit.</hi> Thus the <hi>Homily!</hi> whereby
I think this Argument is ſufficiently ſupported; and will appear
<hi>Cogent</hi> to all ſuch as own themſelves <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no <hi>true Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is this Argument leſs ſtrong <hi>in it ſelf</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts:</hi>
For the Propoſition is St. <hi>Paul's,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. That Man or Angel
(and by parity of Reaſon <hi>That Church</hi>) which teacheth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

offend in one point he is Guilty of all,</hi> James 2. 10. So moſt truly
too, ſaith St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his Sixth Book upon <hi>Luke, Negat Chriſtum
qui non omnia quae Chriſti ſunt, Confitetur. He denyeth Chriſt who
doth not confeſs and acknowledge all that Chriſt taught.</hi> And for
<hi>adding unto,</hi> the ſame Father Writing upon thoſe words, <hi>Be not
the Servants of Men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 23. thus teſtifieth, <hi>Servi homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
ſunt qui Humanis ſe ſubjiciunt Superſtitionibus; They are the
Servants of Men that ſubmit themſelves to Humane. Traditions:</hi>
And if they are the <hi>Servants of Men,</hi> they are <hi>not the Servants
of Chriſt:</hi> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. So that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
as it is Aſſerted by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſo is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Juſtified by the Authority of the Holy Scripture and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fathers.</p>
               <p>Then as for the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> That in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> neither
the <hi>Word of God</hi> is truly Preached, nor the <hi>Sacraments</hi> duly Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred,
is notorious; for as to <hi>Doctrine,</hi> they have added their
own Figments, as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, &amp;c.</hi> and do
Preach contrary <hi>Doctrines</hi> to the Scripture; and as touching
the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> they have not only Augmented the Number,
and made Five new ones of their <hi>own,</hi> which Chriſt never Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
viz. <hi>Confirmation, Orders, Pennance, Matrimony, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> But alſo they have utterly Corrupted thoſe <hi>Two</hi>
which our Lord Ordain'd: For in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> beſides <hi>Water,</hi> they uſe
<hi>Spettle, Salt, Oyl, Chriſm,</hi> contrary to the Inſtitution; and they
lay ſuch a neceſſity upon this Inſtitution, That all that dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it (even Infants) they ſay are <hi>Damn'd. [See</hi> Bellarm. <hi>de Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>
L. 1. Ca. 4. <hi>and</hi> Rhem. Annot. <hi>on</hi> John <hi>the</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi>] In the
<hi>Lords Supper,</hi> they have turned the Sacrament to a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi>
made an <hi>Idol</hi> of Bread, changed the Communion into <hi>private
Maſſes,</hi> taken the Cup from the <hi>Lay-people;</hi> and committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Abominations. Therefore I conclude this Argument,
The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not having the <hi>Word</hi> of God purely Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor the <hi>Sacraments</hi> rightly Adminiſtred, according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
is in no ſort to be eſteemed a Viſible Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 3. That pretended Church which overthroweth,
and denyeth the only Rule of <hi>Faith,</hi> is no true Church of Chriſt.
But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does ſo. Therefore.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Propoſition;</hi> the only Rule of <hi>Faith</hi> is the Scripture
or written Word of God, <hi>John</hi> 5 32. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. Now
to overthrow this Rule, is to overthrow the Foundation of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57857:79"/>
Church of God, which is built upon the Foundation of the
Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. That is the Scriptures of
the New and Old Teſtaments.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
this Rule is Evident: for Firſt, She hath added another
Rule of her own; to wit, <hi>Traditions</hi> and humane Inventions,
which are contrary to the Scriptures, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 15.
16. Gods Ark and <hi>Dagon</hi> cannot ſtand together; what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
hath Chriſt with <hi>Belial?</hi> What agreement hath Divine
Purity with bold Forgeries? Secondly, they overthrow as much
as in them lies, this only Rule of <hi>Faith,</hi> whilſt they ſubject the
Authority and Senſe of it wholly to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or
the <hi>Pope;</hi> ſo that Gods Word is not received of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as it is the Word of God, but as the Word of Men; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that of the Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 4. That Church which <hi>holdeth not the Head Chriſt,</hi>
is no true Spouſe or Church of Chriſt. But the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> holdeth not the Head Chriſt. Therefore.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is undeniable, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. and 5. 23.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> may thus be proved, That Church which is <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Idolatrous</hi> holdeth not the Head Chriſt. For if <hi>Worſhiping of
Angels,</hi> which is but one kind of Idolatry, <hi>ſeparates from the Head,</hi>
as it does by the Apoſtles Teſtimony, <hi>Colloſſ.</hi> 1. 18. then much
more all kind of Idolatry.—But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is drown'd
in all kind of Idolatry, as not only Worſhiping of Angels, but
likewiſe of Saints, and Pictures, and Images, and of a piece of
Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, ſhe adhereth to another Head, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Pope;</hi> and not to the one only true Head Chriſt: and what agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath the Temple of God, with Idols, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. And
the member of an Harlot cannot be withal a member of Chriſt,
<hi>See</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 5. The true Church of Chriſt is the <hi>true Flock</hi> of
Chriſt. But the true Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the <hi>true Flock</hi> of
Chriſt.—<hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is undeniable, from <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28.
<hi>John</hi> 10. 16.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is proved, <hi>John</hi> 10. 3, 4, and 17 <hi>verſes.</hi> There
it is laid down as the <hi>property</hi> and <hi>Characteriſtick</hi> Mark of Chriſts
<hi>Flock,</hi> That they <hi>hear his Voice</hi> and <hi>know it,</hi> and <hi>follow it.</hi> But
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hears not Chriſts Voice, nor acknowledges, or
follows it; but the <hi>Voice of Antichriſt,</hi> and the Antichriſtian Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57857:79"/>
they hear not Chriſts Voice, as Chriſts Voice, but <hi>as the
Churches Voice;</hi> And this is likewiſe affirm'd againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> by the
Church of <hi>England</hi> in the before Cited Homily for <hi>Whit-ſunday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 6. That Church which practiſeth not the <hi>true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>
of Chriſt, is not the true Church of Chriſt. But the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> does not practiſe the true Baptiſm of Chriſt. <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
               <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> I ſuppoſe will be granted; Baptiſm being an
Initiating <hi>Ordinance,</hi> without which, none can be Members of the
Viſible Church. The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is thus proved;</p>
               <p>True Baptiſm is a Seal of the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> and of
the Covenant of Grace made unto us in Chriſt: But the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not ſuch; for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
denyeth the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the Juſtifying by <hi>Faith:</hi>
yea, ſhe maketh Baptiſm the Inſtrumental Cauſe of Juſtification,
ſo as that it confers Grace <hi>Ex opere operato</hi> (by the meer thing
done) and they require not Faith in Chriſt as neceſſary for the
Party to be Baptized, But only a <hi>Diſpoſition [Conc. Trent. Seſſ. 7.
Can.</hi> 6. and 8.] and principally the whole Force of Baptiſm, and
ſo of all their Sacraments, depend upon their Prieſts intention.
So that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no more of Baptiſm, but only
the External Form of words (and thoſe fullyed with abundance
of <hi>lewd Ceremonies,</hi>) together with the Element of Water. For
<hi>a Sacrament is a viſible ſign of an Inviſible Grace;</hi> which Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Grace the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> deſtroyeth, while ſhe placeth
the Grace in the Sacrament it ſelf;—denying and Accurſing
[<hi>Seſſ.</hi> 7. <hi>Can.</hi> 6.] only Faith in Gods Promiſe, to be ſufficient
to receive Grace: Thus they deſtroy the Nature and uſe of
Chriſts Sacraments, and of Baptiſm in ſpecial, while they ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it from the Doctrine of the Word of God, and from the
neceſſity of Juſtifying Faith. Thus their Church is quite <hi>Removed
from the Foundation,</hi> and built upon another Bottom. Thus Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
to them of that Church is nothing elſe, but a <hi>Seal to a Blank,</hi>
or which is worſe, a Sealing up of their Condemnation, whilſt
their Sins are not waſhed, but their Souls drowned in Errour and
Idolatry, as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> a Type of Baptiſm:
Yea, they make a very Idol of their Sacrament, and of the Prieſt
together, whilſt to theſe they attribute that Grace, which the
only Author and Fountain of true Baptiſm can give, and preſent
their Children in the Faith of that Church which denyeth true
Faith in Chriſt.</p>

               <head>An Objection Anſwered, touching Baptiſm; The Church of Rome
hath no true Miniſtry, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>IN our laſt we urged, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not
practiſe the <hi>true Baptiſm</hi> of Chriſt; whence an Objection
may ariſe thus, <hi>If the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>have not the true
Baptiſm of Chriſt, why then are not Papiſts when Converted
to the true Faith of Chriſt, Rebaptized? How ſtands their former
Baptiſm good?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I Reply in the words of the great Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
(<hi>Contra Creſconium,</hi> Lib. 1. C. 30.) ſpeaking of the External
Form of Baptiſm uſed amongſt <hi>Hereticks,</hi> ſuch <hi>Baptiſm is not to
be Repeated, but the Errour thereof Corrected.</hi> And in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Book againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> Chap. 40. He hath theſe
Words, <q>The Divine Scriptures in many places do ſhew, all
theſe to be ſtrangers from the Church, who are not in the
Rock, and appertain not to the Members of the Dove, and
yet they Baptize and are Baptized, and have <hi>Sine ſalute Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
ſalutis:</hi> without Salvation the Sacrament of Salvation.</q>
And <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>chap.</hi> 17. <hi>Hereticks</hi> (ſaith he) have <hi>Lawful Baptiſm</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:57857:82"/>
(that is for the External Form) <hi>but not Lawfully.</hi> And ſo <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
himſelf determines the Caſe, <hi>Cum veniunt ad Eccleſiam
Baptizati ab Haereticis, agnoſcendum eſt quod eſt Eccleſiae, id eſt,
Baptiſma, corrigendus verò Error; When thoſe that are Baptized
by Hereticks come to the Church, the Church acknowledges what is
her own; that is, the Baptiſm; but the Errour is to be corrected.</hi>
The Sacraments operate effectually, <hi>Non quia</hi> dicitur, <hi>ſed quia</hi>
Creditur: Not becauſe the Words are <hi>uttered,</hi> but becauſe there
is the <hi>Word of Faith purifying the heart as the Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks,
Act 15. And therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> having deny'd the
Faith of Righteouſneſs, and the Righteouſneſs of Faith, and
the ſaving Doctrine of Baptiſm; She hath conſequently rendred
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> to be of none Effect to her unto Salvation; But yet
ſtill, when any <hi>Papiſt</hi> is by the Grace of God and the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word, and of ſaving Faith Converted to the true
Church of God, the <hi>Seal of Baptiſm</hi> is not again affixed, but
the <hi>Evidence</hi> of ſaving Faith and Teſtament of the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
written in his heart, is now added to the Seal, and ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
compleatly <hi>authentick,</hi> as not being bound neceſſarily to
outward means. Nor do we here exclude Gods free Agency in
Baptiſm, who in the Party Baptized in that Heretical Church
may (if it pleaſe him) work Grace, finding his <hi>own Water</hi> and
his <hi>own Words;</hi> finding, I ſay, his own <hi>Seal,</hi> he can add his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace unto it; yet no Child there Baptized coming
to the years of Diſcretion (unleſs he Renounce the wicked
Faith, and Relinquiſh the Idolatrous practices of that <hi>Romiſh
Church</hi>) can have benefit by his Baptiſm; but to him it is <hi>Penal</hi>
and <hi>Pernicious</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks.—And now I proceed to
another Argument: <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is not a Church
of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 7. That Church which hath not a <hi>lawful Miniſtry,</hi>
is not a true viſible Church of Chriſt.—But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
hath not a Lawful Miniſtry.—<hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know this, to many will ſeem a <hi>Paradox,</hi> but 'tis a certain
Truth, for if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not a Lawful Ordination,
how can it have a Lawful Miniſtry: But it has no Lawful Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.
1. In regard of the <hi>Efficient Cauſe,</hi> either Remote,
as the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Head;</hi> whence all their <hi>Miniſterial Power</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd:
or immediate, as the <hi>Ordainer;</hi> on whoſe Intention their
<hi>Gratia gratis data</hi> dependeth: So that here is a Nullity in the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57857:82"/>
very Foundation of the Papal Prieſt-hood. It is deriv'd from
the <hi>Pope,</hi> as Head of the Clergy and Church: a Title Anti-chriſtian
and Uſurp'd; and ſo their Miniſtry is Anti-chriſtian.
And if the <hi>Pope,</hi> being Antichriſt, and an Uſurper, and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
Biſhops by vertue of his Papal Supremacy, as Chriſt's
ſole Vicar, and <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor, cannot convey any power of
<hi>Order</hi> upon his Biſhops and Clergy; what lawful Miniſtry can
we expect in that Apoſtolical Synagogue? So that Calvin (an
Author whom for <hi>Honour's</hi> ſake I mention, in a lewd Age, when
thouſands decry him, that either for <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> are no
ways comparable to Him) was in the Right, in his Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The Method of Reforming the Church.—Nego ſub toto Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patu
unum eſſe verè Epiſcopum; I deny that under the whole Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
there is one truly a Biſhop;</hi> and what then ſhall we ſay of
their Prieſts? neither have they any Miniſterial Grace, becauſe
it depends (according to their Belief) upon their Ordainers <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi>
and not upon Chriſts Ordinance, Grace, and Promiſe.
But,</p>
               <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> They fail too in the <hi>Formal and Fixal Cauſe of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
They have quite altered and Corrupted the <hi>Form,</hi> and ſo
the End thereof, adding a New <hi>Form,</hi> which overthroweth the
Old, and impoſeth a New End, <hi>viz.</hi> making the whole Eſſence
and uſe of their Miniſtry to conſiſt in Prieſthood; that is, in
Sacrificing of an <hi>Idol,</hi> and ſo turning the Office of a Miniſter of the
Goſpel, into an Idol-Sacrificing Prieſt. For in the Form of
their Ordination ſet down in their <hi>Tridentine Catechiſm,</hi> Part

                     </expan> Coeleſtem illam,</hi> &amp;c. And
thus the Biſhop giveth unto the Prieſt that Heavenly Power of
Retaining and Forgiving of Sins, which the Lord gave to his
Diſciples. Thus the very words of their <hi>Ordination.</hi> Now we
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57857:83"/>
know that this power of <hi>Remitting and Retaining of Sins</hi> the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> placeth not in the <hi>Diſpenſing and Preaching</hi> of the
Word of God, but in their Sacrament of Pennance. Thus
they have wholly perverted their Ordination, both for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
and final End. Nor do they leſs fail in the <hi>Material Cauſe,</hi>
ignorant unqualified Perſons being ordinarily made Prieſts, and
ſuch as only are able to Mumble over the <hi>Maſs</hi> and Matins.</p>
               <p>But it may be Objected, That in Popiſh Ordination there is
a Power Confer'd to Preach the Word of God. 'Tis true,
they do uſe theſe words of our Bleſſed Saviour which the
Church of <hi>England</hi> uſeth, <hi>viz. Receive the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe
ſins ye Remit, &amp;c.</hi> Which <hi>we</hi> do indeed underſtand of the
diſpenſation of the Word and Sacraments. But the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> otherwiſe, meaning thereby the Prieſts power of Binding
and Looſing in their Sacrament of <hi>Pennance.</hi> And it is in vain
for them to ſay, That their Prieſts in their Ordination have
any Power confer'd upon them <hi>to Preach the Word of God,</hi> when
their Practiſe is far otherwiſe: Neither indeed is it lawful for
them ſo to Preach the Word of God, as it behoveth faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> purely and ſoundly to the ſaving of
Mens Souls. For the pure and ſound ſaving Doctrine of the
Word of God is branded for Hereſie in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
Nor may their Biſhops or Prieſts deliver the ſenſe of it otherwiſe
than according to thoſe Canons and Decrees: In a word, See
the <hi>Conc. Trid. Seſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Can.</hi> 3. <hi>Si quid dixerit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If any
one ſhall ſay, That thoſe words of our Lord and Saviour,</hi> [<hi>Receive
the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſins ye Remit they are Remitted, and whoſe ſins
you Retain they are Retained</hi>] <hi>are not to be underſtood of the power of
Remitting and Retaining ſins in the Sacrament of Pennance, but
ſhall wreſt them contrary to the Inſtitution of the Sacrament, to
the authority of Preaching the Goſpel, Let him be</hi> Anathema.
Well therefore does the pious and judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> conclude,—
<hi>Totum Sacordotium Papiſticum non ſolum impia eſt vera Miniſterii

The whole Popiſh Prieſthood is not only an impious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation
of the true Miniſtry, but an execrable Reproach
againſt Chriſt: So that whoſoever is a Popiſh Prieſt, until he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that Title, he cannot be the Servant of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>True <hi>Ordination</hi> is a ſacred Inſtitution of Chriſt, whereby
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57857:83"/>
the Perſon Ordain'd is Inveſted with a Power to Preach the
Word of God, and to Adminiſter the Holy Sacraments accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Chriſt's Ordinance.—But the Ordination uſed in the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not according to Chriſt's Inſtitution, to wit,
whereby the Perſon Ordained is Inveſted with a Power to
Preach the Word of God, and to Adminiſter the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
according to Chriſt's Ordinance.—Therefore in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is no true Ordination; therefore no
true Ordination, Therefore no true Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> we have already Demonſtrated, For firſt,
for Adminiſtration of Sacraments, the Prieſts Power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively
and ſpecially limited to their Euchariſt and Pennance.
2<hi>ly.</hi> That <hi>Eucharist</hi> is a meer Idol, and blaſphemous Sacrifice,
and no true Sacrament at all. 3<hi>ly.</hi> The very Words of Chriſt
uſed in true Ordination of all <hi>Orthodox</hi> Churches, which are
underſtood of Diſpenſing the Word and Sacraments, the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> perverteth and wreſteth to Abſolution; and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
faith, That to underſtand it of Diſpenſing the Word
of God, is to wreſt the ſenſe contrary to the Inſtitution of
this Sacrament of Pennance.</p>
               <p>But now a like <hi>Objection</hi> will occur thus,—If in the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> there be not true and lawful Ordination, why then,
when any of their Prieſts are Converted to the true Faith and
Church of Chriſt, are they not Re-ordained?</p>
               <p>To this we may Anſwer, That although their Ordination
were altogether <hi>unlawful</hi> and unwarrantable, according to the
Inſtitution of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet coming to us of the
true Church, after the paring and ſhaving off of their Power
of Sacrificing, and of Sacramental Binding, and Looſing, and
Pennance, and Reſtoring to the Word of God (prophaned and
abuſed by them to a wrong ſenſe) its Original and true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whilſt the Prieſt ſo Converted openly Renounces the <hi>Maſs,</hi>
and witneſſeth his Abhorrence and Deteſtation of all that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Sacrifice, and ſubſcribes to the Articles and Doctrine
of our Church; they are hereupon Received, and their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
now ſtands good, which before was vitious and Anti-chriſtian.
See for this more fully Mr. <hi>Francis Maſon</hi>'s Book of
Ordination, <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>Ch.</hi> 12. The ſame Reaſon is to be given of
the Miniſtry of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which in times paſt
was derived and deſcended from that falſe and Corrupt Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:57857:84"/>
Some will ſay,—The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is as a Diſeaſed Body,
which though never ſo Corrupt is yet ſtill a true Body: for he
is really a Man to whom the Definition of a Man agreeth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with a reaſonable Soul, though his Body be never ſo much
Diſeaſed, as with the <hi>Plague</hi> or <hi>Leproſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, Many deceive themſelves and others with this
Compariſon. They ſhould firſt prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be
a Living Church, before they can properly compare the Body
of it to the Body of a Living Man; for elſe it is a meer <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
Principii, a ſhameful begging of the Queſtion.</hi> For I deny the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be an Organical Body; to wit, a Living
Body, No, no, It is a meer Corrupt and ſtinking <hi>Carcaſs:</hi> and as
a dead corrupt Corps is not to be accounted an <hi>Organical Body,</hi>
as wanting the Soul to Actuate it; and ſo cannot be called tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Man,</hi> or a Mans Body; but <hi>Cadaver</hi> a <hi>Corps.</hi> No more is
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (no leſs <hi>Dead</hi> than Diſeaſed,) a true Church,
for a dead Member can but Equivocally be call'd a Member. Nor
will it follow, That becauſe there may be an hidden Church of
God within the borders of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Therefore the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true viſible Church. For if any amongſt
them be of the Number of Gods Sacred ones, before their Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Calling they are Members of that Antichriſtian Church,
but being Call'd they are no more of it, but in it; and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it, will never prove it a true Church.</p>
               <p>It may be alledged, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath only
<hi>added</hi> to the Foundation, not taken away, or ſubtracted from
it, and the Nature of an Addition is not directly to deny,
but by Conſequence at moſt. <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> We have already
proved, That they have deſtroyed the Foundation, and that
both by Subtraction and Addition. As their Traditions and
Decrees overthrow the Foundation of the Scriptures; for if
the Scriptures affirm one thing, and their Traditions another,
Theſe are obey'd, and thoſe rejected. What ſay you to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints,</hi> doth it not directly overthrow the pure
Worſhip of God, and Faith in him alone? Doth not the <hi>Maſs</hi>
directly overthrow the one and only Sacrifice of our Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Croſs?</hi> And ſo of the reſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Open-Atheiſme</hi> is, when men, both in Word and Deed deny
God and his Word. <hi>Colour'd Atheiſme</hi> is not ſo manifeſt, and
hath two Degrees. 1. When men acknowledge a God, a <hi>Firſt
Cauſe</hi> of Cauſes, or Infinite Being, that made and Governs the
World, but yet deny or are Ignorant of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and
<hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> Thus the <hi>Epheſians</hi> before they Believed the Goſpel
are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. and ſaid to be <hi>without God,</hi> (when
yet no doubt in their natural Judgment they acknowledged)
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57857:86"/>
becauſe they deny'd Chriſt. And in like manner though the
<hi>Samaritans</hi> Worſhipped the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet our Bleſſed
Saviour ſaith, <hi>They Worſhipped they knew not what,</hi> John 5. 46.
And the Pſalmiſt ſaith of all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that their Gods are
Idols.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Degree of this <hi>Colour'd Atheiſm,</hi> is when men do
rightly acknowledge the Unity of the Godhead in the Trinity
of Perſons; yet ſo as by neceſſary Conſequences, partly of
their Doctrine, and partly of the Service of God, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
that which they well maintained, And in this Reſpect, I
ſay, That the very <hi>Religion</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a kind of
<hi>Atheiſm.</hi> 'Tis true, every Papiſt is not ſo ſhameleſs as one of
their <hi>Popes,</hi> who, ſhewing ſome of his Confidents his Vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
Helliſhly ſaid, <hi>Quantas divitias nobis peperit haec Fabula
Chriſti! What a world of Riches has this Fable of Chriſt brought
us in!</hi> Yet the very Doctrines of their Church, if underſtood
and believed, directly tends to lead all thoſe of her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to the like, or as deſperate Impiety. For,</p>
               <p>1. Whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maketh the <hi>Merit</hi> of the
works of men to Concur with the Grace of God, it overthrows
the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> If it be of works, it is no more Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6.
whereas in words they own thoſe glorious Attributes the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi>
and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God to be <hi>Infinite,</hi> do they not by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
deny both? For how can that be <hi>Infinite Juſtice</hi> which
may any way be appeaſed by <hi>humane ſatisfaction?</hi> And how is
God's <hi>Mercy Infinite,</hi> when we by our own ſatisfactions muſt
add a <hi>ſupply</hi> to the ſatisfaction of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>He that hath not the Son, hath not the Father,</hi> John 21. 23.
and conſequently is an <hi>Atheiſt.</hi> Now the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
hath not the Son, that is, Jeſus Chriſt, God and Man,
the Mediator of Mankind, but hath transformed him into a
<hi>feigned</hi> Chriſt: For, inſtead of one Jeſus Chriſt in all things
like unto us in his Humanity, Sin only excepted, They have
framed a Chriſt, to whom they Aſcribe two kinds of Exiſting,
one <hi>Natural,</hi> whereby he is viſible, touchable, and Circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in Heaven, The other not only <hi>above,</hi> but alſo <hi>againſt</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by which he is ſubſtantially according to his <hi>Fleſh</hi> in the
hands of every Prieſt in every Hoſt, and in the mouth of every
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57857:86"/>
Communicant, inviſible, untouchable and uncircumſcribed, and
thus in effect they aboliſh his <hi>Man-hood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. They Degrade our bleſſed Lord of his <hi>Offices,</hi> and have
Committed <hi>High Treaſon</hi> againſt the King of Glory, and will
you contend that ſuch <hi>Arch Traitours</hi> are ſtill true Subjects?
For one Jeſus Chriſt, the only King, Lawgiver and Head of the
Church, They joyn unto him the <hi>Pope,</hi> not only as a <hi>Vicar,</hi> but
alſo as a <hi>Companion</hi> or Equal in Government. In that they give
unto him power to make <hi>Laws</hi> binding Conſcience, To reſolve
and determine infallibly the ſenſe of Holy Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For
one Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>only</hi> real <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the New Teſtament, they
joyn many <hi>Secondary Prieſts,</hi> who pretend to offer Chriſt daily
in the <hi>Maſs</hi> for the Sins of the Quick and the Dead. For one
Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>All ſufficient Mediator</hi> of Interceſſion, They
have added <hi>many</hi> other Companions to Intercede for us. And
for the only. <hi>Merits</hi> of Chriſt, in whom alone the Father is well
pleaſed, they have deviſed a <hi>Treaſury of the Church,</hi> containing
beſides the merits of Chriſt, the Over plus of the <hi>merits of
Saints</hi> to be diſpenſed to men at the <hi>Popes</hi> diſcretion. By all
which we ſee, That Chriſt, and conſequently God himſelf to
be worſhipped in Chriſt, is changed for a <hi>Fantaſie</hi> or Idol of
mans conceit.</p>
               <p>4. There is always, and will be a <hi>Proportion</hi> between the
worſhip of God and our perſwaſion of him; and men in give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto God any worſhip, have reſpect to his nature, that
both may be ſuitable, and he be well pleaſed. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now turn our Eyes, and behold with horror and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what manner of Worſhip the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion affordeth:
It is for the greateſt part, meer <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> without any allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
or command from God; as is in effect acknowledged by
their own <hi>Durandus</hi> in his <hi>Rationale,</hi> wherein he pretends to
give an Account of the Original, <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Myſtery</hi> of thoſe
Deviſes, and as <hi>we</hi> in ſeveral parts of <hi>this Work</hi> have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
proved. It is a fulſome Carnal Service, conſiſting of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
bodily <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> borrowed partly from
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and partly from the <hi>Heathen,</hi> it is divided between
God and ſome of his Creatures, in that they are Worſhipt
both with one kind of Worſhip, let them paint and diſſemble
it how they can with nice and unintelligible diſtinctions. Thus
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57857:87"/>
then, if by their manner of worſhipping we may judge how
they conceive (as moſt rationally we may) it will appear they
have plainly abandon'd the <hi>true God,</hi> and have ſet up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a <hi>Phantaſie</hi> of their own. For God is no otherwiſe to
be Conceived than he hath Revealed himſelf in his Creatures
and word, and ſpecially in Chriſt who is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the
Image of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. And <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> The
<hi>Character</hi> or <hi>lively figure of his perſon,</hi> Heb. 1. 3.</p>
               <p>I proceed to another Argument.—If the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which was once the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt</hi> have Committed Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the Bill of Divorce be long ſince ſued out, ſhe is no
longer to be called or counted a <hi>Spouſe</hi> or Church of Chriſt.
But ſhe hath plaid the Adultereſs, and the Divorce is paſs'd—
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath long ſince, and ſtill doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> (which is Spiritual <hi>Adultery, Jer.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 37.)
is notorious; I ſhall at preſent only Inſtance in three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
1. Becauſe they worſhip <hi>Saints</hi> and Angels with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worſhip, which without exception is proper and only
due to God; yea, they transform ſome of them into deteſtable
Idols, making them Mediators of Redemption, eſpecially the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom they call not only Lady, but Goddeſs
and Queen, whom Chriſt her Son Obeyeth in Heaven, a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatreſs,
our Life, our Hope, the Medicine of the Diſeaſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And pray unto her thus,— <q>Prepare thou Glory for us, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
us from our Enemies, and in the hour of Death receive
us, Looſe the Bands of the Guilty, bring Light to the Blind,
drive away all Devils, ſhew thy ſelf a Mother, by thy Mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Right Command thy Son to receive our Prayers.</q> See for
this the <hi>Roman</hi> Miſſal and Breviary, and <hi>Bellarm. L.</hi> 2. De
Sanctis, <hi>Ca.</hi> 1. 6. 2. Their Idolatry is manifeſt in that they
Worſhip Images, or (at leaſt to give them their Excuſe and
Evaſion into the Bargain) Worſhip in, at, and before Images,
having no Commandment ſo to do, but the contrary. They
alledge that they uſe and worſhip Images only in Remembrance
of God, but this it all one, as if an unchaſte Wife ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
many <hi>Gallants</hi> into her Houſe in the abſence of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and being caught in Bed with them ſhould anſwer, That
they were friends of her Husband, and that ſhe was ſo kind to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57857:87"/>
them only in remembrance of him. Would any man accept of
ſuch an Excuſe, much leſs will the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who is a <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
God, and hath ſworn that he will not have his Glory gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to another. 3. They are Guilty of Idolatry, and that too
more abſurd than the Heathens themſelves; For they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
a <hi>Breaden God.</hi> For if our Bleſſed Saviour according to his
Humanity, be abſent from the Earth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> undoubtedly he is;
For <hi>the Heavens muſt receive him until the times of the Reſtitution
of all things,</hi> Acts. 3. 21. Then the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Hoſt is as abominable
an Idol as ever was.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, a known Harlot may afterwards remain a
Wife, and be ſo termed, if ſhe be not actually Divorc'd? But
as to that, in the ſecond place, I anſwer, the Bill of Divorce
is long ſince Sued out; her Sins have ſeparated her, and her
God: We have it expreſly in the Word of God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.
You have her Apoſtacy exactly foretold and deſcribed—<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivableneſs
of unrighteouſneſs—ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould
believe a Lie,</hi> and what follows—<hi>That they all might be
damn'd,</hi> v. 12. So in the 13. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi>
Apoſtatiz'd Church is ſet forth by the name of the <hi>Beast.</hi>
And <hi>Ca.</hi> 14. 9. It is ſaid,—<hi>If any man Worſhip the Beaſt,
and his Image, and receive his Mark in his Forehead, or in his
Hand, he ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is
poured out without mixture into the Cup of his Indignation, and
he ſhall be tormented with Fire and Brimſtone in the preſence of
the Holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb. And the
Smoak of their torment Aſcendeth up for ever and ever, and
they have no Reſt Day nor Night, who Worſhip the Beaſt and his
Image, and whoſoever receiveth the Mark of his Name.</hi> And
therefore <hi>Ca.</hi> 18. 3. It is ſaid,—I heard a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſaying,—<hi>Go out of her my people,</hi> &amp;c. Since God hath
Commanded us to come out of Her, we may conclude her
utterly <hi>Divorc'd</hi> from God; for we may not wholly forſake
any people, till they forſake Chriſt. And therefore though
an <hi>Adultreſs,</hi> till publickly detected and caſt off, may paſs
for a Wife, yet after ſhe is Convicted, and the <hi>Divorcement</hi>
ſolemnly declared, ſhe ceaſeth to be a Wife, though ſhe
boaſt never ſo much of her Marriage in her youth, and
though ſhe can ſhew her <hi>Wedding Ring,</hi> yet all this will not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57857:88"/>
prove her in any ſort a Lawful Wife; nor intitle her to
any pretence of Claim to the Affections or Eſtates of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>But the Truth is, though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have thus
proved <hi>Diſloyal</hi> to her Lord, and committed <hi>Whoredome</hi> on
every <hi>high Hill,</hi> and under every <hi>Green Tree,</hi> yet with the
Strumpet mentioned by the Royal Preacher, She <hi>wipeth her
mouth,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>I have done no wickedneſs:</hi> For it hath of
late continually been her cunning, to make the <hi>Adorable Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
(under pretence of being ſtill his Spouſe) a Cover, and
<hi>Cloak</hi> of all her Abominations, (as a <hi>Subtle</hi> and Unreclaimable
<hi>Adultreſs,</hi> deals with her too long <hi>ſuffering</hi> and <hi>patient</hi> Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band)
That ſo ſhe may ſeem to be an honeſt <hi>Matron,</hi>
though indeed ſhe be a notable Strumpet. And this indeed
is the higheſt point of the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity.</hi>

the Apoſtatiz'd Congregation of Romaniſts, united to the
Pope as their Head, and guided in their Faith according to the
Canons of the Conventicle of <hi>Trent,</hi> and averr that all are
<hi>Damn'd</hi> eternally that do not joyn with them therein. 'Tis a
notable Rant to this purpoſe, of one of their Tribe, in a Book

they are no true Preachers. What are they then? Forſooth, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders,

and this is the charity which Roman Catholicks ſo much
boaſt of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:57857:90"/>
But God forbid Proteſtants ſhould entertain ſuch Sentiments,
we dare not pry into the Ark, the Lord, and the Lord only
knoweth who are his, we will not therefore preſume to paſs
a peremptory doom, or affirm that <hi>no Papiſt can be ſaved,</hi> but
this we may maintain with truth and ſafety, that none by that
Doctrine, which at this day according to the Canons of the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> is taught in the Papiſts Aſſemblies can come
to Salvation. Though ſtill we doubt not but in ſuch their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
there have been from time to time, and ſtill are, not
a few, who although out of weakneſs they have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with them, yet either they never gave an hearty Aſſent
to thoſe more grievous and fundamental Errors which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
taught, or were ignorant of them, or before their death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
them, and in the true Faith of Chriſt, though fullied
with many infirmities, they dye and are ſaved. For as of old
in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when it was moſt corrupt, there were ſtill many
there, who <hi>bowed not their knee to Baal,</hi> but did ſigh and cry
out, by reaſon of thoſe <hi>Abominations which were committed in
the midſt thereof.</hi> So there is no doubt but under the <hi>Papacy</hi>
ſuch at this day may be found, who though they dwell in the
<hi>Tents of Kedar,</hi> may yet be Heirs of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but theſe are
not properly ſaid to be of the Roman Church, though in it.</p>
               <p>Nor is this any thanks to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſhe prohibits
the true Doctrine of Salvation to be Preach'd, and advances
Errors that utterly make void the Goſpel, and ſuppoſe ſome
Predicant Friar or ſo, ſhould tranſgreſs the Rules of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent,</hi> and ſo Preach the Word of Life to the People, as
that Souls come thereby to be ſaved. For Example, ſay he
ſhall Preach unto them, that they muſt believe to be ſaved by
nothing but the merits and righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed
unto them. That they muſt not look to be ſaved by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
righteouſneſs, but by the only mercy of God to them
in Chriſt. That every one muſt have a particular Faith and
Affiance of his own, for the pardon of his ſins. That they
muſt Worſhip God only, and pray unto him, and that in
Chriſts name only. That there is no Sacrifice for ſin, but that
of Chriſt once offered upon the Croſs. That Chriſts Blood
doth ſo purge away ſin, as there remains no ſtain, nor puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after this Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, if any Friar ſhall dare Preach
thus, I deny not, but he may be an inſtrument of ſaving many
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57857:91"/>
Souls. But in the mean time does not he fall under the heavy
Curſes of the Tridentine Canons? Is not the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> ready
to clapp him up for an Heretick? Do theſe that have imbib'd
ſuch his ſound Doctrines dare avouch them, or are not they
forc'd to recant and do pennance for the ſame? So that if any
by ſome ſpecial providence, ſecret power, and unlimited mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall come ſo to believe, as
thereby to be ſaved, both he and his Faith are diſavowed, as
not being the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but accounted and
accurſed by her as Heretical.</p>
               <p>Therefore as we deny not but ſome particular perſons, that
outwardly ſeem of the Church of <hi>Rome's</hi> Communion, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
everlaſting Life, ſo we cannot but look upon the generality
of them in a very deplorable caſe, and their Souls in unſpeakable
danger; for the reaſons following.</p>
               <p>1. God ſaith expreſly in his word, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. That if any man
<hi>worſhip the Beaſt, and his Image, and receive his Mark in his
Forehead, or in his Hand, he ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath
of God.</hi> And afterwards, he ſaith, <hi>all ſuch ſhall be tormented
in Fire and Brimſtone.</hi> Now whoever is joyned or reconciled
to the Pope, and ſubmitteth himſelf to the Laws and Kingdom
of Antichriſt, doth Worſhip the Beaſt and his Image. Whoever
openly profeſſeth Popery, receiveth the Popes Mark in his <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>
Whoever yieldeth to the practiſe of the Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
receiveth his Mark in his <hi>Hand.</hi> Let them therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how they will avoid the Judgment threatned.</p>
               <p>2. Our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. Teacheth us that
<hi>ſuch worſhip God in vain, as teach for Doctrines the Precepts of
men;</hi> But the Doctrine of Popery, as it addeth to Antient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion, is nothing but a <hi>Maſs</hi> of humane Inventions,
Deviſes and Precepts. Their <hi>Decretals</hi> are the Popes conceits,
their Forms of Worſhip contained in the <hi>Miſſals</hi> and <hi>Breviaries,</hi>
are meerly Humane. From mans deviſe proceeded the Popiſh
Worſhip of Angels, Saints, Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moſt part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
of Caſes of Conſcience, is grounded on the Popes Laws.
Finally, the turnings, skippings, heavings, greaſings, ſpittings,
and other Ceremonies of Maſs-Prieſts, and their Followers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from man's invention. Popery therefore by Chriſts rule is
nothing but <hi>vanity,</hi> wearineſs and vexation of Souls, whilſt they
ſeek to ſerve God, not according to his appointments, but their
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57857:91"/>
own fond imaginations, and how ſhall a vain Religion bring any
man to heaven?</p>
               <p>3. We read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. <hi>Without are Doggs,</hi> and that <hi>Enchanters,
Whore-mongers, Murtherers, Idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and
maketh a lie, ſhall be excluded out of the Kingdom of God.</hi> Now,
how like two Dogs do the Pope and his Adherents refuſe and
bark at Gods word, and bite and tear thoſe to pieces, who ſeek
to feed them with the <hi>Bread of Life.</hi> Not a few of the Popes have
been <hi>Magicians</hi> and <hi>Necromancers;</hi> as <hi>Benet</hi> the 9. <hi>Gregory</hi> the
6. and 7. <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the 2. <hi>Paul</hi> the 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And one of their Offices
in their Church, is that of an <hi>Exorciſt</hi> or <hi>Conjurer.</hi> They permit
publick <hi>Stews,</hi> allow Concubines, and to Monks, Friars and Maſs-Prieſts
forbid Lawful Marriage. They have murdered and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred
millions of Chriſtians to erect and uphold their Anti-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Kingdom. They ſet up <hi>Idols</hi> in Churches, and every corner
of their ſtreets, and in high-ways, giving Divine Honour to the
<hi>Croſs,</hi> and to the Images of the Trinity, and calling the Sacrament
<hi>their Lord and God;</hi> and making <hi>Vows,</hi> Prayers and Confeſſions to
Saints, and burning Incenſe to Images, and ſaying Maſs in Honour
of Saints and Angels. Finally, they do not only <hi>make</hi> and delight
in <hi>Lies,</hi> as forging not only horrid ſlanders againſt <hi>M. Luther,
Zwinglius, Calvin,</hi> and other ſincere Preachers of Gods word, but
alſo againſt all Proteſtants, aſſerting that we teach, That <hi>God is
the Author of Sin,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt deſpaired,</hi> That there is <hi>no Hell</hi> but
horror of Conſcience, That <hi>good works</hi> are not to be practiſed or
commended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which we expreſly deteſt; Therefore theſe
wickedneſſes in <hi>Papiſts,</hi> not being ſo much the ſins of particular
private men, as the natural conſequences of their Tenets and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
avowed Practiſes of their pretended <hi>Church,</hi> muſt needs
render the condition of any Soul in that Communion very <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi>
and hazardous.</p>
               <p>4. No man can come to God the Father, but by Jeſus Chriſt, as
our Lord teſtifieth of himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 14. Who alſo ſheweth, That <hi>he
is the way, the truth and the life:</hi> And by his holy Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
teacheth us, That there is no Mediator betwixt God and Man, but
<hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> But contrary hereunto the Papiſts vainly
hope and imagine to come to God, not only by Chriſt, but alſo
by the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> by <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints;</hi> They alſo ſeek out
new ways, and content not themſelves with ſuch as the infinite
wiſdom of our Lord preſcribed unto us, and do fooliſhly believe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57857:92"/>
that the Pope by his <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and every Hedg-Prieſt by mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
over his <hi>Maſſes,</hi> is able to redeem mens Souls.</p>
               <p>5. Whoever buildeth his Faith upon <hi>other foundation</hi> than
the Doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets, doth build upon the
Sand, and not upon ſuch a firm foundation, as will abide in the
day of the Lord. But the Papiſts generally build their Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Popes <hi>Decretals,</hi> upon unwritten and <hi>uncertain</hi> Traditions,
upon falſe pretended Miracles, lying <hi>Legends,</hi> and ſilly Fables;
do they not then build upon ruinous foundations, and if ſo, what
is like to become of the Superſtructure?</p>
               <p>6. By their own <hi>Canon Law,</hi> Chapt. ſi papa. diſt. 40. 'tis affirm'd,
<hi>That the Pope may be remiſs and negligent in his Office, and ſilent in
teaching, and lead innumerable people with him into Hell:</hi> Now if the
Papiſts are to adhere to the Pope as their Head, and to follow him,
how can they eſcape when he leadeth them into Hell? So that if
they know not, or will not believe the Scriptures, nor any other
Arguments, yet their own <hi>Decrees may</hi> teach them, that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Pope, innumerable Papiſts run <hi>blindfold</hi> and <hi>headlong</hi> into
Perdition.</p>
               <p>7. How is it poſſible that they ſhould be <hi>ſaved,</hi> who are Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the <hi>means</hi> of their Salvation, who hold damnable Hereſies
repugnant to the Apoſtles Doctrine, whoſe Faith is Faction, and
their Practiſes Idolatry, Perjury, Treaſons, Maſſacres, and all kind
of Abomination, and this conniv'd at, promoted, excuſed, juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nay commended and applauded by their Church, as means to
propagate the Goſpel. But all this is too true of the Papiſts at this
day, and therefore what Scripture grounds have we of hope, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they ſpeedily repent and depart from theſe Abominations.</p>
               <p>But if any man ſhall ask, what then is become of all thoſe, that either
<hi>now die,</hi> or in times paſt are dead in places where Popery is or hath been
profeſſed? We anſwer, ſecret things belong to God, we dare not pretend
to ſentence thoſe that are gone, but would <hi>caution</hi> ſuch as ſurvive. Of
thoſe that held the foundation and lived good lives, we hope well; nor
were ſeveral of the moſt deſtructive errors ever inforc'd upon the belief of
men, before the Conventicle of <hi>Trent;</hi> and there may, and no dobut are
many amongſt the Papiſts at this day, who though conforming to them in
outward Ceremonies, yet hold not the errors of Popery poſitively, but keep
themſelves to the old Apoſtolick Faith, and of ſuch perſons Salvation we
have no cauſe to deſpair. God grant that the reſt alſo may ſee their deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and upon what a dreadful precipice they ſtand, and revoke their errors,
and hearken to the call of God to <hi>come out of Babylon,</hi> leſt they are partakers
of her plagues, and joyn themſelves with a ſincere heart to the true Church
of God, and ſo be ſaved.</p>

as one individual or ſingular thing, for though indeed it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57857:94"/>
be divided into ſeveral Articles of which it conſiſts, yet it is
conceived by themſelves as one intire Body, becauſe they are
all knit together by the ſame Bond; namely, by being aſſented
to and believed upon one and the ſame reaſon, and all to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
on pain of the ſame <hi>Anathema</hi>—Thus <hi>Fiſher</hi> the Jeſuite
(under the Mask of <hi>A. D.</hi>) in his Treatiſe of Faith, <hi>Ca.</hi> 4.
— <q>Faith muſt be intire, whole and ſound in all points, and
it is not ſufficient ſtedfaſtly to believe ſome points, miſ-belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or not believing other ſome or any one.</q> —For not to
believe any one Point whatſoever, which God by revealing it,
doth teſtify to be true, and which by his Church he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to believe, muſt needs be <hi>damnable,</hi> as being a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Injury to Gods Verity, and a great diſobedience to his
Will.—And that <hi>Chamaelion</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Spalatto,</hi> when
he was return'd to his Vomit in his <hi>Conſilium Reditûs</hi> p. 20. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
the ſame.—All Articles (ſaith he) of Faith determined
by the Church are fundamental, none of them may be deny'd
without Hereſie.—Thus every Member of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
muſt as ſtedfaſtly and abſolutely believe the leaſt point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
Images, Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> delivered by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
as the greateſt myſteries of the Godhead, Trinity, Incarnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And if he deny any of the former, he is no leſs an Heretick, than
if he deny'd any of the latter: Yea, though he believe all that
they propound to be believed, ſave ſome one, he is for want of
believing that one (if he know that the Church propounds it to
be believed) a Miſcreant or Miſ-believer: The reaſon of which
is this, that if the Church may err in one thing, it may err in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and ſo can be no ſure foundation of Faith.</p>
               <p>Now to <hi>refuſe the Faith of the Church of</hi> Rome, is nothing elſe,

but to abhor it as falſe; not of every particular point, but of all

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon pain of Damnation</hi> are not ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57857:94"/>
as if we preſumed to pronounce ſentence of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
againſt all that continue in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we have
diſclaim'd ſuch Temerity; but thereby is meant, that the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that Doctrin as a matter of Faith, is a thing in it ſelf dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
that is, ſuch as maketh a man liable to damnation. How it
ſhall fall out with particular men in the event, we neither know,
nor take upon us to inquire, only we ſay, that their miſ-belief is
ſuch a ſin, as ſetteth them in a ſtate of Damnation.</p>
               <p>To prove this, we muſt conſider,</p>
               <p>That there are <hi>Two</hi> ways, by which ſin leadeth a man into
the ſtate of damnation: The <hi>one</hi> is, the <hi>deſert</hi> or fitneſs it hath
to procure damnation: The <hi>other</hi> is, the <hi>actual meriting</hi> or deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Salvation. Into the former, ſin caſteth a man off it ſelf.
Into the latter he falleth as by ſin, ſo by the Ordinance or Decree
of God who hath laid the penalty of Damnation upon it. Hence
ariſeth this Argument againſt receiving the Faith of the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which maketh a man unclean in Gods ſight, hath a fitneſs to
procure Damnation: For unclean things are unmeet for the preſence
of God, and conſequently meet for Damnation;—But the Faith of
the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>maketh a man unclean in the ſight of God:</hi>
For it is erroneous in ſo high a nature (as we have proved that
it makes a man guilty of <hi>High Treaſon</hi> againſt God, by Inſtalling
the <hi>Pope</hi> in the Throne of God, giving him Power and Authority
to determine as a Judge what is matter of Faith, and what not,
without any Commiſſion or Warrant from God. Nor do they only
give him authority to Interpret the Scripures, but alſo allow him
to ſet up a <hi>Forge</hi> [of Tradition] where he Hammers what he liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and Vends it to be received upon pain of Damnation, for the
word of the ever living God. What is it to fulfill that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>To ſit in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf
that he is God,</hi> if this be not? And muſt not all they needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
to this High Treaſon, that acknowledge ſuch his Uſurp'd
Authority, and yield obedience to it? Or how can it be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
denied, that there is a worthineſs and fitneſs in the Faith of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to procure Damnation?</p>
               <p>Therefore nothing remains but the <hi>Ordinance</hi> or Decree of
God, to appoint Damnation as a puniſhment of this ſin, according
to the deſert thereof. But that was paſſed long ſince by the Lord
himſelf—<hi>You ſhall put nothing to the word which I command you,</hi>

add to him the Plagues that are written in this Book.</hi> But more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
2 Theſ. 2. 11, &amp; 12. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions,

Damnation by his Sentence that believe <hi>Lies</hi> (that is) falſe and
erroneous Doctrin, nor agreeable to the Truth which they ought

of the Church of <hi>Rome damnable,</hi> and the Profeſſors thereof liable

Lord hath <hi>decreed,</hi> that they which believe it, ſhould have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <p>Since therefore it thus plainly appears, that every man is
bound upon pain of Salvation, to <hi>refuſe</hi> the Faith of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> in what a deſperate caſe are thoſe that continue in it?
'Tis not for nothing that the Almighty God of Love and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
makes Proclamation by his <hi>Sacred Herauld,</hi> Rev. 18. 4. <hi>Come
out of her people, leſt ye periſh with her, and partake of her Plagues.</hi>
We have a famous example in that depravation of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and ſetting up of Idolatry under <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 2 Chron. 11. 14.
The <hi>Levites</hi> [that dwelt amongſt thoſe Revolted 10 Tribes] <hi>left
their Suburbs and their Poſſeſſions that belonged unto them</hi> [a great
Act of ſelf-denial] <hi>and came to</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to do the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Lord in the Temple there.</hi> And after their example many
people out of all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (that abhorred <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s
Idolatry) came thither alſo for the true worſhip of God: They
knew to abide amongſt Idolaters would bring them to deſtruction.</p>

baptized into a Reformed Church, engaged for by Proteſtant
Sponſors, Educated by Religious Parents, and under the ſweet

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57857:95"/>
fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Adverſary. He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes <hi>Law died without Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
under two or three witneſſes; of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe
ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under Foot the Son

the Blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified an unholy
thing</hi> [imperfect without the Virgins Milk and Saints Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons]
<hi>and hath done deſpite unto the ſpirit of Grace.</hi>—As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
argues in the ſame Caſe, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 27.</p>
               <p>It is reported by <hi>Ireneus</hi> cont. Haereſ. L 3. Ca. 3. And by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi>
in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory L. 3. Ca. 25. That Holy and
Beloved Apoſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> when he ſpied <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Heretick
in the Bath where he was, made all the haſte he could poſſible to
be gone, apprehending it dangerous to be under the ſame Roof
with him. Yea the very Heathen (as <hi>Tully de natura deorum</hi> L 3.
witneſſes) being at Sea in a violent ſtorm, were much afraid of
being Ship-wrackt, becauſe they had <hi>Diagoras</hi> the Atheiſt abord
amongſt them. I would to God ſome Proteſtants were but as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for their Souls, as (I ſay not the Apoſtle, but) the Heathen
were for their Bodies, and uſed the ſame diſcreet caution to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for their Eternal Salvation, as they had to procure their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
ſafety. Neither was the Apoſtle any thing concern'd in the
Impiety of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> or theſe Heathens with that of <hi>Diagoras,</hi>
and yet both He and They doubted ſome evil might befall them
becauſe they were in the Company of ſuch profane wretches?
And can any Proteſtant Imagine, that he may be free from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
though he joyn in Faith with the <hi>Pope</hi> that great Anti-chriſt,
though he harbour thoſe <hi>Locuſts, Prieſts and Jeſuites,</hi> and converſe
daily with them, and hearken to their Syren Muſick, and Imbibe
their <hi>gilded poyſon,</hi> out of that <hi>Cup of Fornication</hi> wherewith they
have Intoxicated the Kings of the Earth? No, No, touching of
Pitch always defileth. It coſt <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> dear, though he were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
a good King for going to War with Idolatrous <hi>Ahab</hi>
againſt a common enemy. For what ſaid <hi>Hanani</hi> the Seer, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
19. 2. <hi>Wouldſt thou help the wicked, and love them that hate the Lord?
Therefore for this thing, the wrath of the Lord is upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then may they look for, who like the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> are
lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, altogether indifferent whether
they be <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> prepared to ſhift their Religion, as

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57857:96"/>
to declare beforehand, that they <hi>had rather be Papiſts,</hi> than joyn
with any of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Proteſtant Churches beyond the Seas,
that <hi>ſcoff</hi> at the very name <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and make it the beſt part
of their Religion to <hi>ſwear and damn</hi> and rail againſt, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

it be through the error or weakneſs of their Conſcience) come
up to the uſage of ſome inſignificant Ceremonies acknowledged
to be indifferent, though otherwiſe ſound in their Faith, Loyal
to their King, readily paying all Taxes, uſeful to the publick, and
peaceable to their Neighbors, whilſt at the ſame time theſe high

<hi>And therefore we ſay, ſhe</hi> [the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>] <hi>ought to be forſaken
of all, who would be ſaved; as the Synagogue of Antichriſt and Satan,
it is not any Church at all,</hi> nullam in eâ ſalutem in eâ ſperandam

and this we averr they cannot do, without great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
ſin. For,</p>
               <p>1. Though God, by the wiſe Preacher ſaith to every man,
<hi>My Son, give me thy heart,</hi> and that without the <hi>inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
all external Poſtures of Devotion are vain, yet it is alſo
true, that God requires the <hi>whole Man,</hi> and we muſt ſerve him
with our Bodies, as well as with our Spirits; for which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his Holy Word Aſſigns the Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>one</hi>
as well as the other is <hi>his,</hi> ſince our Bodies are <hi>Redeemed</hi> with
the Blood of a Crucified Jeſus of infinite value, ſhall we dare to
proſtitute the ſame before an Idol? ſince they ought to be
<hi>Temples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> will you pollute them with abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Sacriledge? ſince they are deſigned for a bleſſed Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and to be partakers of <hi>Divine Glory:</hi> How vile a thing
is it to <hi>ſully</hi> them with aſſiſting at loathſome Superſtitions.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> envying againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> uſes this very Argument.
—Your Bodies are <hi>Members of Chriſt;</hi> how monſtrouſly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then is it to make them <hi>Members of an Harlot?</hi> when the
Lord ſpeaks of his faithful Servants, he Characterizeth them
by this ſpecial note. They <hi>have not bow'd the Knee to</hi> Baal, <hi>nor
have kiſſed his Hand.</hi> He might have ſaid, they are not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with Superſtition, or they do not <hi>own Baal for God,</hi>
but to expreſs that the ſame was not enough, the Holy Spirit
by name declares, that they have not ſo much as by <hi>outward
geſture</hi> exhibited any worſhip to the Idol, and does he not by
this Deſcription admoniſh us alſo to abſtain from all ſuch Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if we would be accounted of the number of his people?</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, you keep your <hi>hearts</hi> right to God, and
whatever others do, you fix your Devotion on him, and know
that 'tis abomination to direct your prayers unto, or to expect
help from an <hi>Idol,</hi> and therefore you addreſs your prayers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to God, though with your Face directed towards an Image.
With this very pretence, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of old endeavoured to
excuſe themſelves, when <hi>Paul</hi> reprehended this Crime in them,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. They went to the <hi>Feaſts</hi> which were kept in honour of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57857:98"/>
Idols, and with others were partakers of thoſe ſolemn Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.
But did they do this ſuperſtitiouſly? No, for <hi>Paul,</hi> as
in their perſon, brings in this excuſe,—<hi>We know that an Idol
is nothing, whatever men eſteem it, and that there is but one God.</hi>
But the Apoſtle does not take this for a ſufficient Plea, but tells
them, that for all that, a weak Brother that ſees them, may
conclude that they do it in honour to the Idol, and ſo by your
example may be tempted to Idolatry. When the wicked Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the Devil, whoever in ſuch an action mixes himſelf with
them, adjoyns himſelf to the Devil, you cannot at once be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the Lords Table, and of the Table of Devils, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
chuſes the one, muſt of neceſſity renounce the other.</p>
               <p>Were ſuch evaſions of a good Intention to be allow'd, how
raſhly and fooliſhly did <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Companions expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
Could not they thus have concluded amongſt themſelves,
others indeed will Worſhip the Image which the King hath
ſet up, but we though we bow before it, will ſtill Worſhip
the living God. In the mean time to avoid danger, we will
go with the Crowd, and pretend to do, as they do, would
ſuch a Cavil have excuſed them before God? ſure none will
dare to ſay it. What then, ſhall we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame them for an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
Zeal, that they would rather be caſt into a fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
than by diſſembling, derogate from the Honour of God?
This we cannot do, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt expreſly commends
them for this noble Reſolution and Conſtancy, and Heaven
gave Teſtimony to it by a Miracle; and what is written is for
Example and Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>But how witty is man to find out Gloſſes and Colours to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
his Crimes; ſome fancy to eyade all this by ſaying: Theſe
things are true of Heathen ſuperſtitions, who ſinned not only in
uſing ill Ceremonies, but alſo by Worſhipping falſe Gods,
and therefore 'tis no wonder, if the Lord did ſo abominate
their Rites, but this is nothing to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for though the
Worſhip of God be corrupted amongſt them, yet they have
no other intention but to Worſhip the true God.</p>
               <p>But to this, I anſwer, whenever the World goes about to
Worſhip God in a perverſe and unlawful manner, at the ſame
Inſtant it Adores an Idol with whatſoever varniſh it may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
its impiety. In vain do thoſe that ſet up Superſtitions
Condemned by God, alleadge that they mean thereby to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57857:99"/>
God; for ſince that the Lord neither hath inſtituted, nor
will accept thereof, ſuch Worſhip is exhibited to the Devil,
rather than to him; For which cauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking
of thoſe who turn' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Corruptible Image,

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Brazen
Serpent was not made by the <hi>Capricio</hi> of men, but by the
Command of God; nor was it only a <hi>Symbol</hi> of a Divine Benefit,
but alſo a Type of Chriſt. In after-times this was abuſed to
Idolatry, nor did that abuſe want a ſpecious pretext of the
name of God: Now ſuppoſe any one had feigned to Worſhip
that Serpent to accommodate himſelf to the Superſtition of
the Rabble, would any ſay he were guiltleſs? The Golden
Calf was made by <hi>Aaron</hi> to repreſent the true God; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt God's Command, and contrary to Truth, the Lord
pronounc'd it Idolatry. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s
<hi>Calves,</hi> for he did not pretend to Introduce any <hi>new God,</hi>
only ſet up thoſe Figures to prevent his people's going up to
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to pay their Devotion, whereby he thought the
State of his Kingdom would be endangered, yet ſtill it was
groſs <hi>Idolatry,</hi> becauſe he inſtituted a Rite without warrant
from the Word of God, and contrary to the Divine Command.
Now if any one had offered Sacrifice there, not cordially, but
only in Complement to the King, would he have been inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent?
or do we read of any of the Servants of God, paying
their Devotions there? or rather on the contrary, do not we
find that God by his Prophets continually did forbid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the ſame? Was the Temple at <hi>Samaria</hi> Dedicated to
<hi>Jove</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> to <hi>Baal</hi> or <hi>Aſhdod?</hi> No, no, 'twas Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>God of Iſrael;</hi> but was it ever the more lawful to
Worſhip there? Secret Idolatry though varniſh't with the
name of God, is prohibited, as well as that which is <hi>open,</hi> as
was that of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the better to underſtand wherein, and how far it may
be lawful for a Chriſtian to whom God hath made known the
Abominations which abound in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with them, we muſt note, that of thoſe things wherein
they place the Worſhip of God, ſome are inventions directly
<hi>contrary to God's Word,</hi> ſome other are <hi>depraved</hi> and corrupted
by latter uſe, though originally not evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:57857:99"/>
2. Some of their Ceremonies are in no ſort to be excuſed,
ſince they contain apparent Idolatry, others are <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,</hi>
which yet do not defile a man, unleſs he have entertained
a Superſtitious Opinion in obſerving them.</p>
               <p>3. Some things are there wickedly Impoſed and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which yet a man may obſerve without offence; others
which neither can, nor <hi>ought</hi> in any manner to be obſerved.
I ſhall not enlarge on each of theſe, 'tis enough in general to
have hinted them, and to ſhew that I intend not to forbid a
Chriſtian Man wholly and without exception from Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in any Rite, Ceremony or Obſervation
whatſoever: I only ſhew the danger of being partakers with
them in what is plainly evil.</p>
               <p>As for Example, <hi>Maſs</hi> is every day ſaid, thoſe that would
appear Religious go thither, can this be excuſed? A Perſon
but meanly inſtructed in the Goſpel, cannot but know that
that action is abominable Sacriledge. For how can any man
bow down before an Idol (their Breaden God is no more)
with a deſign that all preſent ſhall think that he does it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly,
and not ſin grievouſly in ſo doing. If this be not
Criminal, what means that of the Holy Ghoſt, whereby we
are forbidden to have any Communion with the unfruitful
works of darkneſs, but rather to reprove them. I ſee a
wicked work adoing, and odious to God, I thruſt my ſelf
in, and make as if I approv'd it, with what Face, with
what Fore-head can I afterwards deny, that in ſo doing I
have ſinned? For what is this, but to boaſt with thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
ones of whom <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Let us do whatever we liſt,
God ſeeth not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay, though you freely confeſs, that in the
<hi>Maſs</hi> there be many corruptions, yet in your Opinion it is
a <hi>Remembrance</hi> of the Lords Supper, and in that reſpect you
come there to be put in mind of our Lords Death. But tell
us, I pray, what <hi>Similitude</hi> hath the Sacrament inſtituted by
our Lord, with this <hi>Mock-Shew.</hi> For Firſt, The <hi>Papiſts</hi> Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
their Maſs to be a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which reconciles to God
not only the <hi>Living,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Dead,</hi> and is this think
you nothing? Secondly, The <hi>Canon,</hi> a principal part of the
<hi>Maſs,</hi> is ſtufft full of Execrable Blaſphemies. Thirdly, Herein
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57857:100"/>
are <hi>Prayers</hi> offered up for the <hi>Dead</hi> tormented in <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
which we know to be altogether Superſtitious. Fourthly,
Were there nothing elſe amiſs but that Diabolical Fiction,
whereby they think that Chriſt is there <hi>offered up to God;</hi>
That by that Act, the Sins both of the Living and the
Dead may be Expiated; is not this to deny the Death of
Chriſt? which is made of no value, unleſs it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be the <hi>one only</hi> and <hi>perpetual Sacrifice.</hi> And is
not the Lords Supper hereby Prophaned? Theſe Pollutions
can no more be ſeparated from the <hi>Maſs,</hi> than heat from
Fire: And whoever comes to participate thereof, can he be
pure and clean, doing ſuch a filthy work; Is this the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
we give to <hi>God</hi> our Father? This the <hi>gratitude</hi> we
pay to Chriſt our Redeemer? That when we ſee them both
thus reproach'd and diſhonoured, we not only do oppoſe,
but joyn our ſelves Companions in the Wickedneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
others by our <hi>Example</hi> to do the like.</p>

at the <hi>Popiſh Maſs;</hi> he needs only conſider the
horrible <hi>Idolatry</hi> that is there committed, where a
bit of Bread is <hi>adored</hi> for God, and no longer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
Bread, but God himſelf. 'Tis moſt true, were the
<hi>Lords Supper</hi> there rightly Adminiſtred, there would then be
there a <hi>true Exhibition</hi> of the Lords Body and Blood, but it
would not therefore follow, either that the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the
Bread is chang'd into the Body, or that the Body lies <hi>included</hi>
under the Bread: For the end of Inſtituting that Sacred Supper,
is to elevate our Minds to Heaven, not to detain them in the
viſible Elements; but indeed by what right does that promiſe.
—<hi>This is my Body which ſhall be delivered for you,</hi>—at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57857:102"/>
to the Maſs? Before our Lord promiſes any thing there of
that kind, he commands the Sacrament <hi>to be diſtributed</hi> amongſt
the Faithful. Is this done in the Maſs? No, but on the clean
contrary, the Prieſt diſpatches it all alone as a <hi>private</hi> affair, and
on ſuch a manner, as if he purpoſely meant to <hi>Excommunicate</hi>
himſelf from the whole Congregation. Chriſt adds another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that we ſhould <hi>do This in remembrance</hi> of him, ſhewing
forth the ineſtimable benefit of his Death with <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi>
But how can this be done in the Maſs, where <hi>not one word</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood?
but all things are <hi>whiſper'd</hi> by the Prieſt with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
murmur and unknown. Furthermore, the Lord directs
his word to his Diſciples, when reaching forth the viſible ſign,
Bread, he promiſes them the Communion of his Body, but in
the Maſs there is no ſuch thing, but the Prieſt after the manner
of Conjurers or <hi>Jugglers,</hi> blows upon the Bread [<hi>ſufflation</hi> they
call it] that with a ſecret Exorciſm he may <hi>Inchant</hi> it. And
what is there in all this of God's Inſtitution? can day and night
be more different than our <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and this <hi>Romiſh</hi> Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?
What then ſhall we account the <hi>Adoration</hi> paid there to
the Bread? Muſt we not confeſs it <hi>execrable Idolatry,</hi> more groſs
than ever was practiſed amongſt the Heathen? and if ſo, tell us
with what fore-head, with what <hi>Conſcience</hi> can any Chriſtian
man dare reſort thereunto, that he may ſeem to <hi>Conform,</hi> and
do as others do? Here's an <hi>Idol</hi> erected to that very purpoſe,
that it may be Worſhipped and Invoked in God's ſtead, I come,
and down on my knees, and publickly profeſs to adore it, what
Fig-leaves, what excuſes, what evaſions can palliate ſo ſhameleſs
a wickedneſs?</p>
               <p>But let us in ſome <hi>other</hi> particulars conſider what theſe <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
men</hi> muſt do, if for ſiniſter ends, and <hi>temporal reſpects,</hi> they
will, againſt the convictions of their Conſciences, joyn in outward

your ſelf in theſe Profanations, and countenance them with your
preſence and complying approbation, and yet hope to eſcape
<hi>guiltleſs</hi> in the terrible judgment of a <hi>jealous God,</hi> who is of purer
Eyes than to behold <hi>vanity,</hi> or connive at ſin? There is none of
us (I ſpeak of thoſe to whom God hath vouchſafed the Light of
his <hi>Goſpel</hi>) but is well ſatisfied, that the <hi>Obſequies</hi> of the dead,
as they are practiſed amongſt the Papiſts, with the Maſſes attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them and other appurtenances, are meer <hi>abominations,</hi> as well,
becauſe they are falſly feigned againſt the manifeſt word of God,
as more eſpecially becauſe they extenuate and depreciate the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and <hi>vertue of the Death and Paſſion</hi> of our Bleſſed Saviour. But
now if it happen any of your Relations, Friends or Neighbours
dye, you that call your ſelf a Chriſtian come with others to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the <hi>Funeral,</hi> you are prefent at the <hi>Maſſes,</hi> and pretend
with the reſt to pray for the <hi>Soul of the deceaſed;</hi> dare you offer
to juſtify all this? if it be your <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> that is departed,
you will preſently be ſmelt out for an Heretick, if you do not
only approve of this Sacriledge, but <hi>purchaſe</hi> it with your money,
and give ſo many <hi>ſhillings</hi> to ſome Prieſts to ſay ſo many Maſſes to
redeem their Souls out of Purgatory. I will not mention the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Superſtitions you muſt run through at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> when you
muſt proſtrate your ſelf before the <hi>Vicar of Antichriſt,</hi> ſome
wicked <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſt, who by the authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> gives
you Abſolution, and injoyns you pennance, which perhaps may
it ſelf be as great a <hi>ſin</hi> as any you have committed; as to murmur
over ſo many <hi>Ave Maria</hi>'s, to ſay ſo many Prayers before a <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix,</hi>
to buy ſo many <hi>Maſſes, &amp;c.</hi> and to what end all this, why,
forſooth, that thereby as ſo many Compenſations you may <hi>ſatisfie
God</hi> for your ſins; if this can be approved and juſtified, I know
not what ought to be Condemned.</p>
               <p>But furthermore when a man has thus ſpun out his days in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
and liv'd in this filth, the laſt <hi>Scene</hi> is ſtill the worſt in
the Tragedy, and that is when he comes <hi>to dye;</hi> then come the
Prieſts and the Monks, the Devils <hi>Fans</hi> to Winnow him like
Wheat, and though he knows they are the very <hi>Locuſts</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
out of the <hi>bottomleſs pit,</hi> yet out of complaiſance he muſt
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57857:103"/>
ſeem to hearken unto them, to be ſatisfied with their gibberiſh
prayers, to be content with their lew'd <hi>Abſolution</hi> and ridiculous
<hi>extream unction,</hi> and under what throws and pangs and <hi>torture</hi>s
of Conſcience muſt ſuch a poor ſoul lye, when he perceives he
muſt immediately appear before the Tribunal of that Judge, whoſe
Truth he dares not to acknowledge, eſpecially when this Sentence
ſhall Eccho in his Ears, that Chriſt ſhall diſown all thoſe as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of his Kingdom, who have here been aſhamed to confeſs
him before men.</p>
               <p>But how fond are we to indulge our ſins, and what ſorry <hi>Shields</hi>
will men make uſe of rather than not have ſome colour of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
for their crimes? Theſe <hi>Nicodemites,</hi> theſe colloguing
Hypocrites, who think they can make a <hi>match</hi> between Light
and Darkneſs, and at once paſs Homage both to Chriſt and
<hi>Belial,</hi> that they may ſeem <hi>cum ratione Inſanire</hi> to offend God
with warrant from his own word, plead Scripture (the Divel
did ſo of old) for their practice, and alleadge the example of
<hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 5. who being Miraculouſly Cured
of his Leproſy, came to acknowledg the true God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
and reſolv'd not to Worſhip any other Deity, for ſo ſaith he to
the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> v. 17. <hi>Thy Servant will henceforth Offer
neither Burnt Offering nor Sacrifice unto other Gods, but unto the
the Lord.</hi> But then in the next verſe he comes with this
Reſerve—<hi>In this thing the Lord Pardon thy Servant, that when
my Maſter goeth into the houſe of</hi> Rimmon <hi>to Worſhip there, and
he leaneth on my hand, and I bow my ſelf in the houſe of</hi> Rimmon, <hi>the
Lord pardon thy Servant in this thing.—And the Prophet ſaid unto
him—depart in Peace.</hi>—Which ſay theſe men, implies an <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi>
or leave for him ſo to do; if therefore it were permitted
for him rather than loſe the favour of the King his Maſter, to
wait on him into an Idols Temple, and bow down and pay the
external ſigns of Worſhip there, ſtill keeping his heart upright to
the Lord; why may not we for like reaſons aſſiſt at <hi>Maſs,</hi> ſince
in our hearts we contemn and abhor it.</p>
               <p>This is the full force of the Objection. To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. My friend, thou that makeſt uſe of this Plea, I cannot but
admire ſince in the word of God thou haſt a <hi>general road,</hi> the Kings
High way plainly ſet forth by commands, and <hi>hedg'd in</hi> with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions
not to depart from it, and trackt by all the Troops of
Pilgrims to the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wherein thou canſt not err; why
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57857:103"/>
doſt thou rather chuke to decline and ſtart aſide after this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Example, as into a <hi>By-path</hi> rarely troden, where eaſily thou
may'ſt go aſtray? How comeſt thou ſo <hi>Eagle ey'd</hi> to diſcover
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e private <hi>paſsages,</hi> and ſmall <hi>Chinks</hi> and <hi>Creviſes,</hi> and yet art
ſo blind thou canſt not ſee the <hi>Door?</hi> Canſt thou be ignorant that
'tis a very dangerous thing to follow <hi>particular Examples</hi> without
ſome other Warrant? For ſometimes to ſome perſons God as by
a ſingular priviledge hath permitted that, which to all in general
he hath forbidden. And many things he <hi>ſuffers,</hi> which he does not
approve: We do not read, nor is it credible that this <hi>Syrian</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
was ever <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> will you hence raiſe an excuſe to avoid
your own being Baptized? what if we ſhould ſay, thou art more
bound to confeſs publickly thy Faith, and abſtain from all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>Idolatry</hi> than <hi>Naaman</hi> was, becauſe God has vouchſafed
unto thee a greater meaſure of <hi>underſtanding;</hi> becauſe ſomewhat
was indulg'd to his ignorance, will you, who are many degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
him in knowledge claim the ſave priviledge? How abſurd,
how raſh is this? be not deceived, God is neither a <hi>Sophiſter,</hi> nor
will ſuffer his glory to be fullfilled, or his <hi>Juſtice</hi> eluded by any
Sophiſtical tricks or evaſions? But,</p>
               <p>2. This Scripture is by them abuſed, and being rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
gives not the leaſt countenance to their practiſe who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
it; For firſt you muſt note, that this noble <hi>Syrian,</hi> as long
as he liv'd in Idolatry and Superſtition, with great <hi>coſt and pomp</hi>
was wont to Sacrifice to his Idols, for the meaneſt men would
<hi>ſtrain</hi> themſelves upon ſuch occaſions. But now what does he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve;
that henceforword <hi>he would only Sacrifice to the God of Iſrael.</hi>
Now what was that leſs than to make a publick &amp; notorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of his having abandon'd the falſe Gods and only to cleave
to the Lord? whence the world might as eaſily perceive, that he
was no longer an <hi>Idolater,</hi> as if he had proclaim'd it with the
ſound of a Trumpet; For how could they doubt but he had caſt off
thoſe Gods to whom he paid no more <hi>Offerings</hi> as he was wont to
do? be, heſides loads away two Mules with the Earth of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
whereon he might adore the living God, leaſt otherwiſe by the
contagion of profane Earth his Sacrifice ſhould be polluted, which
was another ſolemn teſtimony of his Profeſſion. But afterwards
he beggs pardon if he go into the Temple of <hi>Rimmon;</hi> if he did
this, that he might counterfeit a worſhipping of that Idol, it
would be ſome pretence indeed for them. But the matter is quite
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57857:104"/>
otherwiſe, for the words import only thus much,—<hi>If the King
my Maſter ſhall happen to go into the Temple of</hi> Rimmon, <hi>and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reſpect to my Prince and Maſter, let not the Lord impute it to me as
though I worſhipped the Idol.</hi> The bowing of his body here intend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
was no ſimulation of Idolatry, but a <hi>civil duty</hi> which he was
wont to pay the King. Thoſe therefore that will defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by this Example, muſt firſt purge themſelves from all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Idolatry, and openly ſhow that they renounce ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and then we ſhall have no controverſie with them, but till then
'tis vain and ridiculous for them to think to ſhelter their impie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty

after the manner of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

conceive we ought no more to be forbid the frequenting of <hi>Maſſes</hi> and other
Popiſh myſteries,</p>
               <p>1. I anſwer, 1. They are grievouſly reproachful, firſt to God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
a <hi>Ceremony</hi> inſtituted by himſelf, with abominable Idolatry, and in
the next place to <hi>Paul,</hi> unjuſtly loading him with this infamy, for was it a
Ceremony condemn'd by God which <hi>Paul</hi> uſed? or rather was it not yet an
indifferent thing, 'till the Light of the Goſpel ſhould ſhine more clearly?
'twas certainly a thing for that time placed in the liberty of Believers, either
to practiſe it or forbear. The <hi>ſhaving</hi> and <hi>purgation</hi> 'tis true, were part of the
legal ſhadows, but yet a Chriſtian might uſe them to Edification, it being
ſimply no more than a <hi>Sacrifice of praiſe;</hi> and this is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
witneſſes of himſelf, <hi>That to the Jews he became as a Jew, and to the
Gentiles as a Gentile, that he might bring them all to Christ.</hi> How prepoſterous
is it then to bring this indifferent action to excuſe thoſe things which they
know are plainly <hi>wicked,</hi> as if there were no difference between a mans
ſhaving his head, and his bowing down before an Idol</p>
               <p>2. Obſerve the Apoſtles ſcope, intent or <hi>end</hi> herein, had he done it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the good opinion of men, or for avoiding danger to his perſon, it would
have been ſomething to your purpoſe, but 'tis evident he yielded to this
compliance, only to avoid giving <hi>offence</hi> to weak Brethren, and that he might
indulge ſomething to thoſe who were but yet <hi>rude</hi> in the Faith.</p>

               <p>One of their Pleas is like that of <hi>Lot,</hi> begging leave to retreat

Mercy will eaſily paſs it by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, though true it is, that there may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
between the commands of God, whereby ſome are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and ſome leſſer, as our Saviour pronounces <hi>Faith, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
and <hi>Charity</hi> to be the chief points of the Law, yet if we
conſider each command by it ſelf, every one of them is of great
weight, and by a willful breach thereof, we commit no leſs than
High Treaſon againſt that Infinite Majeſty, who is the Author
and Eſtabliſher of ſuch commands; nor ought we to eſteem any
thing ſmall or light, that is repugnant to the Divine Will, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in a matter of this moment, as we have proved it to be, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to advance Idolatry, rob God of his honor, harden <hi>Papiſts</hi>
in their impiety, and laying a ſtumbling block before weak
Chriſtians: Remember that famous Hiſtory Recorded by <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
and in the Book of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> touching <hi>Eleazar</hi> and
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> woman with her ſeven Sons. All that <hi>Antiochus</hi> and
the perſecutors urg'd them to do, was only to taſte a little
<hi>Swines-fleſh,</hi> a ſmall buſineſs you'l ſay, what not eat a bit of
Pork? and yet being expreſly againſt the Law of their God,
they all chuſe rather to dye with exquiſite Tortures, and the
reaſon is notably given by the good old man, 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 6. 24.
in theſe words,—<hi>It becometh not our age in any wiſe to diſſemble,
whereby many young perſons might think that</hi> Eleazar <hi>being fourſcore
years old and ten, were now gone to a</hi> ſtrange Religion. <hi>And ſo
they through mine Hypocriſie, and deſire to live a little time, ſhould
be deceived by me, and I get a ſtain to my old age, and make it
abominable. For though for the preſent I ſhould be delivered from
the rage of men, yet I ſhould not eſcape the hand of the Almighty,
neither alive nor dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, this Hiſtory is no part of <hi>Canonical</hi> Scripture, but
yet it was never eſteemed <hi>Fabulous,</hi> but the Church has always
reckon'd them for Holy <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and applauded their Faith and
Conſtancy, and conſequently muſt condemn thoſe that practiſe
the contrary. In a word, thoſe that repute this feigned <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance</hi>

               <p>But before we proceed to the particular ſtory of his <hi>Life,</hi> it
will be neceſſary for clearing ſome paſſages that we may meet
with therein, to take a brief review of the lamentable ſtate and
condition of the Church in general, in and about thoſe times,
which we find ſo ſenſibly <hi>deſcribed</hi> and bewail'd by ſeveral pious
learned men of that Age, that their complaints ſeem rather writ
with <hi>Tears of Blood</hi> than <hi>Ink.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt theſe, <hi>Clemangis</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Bayeux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
for his courage and zeal to truth, deſerves to lead the <hi>Van;</hi> His
Book <hi>De Corrupto Eccleſiae Statu, of the corrupt Eſtate of the Church,</hi>
as it was produced at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> ſo it well deſerves
every ſtudious Gentlemans Reading, that would fully ſatisfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
touching the horrid abominations of <hi>Rome.</hi> I ſhall only ſelect
a few paſſages,—Having ſet forth by what ſteps and degrees the
Church at one and the ſame time roſe to her <hi>temporal height</hi> and
<hi>ſpiritual declination,</hi> and by what ſubtleties the Popes engroſſed
all Dominion, and how greedily they and their Creatures the
Cardinals hunted after gain, he proceeds to their further Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
thus.—<hi>They bear more patiently the loſs of</hi> Ten thouſand
Souls, <hi>than of</hi> Ten Groats; <hi>nay, they regard the ruin of Souls with
no conſideration or emotion of mind at all, but for the leaſt diminution
of their own private pecuniary advantages they preſently grow</hi> mad
and furious.—<hi>The Study of Divinity, and ſuch as make Profeſſion
thereof, are made a meer May-game and Laughing-ſtock, even
(which is moſt monſtrous) to the Popes themſelves, who prefer their</hi>
own Tradition <hi>far before the Commandments of God. And now that
worthy and excellent function of</hi> Preaching, <hi>ſometimes attributed to
Paſtors only, is of that baſe account with them, that they think it</hi> too
mean <hi>a work for them to meddle with, and that nothing is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
their dignity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſame Author in his Epiſtle concerning the</hi> Study of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<hi>tells us,</hi> That in thoſe days the Monaſteries both of <hi>Monks</hi> and
<hi>Nuns,</hi> [each Sex it ſeems was as bad as the other] are become ſo many
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57857:110"/>
Brothel-Houſes; their Divinity meerly Scholaſtick and Chimerical,
the very ſame which St. <hi>Paul</hi> intended to deſcribe by thoſe words,—
<hi>They dote about Queſtions and ſtrife of words.</hi> Their fruits are
like thoſe of the Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> outwardly fair, but inwardly ſmoak
and filthy aſhes; Eccleſiaſtical Perſons are generally the Succeſſors
rather of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> than <hi>Simon Peter:</hi> No man hath <hi>Orders</hi>
given him without ſilver or gold, nor is any refus'd or debarr'd from
the ſacred function that brings <hi>mony,</hi> be he never ſo wicked. To ſuch
a prodigie of wantonneſs and debauchery are they grown, that their
people the better to defend their Wives chaſtity from the attempts of
theſe <hi>Clergy-ſtallions,</hi> will have <hi>no Prieſts</hi> except ſuch as are known
to keep <hi>Concubines.</hi> The Legends of Saints are read inſtead of the
holy Scriptures, and the Saints brought into the place of God. <hi>And
in a Letter to a Student at</hi> Paris, <hi>diſcourſing of the Council of</hi>
Conſtance, <hi>he aſſigns ſeveral reaſons why no Reformation of the
raigning abuſes of the Church was to be expected thence:</hi> For,
<hi>ſaith he,</hi> theſe Carnal Sons of the Church do not only not regard ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things, nor have any feeling of them themſelves, but they <hi>perſecute</hi>
thoſe that are according to the Spirit, as ever ſince the time of juſt <hi>Abel,</hi>
whom Carnal <hi>Cain</hi> murdered, it hath been, and will be to the worlds
end. Theſe are they that for Temporal Commodities fly to the <hi>Church,</hi>
and yet living even worſe than ſecular men, they covet, ſcrape and rob
all they can, deſiring to bear Rule, but not to ſerve, glorying in their
ſuperiority, oppreſſing their inferiours, and rejoycing in their own pride
and luxury. They account gain godlineſs, and are always ready to
act or ſuffer any thing whatſoever for their temporalities, how lewdly
ſoever they are gotten, ſcorning and <hi>laughing</hi> at all thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to live <hi>juſtly, holily, chaſtly, innocently</hi> and <hi>ſpiritually;</hi>
with ſuch the Church at this day is ſo full, that almoſt in every <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>College</hi> ſcarce any other can be found. And can we imagine
that ſuch will endeavour the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church in manners
and diſcipline, and honeſty of Life, who count that Reformation their
greateſt Calamity, and deſire nothing ſo much as that it may be lawful
for them to do whatſoever pleaſeth them freely, without controul or
puniſhment?—<hi>Thus far</hi> Clemangis <hi>of the manners of the</hi> Dignified
Clergy, <hi>almoſt</hi> 300 <hi>years ago, and I wiſh the</hi> Picture <hi>may not ſerve

               </p>
               <p>Nor was he the <hi>only</hi> complainant, Cardinal <hi>Zabarella</hi> a famous
Lawyer in his Treatiſe <hi>De Schiſmate,</hi> written about the year 1406,
talks much at the ſame rate, and affirms, <hi>That with the flattering</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:57857:111"/>
Canoniſts there was nothing ſo unlawful, which they thought not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for them to do, inſomuch that they extolled the Pope above God
himſelf, making him more than God, ſo that (ſaith he) if God afford
not his helping hand to the preſent ſtate of the Church, it is in danger
of an utter overthrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor was</hi> John Gerſon <hi>the Learned Chancellour of the</hi> Pariſian
<hi>Univerſity (who was alſo one of the Aſſiſtants at the Council of</hi>
Conſtance) <hi>ſilent. In his Book</hi> De Examine Doctrinarum, It is not
(<hi>ſaith he</hi>) in the power of the Pope or any Council to change what is
preſcribed by the Evangeliſts and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as ſome do Dote: Yea, we
are to give more credit in a matter of Doctrine to the aſſertion of a
ſimple unlearned man ſpeaking according to the Scriptures, than to
the Declaration of the Pope or Council, being contrary thereunto.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen in what a <hi>maimed</hi> condition the Church was,
and that there were ſome able Phyſicians that both ſaw, and
might they have been ſuffered, were able 'tis probable to have
<hi>cured</hi> her wounds: Nay, all the <hi>Empericks</hi> at <hi>Conſtance</hi> pretended
at leaſt the ſame deſign. But they made uſe of but an ill expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
when they elected the before-mentioned <hi>Martin the Fifth.</hi>
For though in the Council he had carried himſelf very <hi>ſubtilly,</hi>
and under colour of <hi>moderation</hi> had not only avoided oppoſing
either party, but given each ſide grounds to hope him moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to their particular Faction, which much facilitated his
<hi>choice,</hi> the rather for that the Emperour was much taken with
that <hi>ſtayedneſs</hi> of his temper, and expected no ſmall fruits of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
from ſo unbiaſs'd a Conduct, yet no ſooner were his
<hi>Temples</hi> Impaled with the <hi>Triple-Crown,</hi> but he appeared diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of that moderation which before he made ſhew of, and wholly
addicted to advance the <hi>ſecular intereſt,</hi> Dominion and Treaſure
of his <hi>Chair.</hi> Therefore when ſoon after his Election, the Emperor
<hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> who had had ſo great an influence in his promotion,
preſs'd him earneſtly to proceed on vigorouſly with the promiſed
<hi>Reformation,</hi> the crafty <hi>old Father</hi> wheadled it off, <hi>That the
Biſhops &amp;c. continuing ſo long together at</hi> Conſtance, <hi>was a great
inconvenience to their reſpective Churches and charges; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was now very neceſſary to give them</hi> a ſhort receſs? <hi>that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
was a thing highly needful, but withal being a matter of
great importance, it required mature deliberation. Therefore he
thought fit to diſſolve the Council at preſent, on condition that another
ſhould be call'd within</hi> 5 <hi>years, and in the mean time he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57857:111"/>
to prepare matters; and that afterwards in</hi> 7 <hi>years they ſhould
have another Council, and thence forwards for ever a</hi> Decennial
<hi>one, that is to ſay, a general Council every</hi> 10 <hi>years ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd
and ſit to</hi> Redreſs the grievances <hi>of the Church.</hi>—Having
Cajoled them with theſe fair ſtories, to make them the rather
believe that he was in honeſt earneſt, he preſently ordains and
appoints a <hi>place</hi> for the next general Synod, <hi>viz.</hi> That it ſhould
be held within 5 years at <hi>Pavia</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> And then in the 45<hi>th.</hi>
Seſſion (they having done very little, or indeed nothing towards
Reforming the Root of all the Churches corruptions, but only
<hi>fiddle-fadled</hi> about number of Canons for ordering of <hi>Annates,
Collations, Reſerved Cauſes, Appeals, Commendums</hi> and the like <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Trumpery,</hi> comes Cardinal <hi>Winbald,</hi> (like the Popes
Chancellor) and <hi>diſſolves</hi> them, by pronouncing theſe words—
<hi>Domini ite in pace</hi>—<hi>My Lords, you may be packing,</hi> or <hi>get ye
gone in peace.</hi> Which was done, ſaith <hi>Platina, ſublato omnium
conſenſu maximè verò Imperatoris, without any of their conſents,
but eſpecially againſt that of the Emperour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor could the Emperour prevail with <hi>Martin</hi> to continue a
while in <hi>Germany,</hi> but he would away for <hi>Rome,</hi> alledging that
in the abſence of the Popes, the <hi>Saints Chappels</hi> were gone to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
and (which was a more cogent reaſon by half) Tyrants had
ſeized a great part of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Patrimony.</hi> He was no ſooner
got into <hi>Italy,</hi> but he engaged in ſeveral wars, and reduced the
<hi>Dutchy, Spoletto, Peruſia, Bononia</hi> and other places which had ſet
up for themſelves: He likewiſe made <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Anjou</hi> King of
<hi>Naples,</hi> though <hi>Joan</hi> the Queen thereof had before declared <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus</hi>

               <p>The time being come for holding the Council at <hi>Pavia,</hi> the
Pope for faſhion ſake ſends thither one Arch-biſhop, a Biſhop, an
Abbot and a Friar, who met there only two Abbots of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
and theſe ſix began forſooth a Council; a <hi>Worſhipful Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the whole Catholick Church on Earth! But the Plague
breaking out, they adjourn'd from thence to <hi>Sena,</hi> where things
not fadging juſt as Pope <hi>Martin</hi> would have them, he quickly
gave that Aſſembly too a <hi>Writ of Eaſe,</hi> without their effecting any
thing. But for a colour ſtill promiſes to call <hi>frequent Councils,</hi>
and that next ſeventh year they ſhould have one at <hi>Baſil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus <hi>ſham'd</hi> off the means of Redreſſing the Churches
grievances, and correcting abuſes, he ſettles at <hi>Rome,</hi> and begins

to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>edify ſeveral decay'd buildings, which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Hiſtorians
gloriouſly Intitle <hi>Reſtoring the Church.</hi> But his main buſineſs was
to <hi>ſcrape money</hi> together. For ſaith <hi>Antoninus, He was generally
blam'd as one that too greedily labour'd to heap up riches, being in no
wiſe able to ſay with the Apoſtle</hi> (whoſe Succeſſor he pretended to
be) <hi>ſilver and gold have I none. But all his vaſt Treaſure was lewdly
conſumed by his Kinſmen, and eſpecially by his Nephew the Prince of</hi>
Salerno, <hi>to whom it fell by his death, he beſtowing moſt of it on hired
Soldiers and Enemies againſt the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now he had ſpun out the time, till the Council at <hi>Baſil</hi>
was to Aſſemble, how he would have <hi>ſhuffled</hi> it off, or rendred
it inſignificant, we know not, ſince then God was pleaſed to <hi>cut
him off,</hi> dying of an Apoplexy the 20 of <hi>February</hi> 1431. in the
53 year of his Age, and when he had held the Chair 13 years 3
months and 12 days.</p>
               <p>This is that Pope whom many <hi>flattering</hi> Popiſh Authors extol
for his vertues to the Skies, when yet beſides his ſordid covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and other pranks before-mentioned, <hi>Angelus de Clavaſio,</hi> a
Friar Minorite, in his Book call'd <hi>Summa Angelica,</hi> in the word
<hi>Pope</hi> affirms, that this very <hi>Martin</hi> after long conſultation, gave
a man <hi>leave to marry with his own Siſter,</hi> diſpenſing with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Law of God and Nature.</p>
               <p>This Pope likewiſe was a very buſie ſtirrer up of perſecutions

               <p>IN our laſt we mentioned the Complaints of <hi>Clemangis,</hi> the

recite, not only for the <hi>Excellency of the matter,</hi> and to ſhew what
ſentiments that good man had of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in thoſe
days, that it was even become <hi>Babylon;</hi> but alſo becauſe the
Papiſts by their <hi>Expurgatory Indices</hi> have utterly endeavour'd to

That we are to fly out of Babylon, according to the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
given in both Teſtaments, thou confeſſeſt; but doſt
ſuppoſe that flight is not to be underſtood Corporally,
changing the place, but ſpiritually, not imitating the Corrupt
manners of the wicked. Truly what thou ſay'ſt is not amiſs,
yet ſufficeth ſtill not for a full reſolution. Was not the <hi>Patriarch
Abraham</hi> commanded to depart out of his own Country, and
from his kindred and fathers houſe, <hi>non ſolum Affectu ſed etiam
Effectu,</hi> not only in Affection but actually, nay his bodily
departure is firſt commanded, and then he is enjoin'd to
withdraw his very mind and thoughts from it too; and the
reaſon is, becauſe the Inhabitants were Idolators. Turn over
the whole Canonical Hiſtory, and thou ſhalt not find that God
hath ever poured down his Vengeance upon any Babylonical
Congregation of men, but that firſt conſulting the ſafety of
the Righteous, if any were amongſt them, he called them
forth, left being cover'd with the wicked, as it were under
the ſame Roof, they ſhould periſh in they ſame deſtruction.—Thou
wilt ſay perhaps whether ſhall we fly? there is no place
where Babylon is not, no City that is not Drunk with the Cup
of her Fornication: But tell me I pray, have you ſeen all the
Cities, that you can give ſo abſolute a ſentence of every
corner? Our Saviour teaches his Diſciples, if they <hi>were
Perſecuted in one City to fly unto another;</hi> and leſt they ſhould
make this very objection, that there were no Cities to which
they could retire themſelves, he taketh away the excuſe by
adding—Verily I ſay unto you, that you ſhall not go to all
the Cities of Iſrael until the Son of man come; plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
thereby, that there ſhould be always Cities, dedicated
to the honour of his name, unto which in times of Perſecution
they might fly, now what Perſecution is more to be avoided
than that which conſtrains men to do that which is wicked,
execrable and contrary to the Law of God, where not only
ſound Doctrine is not received, but ſuch are cruelly tormented
that contradict their wills? what wilt thou do there, where if
thou propoſe any thing that is good, no man will hearken to
thee? and if any man commit wickedneſs thou ſhalt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to imitate it; where if thou give ſound Judgment
of any thing, they will ſay thou art beſide thy ſelf, [a <hi>Fanatick</hi>]
but if thou art furious and mad, thou ſhalt be counted wiſe; and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57857:114"/>

reap to thy ſelf another fruit, but an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

danger of thy Life, what is it to be made drunk with the Cup
of Babylon, but by a long converſation there to be ſo infected
with Contagion as following the wandring multitude to embrace
falſhood for truth? for whereas thou ſayſt that that man flieth
from Babilon according to the Exhortation of the Prophet,
who though he may live in the midſt of a wicked and perverſe
Nation, differs from them, nevertheleſs in his life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
know that this indeed ſufficeth as long as the violence
of the fury compelleth not a man to wickedneſs, and ſo long as
Gods mercy tollerateth the ſins of the place, not yet grown to
full height. But where their ſtate is deſperate and paſt hope
of amendment, and from all parts ſend up a continual cry to
Heaven for vengeance, whoever willfully abideth there, and
dreadeth not the Thunderbolts of divine wrath, how different
ſo ever he may be in his private ſentiments and manners, is
guilty of a ſinful ſtupidity. 'Tis true, if thou ſeek here
an aſſured ſettled Reſt in all reſpects, thou ſeekeſt Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and wilt never find it, neither within or without thee.
All things are full of War, confuſion, danger, every thing
encompaſſed with ſnares and ſubtleties, neither canſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
the within thy ſelf; but they follow thee. But yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
though there be ſomething of Babylon every wheere
yet <hi>that Babylon</hi> is not every where, that is <hi>the mother of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
and Abominations of the Earth,</hi> whoſe Judgment, as
<hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>is Aſcended up to the Heavens,</hi> which hath made
<hi>drunken all the Nations with the Wine of her Whoredom,</hi> and
conſtraineth all her Inhabitants to Commit Fornication, to
Blaſpheme, to eat things ſacrificed to Idols, and to Worſhip
the Dragon, with which impieties whoſoever is polluted,
how can he find peace within himſelf, except he hate the
Fornications of that Whore; forſake, Condemn and deteſt
them? To which whoſoever ſhall adhere, is made <hi>one body with
her,</hi> becauſe ſo long as he converſeth with her, he cannot be
freed from her manners, being by force and fury drawn unto
them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Pope <hi>Martin</hi> dying <hi>Anno</hi> 1431. one <hi>Gabriel Condelmere,</hi> a
<hi>Venetian,</hi> deſcended of a mean family, was Elected and aſſum'd
the name of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi> and holding a Conſiſtory imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after his Coronation, ſuch a multitude flockt together,
that the whole Pallace totterd, and the people run out in ſuch
confuſion fearing it would fall upon their heads, that one Biſhop
was <hi>Kill'd.</hi> Some Informers giving this new Pope notice that
<hi>Martin</hi> his Predeceſſor had left <hi>vaſt Treaſures</hi> to his friends and
Nephews, he would needs force them to ſurrender it to him,
and in order thereunto Impriſoned the ſaid <hi>Martins</hi> Vice-Chamberlain,
and great heart-burnings aroſe in the family of
the <hi>Colunni</hi> againſt him. Pope <hi>Martin</hi> before his death had
aſſigned a Council, and ſent thither as his Legate, <hi>Julian</hi> Cardinal
of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> who had began the meeting, but <hi>Eugenius</hi> had
little ſtomach to Confirm it, becauſe they had been ſo <hi>ſawcy</hi> as
in the very <hi>ſecond ſeſſion</hi> to declare—<hi>That the Pope himſelf in
thoſe things that appertain to faith is bound to obey a General Council,
which if he refus'd to do, unleſs he repent, Let him be duly puniſht.</hi>
And indeed he endeavoured to play a Shamm, by offering
to refer it to <hi>Bononia,</hi> under pretence that the <hi>Greeks</hi> (who were
now upon ſome overtures for a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with the Latin
Church,) could more eaſily repair thither. But the Emperour
<hi>Sigiſmond</hi> fearing <hi>delays,</hi> wrot to him very earneſtly of the <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs</hi>
that would happen by ſuch Tranſlation of the Council;
and how much all Chriſtian Princes would be diſſatisfied therewith.
And withall prepares to come himſelf into <hi>Italy,</hi> whereupon the
Pope more out of <hi>fear</hi> than <hi>good will,</hi> approves of the Council of
<hi>Baſil,</hi> and confirms the Legantine power of Cardinal <hi>Julian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> comes to <hi>Rome;</hi> but the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to Crown him, unleſs he would firſt promiſe to Ratify the
pretended <hi>donation of Conſtantine,</hi> and alſo grant all thoſe things
<hi>de novo,</hi> and ſwear forthwith to depart <hi>Italy:</hi> All which <hi>Valla</hi>
cannot mention without Indignation,—<hi>what</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>would be
more abſurd than to be</hi> crown'd Emperor, and at the ſame time
renounce Rome to be <hi>Crowned of him, who he confeſſeth and (as
much as in him lieth) maketh Lord of the Roman Empire? And to
Ratify a donation, which if it be true, leaveth to the Emperor
nothing of the Empire? which I think Children would not have done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not mention all the <hi>quarrels</hi> of this Pope, the greateſt

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57857:115"/>
that the Romans not able to endure his <hi>Cruelties,</hi> once drove
him out of the City, making him run away in the habit of a
<hi>Monk,</hi> and pelting him with durt and ſtones, whence he retired
to <hi>Florence,</hi> and remained there ſome time; but having by his
friends again reduc'd <hi>Rome</hi> to his obedience, he uſed greater
<hi>ſeverities,</hi> than ever, and notwithſtanding he had ſo approv'd of
the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> yet now will needs diſſolve it, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
recalls Cardinal <hi>Julian,</hi> his Legate, from thence; on the
other ſide the <hi>Fathers of the Council,</hi> by their Letters firſt intreat,
and afterwards admoniſh him to come thither himſelf, or at leaſt
not to diſturb the peace of the Church, by offering to obſtruct
their proceedings, but he perſiſting, and appointing another
<hi>Anti-Council</hi> at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> they formally <hi>Cite, Accuſe, Adjure,

year by reaſon of the Peſtilence removed to <hi>Florence,</hi>) <hi>John
Palaeologus</hi> the Emperor of the Eaſt, and ſeveral Biſhops of the
Greek Church, upon a treaty that had been advanc'd for a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi>

Conference, and being at Sea, upon his Voyage for <hi>Italy,
Charles</hi> the 7<hi>th</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who ſided with the Council of

him; and acquaint him that the <hi>lawfull Council</hi> was held at <hi>Baſil,</hi>
not at <hi>Florence,</hi> and therefore to perſwade him to Land in <hi>France,</hi>
whence he ſhould be honourably Conducted to <hi>Baſil.</hi> But the
Pope underſtanding this deſign, by large <hi>Bribes</hi> Corrupts the
Admiral of the <hi>French</hi> Gallies, who willfully ſteering a <hi>wrong

not to affirm, <hi>That it was ſo far from truth, That he ought to obey
general Councils, that he then moſt merited when he contemn'd the

Decrees of the Council,</hi> and that this propoſition—<hi>The Council is
above the Pope,</hi> is <hi>Heretical;</hi> although both then and ever ſince
it was and has been held and affirmed by all the Univerſities of
Chriſtendome; whence it will follow, that whilſt the Roman
Church boaſteth her ſelf ſuperior to all other Churches, and the
Roman Biſhop above all other Biſhops; by this Decree of <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
the Biſhop of Rome is made <hi>ſuperior to,</hi> and of higher
Authority than the <hi>univerſal Church,</hi> and conſequently the

to the Romiſh Church, but to <hi>one only man;</hi> which ſhews him

               <p>AMongſt other Occurrences that happened at the
Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> (which began to be Aſſembled
Anno 1431. and continued ſitting almoſt 12 years)
very remarkable were their proceedings with the
<hi>Bohemians.</hi> How God had been pleaſed to enlighten that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the knowledge of his <hi>Truth,</hi> and to diſcover to them
the errors and wickedneſs of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Wickliffs Books</hi> amongſt them, we have heretofore acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you. As alſo how thoſe <hi>good ſeeds</hi> were <hi>cultivated</hi> by the
pains of thoſe laborious <hi>Husbandmen</hi> in the Lords Vineyard,
<hi>John Huſs</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> who were both cruelly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr'd,
(contrary to the <hi>ſafe conduct</hi> granted them) by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> about the year 1415. Whereby the Goſpel
had taken ſuch <hi>Root</hi> amongſt the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> that all the powers
of darkneſs could not pluck it up; yet of thoſe of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed

the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there were <hi>two ſorts,</hi> ſome that only
contended to have the uſe of the <hi>Cup</hi> in the Sacrament reſtored
to the Laity, but in other Doctrines agreed with the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi>
and theſe for that reaſon were commonly called <hi>Calixſtines</hi>
(from <hi>Calix</hi> a Cup;) the other not only complained of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge</hi>
of the Papiſts in that reſpect, but alſo preſſed for the

for the cauſe herein after mentioned.</p>
               <p>You muſt note, after the burning of <hi>Huſs</hi> and <hi>Jerome,</hi> the
Nobles of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to the number of 50 and upwards, in the
name of themſelves and the whole Commonalty, ſent Letters
under their Seals, Dated 2 <hi>Sept.</hi> 1416, to <hi>Conſtance</hi> complaining
thereof; as likewiſe did the Nobles of <hi>Moravia:</hi> But that
<hi>Bloody Conventicle</hi> vouchfaſed them no anſwer, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſtirred up great perſecution againſt them, ſo that the <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites</hi>
were not only Excommunicated, but their Churches <hi>broke
open,</hi> and their perſons and goods every where expoſed to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which occaſion'd ſuch a tumult on the 13<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1419
at <hi>Prague,</hi> that the common people being enraged, threw 12
Senators of Old <hi>Prague,</hi> with the chief City Majeſtrate <hi>out of
the Windows</hi> of the Senate Houſe, who fell upon the points of
Spears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pope</hi> Martin <hi>the</hi> 5th. Anno 1420, <hi>publickly excommunicates
the</hi> Bohemians, <hi>Exciting the Emperor and all Kings, Prince,
Dukes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to take up Arms againſt them,</hi> Intreating them by
the Wounds of Chriſt, and their own Salvation, unanimouſly to fall
upon them, and quite Extirpate that Sacrilegious and curſed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and withal promiſes [<hi>ſo zealous and bountiful was his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs!</hi>]
an univerſal remiſſion of ſins to the moſt wicked perſon that
ſhould kill one <hi>Bohemian</hi> Heretick—<hi>Hiſtory of the</hi> Bohemian
Perſecution, <hi>p.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>But ſome ſmall time before this, ſome thouſands of thoſe that
profeſs'd the true Religion, finding they could not live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
in <hi>Prague,</hi> retired from thence to a ſtony Mountain about
10 Miles diſtant, which they named <hi>Tabor,</hi> and encompaſſed it
round with a Wall and other fortifications, conſtituting there a
kind of Common-wealth, and reſolv'd to defend themſelves by
Arms, and hence they were call'd <hi>Taborites.</hi> The Emperour
<hi>Sigiſmund</hi> ſpur'd on by theſe Incentives and large promiſes from
the Pope of <hi>gairing Heaven,</hi> gathers a moſt puiſſant Army from
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57857:118"/>
all parts of the Empire, and reſolves utterly to extirpate theſe
poor <hi>Bohemian Huſſites.</hi> Who being in this ſore diſtreſs, one
<hi>John de Troſnovie,</hi> call'd <hi>Ziska,</hi> becauſe he had but <hi>one Eye,</hi> of
a Noble houſe, but mean fortune, yet great valour and conduct,
undertakes to gather together the ſcatter'd people, and to <hi>head</hi>
them againſt their Enemies, which he perform'd with ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
that <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> (afterwards Pope, and no friend to be
ſure to the <hi>Bohemians</hi>) who wrote the Story of thoſe Wars, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
his Atchievements will rather be <hi>admir'd</hi> than <hi>believed</hi> by
poſterity; for with handfuls of thoſe poor unfurniſht people, he
fought eleven ſeveral Battels with <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>'s numerous, well
provided and freſh recruited Armies, and in all of them came off
victorious, nay though in one of them he loſt his <hi>other Eye</hi> and
ſo was blind; yet afterwards he continued no leſs fortunate a
Leader, ſo that at laſt <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> deſpairing to vanquiſh him, but
by a <hi>Treaty,</hi> conſents to declare him his Lieutenant, and allow
him a Penſion, on condition he and his followers would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him the ſaid <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> as King.—But before this Treaty
was fully perfected <hi>Ziska</hi> dies.</p>
               <p>Some ſay that he ſhould bequeath his <hi>Skin</hi> to make a <hi>Drum</hi>
of, or that his followers ſhould carry it about with them, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby to fright their Enemies, but this I conceive but a
Fable, and yet 'tis little more than what our valiant <hi>King Edw.
the</hi> 1<hi>ſt.</hi> did; who on his Death-bed, commanded that his
<hi>Bones well boil'd from the fleſh</hi> ſhould in a fit Veſſel, be carried
about by his Son, 'till he had Conquer'd the <hi>Scots,</hi> telling his
Son, that as long as he had his Fathers <hi>Bones with him, none
ſhould overcome him.</hi> This is certain, that after his Death the
<hi>Bohemians</hi> call'd themſelves <hi>Orphans,</hi> as having loſt the common
Father of their Country man; nor will it be amiſs to inſert here
his Epitaph written on his Tomb in the City of <hi>Tabor,</hi> as we
find it before the Hiſtory of the Abbot of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſperge.</hi>—<hi>I</hi> John
Ziska <hi>reſt here, in the skill of Military Affairs, not inferiour to
any of the Emperours or famous Captains of old. A ſevere ſcourge
of the</hi> pride <hi>and</hi> covetouſneſs <hi>of</hi> Clergy-men, <hi>and a moſt valiant
Defender of my Country. That which</hi> Appius Claudius <hi>being</hi> blind
<hi>did for the</hi> Romans <hi>in well counſelling, and furious</hi> Camillus <hi>in
valiantly exploiting; the ſame have I done for my</hi> Bohemians. <hi>I
was never wanting to the good fortune of the war, nor it to me. I
have foreſeen though</hi> blind, <hi>all advantages and opportunities of well
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57857:119"/>
doing, and with Enſigns display'd have fought eleven times in the open
Field, ever victorious. It ſeemed to me moſt fit and honourable to
take in hand the moſt juſt cauſe of the miſerable and hungry, againſt
the delicate fat and</hi> full-cram'd Prieſts, <hi>and in this doing, I have
found the aſſiſtance of God giving a Bleſſing to my arms; if their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
had not hindred it, no doubt I ſhould have merited to be numbred
amongst the</hi> illuſtrious men; <hi>nevertheleſs my Bones lye here in this
ſacred place, without asking the Pope any leave, and in ſpight of his
Teeth.</hi>—John Ziska <hi>the</hi> Bohemian, <hi>an Enemy of Prieſts that are
covetous of diſhoneſt gain, but in a godly zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After his death, the Pope and Emperour thinking the <hi>Huſſites</hi>
much diſcouraged thereby, as in truth they were, ſent ſeveral
great Armies againſt them, but ſtill they were ſtrangely diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited,
for the <hi>Bohemians</hi> (ſaith <hi>Monſtrelet</hi>) <hi>feared neither death
nor torments, their very Women took arms and fought, and the dead
Bodies of many of that Sex were found amongst the ſlain in ſeveral
Battels.</hi> Wherefore being not able to extirpate them by War,
they are invited to come (in order to hearing their demands and
giving them ſatisfaction) to the Council of <hi>Baſil.</hi> Indeed moſt of
the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Churches being ſenſible of the perfidious treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uſed to <hi>Huſs</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> at <hi>Conſtance</hi> were loth to ſend any
Deputies thither, but the Nobility over-rul'd the matter, that
ſome ſhould be diſpatcht to render a Reaſon for the Innovations
in Religion laid to their charge.</p>
               <p>Commiſſioners were therefore choſen and ſent, amongſt whom
the moſt eminent were <hi>John Rokizane</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas
Epiſcopius</hi> of the <hi>Taborens,</hi> both famous Divines, and of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<hi>Procopius</hi> the General of the <hi>Taborens,</hi> and <hi>William Raſtka</hi>
Baron of <hi>Poſtupiez,</hi> and others, who being honourably conducted
in their paſſage, and courteouſly received at <hi>Baſil:</hi> They declared
that at <hi>Conſtance</hi> they had been condemn'd unheard; though
they held nothing but according to the Scriptures, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
the four Requeſts and Articles following, deſiring that
the Council would grant them, or allow them to defend them by
Argument.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the uſe of the <hi>Cup</hi> may be reſtored to the people,
and that the Service of the Church might be in their own
Tongue.</item>
                  <item>2. That Clerks or Miniſters might uſurp no Authority in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:57857:119"/>
3. That the word of God might be freely Preached without
diſturbance.</item>
                  <item>4. That there may be publick puniſhment of publick offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe Articles being read, the Popes Legate demanded if
they had nothing elſe to propound, becauſe he had heard it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that they affirmed that the Orders of Monks were from
the Devil, <hi>Procopius</hi> made anſwer, from whence elſe, I pray, can
they derive their original, which was inſtituted neither by the
Patriarchs nor Prophets, neither by Chriſt nor his Apoſtles?
However a Conference was appointed, and 40 days (ſome ſay 50)
the Diſputation laſted; and when the <hi>Bohemians</hi> could not be
confuted by Arguments, they were at laſt wheadled into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
<hi>John Rokiſane</hi> being himſelf corrupted with the hopes
of an Arch-biſhoprick, ſeduced others of the Commiſſioners, and
ſo matters were ſubtilly carried, that leave being given by the
Council, that they ſhould enjoy the uſe of the <hi>Cup,</hi> in other
matters they were brought to conſent. Theſe four Articles with
ſome Explanations were afterwards named <hi>the Concord,</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
were ſent into <hi>Bohemia</hi> from the Council and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
to declare that Realm was received again into the Boſome
of the Church, and a <hi>Diet</hi> being there Aſſembled on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>Rokiſane</hi> very rhetorically explained and magnified the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of this agreement, whereby ſo much War, Bloodſhed and
Devaſtation, as otherwiſe might have happen'd to the Kingdom,
was prevented, and now he was pleaſed to mention the <hi>Pope</hi> and
<hi>Ceſar</hi> in other Language than heretofore, when he was wont to
ſtile the one the <hi>Whore,</hi> and the other the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> This <hi>Rokiſane</hi>
continued a pitiful Hypocrite long after, and at laſt died uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably,
Anno 1471.</p>
               <p>The craft of the Council in granting the <hi>Cup</hi> to the <hi>Bohemians</hi>
provided in all other things they would ſubmit was conſiderable,
for hereby they ſet at variance the <hi>Calixſtines</hi> and the <hi>Taborites,</hi>
and conſequently prevented all their further endeavours of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and the pure profeſſors of the Goſpel, henceforwards
were as much hated and perſecuted by thoſe that enjoy'd the uſe
of the <hi>Cup,</hi> as by thoſe that diſown'd it.</p>
               <p>It was no little grief to many, eſpecially of the zealous <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
to depart in this manner from the Doctrine and Diſcipline
of Chriſt delivered to them by <hi>Huſs,</hi> and return again to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57857:120"/>
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor could they ever be wholly
brought over to embrace it, but the truth has remained ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, and great <hi>Perſecutions</hi> have they ſuffered even to
our times; as by the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> thereof brought down to the year
1632. and Printed at <hi>London,</hi> Anno 1650. appears.</p>
               <p>To return to the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> the other moſt material De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
they made, were, 1. That no Actions, Suits or Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
ſhould by <hi>Appeals</hi> be carried up to be decided in the Courts
at <hi>Rome,</hi> which were above four days diſtant from thence. 2. A
Regulation of the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> that they ſhould not be above 24 in
number, and to exclude the Popes <hi>Nephews</hi> and Kindred from
that office. 3. Againſt the payment of <hi>Annals</hi> or firſt fruits to the
Pope. 4. Againſt Prieſts keeping <hi>Concubines.</hi> 5. They brought
two <hi>new Holy-days</hi> into the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> The Conception and
the Viſitation of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As long as <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>Charles</hi> the 7<hi>th.</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> King lived, who both favoured this Council, the ſame
continued <hi>Aſſembled,</hi> but afterwards wanting ſuch friends to
back them, it <hi>mouldered</hi> away inſenſibly, ſo that at laſt moſt of
the Fathers and Ambaſſadours of the ſeveral Princes abandoning
it, it was broke up and diſſolv'd.</p>
               <p>And alſo <hi>Felix</hi> that by the ſaid Council had been elected Pope,
was prevailed with to renounce that dignity, and reſign his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
of Papacy to <hi>Nicholas</hi> the 5<hi>th,</hi> the Succeſſor of Pope <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi>
about the year 1450.</p>
               <p>But remarkable it is with what kind of arguments this very
Council (perhaps none of the worſt in the whole <hi>Pack</hi>) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to ſilence the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> which appear out of the Letters
of Cardinal <hi>Cuſanus</hi> (one imploy'd by the Council to manage the
controverſie) in his 2 and 3 Epiſtle to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> where he
maintains theſe aſſertions: 1. <hi>That the Scriptures can by no means
be of the Eſſence of the Church, either begun or continued, but only
of the ſeemly Order thereof.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Church is not known by the
Goſpel, but the Goſpel by the Church.</hi>

<hi>Conventicled</hi> an <hi>Anti-Council</hi> at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> (though, becauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

               <p>Almoſt Fourſcore years before, <hi>John Palaeologus</hi> Emperour

                  </gap>
&amp;c. In the Morning before the firſt hour of the day, we
ſaw <hi>Cariſtinus</hi> come running to us, ſent from the Emperour, who
acquainted the Patriarch, that the Pope expected that his <hi>Great
Holineſs</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for you muſt note, the Patriarch
aſſum'd the title of his Holineſs as well as the Pope,</hi>] ſhould go
to him and adore him and kiſs his feet, and the Emperour had already
inſiſted and contended three days, that the ſame might be waved, but-could
not obtain it, of which in the mean time he thought fit to Adver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſe
your Great Holineſs, that you may know in what manner you
muſt approach him. This was irksome news to the Patriarch, who
expected to be received in a far different, way and with greater marks
of Affection and eſteem. For whilſt he was at <hi>Venice</hi> he had thus
declared himſelf to one of his Domeſtick Favourites, diſcourſing about
the Pope—I have determined with my ſelf, that if the Pope be a
perſon of more years than I, then I will eſteem him as a Father, if of
equal years I will carry my ſelf towards him as a Brother, but if he be
younger than I, then I will regard him but as my Son: And my mind
is, that if there be any meet Pallace neer to his, that hath a private
paſſage from one into the other, I will take it up for my Quarters,
that I may privately go to him, and he likewiſe to me again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
[thereby to void priority of viſits and Ceremony] wherefore when
now he heard talk of <hi>Kiſſing his Feet,</hi> he was aſtoniſht; however he
proceeded, and we came (when the Courts were all ready full) to
<hi>Ferraria,</hi> and ſtaid right againſt the Caſtle, near the Bridge, and
before noon there came ſix Biſhops in the Popes behalf to Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Patriarch, who told them, That he owed not the Pope any
ſuch Salutation as Kiſſing his Feet, but for as much (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) <hi>we be
Brethren</hi> let us Embrace and Kiſs each other in Brotherly manner,
elſe I will do nothing. The Patriarch alſo had other Speeches concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that matter, unto which they made anſwer, and the Patriarch
advis'd with all the Biſhops that came with him about this weighty
affair, who all (<hi>Nemine Contradicente</hi>) Voted <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
That the ſame [<hi>The
Toe Kiſſing</hi>] was neither <hi>Juſt</hi> nor ſeemly, nor <hi>profitable</hi> to be done.
But the Popes Biſhops return again in the morning, and with
repeated inſtances preſs the Kiſſing of the feet, to which the Patriarch
anſwers, from whence hath the Pope that Right? ſhew us what
Synod hath beſtowed it upon him? or where is it written? eſpecially
ſince the Pope calleth himſelf the Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter?</hi> Then the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57857:123"/>
Biſhops told him that it was an antient Cuſtome of the Pope, that all
perſons ſalute him in that manner, Biſhops, Kings, the Emperour of
<hi>Germany</hi> himſelf, and the Cardinals who are greater than the
Emperour, (<hi>here's Divinity for you!</hi>) in as much, as they are
perſons <hi>Conſecrated.</hi> Whereunto the Patriarch reply'd, That this
was a new Invention, I will not (<hi>quoth he</hi>) aſſent unto it, I will
never do it, but if the Pope be pleaſed that I ſalute him Brotherly,
according to our antient manner, in that ſort I will go unto him, but
if he refuſe that, I will have nothing to do with him, but will return
back again.—<hi>Thus far the ſaid</hi> Greek <hi>Synod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee he was very <hi>reſolute,</hi> and here was a <hi>long Voyage</hi> like
to be ſpoil'd and come to nothing; but at laſt an <hi>Expedient</hi> was
found out, <hi>viz.</hi> That whereas the Pope thought to have made
the Patriarch kiſs his Feet in a full Aſſembly <hi>publiquely,</hi> he was
forc'd to receive him and take that Homage in his <hi>Privy Chamber,</hi>
the Cardinals only being preſent.</p>
               <p>But then a new difficulty aroſe, about the order of ſitting in
Council, who ſhould have the <hi>uppermoſt</hi> place, the Pope conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour and Patriarch with the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
ſhould ſit on the <hi>left ſide</hi> the Church, and the Weſtern
Biſhops on the right hand, and himſelf at the higher end of all,
in the middle, as head of them all, in a more eminent Seat.
The Emperour on the contrary, pretended the place belonged
to him, At laſt it was ngreed the Weſtern people ſhould ſit on
the <hi>right</hi> hand, the Eaſtern ones on the <hi>left;</hi> Pope <hi>Eugenius's</hi>
Throne placed by the High Altar; the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours
(though abſent) in the next place but ſome degrees lower; and

               <p>Being thus at laſt ſeated, the 4 principal Controverſies deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
between them, were. 1. Touching the proceſſion of the
Holy Ghoſt, the <hi>Greeks</hi> not acknowledging that he proceeded
from the Son, but only from the Father, and therefore charged
the <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ines</hi> that they had added the word, <hi>Filioque,</hi> and <hi>from the
Son, to the</hi> Creed. 2. About the Bread uſed for the Sacrament.
The <hi>Greeks</hi> contending, that it ought to be Leavened, the
<hi>Romaniſts,</hi> that it muſt be unleavened. 3. About Purgatory
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57857:123"/>
which the <hi>Greeks</hi> denyed; and the laſt (tho principally inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
about the Popes Primacy and being ſupream head of the
univerſal Church, which they would not acknowledge.</p>
               <p>Theſe points were argued ſtrongly on both ſides in the ſaid
Council: (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>As far as I can learn, on the one ſide, the Generality of
the Citizens have a mind to preſerve their Right of Chuſing of
<hi>Sheriffs,</hi> and acting in <hi>Common-Hall</hi> as time out of mind hath
been accuſtomed; on the other ſide, there are ſome that ſcarce
know what they would have themſelves, but however they make
a horrid noiſe and clamour, and every body that will not be as
mad and ſilly as themſelves, they count a <hi>Traitor</hi> and a <hi>Fanatick,</hi>
many of theſe are influenc'd by <hi>Strangers,</hi> that endeavour by
rudeneſs and ill Language and all kind of Affronts to provoke
and raiſe ſome tumult or diſturbance, and rather than fail will
ſwear it, on the moſt peaceable. Or if we may beleive what a
printed paper relates, and names the perſon, one of theſe ſticklers
confeſſed lately, that the buſineſs ſo ſtrugled for, was, to get
<hi>Sheriffs to hang up half a ſcore that were uneaſy,</hi> &amp;c. But as one
Innocent mans blood is enough to draw down divine vengeance
on the whole Nation, ſo who knows where <hi>Blood hounds</hi> if once
fleſht, would <hi>ſtop?</hi> as to the preſent Controverſy is it not fit to
be conſider'd,</p>
                  <p>1. If my Lord Mayor be allow'd a Right to chuſe one of the Sheriffs
againſt the mind of the Common Hall, then whether the Cities late plea
to the <hi>quo Warranto,</hi> in defence of the Charter, be not thereby confeſſ'd to
be falſe and invali'd?</p>
                  <p>2. If the Sheriffs for the time being, have not a right to declare the free
choiſe of Sheriffs for the year enſuing, and to manage the Poll, (if any be
demanded then whether we have had any Sheriffs duly choſen this
hundred years? for 'tis certain the Sheriffs not the Mayors have done it;
nor did ever any Mayor Adjourn the Common-Hall, before the buſineſs
diſpatcht, but Sir <hi>Samuel Starling,</hi> and he paid for it, being caſt at Law upon
ſerious conſideration of all the Judges.</p>

for the Papacy, <hi>viz.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Rotomagenſis,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi>
ſo that during the four days ſpace wherein the matter was
debated in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> the only difficulty was which of theſe
they ſhould chuſe, nor was either of them wanting to puſh on
his own promotion, and aſperſe his Rival.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On the one ſide,</hi> Rotomagenſis <hi>runs up and down from one
Cardinal to another whiſpering</hi>—What have you to do with
<hi>Aeneas?</hi> how can you think him worthy of the Papacy, will you
confer ſo important a charge upon that <hi>gouty Beggar?</hi> where is
his knowledge, where his Learning, will ye make him a Pope becauſe
he is a Poet? It is not long ſince he came out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and who
knows but he may transfer the See thither? I ſhould never have
Ambition'd the Chair, had I not ſeen a perſon ſtand for it of ſo much
weaker parts than my ſelf; beſides I am the antienter Cardinal of
the two, and I believe you think I have parts and Learning ſufficient
to govern the Church of Chriſt, moreover I am of <hi>Royal Extraction,</hi>
and have wealth, friends and faculties, wherewith to accomodate and
releive the Neceſſities of <hi>the Church,</hi> and upon my Election, the
many Benefices which I now hold will be divided amongſt you.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons, and eſpecially the <hi>laſt,</hi> were very prevalent
with many, particularly the Cardinal of <hi>Avignon</hi> eſpous'd his
Intereſt, not ſo much becauſe he was a <hi>French</hi> man, as in hopes
that upon his promotion, his Church, Pallace, and office in the
<hi>Chancery</hi> would fall to his ſhare; therefore cunningly in the
night he gets together certain of the Cardinals in an <hi>houſe of
Office</hi> [<hi>A ſweet place to confir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

carry the day.</p>
               <p>But there was <hi>fraud in fellowſhip;</hi> for the Cardinal of <hi>Bologna,</hi>
one of this <hi>Houſe-of-Office-Cabal,</hi> diſcovers the Intrigue to
<hi>Aeneas</hi> a little after midnight; preſently up gets he, and away
to Cardinal <hi>Roderigo</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> of <hi>Rotomagenſis's</hi> faction, as
having from him and the Cardinal <hi>Avignon</hi> received a promiſe
in writing that the Chancellorſhip ſhould be conferr'd upon him.
<hi>Aeneas</hi> expoſtulates with him for ſiding with his enemy, who
excuſes himſelf ſo well as he can, telling him he did it not out of
any perſonal Averſion, but becauſe he thought verily the other
would be choſen, and he was loath to <hi>hang an arſe,</hi> and ſo
perhaps loſe his Chancellors place: <hi>Will you then</hi> (quoth Aeneas)

                  <hi>ſell your Vote? and by Simony incur the diſpleaſure of God Almighty?
will you obtrude an hairbrain'd Youth upon the Vatican, and one
that is an enemy to the Nation? know you not the Chancellorſhip
which is promiſed you, is already beſtow'd and Confirm'd to the
Cardinal of</hi> Avignon, <hi>and ſo you are meerly</hi> Chous'd, <hi>for can you
think that a</hi> French <hi>Pope will do more for a</hi> Spaniard <hi>than for one of
his own Countrymen!</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Having thus</hi> rattled up Don Roderigo, <hi>in the next place he
finds out the Cardinal of</hi> Pavia, <hi>whom he accoſts in this manner,</hi>
—I hear you reſolve to chuſe <hi>Rotomagenſis</hi> Pope, are you not
aſham'd to degenerate ſo much from Cardinal <hi>Brando</hi> your
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, who with ſo much labour and ſweat aſſiſted to transfer the
pontificial Court from <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> [He means in the Schiſm,
when the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> took upon him to be Pope] and you that are
his Nephew would Tranſport it from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>France;</hi> ſurely
<hi>Rotomagenſis</hi> will never give the <hi>Italians</hi> precedence before the
<hi>French,</hi> and yet you an <hi>Italian</hi> will Confederate ſooner with <hi>France,</hi>
than with your own Country. Can you have the heart to ſee your
ſelf a ſlave to the <hi>French,</hi> when it is in your power to make the
<hi>French</hi> truckle to your Nation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Cardinal</hi> Pavia <hi>reply'd—That he did not believe that
the</hi> French <hi>had any deſigns againſt the Intereſts of the Church,
they having given with ſo much Generoſity moſt of the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
it poſſeſſeth, and ſurely they would not take away what they
ſo lately had given.</hi>—Suppoſe ſaith <hi>Aeneas,</hi> that ſhould be, ought
it not however to ſtir up your heart againſt this Cardinal of <hi>Roan</hi> to
conſider the Infamy of his manners, who is addicted to all kind of
Laſciviouſneſs and debauchery. You have often told me you would
ſooner dy than give your Voice for him, what reaſon have you for ſo
great a Change? is he in the twinkling of an eye become an Angel of
a Divel? or are you become a Divel of an Angel? <hi>Pavia (who was
but a</hi> ſilly fellow, <hi>and eaſily made to comply with either ſide) began
to weep,</hi>—What you ſay <hi>Aeneas</hi> is true, but what ſhall I do? I have
now paſs'd my word to make <hi>Rotomagenſis</hi> Pope, and if I do not, I
ſhall be held Infamous and a Traitor: <hi>To which</hi> Aeneas <hi>briskly
reply'd</hi> Things ſtand ſo now, that which way ſoever you turn you,
you cannot avoid the blame of a Fool and Traitor, yet it is in your
power to chuſe whether you will betray <hi>Italy</hi> your own Country, or
betray him and be faithfull to your Country and your beſt friends.—
<hi>Theſe words overcome old</hi> Pavia, who preſently joyns with

Cardinal <hi>Peter de Sancta Maria Nova,</hi> and other <hi>Italians,</hi> in the
Cardinal of <hi>Genoa's</hi> Chamber, where they all reſolve to prefer
<hi>Aeneas. Rotomagenſis</hi> fearing things would not fadge according
to his expectations, ſeeing <hi>Aeneas</hi> going to take up the Billet to
give his Vote, whiſpers him very ſubmiſſively—<hi>AEneas I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
my ſelf to thee, remember me, I beſeech thee, and have
compaſſion on me.</hi> But <hi>Aeneas</hi> takes him up ſhort thus—<hi>poor Worm!
thou miſtakeſt in Recommending thy ſelf to me.</hi> The ſcrutiny being
publiſh't, it appear'd that <hi>Aeneas</hi> had three Voices more than
<hi>Rotomagenſis,</hi> but they could not yet obtain their two thirds.</p>
               <p>Then the Cardinals <hi>Roderigo</hi> and <hi>Santa Anaſtaſia</hi> declared for
<hi>Aeneas</hi> with a loud Voice, which Cardinal <hi>Proſper Colonna</hi>
obſerving, being ambitious to have the Honour of making the
Pope (ſince now there wanted but one Voice) aroſe and went
towards <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and being ſtopt and held by Cardinal <hi>Niceno</hi>
and <hi>Rotomagenſis,</hi> he cry'd out—<hi>I joyn my ſelf to
Cardinal</hi> Aeneas <hi>and do make him Pope;</hi> which being heard by
the reſt of the Cardinals, they all threw themſelves down at
<hi>Aeneas's</hi> feet, ſaluted him Pope, Corfirmed the Election
afterwards with the uſual ſuffrages. Then Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion</hi>
Apooglized to the New Pope for himſelf and all the reſt of the
Cardinals that favour'd <hi>Rotomagenſis</hi>—To whom the crafty old
Fox (being now ſure of the Chair) very gravely reply'd—<hi>I aſſure

               <p>This <hi>Aeneas</hi> whoſe other name was <hi>Piccol homini,</hi> but after he

oppoſing <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and aſſerted, that a Pope ought to be ſubject to

—<hi>All men abhor and deteſt Schiſm, the Remedy is brief and ſafe,</hi> viz.
<hi>That Princes or their Ambaſſadors Convene in ſome common place,
and conclude matters among themſelves; for he ſhall be undoubted
Pope, whom all Princes would obey; nor do I ſee any of the Clergy ſo
conſtant to Death as to ſuffer Martyrdome either for the one part or
for the other; we all commonly hold that Faith which our Princes
embrace, and if they ſhould Worſhip Idols, we would alſo do the ſame,
and not only deny the Pope but God alſo, if the ſecular power
preſs us thereunto, for Charity is grown cold, and all Faith is
gone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But Honours change manners; no ſooner was he Pope, but he
begins to ſing another Tune, and ſets forth a Bull entituled <hi>Retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
revoking his former Acts and opinions, and the things which
he before had ſeemed to deteſt in other Popes, he himſelf now
both applauded and advanced. So likewiſe by another Bull
begining <hi>Execrabilis,</hi> dated in the ſecond year of his Popedome,
he ſtrictly forbids any to preſume to <hi>Appeal</hi> from the ſentence of
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to any future Council; and pronounces all ſuch
Appeals, whether of Emperors, Kings, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be <hi>void,
vain, execrable</hi> and <hi>peſtiferous.</hi> In another Bull which begins—<hi>In
minoribus agentes,</hi> directed to the Univerſity of <hi>Cologn,
Anno</hi> 1463, he profeſſeth that it repenteth him that he wrote the
Dialogue and other Books touching the Authority of the
Council, and is not aſhamed to add, <hi>That then like St.</hi> Paul <hi>he
ignorantly perſecuted the Church of God,</hi> affirming now on the
contrary, that the Authority of the Pope is above that of the
Church Repreſentative, and endeavouring to prove the ſame by
the very ſame Text, which before he had expounded in a quite
different ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Nor was he leſs <hi>pragmatical</hi> in his Actions than his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
<hi>For the Augmentation of the Papal</hi> Majeſty he feared
(<hi>ſaith</hi> Stella <hi>in his Life) neither Kings nor Dukes, people nor

<hi>Miles Prance</hi> and another man and a third perſon that was a

down quietly without ſpeaking to any body, but before <hi>Prance</hi>
had drunk his diſh, a Journy-man Draper whiſper'd the Company
and told them who he was, preſently twenty or thirty of them
flock about him, call'd him ſcurrilous names and gave him all
kind of Affronts, which he took patiently, only laught at their
folly, and paying for his Coffee, he and one of the perſons that
came in with him, went to the <hi>Old Dog</hi> Tavern and ſat down in the
Kitching, where the other man in a Frolique would needs ſend
to <hi>Sa'ms</hi> for <hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi> who refuſing to come, unleſs a Name

                  <hi>Peter Barbs</hi> a <hi>Venetian</hi> ſucceeds, by the name of <hi>Paul</hi> the
ſecond, one of the moſt peviſh fancifull fools, that we ſhall meet
with in any Hiſtory. One of his firſt exploits was to aboliſh all
the Abbreviators, to whom Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his predeceſſor had ſold
thoſe places, without returning any of their Mony. What theſe
Gentlemens Office was, I am not wiſe enough to acquaint you,
but it appears to be both of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>profit,</hi> elſe they would
never have ſtickled ſo much about it. His pretended reaſon for
putting them down was <hi>Ignorance,</hi> when in truth they were the
Learnedeſt men <hi>Pius</hi> could get together from moſt parts of the
World, and <hi>Platina</hi> who writes the Lives of the Popes hitherto,
was one of them, a perſon no way contemptible for parts, as the
ſize of Learning went in thoſe times. When ſome of theſe
diſcarded Officers, petition'd him to refer their Cauſe to the
hearing of the Auditors of the <hi>Rota,</hi> (a certain Court of <hi>Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
in <hi>Rome</hi>) and <hi>Platina</hi> ſpoke for all the reſt; this haughty
Pope return'd this ſwaggering Anſwer—<hi>What doſt talk to us of
Judges? doſt thou not know that all Laws are lodg'd within the Cloſet
of our Breaſt (Ita nos, inquit, ad Judices revocas, ac ſi neſcireo
omnia Jura in ſcrinio pectoris noſtri collocata eſſe?) This is our
ſentence, let them all be packing, I regard them not, I am Pope
and it is lawfull for me to diſannull or approve the Acts of others at
my own pleaſure.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Platina,</hi> not ſatisfied with this
Anſwer, wrot him a <hi>Letter</hi> about the ſame affair, he accuſed
him of <hi>Libelling</hi> and <hi>Treaſon,</hi> which Treaſon was that he had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>alkt of Appealing from his Holineſs to a <hi>General Council;</hi> upon
this poor <hi>Platina</hi> was Jail'd for four Months, and not long after
taken up again upon a <hi>Sham plot,</hi> and put upon the <hi>Rack</hi> with
ſeveral others, of whom diverſe, being perſons of good quality,
whom he names in his Hiſtory, dyed of their Tortures; and
when it appeared there was no ſuch Conſpiracy, as the Pope had
fancied, yet they were long kept in durance, leaſt, forſooth, he
ſhould ſeem to have Committed them at firſt <hi>without cauſe;</hi> and
when other accuſations fail'd, he accuſed them of <hi>Hereſy</hi> for
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57857:134"/>
diſputing of the <hi>Immortality of the Soul</hi> out of <hi>Plato,</hi> whom, yet,
(as <hi>Platina</hi> truly obſerves,) St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> affirms to come neareſt
therein to the opinion of a Chriſtian; and to compleat his ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
folly, he very gravely pronounced, <hi>all thoſe to be Hereticks
that ſhould either in jeſt or earneſt make mention of the name of an
Academy.</hi> This will not appear ſtrange, when you conſider what
the ſame Author relates, that this Pope hated Learning, and had
ſuch a ſpight againſt the <hi>Studies of Humanity,</hi> that he called all
that follow'd them, <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and for that reaſon, exhorted the
Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> not to ſuffer <hi>their Sons to be any longer at the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Learning, for that it was ſufficient if they had learned to write
and read,</hi> and therefore <hi>Genebrard</hi> fitly calls him, <hi>Hoſtis Virtutis
&amp; doctrinae, the enemy of virtue and Learning.</hi> The moſt memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things that he did for the good of the Church, was that he
bought up at any rate all the extraordinary pretious ſtones he
could hear of, to make the Papal Mitre more gay and glorious,
for he took much delight to be gaz'd at and admired in that
Bravery; likewiſe he decreed that none ſhould wear <hi>Scarlet</hi>
Caps but Cardinals, and in the firſt year of his Popedome he
gave them Cloth of the <hi>ſame Colour</hi> wherewith to cover their
Horſes and Mules when they rode; that the Apoſtatized Church
might even litterally reſemble that Whore deſcribed to us in the
<hi>Revelations.</hi> In the year 1465<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Cardinal of <hi>Laurence</hi> dying,
who was exceeding rich, by the Popes conſent bequeath'd his
Eſtate to his two Brothers, called <hi>Scaranupi,</hi> but no ſooner was
he dead, but the Pope ſeized on the Legatees and kept them in
Priſon till they ſurrendred the Eſtate to his diſpoſal, and ſo got
thoſe riches which (ſaith <hi>Platina</hi>) the late owner would rather
had fallen to the <hi>Turks</hi> than him, as being one that he hated and
always had quarrels with. Another of his excellencies, was
that he had appointed publick Races all the Lent, and propos'd
Priſes to thoſe that won, every day, ſo that there ran old men,
young men, and Children, Chriſtians and <hi>Jews,</hi> nay they ran with
Horſes and Mares and Aſſes and ſome upon <hi>Cows,</hi> with ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion

in the year 1475. whence he promis'd himſelf abundance of

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57857:139"/>

in theſe words</hi>—He was choſen Pope by means of the diſcord that
was betwixt the Cardinals <hi>Aſcanius Sforta,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> of St. <hi>Peter
ad vincula,</hi> but add withall, that by a new Example in the ſight and
knowledg of all men he bought the Popedome, partly with Mony,
partly with the promiſe of his great Offices and Benefices, by which
means he got the Cardinals Voices, who contemning the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Goſpel, were not aſhamed to ſell the power to him, to
make Traffique of the ſacred Treaſures, by a Coeleſtical Authority.
To this abominable Negotiation many amongſt them were drawn by

Corrupted by an Inſinite deſire of Riches, bargained to have the

the Legate Honourably, and with them returned a vaſt ſum of
Mony and an Ambaſſador of his own, to whom amongſt other
matters given in charge, there was a Letter written in the <hi>Greek</hi>
Tongue, wherein <hi>Bajazet</hi> earneſtly importunes the Pope to
make away his Brother <hi>by Poyſon,</hi> promiſing upon his faith to
give him for the ſame not only Twenty Thouſand Ducates, but
alſo to beſtow upon him the <hi>Seamleſs-Coat</hi> of Chriſt, as ſome years
before he had ſent the <hi>point of the Spear</hi> before mention'd.
But theſe Ships were Intercepted, by the Brother Cardinal <hi>Julian</hi>
an Enemy to the Pope, and a friend to the <hi>French,</hi> who ſeized all
the Mony as due to him from the Pope. At which his Holineſs
was much afflicted, and ſought new means to reeſtabliſh this
Correſpondence with <hi>Bajazet.</hi>

Accidents whatſoever. Alexander</hi> for the preſent retreats to

Corrupts diverſe of the Kings Council, to divert him from

of <hi>Greece,</hi> and ſome other Articles, matters were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

               <head>Pope Alexander Poiſon'd, by a miſtake with Wine prepared to Poiſon
a Cardinal. Thirty Thouſand years pardon granted, Julius the
ſecond, a Tory-Pope, flings St. Peters Keys into Tybur. Pope
Leo the X. ſends out extravagant Indulgences, which Luther
oppoſes, and ſo we are brought to the beginning of the Reformation.</head>
               <p>THe Pope was ſo far from puniſhing his <hi>baſe begotten
Caeſar Borgia,</hi> for <hi>murdering</hi> his <hi>Brother</hi> mention'd in
our laſt, that he not winked at it, but reſolves ſtill
to advance him to Riches and Honour; in order to
which the ſaid <hi>Caeſar</hi> flung off his <hi>Cardinals Robes,</hi> and openly
delar'd he would be no longer a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but a <hi>man of Warr;</hi>
then he married <hi>Charlotte</hi> nearly related to the <hi>French</hi> King,
who was willing to beſtow her on him, becauſe he had a mind
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57857:142"/>
to change his <hi>Bedfellow,</hi> and concluded by ſweetening the Pope by
this match, to obtain a <hi>Divorce. Caeſar</hi> being return'd into
<hi>Italy,</hi> deſigns the ruine of all the Governours or Lieutenants of
the Cities of <hi>Romania,</hi> and to take the Government and profits
all to himſelf; for effecting which, there was no kind of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
or Cruelty which he left unpractiſed, <hi>Stabbing</hi> ſome,
<hi>Poiſoning</hi> others, and <hi>Strangling</hi> diverſe; whilſt the Father ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
as it were to exceed the Son in wickedneſs, was playing
the ſame Game with the Cardinalls and chief Barons of the City;
inſomuch that <hi>Volateran</hi> and <hi>Guiccardine</hi> are weary with relating
their Barbarities, and the politick Florentine, <hi>Nick Matchiavil,</hi>
when he would give the World the Character or true figure of
a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> does it in the perſon of this <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> as <hi>Zenophon</hi>

               </p>

                  <hi>The manner of this Popes death both</hi> Onuphrius, Volateran,
<hi>and</hi> Guiccardine <hi>relate as followeth,</hi>—He Supping one night in
a Vineyard near the Vatican, to enjoy the coolneſs of the Air,
was ſuddenly carried deſperately ſick into the Pallace, and the next
morning he died, black, ſwoln, and beyond all credit deform'd, which
happened as it is credibly reported by Poyſon in this manner: <hi>Caeſar
Borgia</hi> his Son Duke of <hi>Valentia,</hi> had reſolv'd to <hi>Poiſon Adrian</hi>
Cardinal of <hi>Corvoto,</hi> in whoſe Vineyard they were to Sup that
Night, he ſent before certain Bottles of Wine which he cauſed to be
delivered to a Servant of his with a ſtrict charge that no body ſhould
taſt or touch it; it happen'd before Supper time the Pope came, and
being very hot and thirſty, called for Wine, and becauſe his Supper
was not yet brought from the Pallace, the fellow thinking this to be
ſome more excellent ſort of Wine than uſual, willing to gratify his
Holineſſes Pallate, gave him ſome of it; and juſt as the Father was
drinking, in came the Son, and not imagining it to be of the Wine
he had ſo prepared, drank of it too, but he being young and uſing
preſent Remedies eſcaped with his Life, but not without
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57857:142"/>
great Languiſhment which incapacited him for Actions for the
future.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Pope had</hi> Raign'd, <hi>or rather</hi> Rag'd 11 <hi>years, and the
people were ſo pleas'd they were rid of him, that</hi> Guiccardine
<hi>tells us,</hi> Multitudes ran from all parts of the City, to glut their eyes,
if they could, with the dead Carcaſe of this Serpant, who with ſuch
unbridled Ambition, perfidious Treachery, horrible Cruelty, monſtrous
Luxury, Inſatitae, Avarice, and ſelling without difference, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
all things holy and profane, had Infected the whole World.
<hi>Nor does</hi> Onuphrius <hi>the Popes own Hiſtoriographer, give him a
better Character;</hi> His Treachery (<hi>ſays he</hi>) was more than puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
his Cruelty Barbarous, his Covetouſneſs and Extortion unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable,
his deſire to enrich his Children, whether by Right, or by
wrong, unſatiable. He was ſtrangely given to Women, by whom he
had four Sons and two Daughters. His principal Where was <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noccia,</hi>
a <hi>Roman,</hi> whom for her Beauty, rare meen, pleaſant wit, and
Eloquence, in the time of his meaner Fortunes he liv'd with after
the manner of a Wife.—<hi>Now was not this a rare fellow to be</hi>
Chriſts Viccar, Peters Succeſſor, <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
<hi>&amp;c. Yet this was the pretious Pope, who in the year</hi> 1494.
<hi>Publiſht with his own mouth, a pardon for</hi> Thirty Thouſand years
<hi>to as many as would ſay a certain Prayer before the Image of
St.</hi> Anne, <hi>the Mother of the bleſſed Virgin, Beginning—</hi> Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta

ſpot or ſin thou didſt proceed, <hi>&amp;c. Where are now the</hi> Dominicans
<hi>who Preached the contrary Doctrine? the moſt Holy, moſt
infallible</hi> Monſter, <hi>you ſee, has concluded the point againſt
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next came <hi>Pius</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> in the year 1503. he was an Old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cripite
fellow, and lived not above a month, then upſtarts <hi>that
Hector Julius</hi> the ſecond, for before ever the Cardinals met, he
had made his Party by <hi>Bribes</hi> and fair promiſes; and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever ſhutting the doors of the Conſiſtory was declared Pope;
his firſt buſineſs was to Marry a Baſtard Girle he had, named
<hi>Felix,</hi> to one of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> and his next was to drive the <hi>French</hi>
out of <hi>Italy;</hi> he took <hi>Ceſena</hi> and <hi>Forolivio</hi> from <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> the
Son of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6<hi>th,</hi> Expell'd the Family of <hi>Bentivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli</hi>
with their Wives and Children out of <hi>Bononia,</hi> Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and gave their Lands to the firſt that could
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:57857:143"/>
take them, Interdicted <hi>Alphonſo</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and made open
War againſt him becauſe he took part with the <hi>French,</hi> and
went in perſon to the ſeige of <hi>Mirandula.</hi> And paſſing once
over the Bridge of <hi>Tyber,</hi> with a naked <hi>ſword</hi> in his hand, he
flung the Keys into the River, which gave occaſion to that
Epigram.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Monſtrelet <hi>the Hiſtorian thus deſcribes him,</hi>—He left
the Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and took upon him the Title of <hi>Mars</hi> the God of
War, diſplaying in the field his Triple Crown, and ſpending his
Nights in the Watch. What a goodly ſight was it to ſee the Mitres,
Croſſes and Croſier ſtaves Flying up and down the Field? ſure no
Divels could be there, where Benedictions were ſold ſo cheap.</p>
               <p>Upon this, <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour
reſolve to call a Council at <hi>Piſa,</hi> and to ſummon this Pope
thither as being notoriouſly ſcandalous, incorrigible, a Fomenter
of Wars, and altogether unfit for the Popedome; and though
the Pope uſed means to take off the Emperour, yet <hi>Lewis</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
and cauſed certain <hi>Medals</hi> to be Coyned, upon which was
Inſcribed theſe words—<hi>Perdam Babylonem, I will deſtroy
Babylon,</hi> and on ſome of them, <hi>perdam Babylonis nomen—I will
deſtroy the Name of Babylon.</hi> By which 'tis evident he meant
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that the notion of its being <hi>Babylon</hi> is neither new,
nor ſet on foot by Proteſtants, though 'tis true his Holineſs was
herewith ſo much offended, that by his Bull he took away from
the French King the Title of <hi>Moſt Chriſtian,</hi> and offer'd the
ſame to <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (then one of the Popes <hi>white
Boy's</hi>) on whom afterward was beſtow'd, <hi>that</hi> of, <hi>defender of the

               <p>In oppoſition to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Piſa,</hi> Pope <hi>Julius</hi> ſets up a
