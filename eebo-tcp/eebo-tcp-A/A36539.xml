         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Epiſtle to the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT is agreed on all hands, that the Mind
and Will of God revealed to us, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Revelation be made, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and adequate Rule of Conſcience, by
which we are to direct both our Faith and
Practice. And that the Holy Scriptures of
the Old and New Teſtament, contain at leaſt
a part of this Divine Revelation, is granted by
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. From whence
it will clearly follow, that whatſoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that Revelation which we have in the
Holy Scriptures, ought not to be received for
Divine Doctrine and Truth; unleſs we will
ſuppoſe an inconſiſtence in Divine Revelation,
or that God doth contradict himſelf, which none
will have the folly to aſſert. We muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
therefore how we have received and heard
in the Holy Scriptures, and hold that faſt.
And if there be any Doctrine or Tradition,
which contradicts the Doctrine of God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the Holy Scriptures, or makes his
Commandment therein contain'd of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
we are taught by our Saviour to reject it.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:97965:3"/>
So that if an Apoſtle, or an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and much more if a Father, or if a
Church, preach to us any other Goſpel than
what is therein delivered to us, we ſhould do
the ſame.</p>
            <p>Whether the Doctrines that are conteſted
between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are of
this Nature, is the Queſtion in diſpute. To
make a right Judgment of which, we need but
conſider the ſeveral Doctrines, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them with the Holy Scriptures, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their agreeableneſs and diſagreeableneſs
thereunto. To aſſiſt the Reader in which, is
the Deſign of this ſmall Treatiſe, wherein you
have a Collection of the chief Points in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
between us; and in the head of the
ſeveral Chapters, is firſt ſet down the Romiſh
Doctrine, as it is defined and received, or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
taught in the Church; and then the
Texts of Scripture are ſubjoined, with ſhort
and eaſy Notes and Obſervations deduced
from them, to apply them to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
whereby it is eaſy to make a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
between the ſeveral Doctrines and the
Scripture, and the Contrariety between them
will be manifeſt to the meaneſt Capacity. But
yet that it might be made more uſeful, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all miſunderſtanding, and to make the
Matters in Difference the more clear, where it
was thought needful, the Controverſies alſo
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:97965:3"/>
are briefly ſtated, and ſome farther Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
added, and the principal Objections
are briefly obviated. So that it is hoped, it
may be of good uſe to all that deſire to be
guarded againſt the Errors of <hi>Rome,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to thoſe that have not Mony to buy, or
Time or Capacity to read and underſtand lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or more learned Diſcourſes, for whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
it was principally intended: And ſome
ſuch Thing, in ſo plain and eaſy a Method,
ſeemed to be deſired.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
we may be ſure, will not be pleaſed with this
Method, becauſe we do not take the Scriptures
in their Senſe, and with their Interpretations.
But thoſe, we think, are Comments which
deſtroy the Text; and therefore we have no
mind to them. And we ſhould not have the
Text neither by their good will; for they do
not love that that dangerous Book ſhould come
into the hands of the Common People, for
fear leſt they ſhould think that the Text is
againſt them. But however they endeavour
to make themſelves Maſters of the Senſe and
Interpretation, that that may be for them.
Thus if the Text be ready to ſtrike them,
they put out its Eyes by the Expoſition, that
it ſhall not know how to direct its Blow, and
then they are ſafe enough. But we cannot
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:97965:4"/>
think our ſelves obliged to take every thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
truſt that they ſay.</p>
            <p>But they refer us alſo to Tradition, and the
Conſent of the Fathers, for the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Scripture-Doctrine; which we are
not againſt. But unleſs we will take this
Tradition, and this Conſent of the Fathers
from their Mouth likewiſe, they will not be
pleaſed. So that, as they would have it, our
Faith muſt be ultimately reſolved only into
the preſent Voice of their Church. And we
muſt not condemn any of her Doctrines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
they ſay, they ſhall not be condemned;
that is, they will be Judges in their own Caſe,
for fear of the worſt.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that we make uſe of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and the Judgment of the Fathers as
well as they. And we do not fear to refer
our ſelves to them, in the Matters conteſted
between us; but then they muſt give us leave
to make uſe of Tradition a little more Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
than they do, and not to ſeek it only
from the Voice of their Church; For we hope,
as long as we have Eyes, we may read the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as well as they; and we do not know why
we may not as well underſtand their Senſe, as
alſo the Senſe of the Holy Scriptures, having
the ſame means for it; only the worſt is, we
want Infallible Parts, which we do not know
but they may want as well as we.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:97965:4"/>
But what is it, but a great derogation from the Holy
Scripture, and the Holy Ghoſt, the Author of it, to think,
that of it ſelf it is equally apt to deceive, as to inſtruct?
to induce into Error, as to lead into Truth? What is this,
but to level it with the Heathen Oracle, that ſpake always
with that ambiguity, that no Body knew what to make of
it, and therefore they were as ſoon deceived by it as not?
But yet is not this in effect the very Senſe of the Church
of <hi>Rome?</hi> Or why elſe doth ſhe ſo ſtudiouſly with-hold the
Bible from her Members, for fear leſt they ſhould have
more hurt by it, than good, if they take it by it ſelf?
What is this, but under pretence of taking care of her
Children, to call her Father and Husband, whom ſhe
pretends ſo great reſpect to, all to naught; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
her ſelf, that ſhe hath more tenderneſs and love to
her Children than they? But is it not rather her own
Grandeur and Height which ſhe takes care of, which theſe
Doctrines do ſubſerve to? And therefore ſhe is reſolved to
maintain them, and muſt uſe the means for it; which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
by with-holding the Light that would diſcover them.
For it is to be truly feared, that if the Bible were in
every one's Hand, and read with any attention, it would
ſoon ſcatter this Darkneſs, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
well perceives. And if that be to deceive, the Scripture
will deceive. And if Inſtruction conſiſts only in learning
their Errors, the Scripture will never inſtruct us to the
World's End: So that in this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in
the Right, and is a very wiſe Mother for her ſelf; but let
others judg how kind ſhe is to her Children, or faithful to
her Bridegroom.</p>
            <p>As for our parts, we are fully perſwaded, that the
Holy Ghoſt may ſpeak as good Senſe, and as intelligibly
in the Scriptures, as any of them in their Writings, or as
the Church can in hers, and that it was his Deſign to do
ſo. And therefore we doubt not, but it is done plainly and
fully in all Points neceſſary to Salvation; and alſo as to
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:97965:5"/>
the Controverſies between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us,
that enough may be plainly gathered from them. And
where there is any obſcurity, either it is in leſſer Matters,
or in prophetick Viſions; or only ariſeth by accident, by
reaſon of the diſtance of time, wherein the Holy Scriptures
were written, the variety and change of Cuſtoms, the
difference of Dialects or Forms of Speech, or ſome ſuch
other Cauſes which are incident to all ancient Writings, and
eſpecially of the Eaſtern Countries. And either it may be
cleared up by the ſame means which we may uſe as well as
they, or elſe it muſt, for what I know, remain ſo yet to
us both, for the exerciſe of our farther induſtry.</p>
            <p>It is the Scripture then that we build our Faith upon,
and guide our ſelves by; though we do not refuſe any help
to the underſtanding of it. And we are not afraid that
our common People ſhould read it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but do exhort them to
it. For we do not deſire to retain any Doctrines or Works
of Darkneſs, and therefore we are very willing that all
ſhould be brought to the Light. It is the Scripture that
we love; and whilſt we love the Scripture, we do declare
it, that we cannot be very fond of <hi>Rome.</hi> A plain ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
view of Scripture is ſufficient to keep us out of the
ways of Romiſh Deluſion. And ſuch a view is preſented
to the Reader in this little Treatiſe, in a Method fitted to
the moſt vulgar Capacity.</p>
            <p>Let us but ſtick to the Scripture, or written Word,
which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is really moſt dreadfully afraid
of, and then we are out of danger. The Scripture we know
from whence it is; but as for their Traditions, many of
them we know not whence they are. They pretend they
come from the Apoſtles, but we have nothing elſe but only
their own word for it: For we cannot perceive the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Image and Superſcription upon them. Nor would
they then ever contradict the Apoſtolical Writings, as we
are well aſſured they do many of them. Tradition indeed
alone doth but open a Gap to whatſoever bold and confident
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:97965:5"/>
Men may obtrude, that have ſubtilty enough to ſet off a
Thing a little plauſibly. But let us hold faſt the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Word, and we ſhall not fear to be intangled with
thoſe new Doctrines, which are the obtruſions of crafty
and ambitious Men to make an advantage, by which the
face of Chriſtianity comes to be quite marred, and all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
comes to be indangered.</p>
            <p>And read but this little Treatiſe then, and compare Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Text, and then ſee who is in the right, the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or We: For ſee if their Doctrine and
the Holy Text be not at variance the one with the other.
And if ſo, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt excuſe us, if we
leave their Doctrine and follow the Text.</p>
            <p>Beware of falſe Prophets, which come to you in Sheeps
Cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves; ye
ſhall know them by their Fruits. Do not believe every
Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God. If
the Blind lead the Blind, they will both fall into the
Ditch. Hereſies will ariſe in the Church, and the Devil
will ſometimes transform himſelf into an Angel of Light,
to deceive whom he can deceive. Therefore ſee with your
own Eyes, and beg the holy Anointing to teach you.</p>

Verſ. 16, 17. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of
God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
for inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of
God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good
Works.</hi> Mow if the Man of God, who is to inſtruct
others, and to declare to them the whole Counſel
of God, ſo far as is neceſſary for their attainment of
Salvation, be perfectly inſtructed for the diſcharge
of his Duty from the Scripture; then the Scripture
muſt needs contain all ſaving Truth, or all that is
neceſſary to be known, both by him and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Chriſtian in order to Salvation. And note,
that it is not our part to ſhow what thoſe Scriptures
then were which the Apoſtle here intends, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confeſſedly the ſame which are ſtill contained in
the Canon of it: But whatever they were, it is
plain from the Apoſtle, that there is no ſaving
Truth but what is contained in them, which yet
doth not derogate from the uſefulneſs of thoſe
Books which were added to the Canon afterwards,
whatever they were, they being uſeful however as
Comments upon the former, to clear up what was
before leſs clearly delivered, or to declare ſome
Truths of leſs neceſſary importance, though all
that was neceſſary to Salvation was delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
So that we muſt needs apprehend the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as it is now, to be a compleat Rule of Faith,
without taking in any thing of unwritten Tradition
to piece it up or compleat it.</p>
               <p>Before Divine Doctrine was committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Men had no other Rule but natural Light, or
immediate Revelation, or Tradition of what was
before made known. And when the Lives of Men
were long, Divine Doctrine might better be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
this way than it can be now. And in our
Saviour's &amp; the Apoſtles Time this might ſerve the
turn for the preſent Age, in which there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97965:8"/>
of extraordinary Gifts, and eſpecially to
the immediate Auditors of theſe inſpired Perſons.
But in the ſhorter Age of Men this was not thought
a ſafe or ſufficient means to conveigh down Divine
Doctrine to the following Ages. And therefore it
was thought more expedient to put down in
writing what was to be made known to after-Ages,
for the more ſure preſervation of all ſuch Truths
from Corruption, and to be a ſtanding Rule to which
they might have recourſe upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>Thus God himſelf wrote the Ten Commandments
in Tables of Stone. And <hi>Moſes</hi> by God's direction
wrote the Law, as the Prophets afterwards did their
ſeveral Prophecies, or a brief Summary of them:
For it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. All Scripture is given b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
inſpiration of God.</hi> And ſometimes we find expreſs
direction for the writing of ſome things which were
to be tranſmitted to future Ages: As <hi>Exod. 17. 14.
Write this for a Memorial in a Book.</hi> And <hi>Iſa. 30. 8.
Now go write it before them in a Table, and note it in a
Book, that it may be for the Time to come, for ever and
ever.</hi> And <hi>Pſal. 102. 18. This ſhall be written for
the Generation to come.</hi> Whereby is intimated the
great need of writing then, to conveigh a certain
notice of things to future Ages; and which implies
the Incompetency and Inſufficiency of Tradition
for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And when once it had pleaſed God to commit the
Holy Rule to writing, we find the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for a perfect Direction: Pſal. 19. 7. <hi>The Law
of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul.</hi> And Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is no where commended, or any order given
to have recourſe to it in any caſe, but to the Holy
Scripture alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus,</hi> Iſa. 8. 20. To the Law and to the Teſtimony;
if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe
there is no Light in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97965:9"/>
                  <hi>Thus</hi> Joſhua <hi>was directed to govern himſelf in
all his Actions by the ſame Holy Rule, and therein
ſhould</hi> proſper and do wiſely, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 7. That thou
mayſt obſerve to do according to all the Law which <hi>Moſes</hi>
my Servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right
hand, or to the left. <hi>And,</hi> verſ. 8. This Book of the
Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt
meditate therein day and night, that thou mayeſt obſerve
to do according to all that is written therein.</p>
               <p>The ſame alſo did <hi>Joſhua</hi> preſcribe to his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 23. 6. And the King, when he ſat <hi>upon the
Throns of his Kingdom,</hi> was to <hi>write him a Copy of this
Law in a Book, and read therein all the days of his life.</hi>
Deut. 17. 18, 19. And this was the way to have him
proſperous, and to <hi>prolong his days.</hi> Here is nothing
at all left to Tradition, nor any recourſe to be had
to it, but to the written Law alone intimated as
perfect to all the intents and purpoſes of a good
and holy Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There were no other Ordinances to be obſerved
but what were contained in the Law, which forbad
all Additions. Deut.</hi> 4. 2. Ye ſhall not add unto the
Word which I command you; neither ſhall you diminiſh
from it. <hi>So again,</hi> Chap. 12. 32. <hi>ſo</hi> Prov. 30. 6. Add
thou not unto his Words; leſt he reprove thee, and thou be

               <p>
                  <hi>For this the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were condemned,</hi>
Jer. 32. 35. <hi>that they</hi> built the high Places of <hi>Baal,</hi>
to conſecrate their Sons and their Daughters unto <hi>Molech,</hi>
which I commanded them not.</p>
               <p>The Reformation of the Church therefore under
<hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> that good King, was made by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
That was their Rule alone, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 9.</p>
               <p>The ſame practice was obſerved under the Reign
of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 31. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Accordingly our Saviour and his Apoſtles refer
to the Scripture as the only Rule, and confirm their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97965:9"/>
Doctrines by it, but no where have recourſe to
Tradition for any thing.</p>
               <p>Thus for the obtaining amendment of Life, and
the avoiding of Condemnation; Luke 16. 29. <hi>They
have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> And
this he commends for as great efficacy to that end,
as if one ſhould come and ariſe from the Dead to
ſpeak to them.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. For the attainment of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of himſelf, and Life everlaſting, <hi>Search the

                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 27. Beginning at Moſes and all the Prophets,
he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things

               </p>
               <p>So alſo he refutes the Phariſees by the Scripture,

               <p>He combateth all ſorts of Errors by the Scripture,

               <p>To end the Difference that was agitated at the
Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> alledges the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 15. So that the Scripture is
that which is every were referr'd to, as the Rule
of Faith and Manners; but not one word ſaid of
Tradition to that end. It having pleaſed God,
when once the Scripture was Indited, to leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Tradition; though ſometimes he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to reveal himſelf farther by immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97965:10"/>
till all the Books of the Holy Canon were
perfected.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, Tradition is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commended, that the uſe of it is decried, as
the foundation of many Errors, and Wickedneſſes,
and Superſtitions; and their adhering to the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the Fathers is cenſured.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 1, &amp;c. <hi>When the Phariſees ſaw
ſome of his Diſciples eat Bread with defiled (that is to
ſay, with unwaſhen) Hands, they found fault. For the
Phariſees, and all the Jews, except they waſh their Hands
oft, eat not, holding the Tradition of the Elders.
And when they come from the Market, except they waſh,
they eat not. And many other things there are, which they
have received to hold, as the waſhing of Cups, and
Pots, and brazen Veſſels, and Tables.</hi> Which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
as a part of religious Worſhip received by
Tradition from their Fathers, though not commanded
in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Like the Holy Water of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Incenſings and Garments, the
Salt and Spittle, and Exorciſms, and Wax-candles,
uſed in Baptiſm; the Prieſts ſhaving the Head after
the manner of a Crown, which they profeſs to have
received from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, &amp; conveyed
to them by the Tradition of the Church through all
Ages, though there be not one word of any of it

their Fathers. So that the Tradition of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
was ſo far from being a ſure Rule to them,
that it was a means of very great Corruption, which
the Chriſtians are redeemed from.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore there was that Exhortation,</hi> Ezek. 20.
18, 19. Walk ye not in the Statutes of your Fathers,
neither obſerve their Judgments, nor defile your ſelves
with their Idols: I am the Lord your God, walk in my
Statutes; and keep my Judgments, and do them.</p>
               <p>The vanity and uncertainty of Tradition for a
Rule of Faith, ſufficiently appears by theſe things.
And how much the uſe of it is decried as miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and hurtful. And if it was ſo in the Church
and State of the Jews, which was but of a very
narrow compaſs, and thereupon it might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
then to be a more certain means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Truth; how much more reaſonably may
we think it to be ſo in the Chriſtian Church diffuſed
through all Nations, where by reaſon of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and diſtance of Chriſtian Teachers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
it muſt needs be much more eaſy for ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
and conceited Men to obtrude their Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to back them with the pretence of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
of which there hath been many Inſtances.
And hence ſuch Difference hath ariſen between
Traditions themſelves, as is plain in the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
in the Primitive Church about <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and many
others. And can we think that our Saviour ſhould
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97965:11"/>
leave his Church to ſuch an uncertain Rule now,
when there is ſo much need rather to have it more
exact and ſetled? Should that be a Rule of Faith in
the Chriſtian Church, which was wholly diſallowed
and decried in the Jewiſh? Or is Tradition now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo much altered, that it is become ſo ſure and
harmleſs above what it was? If Tradition be taken
for a natural Means, there is nothing more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in a long tract of Time. And ſure our Saviour
would not leave his Church to ſuch uncertainty
when he might do better. If it be pretended to
be aſſiſted with Infallibility, that ſhall be examined
afterwards.</p>
               <p>It is plain, that the Chriſtian-Inſpired Writers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſaw it needful to write down the Doctrine of our
Saviour, to tranſmit it to After-ages: they did not
think Tradition was a ſure means of conveyance
then, no more than it was before: Therefore St.
<hi>Luke</hi> wrote his Goſpel <hi>to the moſt excellent</hi> Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
<hi>that he might know the certainty of thoſe things
wherein he had been inſtructed,</hi> Luke 1. 4. implying,
that the other way of conveyance by Tradition is
not ſo certain. And St. <hi>Peter, I will not be negligent,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>to put you always in remembrance,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.
12. And, verſ. 13. <hi>I think it meet to ſtir you up,
by putting you in remembrance.</hi> Mens memories are
not ſo very good to retain Divine Things, unleſs
they are excited and quickned. And, verſ. 15.
<hi>Moreover, I will endeavour that you may be able after
my deceaſe, to have theſe things always in remembrance:</hi>
Which ſeems to be done by his putting St. <hi>Mark</hi> to
write this Goſpel from his Mouth. Thus St. <hi>Jude</hi>
ſays, <hi>That he gave all diligence to write unto them of
the common Salvation, and that it was needful for him
to write unto them,</hi> verſ. 3. And if it was needful
for that Age, it was much more needful for After-ages.
We may be ſure, our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="09" facs="tcp:97965:11"/>
would have that done which was needful in
their own Judgments for Mens Salvation.</p>
               <p>And we are likewiſe aſſured by St. <hi>John,</hi> that it
is done fully, as it was needful it ſhould be done,
that nothing might be left to the uncertainty of
Tradition. John 20. 31. <hi>Theſe things are written,
that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye may believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of
God, and that believing ye might have Life through his
Name.</hi> He ſhows, that the writing of theſe Things
is needful to be a Foundation of right Faith to Men,
and that enough was written then in his own and
the other Goſpels and Writings (which it is ſaid
he had ſeen) to be a Foundation of that Faith
in Men which is needful to their eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So that no ſaving Truth was left to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
by Tradition at all; which yet does not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
the uſeleſſneſs of what Books were after added,
as was ſaid before.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 4. Theſe things write we unto you, that
you may rejoice, and that your Joy may be full.</p>
               <p>So that the Scripture giving us ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
as to what concerns our Faith and Comfort,
in order to Eternal Salvation, how can we imagine
any deficiency in it, but muſt needs ſuppoſe that it
contains in it all the material Objects of Faith and
Matters of ſaving Practice? Or how can we depend
upon Tradition as diſtinct from the Scripture, which
was ever ſo decried, for uncertain, miſchievous and

               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore we conclude with our Church,</hi> That

of Tradition unwritten, that amongſt all the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97965:12"/>

St.</hi> John <hi>tells us were ſo many,</hi> John 21. 25. <hi>That
if</hi> all the things which he did, ſhould be written every

the Books that ſhould be written. <hi>Yet there is
not one of all theſe come certainly to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
but what is written in the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we have fair warning alſo given us of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

Spirit, nor by Words, nor by Letter, as from us, as that
the Day of Chriſt is at hand: Let no Man deceive you
by no means.</hi> By which it appears, that even in the
Apoſtles Times, there were forged Writings, and
feigned Traditions, which ſome had the boldneſs to
obtrude for Apoſtolical Doctrines. This is a fair
warning to us now, much more in theſe later Ages,
to give but little heed to any thing, however pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

wrote (and it does not appear that they wrote any

things, that are not ſo abſolutely neceſſary to

but ſpeak only of being baptized in Water,
in the Name of the Father, and the Son, and the

ſpeak ſo much of Worſhip, tell us of the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of Saints and Images? or of praying for the
Dead, when they give us ſo many directions about
Prayer? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>

We muſt <hi>hold faſt the Traditions,</hi> ſay they, <hi>which
we have been taught</hi> by the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 15.
But we cannot believe, that theſe and ſuch-like
things were ever taught by them, when we have
nothing at all of any of them in all their Writings.
And that exhortation could be then meant only of
thoſe things which the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> had heard from
them, and were very ſure of, that they were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Doctrines; And which we doubt not, were no
other but what were after ſet down in the holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and in them conveyed to us. It is impoſſible
for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſhew that they were any
other by Tradition only, when the traditional con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of Points is evidently ſo uncertain, and that
which we have been ſo warned againſt.</p>
               <p>Yet after all note, that all this is nothing againſt
the Tradition of the Univerſal Church, as a means of
delivering down to us the Holy Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
the number of the Books, and the Names of
the Authors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor againſt that which is concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
with Scripture, or corrolorative of it in any
Point of Faith or Practice, but againſt that which is
urged as a Rule of ſaving Faith and Practice, diſtinct
and different from it, (and ſometimes contrary to
it) and is pretended to be the Tradition of the
Univerſal Church from the Apoſtles Age, but can
never be proved to be ſo.</p>
               <p>There is no fear of falling into Error therefore,
either through Ignorance or Infidelity, as to ſuch
Traditions. But we muſt ſay as our Saviour, <hi>Mark
12. 24. Do ye not therefore err, becauſe ye know not the
Scriptures?</hi> And as the ignorance of Scripture is the
Source and Fountain of Error, ſo on the contrary
then to follow the guidance of the Scripture, is the
way to be preſerved from Error.</p>

               <p>So, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 15. From a Child thou haſt known
the Holy Scriptures.</hi> See here a Child exerciſed in
the Holy Scriptures: And this is noted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
as an excellent and praiſe-worthy thing in

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve, that the Apoſtle St.</hi> Paul <hi>addreſſes the
moſt part of his Epiſtles, not to the Prieſts or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97965:16"/>
but</hi> to the Churches of God, to them that are
ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, and to all that call on the
Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>ſee</hi> Rom. 1. 7. 1 Cor.
1. 2. 2 Cor. 1. 1. Gal. 1. 2. Epheſ. 1. 1.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew clearly that he wrote to the People,
as well as to the Paſtors, he diſtinguiſhes them in his

<hi>the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, To all the Saints

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So likewiſe St.</hi> James <hi>addreſſes his Epiſtle</hi> to the

the Righteouſneſs of God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> writes <hi>to Fathers, to young Men, and to
Children.</hi> Now what colour can there be to hinder
thoſe Perſons from reading thoſe Epiſtles that were
ſent and addreſt to them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Add to this, that the Apoſtles did formally and
expreſly command and require Perſons to read
their Epiſtles. Thus,</hi> Col. 4. 16. When this Epiſtle
is read among you, cauſe that it be read alſo in the
Church of the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and that ye likewiſe read
the Epiſtle from <hi>Laodicea. So,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 27. I
charge you by the Lord, that this Epiſtle be read to all
the Holy Brethren.</p>
               <p>And note, that for this end they were writ in
a Language beſt known to the generality of People.
As alſo all the Holy Scripture beſides was writ in a
Language that was beſt underſtood by the People for
whom it was writ. The Old Teſtament in Hebrew
for the uſe of the Jews; The New Teſtament in
Greek, that being the Language then moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
uſed. And for this end there were Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97965:16"/>
made of the Scriptures into the Languages of
ſeveral Nations, that People of all ſorts might read
them.</p>
               <p>As to what is ſaid, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. That in the
Scriptures <hi>there are ſome things hard to be underſtood,
which many do wreſt to their own deſtruction.</hi> It is from
the vice and raſhneſs of Men, that they do ſo wreſt
them; which if they were of humble and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſpirits, they might avoid. And therefore to
prevent this wreſting of them, the Apoſtle doth
not prohibit the People the reading of them; but
only cautions them, that they <hi>be not led away with</hi>
theſe <hi>Errors of the Wicked,</hi> and directs them <hi>to grow
more in knowledg:</hi> the way to attain unto which is,
to peruſe them with greater care and diligence.
And it is an unreaſonable thing to build a Prohibition
of reading the Scriptures upon a far-fetch'd conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from this Text, againſt ſo many expreſs
Commands to the contrary.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Note, here the moſt difficult Book of Scripture

God calls thoſe Bleſſed that read and keep it. And

As for Example;</p>
               <p>What was the Face of the Church then, when
God brought <hi>Abraham</hi> out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and Idolaters? <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What was the Face of the Church when</hi> Iſrael
<hi>was in</hi> Egypt, <hi>where they defiled themſelves with the
Idols of</hi> Egypt? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 7, 8. Then they rebelled againſt
me, <hi>ſays God,</hi> and would not hearken unto me; they did
not every Man caſt away the Abominations of his Eyes,
neither did they forſake the Idols of <hi>Egypt;</hi> then I ſaid,
I will pour out my Fury upon them, and mine Anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them in the midst of the Land of <hi>Egypt. Here
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97965:17"/>
was a very great Corruption in the State of the
Church, and that in the very chief and principal
Points of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What was the Face of the Church in the Time
of the Judges of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12, 13. All
that Generation were gathered unto their Fathers; and
there aroſe another Generation after them, that knew not
the Lord, nor yet his Works which he had done for <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
And the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did evil in the ſight of the
Lord, and ſerved <hi>Baalim:</hi> And they forſook the Lord
God of their Fathers, which brought them out of the
Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and followed other Gods, of the Gods
of the People that were round about them; and bowed
themſelves to them, and provoked the Lord to anger:
And they forſook the Lord, and ſerved <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Aſhta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth.
How was the Face of the Church disfigured
at that Time, when they publickly worſhipp'd falſe
Gods? He that would ſee the ſeveral Ecclipſes of
the Church of</hi> Iſrael <hi>then, let him read this Hiſtory
of the Judges, particularly Chap. 2. 3, 4, 6, 10.
And,</hi> 2 Chron. 15. 3. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was for a long ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
without the True God, and without a teaching Prieſt,
and without the Law.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Solomon,</hi> ten
of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> revoked from the
Service of God, and publickly worſhipp'd the Calves
in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> which were made by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 King. 12. And if you
deſire to ſee how much the Face of the Church was
disfigured, and how often the Service of God was
interrupted, read the Hiſtory of the <hi>Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ten Tribes were the greateſt part of the
Church of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>But in them the Church was ſo
obſcured in the Time of</hi> Ahab, <hi>that</hi> Elijah <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,</hi>
1 King. 19. 10. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> have
forſaken thy Covenant, thrown down thine Altars, and
ſlain thy Prophets with the Sword; and I, even I only
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97965:18"/>
am left, and they ſeek my Life to take it away. <hi>God
had indeed reſerved to himſelf 7000 Men, that had
not bowed their Knees to</hi> Baal. <hi>And,</hi> 1 King. 18. 4.
When <hi>Jezebel</hi> had put to death the Prophets of the Lord;
<hi>Obadia</hi> took an hundred Prophets, and hid them by fifty
in a Cave, and ſed them with Bread and Water. <hi>So
that there was a Church then left in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

was ſo obſcured, that</hi> Elijah <hi>himſelf could not ſee
it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> alſo, there was
ſometimes the ſame obſcure State of the Church.
As in the Time of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 Chron. 28. 24, 25. For
Ahaz <hi>gathered together the Veſſels of the Houſe of the
Lord, and cut them in pieces, and ſhut up the Doors of
the Houſe of the Lord, and he made him Altars in every
corner of</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>And in every ſeveral City of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah
<hi>he made high Places to burn Incenſe unto other Gods, and
to provoke to anger the Lord God of his Fathers.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
again, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 6, 7. There was no other
Church of God then upon Earth, but what was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> and there
was not any one Temple dedicated to the Worſhip
of the True God but that at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But yet you
ſee that was prophaned, the Service of God ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
Idolatry eſtabliſh'd. And what external
Form of a Church then was there there, where the
true God was not acknowledged or ſerved?</p>
               <p>So in the Time of <hi>Manaſſeh, 2 Chron. 33. 4, 5.
Who built again the high Places which</hi> Hezekiah <hi>his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had broken down, and he reared up Altars to</hi> Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim,
<hi>and made Groves, and worſhipped all the Hoſt of
Heaven, and ſerved them. Alſo he built Altars in the
Houſe of the Lord, whereof the Lord had ſaid, In</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem
<hi>ſhall my Name be for ever.</hi> Which was as great
a Promiſe as ever was made to any Church; and if

yet you ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple filled with
Idols. And it is moreover to be obſerved that at
this time the State of the Church was ſo corrupt,
that there were no Copies of the Law to be found
extant among the People, but the Book of the Law
was found in the reſtoring of the Temple by <hi>Joſiah;</hi>
at the reading of which, as a new thing, the King
was mightily terrified, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 18, 19, 20.
which is a plain Argument, that the Law was but
little known, and the Copies of it generally loſt.
And the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jer. 11. 13. That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the number of thy Cities were thy Gods, O</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;
<hi>And according to the number of the Streets of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem

               <p>
                  <hi>Rev. 13. 15, 16, 17. The time is propheſied of,

               </p>
               <p>It is certain in <hi>Fact,</hi> that many Churches founded
by the Apoſtles themſelves have quite fallen away

the whole World almoſt was become <hi>Arian.</hi> And
in the Ages, juſt before the Reformation, the Purity

Superſtitious and Idolatrous Worſhips, that
the Doctrine of the Goſpel was almoſt quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
and falſe Legends, humane Traditions and

always held the ſame Doctrines that we do. Though
there were always ſome that oppoſed and groaned

the Church. For after more than ſixteen hundred
Years after the Creation of the World, the Church
was compoſed but of eight Perſons that entred the

               <p>Near two thouſand three hundred Years after the

Exod. 1. 5. and all theſe but of one Family. And
though it was much encreaſed in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Time, yet

It was confined to the Jewiſh People alone

               <p>In After-Ages the Church indeed was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed;

               <p>So, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 1, 2. it is the <hi>great Whore</hi> that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

which thou ſaweſt, where the Whore ſitteth, are
Peoples, and Multitudes, and Nations, and Tongues.)
And the Kings of the Earth have committed Fornication
with her, and the Inhabitants of the Earth have been
drunk with the Wine of her Fornication.</hi> So that the
great Whore commands Kings, and a multitude of
Peoples, and Nations. This is that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> vaunts of ſo much; but we ſhall think never
the better of them for their Multitude, nor yet
the worſe of our ſelves though we were fewer than
we are, having had ſuch fair Warnings as to this
Matter.</p>
               <p>This is no ſufficient Argument of their being the
true Catholicks, for having the greateſt number of
Profeſſors of their ſide, unleſs they likewiſe retain
and profeſs the Catholick Faith, the ſame Chriſtian
Religion, which all good Chriſtians in all Ages, and
of all Nations, have ever conſtantly profeſs'd. And
if we do this, we are true Catholicks, though we
are the leſſer number, if it be ſo. But upon Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
it has been judged, that the number of
the Reformed is not much unequal to theirs. But
no wiſe Man ever judged of the Truth of Religion,
by the <hi>major Vote;</hi> which is an Argument to none
but Fools. Exod. 23. 2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a
Multitude to do evil.</hi> But, if Multitude were always
in the right, this had been a very improper and

Bellarm. de Eccl. lib. cap. 14.</head>
               <p>WHenſoever any Perſons have been ſent out
upon an extraordinary Meſſage, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Miſſion from God, to preach or teach
ſuch Doctrine as hath not been delivered before, or
not ſufficiently atteſted; In that caſe it is confeſt,
that Miracles are neceſſary to atteſt their Miſſion,
and to confirm their Doctrine. But this Miſſion of
theirs having been once ſufficiently atteſted, and
their Doctrine confirmed by Miracles, and both this
Doctrine and Miracles faithfully recorded, and the
Records ſafely preſerved, then there can be no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
need of more Miracles. For there can be no
need of doing that again which hath been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done already: And therefore there can be no
need of more Miracles, when a Doctrine already
ſufficiently confirmed by Miracles, is only to be
cleanſed and reſtored from the mixture of Errors
with which it is defiled or obſcured. But in that
caſe it is ſufficient to have recourſe to the Writings
and Records in which the true Doctrine hath been
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97965:23"/>
delivered, which hath been ſufficiently confirm'd
before. And therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> wrought
to Miracles, when the Reformation was ſet a-foot
by them according to the Law, already confirm'd
by Miracles. And <hi>Hoſea, Amos,</hi> &amp;c. wrought no
Miracles, when they were ſent to recal the People
from their Apoſtacy to the obſervation of the Law.
And <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt himſelf wrought no Miracles, <hi>John</hi>
10. 41. being but to teach the People that Doctrine
that was delivered in the Promiſes of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
concerning the Meſſiah. And for the ſame
reaſon there was no neceſſity that Miracles ſhould
be wrought by our Reformers, it being their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
not to teach any new Doctrine, but to reſtore
what was already taught, and formerly confirmed
by Miracles.</p>
               <p>And it is moreover to be obſerved, that neither
our Saviour nor his Apoſtles did inſiſt upon Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
alone, as the only Teſt of the Truth of their
Doctrine, but in conjunction with the Predictions and
Prophecies of the Old Teſtament, which were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in our Saviour's Perſon, and in his Works and
Doctrine, as may appear by our Saviour's own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
which he took for the conviction of others,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 25, 26. where he appeals to <hi>all that the
Prophets have ſpoken concerning himſelf.</hi> And by his
referring them to the Scriptures for their informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>John</hi> 5. 39. And ſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> corroborates
the Teſtimony of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, with
<hi>David</hi>'s prediction of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 22, 24. And refers
likewiſe to the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament as
the moſt ſure Rule, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16, 17. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in his preaching, ſaid <hi>none other things than thoſe which
the Prophets and</hi> Moſes <hi>did ſay ſhould come,</hi> Act. 26.
22. So that the Jews were to receive our Saviour
and his Doctrine, not barely upon the account of
his Miracles, but as in conjunction with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97965:24"/>
and Prophecies of the Old Teſtament, and ſo
as having all the concurrent Characters of a Divine
Revelation. And we have much leſs reaſon now to
receive any Doctrine from any Perſons or Church,
upon the account of any Miracles wrought or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be wrought by them, unleſs it be likewiſe
conformed to the Doctrine of the Scriptures, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
delivered and confirmed, by which it is to be
tried.</p>
               <p>We are alſo forewarn'd in the Scriptures, that it
may pleaſe God ſometimes to permit Signs and
Wonders to be wrought for the trial of Men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will adhere to the True Doctrine already
delivered, and ſufficiently confirm'd. And the falſe
Prophets and Teachers ſhall make uſe of ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to propagate their falſe Doctrines. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this can be no proper Mark or Character of a

deceived thereby: For <hi>the Spirit ſpeaketh expreſly,

The ſo many pretended Miracles of the Romiſh
Church, then give us cauſe of ſuſpicion that all is
not right. It is for them to pretend to Miracles,
that want other confirmation of their Doctrine;
but when we preach only the Doctrine already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
we do not need them.</p>
               <p>Gal. 1. 8. <hi>But though we, or an Angel from Heaven,
preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we
have preach'd unto you, let him be accurſed.</hi> It is in
vain to alleadg Miracles to confirm a falſe Doctrine;
for it is not the preaching or apparition of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
is enough to recommend it; and if not ſo, then
not any other Miracle. So that we are to try the
Doctrines now, not by Miracles, but by its conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
to, and correſpondency with the Doctrine of
the Scriptures already eſtabliſh'd. And we muſt
judg of the Miracles themſelves by the Doctrine,
and not the Doctrine by them. And as we are to
judg of the Doctrine, ſo we are to judg of the
Church that teacheth it: And have cauſe to ſuſpect
Miracles now as the Marks of Deceivers, who we
are foretold ſhall pretend to them, than to take
them as Teſts of true Doctrine, or Marks of the
true Church.</p>
               <p>It is the Character of the Phariſees, never to be
contented with the Miracles that have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
wrought, but ſtill to expect more, <hi>Mat. 16.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97965:25"/>
wrought by our Saviour and his Apoſtles. And
ſince we teach no other Doctrine than what was
taught by them, we may ſay of good right, that
their Miracles are our Miracles, and that they au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
our belief.</p>
               <p>So that we ſhall think not one jot the worſe of

Luke 22. 24. <hi>There was alſo a ſtrife among them,
which of them ſhould be accounted the Greateſt.</hi> Note,
that this Diſpute was but the Evening before the
Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, after theſe words were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<hi>Mat. 16. 19. I will give unto thee the Keys.</hi> If
St. <hi>Peter</hi> had been then conſtituted the Chief of the
Apoſtles, there would never have been this Diſpute
among them touching the Primacy. For our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

had given it to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> But on the contrary,</p>
               <p>Verſ. 25. 26. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe
Lordſhip over them; and they that exerciſe Authority upon
them, are called Benefactors, but ye ſhall not be ſo.</hi> Which
certainly excludes ſuch a Supreme Authority as is
claim'd by the Pope.</p>
               <p>John 20. 22, 23. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt breathed upon his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and ſaid unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt.
Whoſe Sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whoſe Sins
ye retain, they are retained.</hi> Note here, that the
Power of binding and looſing, which was promiſed
to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 16. 19. is here given to all the
Diſciples indifferently. Therefore that Promiſe
conveyed no ſpecial Priviledge or Authority to
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but what was given in common to them
all.</p>
               <p>Epheſ. 2. 20. <hi>Ye are built upon the Foundation of the
Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the

Prophets are here put in the ſame rank, and are
all equally called Foundation-ſtones, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> was
called a <hi>Rock,</hi> Matth. 16. 18. and <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>

               <p>So, Rev. 21. 14. <hi>And the Wall of the City had

<hi>was the Son of the living God.</hi> Which Chriſt calls a
<hi>Rock,</hi> and that upon which he would build his

contained in that, or ſignified by it, but what is
equally the duty of all other Paſtors of the Church?
So that here is no Priviledg conferr'd only to him,
but a Duty injoined which concerns all, but is there
particularly three times repeated to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and
urged upon him as the beſt expreſſion of his Love
which he then profeſſed to his Lord and Maſter,
whom before he had thrice denied, and perhaps

               <p>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. Here St. <hi>Peter</hi> puts himſelf in
the rank of the Elders, that is to ſay, the Paſtors
of the Church, and doth not in the leaſt attribute

the ſame to others. <hi>The Elders which are among you,
I exhort, who am alſo an Elder:</hi> He doth not ſay,
<hi>who am ſupreme Ruler and Governor over all,</hi> as he might

Saviour gave him: And how then is it a ſpecial
Prerogative belonging to him alone? But then he
adds likewiſe, <hi>not by conſtraint, but willingly; not for
filthy Lucre, but of a ready Mind; neither as being
Lords over God's Heritage, but being Enamples to the
Flock.</hi> Quite contrary to the Pride and Arrogance
of many Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> that lord it over all.</p>
               <p>Conſider farther, there are no Indications of any
ſuch ſupreme Authority in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but the quite

                  <hi>St.</hi> Peter <hi>is not always named in the firſt place; as</hi>

a great Diſpute there had been before he began his

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97965:27"/>
to have excepted St.</hi> Peter, <hi>his Head and Lord, at
leaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent in Commiſſion by the reſt of
the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts 8. 14. When the Apoſtles that were
at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>heard that</hi> Samaria <hi>had received the Word
of God, they ſent unto them</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John. Doth this
look like his being their Head, or having ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over them? Sure it would be eſteemed a
ſtrange piece of preſumption, if the Biſhops ſhould
undertake to do the like to the Pope!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St.</hi> Peter <hi>was required to render an account alſo
of his Carriage: Acts</hi> 11. 2, 3. And when <hi>Peter</hi> was
come up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they that were of the Circumciſion
contended with him, ſaying, Thou wenteſt in unto Men
uncircumciſed, and didst eat with them. But <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed
the Matter from the beginning, and expounded it
by order to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was alſo publickly reproved by St.</hi> Paul, <hi>Gal.</hi>
2. 11. When <hi>Peter</hi> was come to <hi>Antioch,</hi> I withſtood
him to the face, becauſe he was to be blamed. <hi>And,</hi>
verſ. 14. When I ſaw that they walked not uprightly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the truth of the Goſpel, I ſaid unto <hi>Peter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them all, If thou being a Jew liveſt after the manner
of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compelleſt
thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? <hi>Was this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
decent in</hi> Paul, <hi>if St.</hi> Peter <hi>was his Head, and
chief Governor over all? So that here is not the
leaſt Teſtimony or Sign of any ſuch Supremacy
or Power ever owned or acknowledged by St.</hi>
Peter.</p>
               <p>Note alſo, that all Headſhip over the Church
is always appropriated to Chriſt, and that in ſuch a
manner, that it cannot be delegated to St. <hi>Peter</hi> or
any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 22, 23. God hath put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the feet of Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given him to be
Head over all Things to his Church, which is his Body,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97965:28"/>
the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all. <hi>Had it not
been proper to have ſaid,</hi> And under the feet of St.
<hi>Peter</hi> too, and his Succeſſors as Chriſt's Vicar, <hi>if it had
been ſo. But as in the Body of Man there is but
one Head, ſo there is but one Head in the Church,
of which we are all Members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Epheſ. 5. 23. <hi>The Husband is the Head of the Wife,
even as Chriſt is the Head of the Church; and he is the
Saviour of the Body.</hi> Where the Apoſtle joins his
being <hi>Head</hi> of the Church and <hi>Saviour</hi> together:
So that he that is not the Saviour of the Church,
cannot be the Head. And note, that our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt is the Head of the Church, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as the Husband is the Head of the Wife. So
that as in the buſineſs of Marriage there is to be no
Subſtitute, ſo neither is Chriſt to have a Deputy or
Vicar in his Church.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. For other Foundation can no Man lay
than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was Head of the
Church, why muſt the Pope be ſo? Or if it could
be proved, that there was ſuch an Headſhip in St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> how doth it appear that this was any more
than a perſonal Privilege, in which therefore he was
to have no Succeſſor? and an Honour conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him out of particular reſpect, and not from any
univerſal neceſſity of ſuch an Office in the Church?
A ſupreme Paſtor, they ſay, is neceſſary to the
Unity of the Church; and therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> was
ſuch a one, and therefore he ought to have a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
in that ſame Office. But is it ſufficient to
build ſo great a Pretenſion, that can be rightly
grounded upon nothing but a Divine Inſtitution, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a mere humane reaſoning of the expediency and
neceſſity of the Thing? Is it not more modeſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to argue the contrary, that becauſe there is no
Divine Inſtitution of ſuch an Office, that therefore
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97965:28"/>
it is not neceſſary, however we may miſtake the
conveniency of it? Shew the Inſtitution, and we
will believe it; or elſe, though St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have
been Prince of the Apoſtles, and Head of the
Church under Chriſt, (which yet is ſhown that it
was not) why may not we take this for a particular
Honour, and not for a neceſſary Office? Cannot our
Saviour, who is God over all, ſufficiently diſpence
his Influences, and provide for his Churches Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
as far as he thinks meet in this military State,
by other Means and Church-Officers, without ſuch
a Vicar Head? Or how is it poſſible, that a meer
Creature ſhould be capable of executing ſuch an
Office over all the Churches, for their good, at
ſuch remote and diſtant places? or how could
he be able to manage ſuch a wide and mighty
Empire?</p>
               <p>But after all, if it could be proved that St. <hi>Peter</hi>
was veſted in ſuch an Office for the Time being;
yet how does it appear that he was to have a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
in it, or that it muſt be the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
rather than any other? So that here we are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at uncertainty ſtill, and muſt build an Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
again upon meer humane Reaſoning. If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he himſelf was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo was he ſaid
to be of <hi>Antioch</hi> too. And why ſhould not his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
at <hi>Antioch</hi> claim this Privilege as much as he at
<hi>Rome?</hi> If becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was his laſt See when he
died, how doth it appear that his dying there tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
his Authority to the following Biſhop, unleſs it
appears it was his laſt Will to have it ſo, and that he
had power to make ſuch a Will? But, laſtly, doth
it appear by the Scripture at all, or certainly by
ancient Record, that ever St. <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi>
much leſs Biſhop there? And if not, how is the
Pope his Succeſſor at all? See for this a late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
printed at <hi>London,</hi> called, <hi>A Modeſt Inquiry,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97965:29"/>
Whether St.</hi> Peter <hi>were ever at</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that
here is nothing but uncertainty ſtill, to build all
their glorious Pretences upon. And conſidering all,
I cannot but conclude as our Church doth, <hi>Sermon of
Obedience, 3d. part; The uſurped Power of the Biſhop of</hi>
Rome, <hi>which he moſt wrongfully challengeth, as the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>is falſe, feigned, and forged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is it neceſſary then to the being of a true
Church, to be united to the Pope as ſupreme Paſtor
and Governour over it, as is pretended, <hi>Catech. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
par. 1. de 9. Artic. Symbol.</hi> ſl. 11. If no ſuch
Center of Unity be appointed by Chriſt, who is the
Lord and Bridegroom of the Church, then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be neceſſary to the Unity of the Faith to be
united in it, nor is that an eſſential Note of the
True Catholick Church. And ſo all thoſe great
Pretenſions of the abſolute neceſſity of Peoples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> under
the Pope as ſupreme Paſtor, upon the pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
for the guilt of Hereſy and Schiſm in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Union, are meerly falſe and vain. So that
our Church may be a Member of the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, and in Catholick Unity ſtill, though
we have ſeparated from them; if there be nothing
elſe to render our ſeparation culpable, beſides this
vain pretence.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle gives us an account of all other
Church-Officers, both ordinary and extraordinary,
that are appointed by Chriſt for the edifying of the
Church; Epheſ. 4. 11, 12. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and
ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors
and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the
Work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of

But not one word of ſuch an Office as that of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme

Which we may be ſure he would not have omitted,

by far-fetch'd Conſequences, without the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation

               <p>And the exemption of all Eccleſiaſtical Perſons

upon the ſame Papal Headſhip: For he being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

is to take cognizance of all Cauſes that have relation

And then there remains no other Power upon

their ſupreme Governor under God and Chriſt, but
ſoveraign Princes and States in their ſeveral Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
But yet this pretended Exemption of the

reſpecting all Perſons under ſuch Authorities,

Prieſt; yet nevertheleſs he was ſubject to</hi> Moſes, <hi>and
called him his Lord,</hi> Exod. 32. 21, 22. And <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſaid unto <hi>Aaron,</hi> What did this People unto thee, that
thou haſt brought ſo great a Sin upon them? (viz. <hi>of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97965:31"/>
the Golden Calf, of which they ſpake);</hi> And <hi>Aaron</hi>
ſaid, Let not the Anger of my Lord wax hot: thou
knoweſt the People, that they are ſet on miſchief. <hi>And,</hi>
Numb. 12. 11. <hi>Aaron</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> Alas, my Lord,
lay not this Sin upon us, wherein we have done fooliſhly,
and wherein we have ſinned; <hi>for he and</hi> Miriam <hi>had
murmured againſt</hi> Moſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The chief Prieſts were ſubject to the Kings of</hi>
Iſrael. <hi>For which you need but read the Books of</hi>
Kings; <hi>See one Example hereof, to which no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
can be made,</hi> 1 King. 2. 26, 27. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

<hi>ſaith Cardinal</hi> Bonaventure, the Temporal Rule
is ſubject to the Prieſthood, and Popes may now degrade
Kings, and depoſe Emperors, as this hath often come to
paſs. <hi>But wherein is the difference? and where is
the proof of this impious Aſſertion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> pleadeth his cauſe before <hi>Felix,</hi> a ſecular

of the Court, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. And ſo again before <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi>
Acts 25. But now the meaneſt Prieſt, and
the pooreſt Monk of them all, where he can, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
to appear before the ſecular Judges. And it
is a received Maxim; <hi>The Pope ought to judg all the
World, and be judged himſelf of no Body.</hi> Diſtinct. 40.

               </p>
               <p>At laſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> appeals unto <hi>Ceſar,</hi> Acts 25. 10,
11. <hi>Then ſaid</hi> Paul; <hi>I ſtand at</hi> Ceſar'<hi>s Judgment-Seat,
where I ought to be judged,</hi> being a Roman.
So he acknowledges <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s Juriſdiction: Yet <hi>to the
Jews I have done no wrong, as thou very well knoweſt,</hi>
though I were liable to their Courts. <hi>If I be an

Offender, or have committed any thing worthy of Death</hi>
by the Roman Laws, <hi>I refuſe not to die;</hi> ſo he readily
ſubmits himſelf to the Trial of their Laws, and to
the Sentence to be inflicted according to them: <hi>But
if there be none of theſe things whereof they accuſe me, no
Man may deliver me unto them,</hi> to be puniſhed by them.
<hi>I appeal unto Ceſar,</hi> the Roman Emperor, as my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

then of <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s juſt Authority? But,
ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he was conſtrained to appeal unto

               <p>THis is contrary to all thoſe Texts of Scripture
that allow a Judgment of Diſcretion to every
private Perſon in Matters of Religion, whereby
they are at liberty to judg for themſelves, and to try
and examine the Doctrines which they are taught,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97965:32"/>
whether they be true or falſe, or whether revealed
by God or no. As,</p>
               <p>1 Theſſ. 5. 21. <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which
is good.</hi> How muſt we prove all things, if we muſt
take them upon truſt, without examination from
any Perſon whatſoever?</p>
               <p>1 John 4. 1. <hi>Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but
try the Spirits whether they are of God; becauſe many
falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi> So that we
are not to give up our ſelves by an Implicit Faith,
to be led by any Perſons whatſoever that pretend
themſelves Guides, but examine their Doctrines
before we receive them. And here's no referring
of Chriſtians to an Infallible Judg, to whoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and determination all are bound to ſubmit,
which the Apoſtle ought in all reaſon to have done,
if ſuch an one had been conſtituted in the Church,
and not to leave it to every Man's private Judgment
to examine theſe things, as he doth;</p>
               <p>1 Cor. 10. 15. <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe Men, judg ye
what I ſay.</hi> The Apoſtle implies a Capacity and
Power in private Men, to judg and diſcern of the
Doctrine propoſed. And though he was guided by
an Infallible Spirit, yet he doth not expect that
Men ſhould blindly ſubmit to his Doctrine, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
them to make uſe of this Power of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Acts 17. 11. <hi>The</hi> Bereans <hi>are commended for</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Gal. 1. 8. <hi>Tho we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach
any other Goſpel unto you, than that which ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
let him be accurſed.</hi> This plainly ſuppoſeth,
that Chriſtians may and can judg in themſelves when
Doctrines are contrary to the Goſpel, and that
they ought to do it, and not blindly rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97965:32"/>
on any one, no, not an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> or <hi>Angel from

               </p>
               <p>1 Pet. 3. 15. <hi>Be ready always to give an Anſwer to

Grounds of Faith themſelves.</p>
               <p>Mat. 7. 15, 16. <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets which come
to you in Sheeps-clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
Wolves. Ye ſhall know them by their Fruits.</hi> How
ſhould they beware of them, if they cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
or judg of them and their Fruits? We have
warning given us of <hi>ſeducing Spirits</hi> that ſhall be in
the latter Days, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. And how can it be,
but Men will be in danger of giving heed to them,
if they muſt not judg for themſelves, or cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
their Doctrines?</p>
               <p>Mat. 15. 14. <hi>They be blind leaders of the Blind. And
if the Blind lead the Blind, they both fall into the Ditch.</hi>
The Leaders of the People, you ſee, were blind:
And the People that follow blind Leaders ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
with them. This is a fair warning to us, not
blindly to ſubmit to the guidance of any.</p>
               <p>So that there is no other way, but for the People
themſelves, by a diligent and ſerious peruſal and
ſtudy of the Scriptures to judg for themſelves
what the right Senſe and Interpretation of them is,
and what Doctrines are true or falſe; not refuſing
the aſſiſtance of their Spiritual Guides who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for their direction herein; yet not giving
up themſelves unreſervedly or unlimitedly to any,
as <hi>Lords of their Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there were a Judgment of Authority veſted
in any Perſon or Perſons in the Chriſtian Church,
which might impoſe upon all, and to which all
were bound in their Judgments to ſubmit, why is
not this Infallible Judg referred to by the Apoſtles?
How is a judgment of diſcerning allowed to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

private Perſon, which is inconſiſtent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with?</p>
               <p>But for Men to judg for themſelves, is indeed a
natural Right belonging to Men as Men, and as ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Creatures. And no Man can judicially embrace
the True Religion, unleſs he be permitted to judg
whether that which he embraces be the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

or no.</p>
               <p>And ſuppoſing the Scriptures plain in all Things
neceſſary to Salvation, (as hath been proved <hi>Chap.
2.)</hi> ſo that every Man, of ordinary capacity, after
competent Inſtruction in Matters of Religion, may
arrive to a ſufficient underſtanding of all thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hings
that are ſo, he may judg of them as well for himſelf
as any Man or company of Men can judg for him.
For every Man can judg of what is plain. And
therefore 'tis reaſonable that thoſe things which are
plain to every Man, ſhould be left to every Man's
judgment. And there can be no neceſſity of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Judg to guide or determine him therein.</p>
               <p>The Civil Magiſtrate, or Judg, only determines
Mens Practice and outward Actions, or diſpoſeth of
ſome of their Goods and Properties. And that
there ſhould be ſuch an one, beſides a Law or Rule,
is needful in Civil Government, for the regulating
Mens outward Actions and Properties. But he
doth not preſcribe to our inward Senſe and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which is the thing that this Infallible Judg
in Religion is pretended to do; to whoſe Judgment
Men muſt not only ſubmit their Practice, but their
Judgment. Which is quite a different thing from
the former; and therefore there is no parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
from one to the other.</p>
               <p>If they ſay, It is needful that there ſhould be
ſuch a Judg in the Church, for the determining and
ending of all Controverſies, and for the preventing
and repreſſing of Hereſies and Confuſions; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97965:33"/>
therefore there is ſuch an one. This is to argue
from our own Fancies what God ſhould do, and not
what he has done. And they might as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Being of an Univerſal Infallible Judg over
all the World in Temporal Matters, for the Peace
of the World; which yet we ſee is not appointed
as ſuch an one over the Church for the Peace of the
Church. But it is not to be expected that all Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
in Religion ſhould ceaſe in this World;
for <hi>there muſt be Hereſies,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 19. As there
were Hereſies even in the Apoſtles Times, though
they were Infallible; which is an Argument, that
Infallibility in any, if it were, is no certain means
to prevent Hereſies or Diviſions. If Men be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
and humble, and teachable, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
ſufficient means for their direction, in the
plainneſs of the Rule which he has given in all things
neceſſary, and appointing Guides for their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in doubtful things, if they will follow their
inſtruction. But if Men be governed with Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Paſſion, they would not hearken to an
Infallible Judg if there were one. And Chriſt the
Judg of all will take an account of ſuch Men in
due time, when the Great Judgment-Day ſhall
come. Then <hi>the Tares ſhall be gathered together, and
bound in bundles to be burnt,</hi> and <hi>the Whea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhall be
gathered into the Barn,</hi> Mat. 13. But this Judgment
in the mean time is to be ſuſpended till that Day
ſhall come.</p>
               <p>But that Men may judg for themſelves in ſome
things without an Infallible Judg, our Adver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aries
themſelves are fain to allow: For how elſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
they judg in the Controverſy about the Infallible
Judg himſelf, whether there be ſuch an on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and who it is? and of the Scriptures and Reaſons
that are brought to prove it? And if they may
judg of this Controverſy, and of theſe Scriptures
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97965:34"/>
and Reaſons without an Infallible Judg, then why
may they not alſo of others which are as neceſſary,
and of other Scriptures and Reaſons in other Points
which are as plain as they? And then there is no
need of an Infallible Judg at all.</p>
               <p>As for the pretended Infallibility of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the qualifying it to be ſuch a Judg:
If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be infallible, then it muſt
be ſo, <hi>either</hi> as it is a Chriſtian Church, and becauſe
it is ſo; And then all Chriſtian Churches would be
Infallible likewiſe, and not that only: <hi>Or,</hi> as it is
an Apoſtolical Church planted by the Apoſtles, if it
were ſo; and then all the Churches that were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Apoſtles, would be ſo likewiſe; and this
would give no particular priviledg to the Church of
<hi>Rome: Or,</hi> as it hath continued down a ſucceſſion of
Paſtors from the Apoſtles, by whom there is a ſafe
conveyance of Apoſtolical Doctrine and Tradition
to the preſent Age; But if this be ſo, then all the
Churches that have had ſuch a Succeſſion, will be
Infallible likewiſe as well as the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>
as the Grecian Church which hath had the like Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion;
and upon this Principle the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
may come in for a ſhare too. But indeed this
proves the Infallibility of no particular Church at
all, becauſe of the uncertainty of Tradition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
notwithſtanding ſuch Succeſſion, which may
ariſe from many Cauſes; No more then it did the
Infallibility of the Jewiſh Church, notwithſtanding
that it had a continual Succeſſion of the Prieſts and
Paſtors, as much as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any
other Church whatſoever can pretend unto. And
therefore we are not to have reſpect to any Church,
Paſtor, or Paſtors, as Infallible, nor to bind up our
Judgments to them as ſuch, upon the account of
any ſuch Succeſſion. <hi>Aaron</hi> was called to the High
Prieſthood immediatly by God himſelf; but was he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97965:34"/>
therefore infallible? or were the People bound to
follow him when he made an Idol? <hi>Exod. 32.
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> was a Prieſt by an uninterrupted Succeſſion
from <hi>Aaron;</hi> was he therefore Infallible, or to be
followed, when he overturn'd the Service of God,
and Introduc'd Idolatry into the Temple? <hi>Caiaphas</hi>
the Chief Prieſt was ſo by an uninterrupted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
for 1500 Years; ought he therefore to be
followed, when he condemened Jeſus Chriſt for a
Blaſphemer? or were the Reſolutions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
where he was Preſident, Infallible, when Jeſus
Chriſt was declared worthy of Death? The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
<hi>ſat in</hi> Moſes <hi>Chair,</hi> and the Diſciples are bid
<hi>obſerve and do, whatſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> they ſaid unto them;
ought one therefore with them to have rejected Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt? By that word therefore <hi>whatſoever,</hi> he
doth not mean every thing without limitation, but
<hi>whatſoever</hi> was agreeable to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> So
that they were to judg for themſelves, what was, or
what was not ſo agreeable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 6. It is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
that ravening Wolves ſhould ariſe from among
the Biſhops of the Churches: Doth their Succeſſion
of Orthodox Biſhops oblige the Sheep of our Lord
therefore to follow them as Infallible? The Son of
Perdition was to ſit in the Temple of God; but was
he therefore Infallible, or to be followed in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt?</p>
               <p>If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be then Infallible, and yet
not ſo upon the former Accounts, Is it then, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of its Relation to its firſt pretended Biſhop St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> who was Infallible; and by reaſon of his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, and his leaving his Priviledges to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
of that See? But though St. <hi>Peter</hi> was Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
how doth it appear that this was more than a
perſonal Priviledg, and in which therefore he was
to have no Succeſſor? As the Infallibility of the reſt
of the Apoſtles was a perſonal Priviledg, and in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97965:35"/>
which they were to have no Succeſſors. As for
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Headſhip over the Church, and that of the
Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> as his Succeſſors, it is refuted in the
foregoing Chapters.</p>
               <p>But if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be Infallible none of
theſe ways, and yet is ſo, then muſt it not be by
virtue of ſome particular Promiſe, by which Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
is annexed to the Church? But where is that
Promiſe? As for the Apoſtles calling the Church,
<hi>The Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. If it
proves any thing, it proves the Infallibility of the
Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and not that of <hi>Rome;</hi> For the
Apoſtle ſpeaks of that Church in which <hi>Timothy</hi> was
Biſhop, which was the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> But
indeed it ſignifies the Churches Duty, and not her
Performance; and may be likewiſe applied rather
to <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelf than to the Church. As for
that ſaying, <hi>Mat. 18. 17. Tell it unto the Church.</hi> If
that proves the Infallibility of a Church, it proves
the Infallibility of every Church. And ſo the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will get nothing particularly by it;
for the Direction is given to every particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in caſe of Scandal offered by him to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
And whither is ſuch an one to make his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
but to the Church of which he is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?
And indeed it is only an Inſtitution of Church-Diſcipline
in every Church, for the reducing of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
to Repentance, and not a ſetting up a Judg
of Controverſies in Matters of Faith, for all Mens
infallible Direction. As for that Promiſe, <hi>John 16.
13. When the Spirit of Truth is come, he ſhall guide
you into all Truth.</hi> It was made to all the Apoſtles,
and ſeems to be made to them only, as appears by
the Circumſtances of the Diſcourſe, <hi>Chap. 14. 25,
26, 28. Chap. 15. 26, 27. Chap.</hi> 16. 4, 6. Or if it be to
be extended to their Succeſſors, ſo far as it is ſo, it
muſt be extended to all their Succeſſors, as it was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97965:35"/>
made to all the Apoſtles. And ſo it will make all
them Infallible likewiſe, if it doth make any of
them Infallible, and not their Succeſſors in the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> only, or the Popes and Biſhops
there by a particular Priviledg.</p>
               <p>But now ſuppoſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
who is it in that Church that is Infallible? Is
it the Pope alone? or is it a General Council cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by him? or is it both together, or the Council
confirmed by a Pope, or the Council alone? In
this they do not agree among themſelves. As for
the Pope's own Infallibility, his Pretentions are
conſidered already. And if a Council be not Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
unleſs called and confirmed by the Pope, who
is yet in himſelf Fallible, how can the Calling or
Confirmation of a Fallible Pope, make a Eallible
Council Infallible? or will two Fallibles put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
make one Infallible? As for the Infallibility of
a Council alone in it ſelf, if the greateſt or major
part of Chriſtian Paſtors are not Infallible, but may
fall into the groſſeſt Errors, (as all will allow)
then how ſhall a General Council be Infallible,
which is to repreſent the whole Church, and in which
things are to be carried by the Rules of the major
part, which may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> err? Unleſs it can be proved, that
the major part of Chriſtian Paſtors, which are groſly
erring ſingly by themſelves, when they come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſhall be indued with ſo much Wit and Honeſty,
that they ſhall ſuffer themſelves to be governed and
over-ruled by the leſſer part that do not err? But
what Promiſe or Security have we for all this?
As for <hi>Mat. 18. 20. Where two or three are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in my Name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi> If
that proves an Infallibility in the Perſons ſo gathered
together, it proves the Infallibility of every Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Chriſtians, gathered in Chriſt's Name, as
well as of a General Council. And therefore it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97965:36"/>
would prove too much; whereas indeed it is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of Chriſt's gracious Preſence, and not of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Guidance. And that ſuſpended upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of being gathered in Chriſt's Name, acting
for his Glory, according to his Rule, by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and Commiſſion. As for that Place, <hi>Acts 15.
28. It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, to lay
no other Burden upon you,</hi> &amp;c. It is only a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the preſent Caſe, and not a Promiſe for the
Future. It is true, that this Council was guided by
the Holy Ghoſt, and was Infallible; but it doth not
follow that other Councils ſhall. For the Apoſtles
who were all Infallible, were the chief Actors in
this Council, and therefore its Determinations were
Infallible; which cannot be ſaid of thoſe of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Council, where there is not the ſame reaſon.</p>
               <p>And now as to the Infallibility of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
ſuppoſe it were granted, how ſhall we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know when a Council is truly General? Or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſuch an one, and Infallible when it ſits, yet
how will that ſatisfy the pretence of the neceſſity of
a living Judg in the Church at all Times, for the
ending of Controverſies, unleſs ſuch a Council did
always ſit? Which we know there did not in the
firſt Ages of the Church, when there were many
Hereſies and Differences; and we know hath not
done in ſeveral Ages, and we ſee doth not now at
this Time. If they ſay we may read the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of Councils that are in Writing, and
that will ſuffice us: So we may do the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Articles of Faith in the Scriptures;
which yet they ſay is not ſufficient, without a
living Judg to give their Senſe. And if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not ſufficient without a living Judg, then
neither are the Definitions of Councils that are in
Writing: For the Definitions of Councils left us in
their Books, are as much a dead Writing as the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97965:36"/>
Scriptures, and can as little help themſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>; and
we ſee there is as much difference about the Senſe of
them. So that if there muſt be a living Judg, and
a General Council muſt be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then there muſt be a
Council ſtill ſitting. For if the written Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of a former Council will ſerve the turn,
then they muſt give up the Controverſy of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of a living Judg. And if it can be proved,
that the Scriptures are a ſufficient Rule, without
ſuch Determinations, and ſufficiently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in all
things neceſſary, then though it be but a dead Rule,
yet it will do the deed as well as the dead Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of a dead Councill: And ſo all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
will run into that abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the ſufficiency and

in the beginning) and to his Controverſy about the
Infallibility of a General Council for a living and
viſible Judg, will be wholly ſuperſeded and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>Yet after all, if all theſe Difficulties could be
got over, about an Infallible Pope or Council, yet
that would not ſignify very much to the common
People, unleſs their particular Biſhops and Curats
may be ſuppoſed to be Infallible likewiſe; to give
them an Infallible account of an Infallible Pope or
Councils Definitions; or unleſs every particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
may go himſelf to the Pope or Council for rc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
in all Caſes. Which they know cannot be
done; for the common People cannot read all their
Determinations in Print or Writing; or if they
could, would as little underſtand them as they do
the Scriptures, and ſo muſt need a living Infallible
Judg nearer at hand to give them Infallible directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or elſe they may ſtill be deceived for want
of one, if the want of one muſt needs make
them liable to deceit; ſo that they muſt have Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Curats likewiſe to preſerve them from danger
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97965:37"/>
of being deceived. If they ſay the Curats may
inform them of the true meaning of the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Councils and Popes, and that they may be
ſufficiently certain of this, without their being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
(which is the only thing that can be ſaid)
then it ſeems there may be Certainty without Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.
And then why may not the Proteſtant
Biſhops and Miniſters, though they were not Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
as certainly inform the People of the true
meaning of the Scriptures? So that if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be a ſure and plain Rule of Faith, ſo that it
may be underſtood without the Infallibility of thoſe
that read it, then the Proteſtant People, who have
not Infallible Teachers, may yet have as much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Faith as the common People of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can have for their Lives.</p>

               <p>It is plain from all this Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle,
that all Publick Service in the Church ſhould be
done to the Edification of the Church. But if the
People do not underſtand what is ſaid, they cannot
be edified by it, or give their aſſent to it. And it
is plain, if it be performed in a Tongue which
they know not, they cannot underſtand the Matter
of the Service. And conſequently 'tis a vain and
unprofitable Act, becauſe in this way the People are
not edified. For it is certain, that in this way the
Mind is not informed, nor the Affections rationally
excited; and therefore it is but a blind irrational
Devotion that is then offered up to God by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and thereby his Name is profaned rather, and
taken in vain, than honoured.</p>
               <p>How ſhould the People ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> when they ſay

more advance that, than Unity of Language; for all

And, <hi>John 16. 24. That your Joy may be full.</hi> This
is the only direction which our Saviour gave his

and to no other way of addreſs is the Promiſe of
Audience made. So that for any to addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

               <p>Epheſ. 2. 18. <hi>For through him we both have acceſs by

And, Heb. 10. 19. <hi>Having therefore boldneſs to enter

Where the Interceſſion of our Saviour is made an
act or part of his unchangeable Prieſthood, not to
be imparted to any other. And by this Interceſſion
of his we obtain Eternal Salvation: So that there
can be no need of any others Interceſſion. The
Mediatory Interceſſion of Saints then is an invaſion
of Chriſt's Prieſtly Office; and doth alſo plainly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97965:41"/>
imply the inſufficiency of our Saviour's Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

               <p>Heb. 12. 24. <hi>We are come to Jeſus, the Mediator of
the New Teſtament, and to the Blood of Sprinkling, that
ſpeaketh better things than that of</hi> Abel. Note, that
Jeſus Chriſt is the Mediator in virtue of his Blood.
Which doth not cry for Vengeance againſt his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
as <hi>Abel</hi>'s did; but by which he intercedes
and calls for Mercy, Grace and Peace for the greateſt
Sinners, who have their Hearts touched with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
and therefore none ſhould be diſcouraged
from approaching this Mediator.</p>
               <p>1 John 2. 1, 2. <hi>I write theſe things unto you that ye
ſin not; but if any Man ſinneth, we have an Advocate
with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous: For he is
the Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but
alſo for the Sins of whole World.</hi> Where Chriſt is
deſcribed as the Advocate, the only Advocate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for us in the Court of Heaven, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
General of all Chriſtians. And the Holy
Spirit joins Interceſſion and Propitiation together,
and founds the former upon the latter, to teach us,
that whoſoever is not a Mediator of Redemption
and Propitiation, cannot be an Advocate or Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of Interceſſion. It is his Mouth alone then by
which we ſpeak to the Father, and that in the
virtue of the Propitiation which he hath made.</p>
               <p>So again, <hi>Rom. 8. 34. It is Chriſt that died, yea
rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right Hand
of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
of Chriſt is founded upon his Death. It
belongs to none other but him who ſhed his Blood
upon the Croſs, to appear for us within the Heavenly
Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>It is his part only to preſent the Prayers of the
Church of God, who can cover their Defects, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97965:41"/>
render them acceptable to God; which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſhadowed in the Perſon of the High-Prieſt,
who was to carry upon his Miter a Plate of pure
Gold, in which was engraven <hi>Holineſs to the Lord.</hi>
Exod. 28. 37, 38. <hi>Thou ſhalt put it on a blue Lace, that
it may be upon the Mitre; upon the fore-front of the Mitre
it ſhall be. And it ſhall be upon</hi> Aaron'<hi>s Forehead, that</hi>
Aaron <hi>may bear the Iniquity of the Holy Things, which the
Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall hallow in all their Holy Gifts:
and it ſhall be always upon his Forehead, that they may
be accepted before the Lord.</hi> This is fulfilled in Chriſt
alone, who is the Subſtance and the Truth of all
the ancient Figures.</p>
               <p>All the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> and all other Prayers,
both in the Old and New Teſtament, are directed
to God alone, and not one Supplication made, or
one Hymn beſtowed upon any Tutelar or Patron,
Saint or Angel, throughout all the Scripture. Which
is very ſtrange among ſo many devout Men, and
their Devotions that are mentioned, if the thing
had been allowable. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 9. Elijah <hi>ſaid to</hi>
Eliſha, <hi>Ask what I ſhall do for thee, before I be taken

nor is there any inſtance of any Prayer made to

he was in Heaven: Nor yet to any Angel, to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel,</hi>

the Children of God, to pray to God alone, and

               <p>It is a vaſt knowledg, that the Saints to whom
we pray muſt be ſuppoſed to have. For they muſt
be ſuppoſed to know where their Petitioners are,
what they want, and how truly and rightly they
pray, and this perhaps of Perſons in a thouſand pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or more, if they ſhould pray all to the ſame
Saint at the ſame time. As for inſtance, to St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
or St. <hi>Peter,</hi> what if all the People in the World
ſhould pray to them at the ſame time, as 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and may be done upon Popiſh Principles;
then St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt know the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all the Men in the World at the ſame time:
or to inſtance in St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> the Sea-man's Saint,
in the words of an excellent Author. He muſt be
ſuppoſed to hearken, when he is in Heaven ſuppoſe,
to what one Sea-man prays in a Shipwrack at the
<hi>Straits;</hi> to what another wiſhes for, when he is
becalm'd in the <hi>South-Sea;</hi> to the Cries of another,
who ſees an Hurricane by the <hi>Barbadots;</hi> to the
private deſires of another, who fiſhes for Pearls in
the <hi>Guiny</hi>-Shore, or Herrings by our <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Coaſt,
or for Whales hard by <hi>Greenland,</hi> or for Trouts in

thouſands of Paſſengers who cry to him, being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to periſh, in as many places all at once; and
withal in theſe numberleſs Places and Exigencies,
what they both think and deſerve, in order to the
returning of ſuitable Reliefs and Helps. Is not this a
vaſt Knowledg for a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re Creature to have? But we
are well aſſured, both by Scripture and the nature
of the thing, that 'tis vaſtly above them, and is
what they have not. And therefore to aſcribe it to
them, what is it but Idolatry?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:97965:43"/>
The Saints in Heaven do not hear our Prayers.
To Hear Prayers, is made the peculiar Attribute of
God in Scripture. Pſal. 65. 2. <hi>Oh thou that heareſt
Prayer, unto thee ſhall all Fleſh come.</hi> For, <hi>Pſal. 145.
18. The Lord is nigh unto them that call upon him, to
all that call upon him in Truth.</hi> But can any one ſay
ſo of the Saints? Their Eſſence is not infinite, to
be in all Places of the World near unto all thoſe
that cry unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Saints departed do not know our particular
Neceſſities. Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 5, 6. For the Dead know not
any thing; alſo their love, and their hatred, and their envy
is now periſh'd. <hi>Job</hi> 14. 21. His Sons come to honour,
and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he
perceiveth it not of them. <hi>He doth not know the
Condition or Neceſſities of his neareſt Relations.
Iſa.</hi> 63. 16. Thou art our Father, though <hi>Abraham</hi> be
ignorant of us, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> acknowledgeth us not. <hi>Yet</hi>
Abraham <hi>was now in Heaven, into whoſe Boſom the
Faithful paſs,</hi> Luke 16. 22. <hi>And God tells</hi> Joſiah,
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 20. I will gather thee unto thy Fathers,
and thine Eyes ſhall not ſee all the Evil which I will
bring upon this place. <hi>He was not ſenſible, after his
departure, of the publick Miſeries, much leſs the
particular Neceſſities of his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Saints departed know our Neceſſities, how
do they know them? They are not Omnipreſent,
are they? Or do they ſee all in the Face of God?
But 'tis certain the Angels do not; for they know
not the Day of Judgment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 32. Beſides,
if they ſee all things in the Face of God, this is to
make them Omniſcient, as God is, and ſo to make
them Gods: or do they only ſee ſome things? If
they only ſee ſome things, how ſhall we be aſſured,
that they ſee either us praying, or what we want?
For who can tell but theſe may be ſome of thoſe
Things which they do not ſee? Or do they only
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97965:43"/>
know all things that occur by the information of
Miniſtring-Angels? But how are we ſure that the
Angels themſelves know all our Affairs, tho they
may know ſome, wherein their own Comfort and
Happineſs is likewiſe concern'd? as the Converſion
of a Sinner, which brings Joy in Heaven, <hi>Luke 15.
7.</hi> This one thing we are ſure they know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our Saviour hath told us ſo; but we are ſure
of no more.</p>
               <p>But neither Saints nor Angels know our Hearts or
ſecret Thoughts, and therefore it is certain they do
not know what the inward Diſpoſition is of him that
prays, whether there be that Piety, Charity, Faith,
good Intention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as there ought to be, to bring
his Performance within the promiſe of Audience.
And for want of this Knowledg, they do not know
whether his Prayers ought to be regarded or no,
though they know his Neceſſities. All this is the
Prerogative of God alone to know the Hearts of
Men; 1 King. 8. 39. <hi>Hear thou and do, and give to
every Man according to his ways, whoſe Heart thou
knoweſt. For thou, even thou only knoweſt the Hearts of
all the Children of Men.</hi> And upon this conſideration
he directs his Prayer to him; and according to this
there is none but he alone that knows what Prayer
of any Man is from the Heart. Rev. 2. 23. <hi>All the
Churches ſhall know, that I am he which ſearcheth the
Reins and Hearts.</hi> If either Saints or Angels then
know our Hearts, or all our Wants; what other
way is there, but by Revelation from God? But
we have no aſſurance that there is ſuch Revelation.
And therefore to pray to them in confidence of
that which we do not know, can be nothing leſs
than a preſumptuous vanity. And it ſeems God
muſt firſt tell them all we want, before they can
repreſent the Matter to him; and alſo muſt inform
them whether our Prayers be fit to be regarded or no,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97965:44"/>
before they can reaſonably undertake our Cauſe.
For Example, whenſoever a Scholar prays to St.
<hi>Catherine,</hi> or a Sea-man to St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> or a Painter
to St. <hi>Luke,</hi> nothing can be done till God calls to
theſe Saints, and tells them; <hi>Hear you</hi> Catherine,
Nicholas, <hi>and you</hi> Luke, <hi>ſuch and ſuch an one prays
to you, that you would pray to me, and perſuade me to
grant them ſuch and ſuch things; and to diſpoſe you to
be the more earneſt with me, I muſt tell you, the poor
Sea-man is in great danger, and is at this very nick of
time like to miſcarry,</hi> &amp;c. Thus God muſt reveal to
his Saints what is to be done, before they can pray
to him; the King muſt be, as it were, a Maſter of
Requeſts to his Courtiers. Which is a meer round-about
and uſeleſs courſe; but the proper and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
way is to go to God himſelf immediately, who
certainly knows all, and who is of himſelf ready
to hear us. John 16. 26, 27. <hi>In that Day ye ſhall
ask in my Name; and I ſay not unto you, that I will pray
the Father for you; for the Father himſelf loveth you,
becauſe ye have loved me.</hi> To ſet up other Mediators
which he hath not appointed, we may fear will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate
both him and the Father from ſuch Men.</p>
               <p>The Holy Angels and Saints departed this Life,
are in an inviſible State, and for what we know to
the contrary are very far remote and diſtant from
us, and ſo are out of the Lines of Civil Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
either by Word, Letter, or Meſſage; and
there being no manner of certainty of their being
acquainted with all our Wants, or that they know
our Hearts, and hear our Prayers; to pray to them
with confidence of their hearing us, and to truſt in
their Aid and Help, is to perform an Act of Honour
and Worſhip to them above what is due to their
Degrée, and which can be paid only to God with
any rational Aſſurance. And it is not the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
that they hear us (if they hear us not)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97965:44"/>
and practiſing accordingly upon this Preſumption,
will excuſe this Act from Idolatry, no more than
the covetous Man's inordinate preſumption of the
value and helpfulneſs of his Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hes, above what is
really in them, will excuſe his delight and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and truſt in them, from being Idolatry,
which yet the Scripture condemns for ſuch. And
tho the Saints and Angels in this caſe are not believed
or owned for Gods, or to have the Supreme Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Deity; yet if there be a degree of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Worſhip given to them, which is above
them, and doth not belong to them, but to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God, though they are not believed to be the
ſupreme God, this degree of Honour and Worſhip
that is given to them, will be Idolatry. For any
degree of Honour and Worſhip given to a Creature,
which doth not belong to them but to God, is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
And unleſs they could certainly ſhow how
the Saints may know our Wants and Hearts, and
hear our Prayers; otherwiſe to pray to them, and
truſt in them, is in the conſtruction of the Fact to
ſuppoſe them Omnipreſent and Omniſcient; and
theſe are owned to be the Perfections of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God alone; and therefore in the conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Fact, this is to ſuppoſe them to have
the ſupreme Perfections of the Deity; and an Act
of Honour to them upon ſuch a Suppoſition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
though not intended, what is it but that they
can very hardly be excus'd from Idolatry?</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe again, they had ſuch a knowledg as
is pretended, to reach to all our Wants, and Hearts,
howſoever they come by it; if this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ppoſition
were real, as it is not, yet this does not neceſſarily
infer, that we ſhould pray to them for their Help
and Aid; nor ought we therefore to do it, unleſs
we are authoriſed to do it, by the Divine Command
or Law. And if we are forbid to do it by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

Law, and this Act of Prayer be by the Divine
Law appropriated to God, (as it is before proved
to be) then to perform this Act to them, is to
perform that to them which is due only to God,
and ſo is Idolatry ſtill in the conſtruction of the
Law, notwithſtanding the knowledg ſuppoſed in
them.</p>
               <p>But obſerve, moreover, Our Adverſaries do not
barely ask the Prayers of the Saints, and truſt in
their hearing and helping them, but they pray with
the ſame ſolemnity of Devotion as they do to God
and Chriſt; In the ſame Places and Times of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
in the Churches and Divine Offices, with the
ſame proſtration of Body, and uncovering the
Head; and what is all this but to equal them with
God Almighty in all the Circumſtances of Worſhip,
and outward Adoration; ſo that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in their outward carriage, between what they
perform to God, and what they perform to them?
And is not this to give them that Worſhip which is
only due to God? or is there no outward Adoration
appropriated to God at all? or if there be, with
what Circumſtances is it inveſted, or how is it to
be known or differenced from what they perform
to the Saints departed? or doth the difference lie
only in the inward intention of the Mind, and not
in any outward Circumſtance at all? So it ſeems
they think, there being no outward Circumſtances
at all, by which their outward Adoration of God
and the Saints are diſtinguiſh'd one from the other:
but they think, as long as they make a Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> owning the Supreme God alone for
God, and worſhip him accordingly; though they
render the Saints the ſame outward Adoration in
all the Circumſtances of it, yet that cannot
be ſuppoſed to invade his Worſhip. But we
find in Scripture, that there is a certain outward
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97965:46"/>
Adoration, which there are certain outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
to determine, appropriated to God;
and the giving of this with any ſuch Circumſtances,
as in the conſtruction of the Fact do determine it
only to God, to any Creature, is condemned,
whatſoever the inward Intention of the mind may
be of reſerving to the Supreme God his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.
And what ſhall we think then of the
outward Adoration of the Saints, performed in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which in all the Circumſtances of
it is the ſame with what is performed to God? If
this be not Idolatry, then there is no merely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Idolatry at all. And the three Children might
have given an outward Adoration to <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s
graven Image, ſo as they had but reſerved or
directed their inward Intention aright.</p>
               <p>See what our Saviour ſaith to the Devil, <hi>Luke 4.
8. Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only
ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Where it was only outward Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or <hi>bowing down</hi> to him, that the Devil did
deſire, and not ſo as that he himſelf ſhould be
owned for the Supreme God, or the Worſhip given
to him with any ſuch intention: For he did not
pretend in this Requeſt to be the Supreme God, or
to challenge Worſhip as ſuch; for he in the ſame
breath pretends that he had the diſpoſal of all the
Kingdoms of the World, not in his own right, but
becauſe <hi>it was delivered to him,</hi> which implies an
owning of a Supreme God above him. But yet
our Saviour refuſes to render him ſuch Adoration,
or to bow down to him, for this general Reaſon
only, that <hi>thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God alone,</hi>
without conſidering the diſtinction of ſupreme or
inferior Worſhip; or that the outward Adoration
was to be determined by the inward Intention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
which the Devil would have been content to
have left to him. Nor doth he aſſign that as a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97965:47"/>
Reaſon of his refuſal, that the Devil was a wicked
Spirit, but gives a Reaſon which would have been
equally againſt it, if he had been a good One.
And the ſame Reaſon as much reaches us as it
did him.</p>
               <p>Col. 2. 14. <hi>Let no Man beguile you of your Reward
in a voluntary humility, and worſhipping of Angels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
into thoſe things which he hath not ſeen, vainly
puft up by his fleſhly mind.</hi> Where the Humility
cenſured by the Apoſtle, which is the ground of
this Worſhip of Angels, is not that which implies a
ſubmiſſion to them themſelves as Supreme Gods,
but that which implies a reſpect to the only Supreme
God, upon the ſame ground as what is now pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
in the Church of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> That becauſe the
Majeſty of God is ſo high and inacceſſible as he is, it
becomes us therefore to ſue to him by the Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and mediation of Angels, as his ſpecial Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
or to trouble thoſe with our Devotions, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than him ſo much: Which is a ſpecious ſort of
Humility, but is here notwithſtanding condemned.
And the practice of praying to Saints in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> being founded upon the ſame Reaſon, is
alſo liable to the ſame Apoſtolical Cenſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. &amp; 22. 8, 9. When St. <hi>John fell at

do it not;</hi> for this reaſon, <hi>I am of thy Fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and of thy Brethren, that have the Teſtimony of

in his Spirit.</p>
               <p>As for what concerns the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
the ſame Reaſons make it alike unlawful and
idolatrous to pray to her, as to pray to the other
Saints. Neither is there any thing of Prerogative
left to her in this reſpect in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 46. Mary <hi>ſaid, My Soul doth magnify the

               <p>As for what is pretended, that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between begging the Prayers of our Brethren
upon Earth, and the Popiſh praying to Saints in
Heaven to pray for us. There is a vaſt difference;
our Brethren upon Earth are within the compaſs of
civil Converſation, and we can certainly acquaint
them with all our Wants. It is quite otherwiſe
with the Saints in Heaven. We are required to
ask the Prayers of our Brethren upon Earth; but
we are required to pray to God only in Heaven.
Our Brethren upon Earth pray for us, as Joint-Petitioners
or Fellow-Supplicants, through the
Merits of our common Redeemer Chriſt Jeſus:
Whereas they pray to the Saints in Heaven as Joint-Mediators
of Interceſſion with our Bleſſed Saviour.
Here we ask or deſire the Prayers of our Brethren;
but they pray to the Saints in Heaven with the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
of Devotion as they do to God himſelf.
But ſhould we kneel down in a ſolemn manner, in
the ſame place and manner as we do to God and
Chriſt, and pray to a Friend in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> to
hear or help us, then we ſhould do juſt as the Papiſts
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97965:48"/>
do to the Saints in Heaven. But would not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
themſelves cenſure that for Idolatry, or down-right
Madneſs? And whatſoever words do they
think then their own Practice deſerves? Let them
give their own Practice what Name they pleaſe,
we will not wrangle with them about a Name.</p>

is it then to except the Images of the Trinity, and
our Saviour and the Saints out of it, contrary to a
plain and general Law?</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this plain prohibition, it is
pretended, that God himſelf appointed the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims
as the Symbols of his Preſence, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations,
and that the Jews were to direct their
Worſhip to them as the Objects of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.
17, 22. Whereas the <hi>Cherubims</hi> were not in the
place of Worſhip, for that was the Temple it ſelf,
repreſenting the Church upon Earth. But the
<hi>Cherubims</hi> were in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> which was the
Figure of Heaven, out of the Peoples ſight, where
they were never to come; but the High Prieſt only
once a Year, as a Type of Chriſt entring into
Heaven. It was the Mercy-Seat, and not the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,</hi>
that was the Symbolical Preſence of God;
and the <hi>Cherubims</hi> were to repreſent the Angels that
encompaſs his Throne. And it was neither the
<hi>Cherubims</hi> or Mercy-Seat that was to be worſhipp'd
or prayed to, or any Adoration to be made to them,
but only to God who made there his peculiar Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;

But it can never be ſhown, that God any where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

Images of the True God, who ſpake from Mount
<hi>Horeb;</hi> and the Prohibition of them is made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>For it is in the Nature of the thing tending to

5But ſuch groſs Notions theſe Images are too apt to
incline unto; As <hi>Rom. 1. 22, 23. Profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be wiſe, they became fools, and changed the
Glory of the Incorruptible God, into an Image made like
to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four-footed Beaſts,
and creeping Things.</hi> Where not only the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
but the very making of any Images of God
by the Heathen, is cenſured by the Apoſtle, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a debaſing of his Nature. For, <hi>Iſa. 40. 18.
To whom will ye liken God? or what likeneſs will ye
compare unto him?</hi> It is not a thing poſſible to be
done. And how will the Images among the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts
eſcape this Cenſure, which have as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of God, as any that the Apoſtle and
Prophet do condemn? Sometimes they paint one
Body with three Heads, ſometimes one Head with
three Faces; ſometimes one Body with two Heads,
and a Pigeon in the midſt; ſometimes and old Man
holding a Crucifix in his Hands, and a Pigeon upon
his Shoulder. What is this but a mere mocking of
God and the Holy Trinity, and a down-right deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:97965:50"/>
Theſe Images of God and the Holy Trinity, as
alſo ſome others of Chriſt, as a Child in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Arms, are ſo far from being any way beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
to give the Vulgar any Inſtruction, that they tend
to pervert and overthrow all honourable Notions
of God and our bleſſed Saviour. They tend to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Men, as <hi>Jer. 10. 8. Altogether brutiſh and fooliſh:
for the Stock is a Doctrine of Vanities.</hi> For, <hi>ver. 14, 15.
Every Man is brutiſh in his Knowledg; every Founder is
confounded in his graven Image: For his molten Image is
falſhood, there is no breath in them, they are Vanity and
the work of Errors.</hi> Doth not this agree to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Images as well as to any other? or what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is there? Pſal. 115. 4, 5. <hi>Their Idols are Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and Gold, the work of Mens hands. They have
Mouths, but they ſpeak not; Eyes they have, but they
ſee not; they have Ears, but they hear not; Noſes have
they, but they ſmell not; they have Hands, but they han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
not; Feet have they, but they walk not; neither
ſpeak they through their Throat.</hi> This is juſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Images of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
neither is there any thing here that does not exactly
agree to them. And how unlikely is all this to give
Men much Inſtruction? Habak. 2. 18. <hi>What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth
the graven Image, that the Maker thereof hath
graven it? The molten Image, and a teacher of Lies?</hi>
What Inſtruction or Teaching can it give, to ſet
out God and the Holy Trinity by the Reſemblances
before-mentioned? or to dreſs out God like a Pope,
with a Miter and a Triple Crown? which yet they
often do, and make Ale-houſe Signs with ſuch Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.
Is not this to expoſe the Divine Nature
to contempt and ſcorn, inſtead of giving any good
Inſtruction?</p>
               <p>But as the making of the Images of God is cried
down and condemned in the Scripture, ſo of any
other likewiſe in order to their being worſhipp'd
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97965:50"/>
or bowed down to; and the bowing down to any
Image is condemned, which equally reſpects Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Images as any others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the Law above-mentioned,</hi> Exod. 24. <hi>add
Levit.</hi> 26. 1. Ye ſhall make no Idols nor graven Images,
neither rear you up a ſtanding Image, neither ſhall you
ſet up any Image of Stone in your Land to bow down to
it; for I am the Lord your God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 15. Curſed be the Man that maketh any
graven or molten Image, an abomination to the Lord, the
Work of the hands of the Crafts-man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 8, 9. The Jews are ſeverely reproved for
this; <hi>Their Land is full of Idols; they worſhip the
Work of their own Hands, that which their own Fingers
have made: And the mean Man boweth down, and the
great Man humbleth himſelf, therefore forgive them not.</hi>
It is not the worſhipping of Images, as they are
the Images of falſe Gods, that the Prophet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
them for; but in general of all Images:
And he cenſures them for juſt ſuch Worſhip as is
practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for humbling
themſelves and bowing down to them. This is
that they do in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they fall down
before their Images, and pray before them; and
moreover they kiſs them, they offer Incenſe to
them, they light Candles to them, they dreſs them
and adorn them, they crown them with Flowers,
they carry them upon their Shoulders, they go in
Pilgrimages to them; in a word, they do every
thing and more, they render them the ſame Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and the very ſame outward expreſſions of
Honours, which the Jews or Pagans did to their
Images.</p>

alike equally to be condemned?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For note, that it is not to be imagined, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Jews or Heathen were ſo ſtupid, as to
worſhip the Images before-mentioned, as Gods

thought ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> God, and whom by conſecration
they thought to be in them, or preſent with them,
and ſo worſhipp'd them in relation to him. For
the Apoſtle ſays of the Heathens, <hi>Rom. 1. 25. That
they changed the Truth of God</hi> (whom they knew,
<hi>verſ. 21.) into a Lie, and worſhipped and ſerved the
Creature more than the Creator;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>beſides</hi> the
Creator, <hi>who is bleſſed for ever.</hi> Which implies that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97965:51"/>
they worſhipped the Creator, but making theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
of him, they worſhipp'd them beſides him,
or with him: Which ſhows that Idolatry is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with the Worſhip of one Supreme God. And
that worſhipping the Images of this one Supreme
God, together with him, was the Sin of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
And therefore though the Papiſts likewiſe
own and worſhip one Supreme God the Creator,
yet by worſhipping his Images in relation to him,
or with him, they may be guilty of Idolatry. As
the Men of <hi>Epheſus</hi> worſhipp'd <hi>the Image which came
down from</hi> Jupiter, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 35. So that they did
not take the Image for <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf; but as the
Image of him whom they thought the Supreme
God, and as the Symbol of his Preſence, and ſo
they accordingly worſhipp'd it? do not the Papiſts
the ſame?</p>
               <p>And it is evident, that the Jews in worſhipping
the molten Calf, intended their Worſhip to it, not
as being either a God really it ſelf, nor yet as an
Image of an Egyptian or falſe God, but as an Image
of <hi>Jehova</hi> the True God, and as the Symbol of his
Preſence with them, <hi>Moſes</hi> being, as they thought,
quite gone from them; and there being a Promiſe
made juſt before his departure, to ſend an Angel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them: For they intended to worſhip that God
in it, that <hi>brought them out of Egypt.</hi> And could
they think that this Image did it before it was made?
or that an Egyptian God would work ſuch a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
for them? Beſides, <hi>Aaron</hi> proclaimed a
<hi>Feaſt to Jehova</hi> upon the Day of its Conſecration,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 32. And their Sacrifices to it were Sheep
and Oxen, which was an abomination to the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
to offer. Neither is this any where laid to
their Charge, that they fell to the Idolatry of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
falſe Gods, as afterwards to <hi>Baal Peer, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Such alſo was the Worſhip given to the two
Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> ſet up by <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> It was
given to them as the Symbols of the true God.
<hi>Jeroboam</hi> not intending thereby to forſake him, but
only to take Men off from going to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him, which was contrary to his Intereſt. He
gives this as the only Reaſon, 1 <hi>Kings 12. 27. If
this People go up to do Sacrifice in the Houſe of the Lord
at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>then ſhall the Heart of this People turn
again unto their Lord, even unto</hi> Rehoboam <hi>King of</hi>
Judah, <hi>and they ſhall kill me. Whereupon the King
took Counſel, and made two Calves of Gold, and ſaid
unto them, It is too much for you to go up to</hi> Jeruſalem:
<hi>Behold thy Gods, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which brought thee out of
the Land of</hi> Egypt; uſing the ſame words as <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
did. And the People were eaſily perſwaded,
for eaſe-ſake, generally to comply with this;
which it cannot be imagined they ſhould ſo ſoon
have done, if thereby had been deſigned an utter
rejection of the True God. Which was afterwards
done by <hi>Ahab,</hi> ſetting up the Worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> which
is therefore reckoned as a greater Sin than this of
<hi>Jeroboam, 1 Kings 16. 31. It came to paſs as if it had
been a light thing for him to walk in the Sins of</hi> Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam
<hi>the Son of</hi> Nebat, <hi>that he went and ſerved</hi> Baal,
<hi>and worſhipped him.</hi> And <hi>Jehu</hi> is commended for
<hi>deſtroying</hi> Baal <hi>out of</hi> Iſrael, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 28. In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which he boaſts of his <hi>Zeal for the Lord,</hi> verſ.
16. And he is rewarded for it, <hi>ver. 28. Howbeit from
the Sins of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>the Son of</hi> Nebat, <hi>who made</hi>
Iſrael <hi>to ſin,</hi> Jehu <hi>departed not from after them,</hi> viz.
<hi>the golden Calves that were in</hi> Bethel, <hi>and that were in</hi>
Dan. Which plainly ſignifies that the Calves at
<hi>Bethel</hi> and at <hi>Dan</hi> were worſhipped as Symbols and
Images of <hi>Jehovah</hi> the true God; and therefore
this is diſtinguiſh'd from the Idolatry of <hi>Ahab</hi> in
worſhipping <hi>Baal,</hi> and look'd upon as a leſſer Sin,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97965:52"/>
which otherwiſe it would not have been. And the
Idolatrous Worſhip of the Sun and falſe Gods, is
noted as a Conſequent of the Idolatry of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
the True God by Images, or Images as his
Symbols, through the juſt Judgment of God upon
Mens blindneſs, in doing as they do. <hi>Acts 7. 41,
43. Deut.</hi> 4. 25, 26, 27, 28. And yet <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is
highly condemned for Idolatry, in the Worſhip of
the Calves, though the true God was worſhipped
in them; and he is ſaid notwithſtanding to have
<hi>gone and made other Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and molten Images, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
me</hi> (ſays God) <hi>to anger, and haſt caſt me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
thy back,</hi> 1 Kings 14. 9. It being ſo by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
becauſe he worſhipped the Images with
God, and did not worſhip God in his own way.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of <hi>Micah,</hi> who no doubt
intended no more, but to worſhip the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
in his molten Image, and that only as the Symbol
of his Preſence, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. And thoſe that went a
whoring after <hi>Gideon</hi>'s <hi>Ephod,</hi> directed their Worſhip
through that to God himſelf, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 27. And thoſe
that worſhipp'd the Brazen Serpent, intended their
Worſhip to that but in a ſecondary manner, as to
an holy Relique, which God formerly made uſe for
the Healing of the People; and they thought no
doubt to honour God in honouring of that, 2 <hi>King.</hi>
18. 4. yet all theſe are condemned for Idolaters.
And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not any one thing
more to ſay for her ſelf in her worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
than theſe might have ſaid for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Let Mens Intentions be never ſo good (as they
think) to honour God in ſuch and ſuch a way;
If Men do ſuch Actions as the Law forbids, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
to be Idolatry; it is not Mens Intentions,
whatſoever they may pretend, can excuſe them
from being idolatrous. For it is the Law that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
our Actions; and our Intentions cannot
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97965:53"/>
alter the nature of an Action, that is determined
by the Law.</p>
               <p>If our Adverſaries give Honour and Worſhip to
the Images, which muſt terminate in God and
Chriſt, (as they pretend) then it muſt be Divine
Worſhip which they give to the Images, becauſe it
is certainly Divine Worſhip which is given to God
and Chriſt; for if it paſs from the Image to the
Perſon, then it is the ſame Worſhip which is given
to both, though it terminates not in the Image but
the Perſon.</p>
               <p>And as for the Images of Saints; If the ſame
Worſhip be given to the Images as to the Perſons,
(as it muſt be likewiſe if it paſs by them to the
Perſons) then if the Worſhip which they give
the Saints themſelves, be due only to God, and ſo
is idolatrous, (as is proved in Chap. foregoing)

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97965:53"/>
becauſe it was abuſed to Idolatry, and the Children

               <p>If there ſhould be any Miracles or Cures wrought
by the means of any Reliques, it is by the Power of
God alone that it is done, who is therefore to have
all the Glory, and not either the Saint or his Reliques
to ſhare in it; which the Saints have always refuſed
and referr'd all to God, as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 3. 12. and
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 14. 14. And though we find in
Scripture therefore many Miracles wrought by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s

St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Shadow, and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
yet we never read that any of theſe were
adored or worſhipped; or if they had, it had been
Idolatry, it being a referring the Virtue and Honour
to Creatures above what was in them, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to God alone, who wrought all by them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THis is to make a Vow of that which God often
inflicts as a Curſe upon Men, and therefore
ſhould be reputed a thing which Men ſhould not
chuſe, but avoid. Pſal.</hi> 109. 10. David, <hi>ſpeaking of
the Wicked, ſaith,</hi> Let his Children be continually Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds,
and beg; let them ſeek their Bread alſo out
of deſolate Places, as thoſe that are caſt out of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.
<hi>The Royal Prophet puts beggary among the
Curſes of God; and what Reaſon hath any one then
voluntarily to take it up as a State of Perfection?
So,</hi> Deut. 28. 48. Becauſe thou ſervedst not the Lord
thy God with joyfulneſs and gladneſs of Heart, for the
abundance of all things; therefore ſhalt thou ſerve thine
Enemies in hunger, and in thirſt, and in nakedneſs, and in
want of all things.</p>
               <p>Poverty hath many Inconveniences and Troubles
uſually attending upon it, and is that which often
expoſeth Men to great Temptations and Snares,
which no Man can be ſure he ſhall be always able
to bear or overcome; whatever his preſent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and diſpoſition of Mind may be, if he be caſt
into this Eſtate by the Providence of God, he may
believingly pray and hope for the Divine Aſſiſtance;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97965:55"/>
but voluntarily to vow it, and expoſe himſelf to
it, is to put himſelf upon that which may be an
occaſion of much Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which no Man ſhould do. It
is that which wiſe and good Men have prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt;
<hi>

                     </gap>rov. 30. 8. Give me neither Poverty nor
Riches, but feed me with Food convenient for me.</hi> Should
any one make that a Vow to God, which the wiſe
Man prays againſt?</p>
               <p>To have a competent proviſion of the good
things of this Life, according to the condition of
ones place, is a Bleſſing and Comfort, and may be
of great uſe to the ends of Piety and Charity, for
the more chearful ſerving God, and the relief of
our neceſſitous Brethren. Voluntarily to caſt away
this, is to be ungrateful to the Bounty of God,
who <hi>giveth us richly all things to enjoy,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17.
And: it is to be cruel to ones ſelf, not to uſe the
good things which God hath given us of his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
as a Bleſſing. For ſo it is accounted, <hi>Pſal.
128. 1, 2. Bleſſed is every one that feareth the Lord:
For thou ſhalt eat the Labour of thy Hands; happy ſhalt
thou be, and it ſhall be well with thee.</hi> And it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that Duty which we owe to our Neighbour,
by which we are obliged, as far as we may, and as
far as the Providence of God will aſſiſt us, ſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
and manage Things, by our Labour and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
as that we may always be in a capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
others in neceſſity, and not to caſt our ſelves
upon their relief when we may avoid it. For this
we have the Apoſtle's direction and approbation,
Acts 20. 35. <hi>I have ſhewed you, that ſo labouring ye
ought to ſupport the Weak; and to remember the words
of the Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid; It is more bleſſed to
give than to receive.</hi> So, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 28. it is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's
Rule, <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more; but rather
let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is
good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:97965:56"/>
Voluntarily to put ones ſelf out of a capacity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, is to ſin againſt the Command of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
and under pretence of Perfection to violate a
down-right Command. And is this fit to be the
Matter of a Vow?</p>
               <p>To ſeek our living by begging Relief of others,
without uſing thoſe Means which we may for our
own ſubſiſtence, is expreſly againſt God's Ordinance,
2 Theſſ. 3. 10. <hi>For when we were with you, this we
commanded you, That if any would not work, neither
ſhould he eat.</hi> And what is ſuch a Vow then, but to
contradict God's Ordinance? Is this the perfection
of thoſe <hi>ſlow Bellies,</hi> thoſe lazy and ſlothful Monks,
that live delicately upon the Liberality of others;
that pervert and abuſe the Alms of the People, and
conſume in Idleneſs and Luxury what the Poor
ſhould have? <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. God hath laid it upon
Men, <hi>In the ſweat of thy Face ſhalt thou eat thy
Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was ordered by God among the Jews, and was
look'd upon as a great Bleſſing, <hi>Deut. 15. 4. That
there be no Poor among you.</hi> And is that now to be
vowed under the Goſpel as a State of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p>As for what our Saviour ſays to the Rich Man,
Mat. 19. 21. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell all
that thou haſt, and give to the Poor, and thou ſhalt
have Treaſure in Heaven; and come and follow me.</hi> The
Perfection which our Saviour there ſpeaks of, is
Chriſtianity it ſelf, which is a neceſſary Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the entring into the Kingdom of Heaven,
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 23, 24, 25. and is therefore Matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and not of Counſel; and obligeth every
Man to perform the hardeſt Tasks, and to part
with any thing here at Chriſt's Command. Here was
an explicit Command to this rich Man to part with
his Eſtate, to ſell all, and give to the Poor; which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97965:56"/>
therefore he ought to have done at Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
if he would be ſaved. And there was an
an explicit Command to the Apoſtles to <hi>leave their
Nets, i. e.</hi> their whole Eſtates and Employments,
and to follow Chriſt. But there is no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Command any where generally given to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
all Chriſtians, and therefore is not their Duty.
But we can no otherwiſe now judg of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Command, and conſequently of our own
Duty in this reſpect, than by the call of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the Neceſſities of others, and a prudent
conſideration of all Circumſtances, by weighing of
which we are to judg, how we may honour God beſt
with our Subſtance.</p>
               <p>The Monkiſh Vow of Poverty then, inſtead of
being a Chriſtian Perfection, is a meer ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and ſuperſtitious Invention. And is indeed
a mere pretence and hypocriſy. For though they
caſt away their private Poſſeſſions, they have
very great Eſtates in common, and live in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Luxury upon the common Treaſure, which
they are ſure will not fail. And is not this, do you
think, a great piece of Perfection and Self-denial, to
live in the fulneſs of all Things from the common

               <p>John 1. 29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh

ſpoken of, threatned by the Law, or no? If not,
then they are not due. If they were, Chriſt hath
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97965:59"/>
taken them off, as they are a Curſe, that is, as they
are vindictive or ſatisfactory Puniſhments; for he
hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>Rev. 1. 5. <hi>Who hath loved us, and waſhed us from
our Sins in his own Blood; to him be Glory for ever and
ever.</hi> If is not the Blood of Martyrdom, or the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of any of the Saints that waſheth them from
their Sins, but the Blood of Chriſt; all the Glory
of it belongs to him. But the Romiſh Doctrine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
that 'tis but part of our Sins, and part of the
Puniſhments that he delivereth us from. This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
leſſens the Love of Chriſt, and the Glory due
to him: For they muſt needs grant, that he had
loved us more, and had been a more perfect Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
if he had delivered us from all.</p>
               <p>But we find alſo, that full Remiſſion and Pardon
is granted unto us now through Chriſt. And what
is Remiſſion of Sin, but Remiſſion of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to Sin, ſo that none is to be undergone by
the Sinner by way of Satisfaction? and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
Remiſſion of all Sin, of all ſuch Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Now this is the Covenant of which Chriſt is
the Mediator, <hi>Heb. 8. 12. I will be merciful to their
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſſes, and their Sins, and their Iniquities will
I remember no more.</hi> But how can it be ſaid, that God
remembers their Sins no more, when he ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts
Satisfaction? The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. verſ.
17, 18. That <hi>where remiſſion of theſe is, there is no more
Offering for Sin.</hi> All being done ſufficiently by the
once Offering of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Col. 2. 13. He hath quickned you together
with him, having forgiven you all Treſpaſſes.</hi> Not ſome
only, or only in ſome part or reſpect. But how are
all Treſpaſſes forgiven, if ſtill there is ſome Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to be made? Iſa. 44. 22. <hi>I have blotted out as
a thick Cloud thy Tranſgreſſions, and as a Cloud thy
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97965:60"/>
Sins.</hi> But it ſeems by the Romiſh Doctrine, they
are not quite blotted out.</p>
               <p>Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are
in Chriſt Jeſus, that walk not after the Fleſh, but after
the Spirit.</hi> But is not that a ſort of Condemnation,
to be adjudged to make Satisfaction for Sin, by
undergoing ſo many Puniſhments, either here or
in Purgatory? What is Purgatory, but a Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Hell?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> Rom. 8. 33. Who ſhall lay any thing <hi>(any
thing at all)</hi> to the charge of God's Elect? It is God
that juſtifieth: Who ſhall condemn? It is Chriſt that
died. <hi>The Death of Chriſt anſwers all; and God
will not demand any thing of the Sinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Epheſ. 4. 32. <hi>Be ye kind one to another, forgiving
one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven
you.</hi> God's forgiving us our Treſpaſſes, is made a
Rule to us to forgive our Brethren. Now we are
to forgive our Brethren all Treſpaſſes, and ſo doth
God then forgive us. Mat. 18. 32. <hi>I forgave thee all
that Debt, becauſe thou deſiredst me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this forgiveneſs of God is all free to us for
Chriſt's ſake. Pſal. 32. 5. <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſs my
Tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of my Sin.</hi> He doth not pretend he had ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for his Sin, by his Sufferings mentioned <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4.
but ſpeaks of it as meer and free forgiveneſs, only
upon his Confeſſion and Repentance. Free For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
and Satisfaction are inconſiſtent. 1 <hi>John</hi>
1. 7. God is ſo there indeed, to be <hi>faithful and
juſt to forgive us our Sins;</hi> but that is not upon our
ſatisfying for them, but only upon our confeſſing
and forſaking them. And none will ſay, that to
confeſs and forſake them, is to give a Recompence
and Satisfaction. And therefore the Faithfulneſs
and Juſtice of God there, muſt be underſtood with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97965:60"/>
reſpect to his own Promiſe, and not to the Sinner's
own Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Beſides, to teach that Men may ſatisfy for ſome
Sins themſelves, as all Venial Sins, is to require
that which is impoſſible to be done; there being
no Sins truly Venial, or not deſerving Eternal
Death, and ſecluſion from the Preſence of God
in their own Nature; though all Sins are Venial
upon Repentance, and in reſpect of the Event only,
through Chriſt's Mediation. So that to encourage
Men to look for the doing away of ſuch Sins by
their own Satisfactions, is to bolſter them up in
Pride and Self-confidence, and at laſt to deceive
them: For we can never by our Satisfactions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt
the demerit of any of our Sins. For, <hi>Rom.
6. 23. The Wages of Sin is Death;</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks
it without exception. So, <hi>Ezek. 18. 20. The Soul
that ſins, ſhall die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> That's the deſert of Sin. So
again, <hi>Gal. 3. 10. Curſed is every one that continueth not
in all things that are written in the Book of the Law to
do them:</hi> He who commits the leaſt Sin, meriteth
the Curſe. For, <hi>Jam. 2. 10. Whoſoever ſhall keep
the whole Law, and yet offendeth in one Point, is guilty
of all;</hi> by Interpretation, the Authority of the
Law-giver being violated in that one, as well as in
all. Mat. 12. 36. <hi>I ſay unto you, That every idle
W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rd that Men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give account
thereof in the Day of Judgment: For by thy Words thou
ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy Words thou ſhalt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>
Yet we do not ſay, that all Sins are equal,
or equally deſerving the ſame degree of Death or
Pain, but all deſerving the Death and excluſion
from God. So that 'tis not poſſible for the Sinner
to offer a ſufficient Recompence or Satisfaction for
the leaſt Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:97965:61"/>
                  <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 6, 7. Wherewith ſhall I come before the
Lord, and bow my ſelf before the High God? Shall I
come before him with Burnt-offerings, with Calves of
a Year Old? Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands
of Rams, or with ten thouſands of Rivers of Oil? Shall
I give my Firſt-born for my Tranſgreſſion; the Fruit
of my Body for the Sin of my Soul? <hi>So, by what
means ſhall I ſatisfy the Juſtice of my God?
Shall I Faſt in Lent? Shall I make Prayers of forty
hours long? Shall I give all my Goods to nouriſh
the Poor? But all theſe things cannot expiate my
Sins; theſe have no proportion or equivalence to
his Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And moreover, as to thoſe Penitential Works,
which are ſaid to be Satisfactions, as Prayer, and
Faſting, and Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are Debts already,
to which we are obliged by virtue of the Law,
(there being no Works of ſupererrogation beyond
or above the Precept of the Law, as is proved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards);
and therefore they cannot be Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
for other Debts, or Sins, or Defects of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
For that which is a Duty already due before
the commiſſion of the Fault, can never ſatisfy for
the Fault committed.</p>
               <p>We are obliged indeed to Repentance, and to
practiſe ſome Acts of Diſcipline, to ſhew our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
againſt our ſelves for our Sins, and to
deter us the more from ſinning for the future. And
ſometimes we muſt make ſome Satisfaction to the
Church for the Scandals that we have committed,
and to teſtify the truth of our Repentance; and
ſometimes to particular Men, in caſe of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Inſtances. And we do not doubt but theſe things
are very pleaſing to God, and may aver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But we deny that they are proper and equivalent
Satisfactions to the Juſtice of God; or that any Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
are ſo, which we can undergo; or that there
can be any ſuch performed or undergone by us at
all.</p>
               <p>As for the Sufferings and Puniſhments inflicted by
God himſelf upon Men, after their Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
theſe are not deſigned by him as vindictive
Puniſhments upon them, and Compenſations to his
Juſtice; but either for Example to others, that
they ſinning may not preſume upon impunity
from his ſparing of others; or as Acts of mere
Diſcipline, and fatherly Correction, to deter his
own from falling into the like Sins for the time to
come. For, <hi>Pſal. 103. Like as a Father pitieth his
Children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that ſerve him.</hi> What
a Father doth, is for his Childrens amendment; he
doth not inflict Torment or Suffering on them for
his own Satisfaction; nor doth delight in giving
them any trouble, were it not needful for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Or if any earthly Parent does ſo, yet God
doth not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. Nor is it true always, that
theſe temporal Inflictions are, or are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon good Men, but only in ſome certain
Caſes, when God ſees it meet and fitting for them

that he ſuffered to ſatisfy for their Sins, as if any
thing were wanting in the meritorious Sufferings of
Chriſt to that end; God forbid. But it was for
the Church's good that the Apoſtles ſuffered, to give
them an Example of Conſtancy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the
Sufferings of the Members of Chriſt are called
<hi>Chriſt's Sufferings,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 5. And they <hi>are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of Chriſt's Sufferings,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 13. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
predeſtinated to be conformed to their Head,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. They are to ſuffer as he did, and ſo
by degrees to fill up the Sufferings that are deſigned

Theſe are they which came out of great Tribulation, and
have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the
Blood of the Lamb; therefore are they before the Throne of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if there be no Satisfactions for Sin made by
any Man or Men, but only Chriſt; and much leſs
ſuperabounding Satisfactions and Merits for others,
above what any one hath need of him, then there
can be no Treaſury of theſe in the Church for the
uſe of others that want: For there can be no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
of that that is not. And what need can there
be of it, when Chriſt's own Satisfaction is ſufficient
in all Caſes?</p>
               <p>And if there be no ſuch Treaſury in the Church
for the benefit of others, to be diſpens'd: then the
Pope, nor any one elſe is the Diſpenſer; for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſpenſe it if it be not. If it be not in his
hands to give, he cannot give it, or rather ſell, for
they do not uſe to be very free of their Gifts. And
then conſequently the uſe of Pardons and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
for the diſpenſing out of theſe ſuperabound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Merits and Satisfactions to others, is a vain thing.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97965:65"/>
For this is to pretend to give that that is not, than
which what can be more vain? And conſequently to
ſell about theſe Indulgences for Mony, and thereby
to give People hope of Pardon of their Sins, is
both to cheat and deceive their Souls, and pick
their Pockets, by pretending to ſell to them that
that is not.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe there were ſuch a Treaſury, why
muſt the Pope be the Diſpenſer? Why ſhould it not
be ſuppoſed, that that is left in the hands of Chriſt
Jeſus alone, who is only able to diſcern who are fit
to have benefit thereby; and who <hi>hath the Key of</hi>
David, <hi>who openeth and no Man ſhutteth, and who
ſhutteth and no Man openeth?</hi> Rev. 3. 7.</p>
               <p>But whatſoever Satisfactious or Merits, even of
Chriſt himſelf, any Perſon hath ſhare in: Surely
theſe are not to be ſold by Mony, nor hath any one
an application thereof made to him by ſuch a Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick;
but upon his Faith and Repentance alone,
which Chriſt alone, and not Man, can judg of the
ſincerity of, and accordingly apply the Benefits of
his Redemption.</p>
               <p>Indulgences of Canonical Penance in the Church,
upon the humiliation and ſubmiſſion of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
are allowed. But Indulgences to diſpenſe an
imaginary Treaſury of imaginary Satisfactions, and
there to be bought by Mony, or ſome very ſlight
Performances, are a bold and unaccountable raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and preſumption.</p>

               <head type="sub">That there is a Purgatory, or place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after this Life, for the expiation of
the Sins of good Men, that are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
purged here. And that the Souls
there detained, are help'd by the Maſſes,
Prayers, Alms, and other good Works of
the Living. Council of Trent, Seſſ. 6.
Can. 30. Seſſ. 25. Decret. de Purgat.</head>
               <p>THE Foundation upon which this Doctrine of
Purgatory is built, is, That there is a Debt of
Temporal Puniſhment remaining to be paid, even
by thoſe that are abſolved and in a ſtate of Grace,
tho the Eternal Puniſhment be forgiven. And that
every Man therefore muſt undergo theſe Temporal
Pains, in proportion to his Sins, Chriſt having not
at all ſatisfied for them: And if this be not done in
this Life, that then it muſt be done in the next, in
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> before a Man can have entrance into
Heaven.</p>
               <p>Now this having been refuted before, and it
having been proved, that Chriſt hath ſatisfied fully
for all our Sins, and that we have compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Remiſſion of Sin through the free Grace of
God, upon the account alone of Chriſt's meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Satisfaction; and ſo that there is no proper Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to be made by us for Sin at all, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
upon which Purgatory is built, is taken away.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97965:66"/>
And all thoſe Texts ſerve to the refuting of it,
which are before produc'd to prove the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our Saviour's Satisfaction, and of the free
Remiſſion of our Sins upon it.</p>
               <p>But yet if it were admitted, that there were a
reſerve of ſome proper Satisfactory Puniſhments,
which God may think fit to inflict upon ſome Men
in ſome Caſes here; yet unleſs it could be proved,
that this were a perpetual Ordinance, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
obſerved by God, it would not ſignify any
thing to the purpoſe of what is intended. And yet
if this were admitted likewiſe, that it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
ſo here, yet what is this to prove a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
hereafter? For who can tell, but for ſuch
Puniſhments as are to be undergone, it may be all
done here, unleſs God reveals to us to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
But there being neither one nor other of theſe
things proved, but the contrary rather appearing,
we cannot otherwiſe think of Purgatory, but that
'tis <hi>a fond Thing vainly invented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, 'tis directly contrary to all thoſe
Texts of Scripture that aſſert the Happineſs and
Reſt of the Saints after this Life. As,</p>
               <p>Iſa. 57. 1, 2. <hi>The Righteous is taken away from the
Evil to come. He ſhall enter into Peace: they ſhall reſt
in their Beds.</hi> Is this to be taken away from the Evil
to come, to be put into a condition where they muſt
undergo heavier? Is that to enter into Peace, and
to be at Reſt, to be burning in Fire ſeven times
hotter than ours, and which differs from that in
Hell in nothing, but in reſpect of duration?</p>
               <p>Rev. 14. 13. <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead that die in the
Lord, from henceforth, that they may reſt from their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and their Works do follow them;</hi> that is, their
good Works, in the gracious Reward that is given
them, not their Sins and Puniſhments. Now all the
Faithful that die, die in the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. So
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97965:66"/>
that they all reſt from their Labours. But to be
tormented in burning Fire, ſure that is not to reſt
from their Labours, but to be put to worſe.</p>
               <p>In the Book of Wiſdom, which the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> holds for Canonical, and therefore cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
its Teſtimony, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1. it is ſaid, <hi>The Souls
of the Righteous are in the Hand of God, and there ſhall
no torment touch them.</hi> What can be more expreſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> 5. 24. Our ſaviour ſays, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay
unto you, That he who heareth my Word, and believeth on
him that ſent me, hath eternal Life, and ſhall not come
into condemnation, but is paſſed from Death to Life.</hi>
Note, that it is not ſaid, That he who believeth in
Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall paſs from Death unto Torment;
but he that ſhall <hi>paſs from Death to Life,</hi> that is a
bleſſed Life; for the other would be to paſs from
Death to Death, at leaſt for a while.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1. We know, <hi>ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi>
that if our earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle were
diſſolved, we have a Building of God, an Houſe not
made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens. <hi>It is not
Purgatory then, or a Place of Torment that the
Saints remove into when they remove from their
Bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore ſaith he, <hi>verſ. 2. In this we groan
earneſtly, deſiring to be clothed upon with our Houſe which
is from Heaven.</hi> But if Death were followed with
Torment ſo horrible, as thoſe are repreſented to
be which are in Purgatory, there would be reaſon
rather for one to be affrighted at it, and to fly from
it, than to deſire it with ſo much ardour and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs,
and to wiſh to continue in this preſent
ſtate of Life ſtill for fear of the worſt.</p>
               <p>Yet again, <hi>verſ. 6, 7, 8. Whilſt we are at home in
the Body, we are abſent from the Lord, and are willing
rather to be abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with
the Lord.</hi> Implying, that that would be preſently
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97965:67"/>
upon the leaving the Body. Now our Lord ſure is
in Heaven, and not in Purgatory. Therefore ſo
ſhall the Saints be alſo when they die.</p>
               <p>Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil. 1. 21. To me to live
is Chriſt, and to die is Gain.</hi> But according to the
Romiſh Church, to die is a damage to us. The fear
of Purgatory may make the beſt Men fearful of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>verſ. 23. I am in a great ſtrait betwixt two,
deſiring to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, which is
far better.</hi> This implies, that he did not doubt
but it would be ſo. But if there were a Purgatory
to paſs through firſt, it would be far better to abide
longer in the Body. For though St. <hi>Paul</hi> had leſs
Sin than others, yet it cannot be denied but he might
have ſome venial Sins. And if there muſt be Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
undergon by way of ſatisfaction for theſe
Sins, equivalent to the Fire of Hell, as that in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
is ſaid to be, though he did undergo more
Croſſes and Afflictions than others, yet ye did not
undergo thoſe that were equivalent to the Fire of
Hell; and how could he be ſure then, but that he
alſo muſt enter into Purgatory firſt before he paſs
into Heaven? and then one would think, he ſhould
have little Heart to deſire to be diſſolved: But he
doth not fear any of this.</p>
               <p>And note, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the next Life in common, in the plural
number, as belonging to all the Saints, and not as a
ſpecial Priviledg to himſelf alone. So, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 8.
Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which the Lord the Righteous Judg ſhall give me
at that day;</hi> that is, the day of his departure out
of this Life, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. And then mark, <hi>Not to me on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but unto all them alſo that love his appearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 43. Our Saviour ſaid to the believing
Thief on the Croſs, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97965:67"/>
Paradiſe.</hi> He doth not ſay, when thou ſhalt have
been ſome Years in Purgatory, I will receive thee
into Paradiſe; but, <hi>this day,</hi> &amp;c. Now Paradiſe
is acknowledged to be the Seat of the Bleſſed, not
a place of Torment. And yet there was no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that could deſerve more to be ſent to ſuch a
place than the Thief, having had no time to do
Penance for any of his Sins. For if to ſuffer Death
for his Sins was a ſufficient Satisfaction; then it
were beſt for every Man to deſire to ſuffer ſuch a
Death or worſe. For the pains of the worſt of
Deaths are much eaſier it ſeems than thoſe of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</p>
               <p>But is it not indeed very ſtrange that God ſhould
forgive Men the Eternal Puniſhment due to the
worſt and moſt mortal Sins, for the ſake of Chriſt's
Satisfaction, and yet exact ſo ſevere a Puniſhment
for Sins, in their own nature Venial, which may be
ſo eaſily remitted? that God ſhould do the greater,
and yet that he ſhould not do the leſs? When yet
it muſt needs be owned, that Chriſt hath offered a
Satisfaction enough for all if it be but applied.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe places that are pretended to prove a
Purgatory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13, 15. There we read of
Fire indeed, and that is all, but not one word of
Purgatory-Fire. It is the Fire of the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is there meant, which is eminently in Scripture
called <hi>the Day,</hi> and is that indeed which ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by Fire, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 7, 8. And it is the Works
of Men there that ſhall be burnt, that is, their falſe
Doctrines, which are but <hi>Hay and Stubble,</hi> when the
Trial comes. But it doth not ſpeak of the burning
of their Perſons that hold the Foundation, who are
not to be burnt, but ſaved, yet <hi>ſo as by Fire;</hi> which
is only a phraſe to expreſs the doing of a thing
with great difficulty, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 2. ſee a like phraſe
<hi>Jude</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:97965:68"/>
As for <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 32. it ſpeaketh of the greateſt
of Sins, <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which ſhall
<hi>never be forgiven,</hi> and ſo that Phraſe ſignifies, <hi>neither
in this, nor in the World to come,</hi> that is, not at all.
So, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 29. it is expreſt, <hi>He hath never forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but is in danger of eternal damnation:</hi> or, that
Phraſe may ſignify, that that great Sin ſhould not be
forgiven in the Times of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or under the
Goſpel, which is ſometimes expreſt by <hi>the World to
come,</hi> Heb. 2. 5. &amp; 6. 5. when the Jews expected
that greater Sins ſhould be forgiven, than could be
expiated by Levitical Sacrifices. Or, if Sins be ſaid
to be forgiven in <hi>the World to come,</hi> what is that, but
at the Day of Judgment, when the actual delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Juſt from Puniſhment, and their final
acquittal, may be not improperly called the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of their Sins? What is this to Purgatory,
where Sins are not forgiven, but puniſh'd?</p>
               <p>Mat. 5. 26. <hi>They ſhall not come out thence till they
have paid the uttermoſt Farthing;</hi> that is, never; but
muſt abide in Hell for ever. Hell is mentioned,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 22, 29, 30. And divers degrees of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
intimated there, with alluſion to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
degrees inflicted in the Jewiſh Courts, but not
one word of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>As for, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19, 20. thoſe Spirits there ſaid
to be <hi>diſobedient,</hi> were not ſaved at all, as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
they ſhall be out of Purgatory. And the
Priſon that they are ſaid to be in, doth not ſignify
Purgatory, as if Chriſt then by his Spirit preach'd
to them there. But by his Spirit in <hi>Noah,</hi> he
preach'd to a diſobedient World, though his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
did then no good; their Souls being then, as it
were, by Luſt and Sin enſlaved and impriſoned in
their Bodies, and are now lying in the Priſon of
Hell for all this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:97965:68"/>
Now then, if there be no Purgatory, or place of
Torment in the next Life for juſt Men, to the end
pretended, then likewiſe Prayers, or Maſſes and
Alms for them, are vain things to the end propoſed,
<hi>viz.</hi> in order to the deliverance out of it. If there
be no ſuch thing, then theſe things that have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it, can be of no uſe. And yet if there
were a Purgatory for expiation of Sins, and for
ſatisfaction for temporal Puniſhments due to them,
how doth it appear, that Prayer for thoſe in that
State will help them out of it? or who can tell,
but that they muſt continue there, if they be there,
till the Day of Judgment? As for the ſupererro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
meritorious Works of the Living, and
their availableneſs to deliver their dead Friends
out of Purgatory, it is after proved likewiſe, that
there are no ſuch Works. But yet if they were,
how ſhould they be available to get them out of
it, when the ſuperabundant Merits and Satisfactions
of Chriſt were not available to prevent their going
in? If others Satisfactions and Merits might be of
uſe to them in Purgatory, one would think Chriſt's
ſhould have kept them out. But if Chriſt's Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
could not help them, but they muſt ſatisfy
for themſelves how ſhould the Saints good Works
upon Earth help them?</p>
               <p>This is the great Doctrine, with the Appenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of it, that brings in ſo great Wealth to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and therefore no wonder it is ſo ſtifly retained;
though among all the Directions that are given
about Prayer, up and down the Scripture, there
is not any where the leaſt intimation of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
for praying for the Dead, or of any uſe
that it would be. Which it is very ſtrange that it
ſhould be omitted among ſo many Inſtructions, that
are given about Prayer, if it were to have been
done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:97965:69"/>
As for 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 12. 39, &amp;c. where he ſaith,
<hi>Mony was ſent to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>that Sacrifices might be
offered for the Slain; and 'tis recommended as an holy
Cogitation to pray for the Dead.</hi> Thoſe Men that
died, died in the Sin of <hi>Achan,</hi> and therefore were
liable to eternal Puniſhment. And ſo there could
be no ground to ſuppoſe, even according to Popiſh
Principles, that they were in Purgatory, but in
Hell. And if it proves the benefit of Sacrifice and
Prayer for the deliverance of dead Sinners, it muſt
be out of Hell it ſelf, and not out of Purgatory.
<hi>Judas</hi>'s Offering was a Sin-offering for the ſake of
the Living, that the whole Aſſembly might not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for the Sin of the Dead, as they once did in the
Caſe of <hi>Achan,</hi> Joſh. 7. And Prayers were offered
up to God to the ſame end, to avert his Anger
from them. But <hi>Jaſon</hi> the Writer of the Hiſtory,
or his Epitomizer, being a Platonick Jew, and
having his Head fill'd with ſome Platonick Notions,
ignorantly applies all this as done for the Slain. But
he commends Self-murder too, and praiſeth <hi>Razias</hi>
for killing <hi>himſelf,</hi> 2 Mac. 14. 42. So that we have
no great reaſon to rely much upon the Judgment of
this Author.</p>

               <p>FOR the underſtanding of this, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
that the Romiſh Doctors diſtinguiſh
Juſtification into the firſt and ſecond. The firſt, in
which a Man is made Juſt, by the infuſion of the
habit of Charity. The ſecond, is his co-operating
with the Grace received, by which he merits and
attains to a greater increaſe of Righteouſneſs. But
both theſe are inherent in him; ſo that Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with him, is the ſame with Regeneration and
Sanctification; and all is wrought in them, in the
uſe, and by virtue of the Sacraments. But beſides
this, they ſpeak of, and ſeem to include Remiſſion
of Sins in Juſtification; by which they mean both
the removing of the Fault, and the guilt of Sin.
But the remiſſion of the Fault, is nothing elſe but
the aboliſhing of Sin by the aforeſaid infuſed
Grace, whereby it is deſtroyed, and ceaſes in its
being. And then the guilt of Sin, which is its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
of, and obligation to Puniſhment, is remitted
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97965:70"/>
of courſe, by natural and neceſſary Conſequence.
For Sin being aboliſh'd, where there is no Sin, there
can be no Deſert or Puniſhment, and ſo no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it. So that Sin being aboliſh'd, the Guilt is
taken away; but it is no otherwiſe taken away,
than by taking away the being of Sin; but it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that by a neceſſary reſult. So that according
to-them, Juſtification or Remiſſion of Sin, is not
an Act of God's Grace, abſolving the believing and
penitent Sinner from Guilt, and graciouſly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Faith to him for Righteouſneſs, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
him as Righteous, and dealing with him
accordingly, though his Righteouſneſs be imperfect,
and do not deſerve it, meerly of his own free
Grace, upon the account of the ſatisfactory or
meritorious Sacrifice of Chriſt Jeſus offered up to
him. But the taking away the Puniſhment of Sin,
is a thing ariſing by a natural Conſequence from the
aboliſhing of Sin, and ſo is neceſſarily due upon the
infuſion of Grace, and is really no diſtinct Act from
it. And ſo the free Grace of God, and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt, has no other hand in the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Remiſſion of a Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>r, than as procuring

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ner for aboliſhing of
Sin, and making him inherently juſt; and then the
reſt is due and follows of courſe.</p>
               <p>Againſt that which is written, <hi>Acts 13. 38, 39. Be
it known unto you therefore, Men and Brethren, that
through this Man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of
Sins. And by him all that believe are juſtified from all
things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law
of</hi> Moſes. Where that which is the Forgiveneſs
of Sins in the firſt place, in the ſecond is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by Juſtification. So that Juſtification and
Forgiveneſs are the ſame thing; and are conſequent
to Faith, which is the condition of it, and ſo is to
go before. And this Forgiveneſs now under the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97965:70"/>
Goſpel-Law or Covenant is of ſuch Sins, of which
by the Sacrifices of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> there was no
remiſſion. So that Goſpel-forgiveneſs or Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the acquitting of the Sinner from his Sin, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of the Sacrifice of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So, <hi>Rom. 3. 24, 25, 26. Being juſtified freely by his
Grace, through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus,
whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation through
Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the
Remiſſion of Sins that are paſt, that he might be juſt,
and the Juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.</hi> Where
Juſtification and Remiſſion of Sins are alſo taken
for the ſame, and the one is but explicatory of the
other. And it is an Act of God's Grace, not infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Grace, but forgiving of Sins paſt, upon the
account of Chriſt's Propitiatory Sacrifice, to all thoſe
that believe in him, though they be not innocent
or ſinleſs, nor have any thing of Merit or Vertue
in themſelves towards the purchaſing of this Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>verſ. 28. Therefore we conclude, that a Man is
juſtified by Faith without the Deeds of the Law.</hi> And
being without the Deeds of the Law, it cannot be
ſuppoſed to conſiſt in Sanctification, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by ſuch Deeds. But the meaning of it
therefore is, That Faith and ſincere Obedience to
the Goſpel of Chriſt, is ſo accepted by God upon
the account of Chriſt's Sacrifice, that though it be
not a perfect Righteouſneſs, the true Believer ſhall
be freely diſcharged and acquitted of all his Sin,
by God's pardoning-Grace, without having a
perfect legal Righteouſneſs in himſelf to deſerve
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3. Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> And, <hi>verſ. 5. To him
that worketh not, but believeth in him that juſtifieth the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, his Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs.</hi> And,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97965:71"/>
verſ. 22. <hi>It was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi>
Where Juſtification is not the infuſion of Faith or
Righteouſneſs, but it is the Acceptation of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's
Faith through meer Grace, as if it were a
perfect Righteouſneſs, though it be not, and though
a Believer has not in himſelf a perfect innocence or
blameleſſneſs.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Even as</hi> David <hi>deſcribeth the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Man, to whom the Lord imputeth Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
without Works; ſaying, Bleſſed are they whoſe Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
are forgiven, and whoſe Sins are covered. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is the Man to whom the Lord will not impute Sin.</hi>
Where the imputing of Righteouſneſs, and the not
imputing of Sin, and the forgiving of Iniquities,
and covering of Sins, are all taken for the ſame, and
are all but ſeveral Expreſſions of Juſtification. And
the imputing <hi>of Righteouſneſs without Works,</hi> ſure is
not the infuſion of Righteouſneſs, which is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by Works. And the covering or not imputing
of Sin, is not the aboliſhing of it.</p>
               <p>Rom. 8. 33. <hi>Who then ſhall lay any thing to the charge
of God's Elect? It is God that juſtifieth; who is he that
condemneth?</hi> Where Juſtification is oppoſed to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
and Condemnation. And from hence it is
plain, that it is a judicial Act of God towards us,
diſcharging and acquitting Believers for Chriſt's
ſake, from what they are accuſed of, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Law. And it is an Expreſſion taken from
Judicial Proceedings at a Court, where the Judg
does not infuſe new Qualities into one at the Bar,
but acquits and diſcharges him from the Guilt of
which he was accuſed, and the Puniſhment due to
it. As the word is alſo uſed. <hi>Prov. 17. 15. He that
juſtifieth the Wicked, and condemneth the Juſt, even
they both are an abomination to the Lord.</hi> Where his
Fault is, that he acquits the Wicked, who ought to be
condemned. But if he could turn his Heart, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97965:71"/>
make him Juſt, ſure that would be no abomination.
And indeed this ſenſe of the word <hi>Juſtify</hi> and <hi>Remit,</hi>
is the uſual ſenſe of all the World; and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it otherwiſe of induing a Man with good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
is againſt the common uſage of all Mankind.
And certainly it ought to be interpreted and taken
in ſuch its uſual ſenſe then in thoſe places, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
treat of Juſtification, and where all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
do concur to ſuch a ſignification. Though
there ſhould be ſome particular place elſewhere,
where it may be ſingularly interpreted in another
manner, where the Circumſtances of the place do
require it.</p>
               <p>Now the reſult of all is, That Faith, or a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
reception of, and ſubmiſſion to Chriſt and
his Laws, is prerequired in us as the condition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Juſtification and Remiſſion of Sin is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
in the Covenant of Grace, upon the account
of Chriſt's Sacrifice. So that this is preſuppoſed
to Juſtification in order of Nature. But the whole
of Remiſſion and Juſtification, is the free Act of
God's Grace, acquitting the true Believer of this
Sin and Puniſhment due to it, upon the account of
the meritorious Satisfaction made by Chriſt Jeſus,
and accepting of him as righteous, and dealing with
him accordingly, though he has a great deal of Sin,
and has not a perfect Righteouſneſs of his own to
deſerve it. His Acquitment and Acceptation is not
a natural Conſequent of his having Grace inherent
in him, as if that were properly his Juſtification;
but it is by virtue of the Promiſe made in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, with reſpect to, and upon the
account of the Satisfaction made by Chriſt Jeſus. So
that the free Grace of God, and the Sacrifice of
Chriſt, have an hand both in the procuring of
Grace for us, and the acceptation of it alſo when
that is done.</p>

               <p>And as for what St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>Chap. 5. 16. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
your Faults one to another, and pray one for another,
that ye may be healed.</hi> Note, that he directs to this,
only in caſe of bodily Sickneſs, accompanied with
an afflicted or diſtreſſed Conſcience, in order to the
obtaining the more fervent Prayers of thoſe who
are made privy to their Caſe, for their relief and
help from God; but he does not appoint it for an
univerſal ſtanding Rule for all Men, and of abſolute
obligation upon them in all Caſes, for the obtaining
of Remiſſion of Sin, by a Prieſtly Abſolution.</p>
               <p>And note, that when our Saviour ſays, <hi>John 20.
23. Whoſe ſoever Sins ye remit, they are remitted; and
whoſe ſoever Sins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> It can
only be meant of ſuch Sins as might happen to come
to their knowledg; and in ſuch Caſes wherein they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97965:73"/>
might be able to make a right and ſure Judgment of
Mens Repentance of, or pertinacy in Sin; which
the Apoſtles were ſometimes enabled to do by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Revelation; and then they had an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Power given them by the Holy Ghoſt, to inflict
extraordinary Puniſhments upon Men, and to take
them off again, as they ſaw cauſe upon Mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3, 4. &amp; 13. 11. 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 5. 2 Cor.</hi>
2. 6, 7. But the moſt that any Prieſt now can do,
who is not inveſted with thoſe extraordinary Gifts,
is to pronounce Men abſolved from the Guilt of
their Sin, upon condition of their Repentance, or
condemned for their not coming up to it. And
here is no Inſtitution of Confeſſion to be neceſſarily
made to a Prieſt; nor the leaſt intimation given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the Sins of Men cannot be otherwiſe remitted,
if ſo be they perform the condition of a ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
in themſelves.</p>
               <p>There is no trace or track of it in our Saviour's
dealing with Sinners, though he had to do with very
great ones. Nor yet in the Apoſtles: And St. <hi>Peter</hi>
himſelf, when he ſinned, we hear of him only, that
he went out and wept bitterly, by that Sign expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the real Contrition and ſincere Repentance of
his Heart; but we read not a word of his going to
a Prieſt to make Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>In caſe of publick Scandal indeed given to the
Church, a publick Confeſſion is very needful, and was
always the Diſcipline of the Ancient Church. And
in caſe of perplexity of Conſcience, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdening
of that, and as an help to Repentance, a
private Confeſſion of the Sinner, and opening his
Caſe to ſome Spiritual Guide, is alſo very uſeful. But
that a particular private Confeſſion of all Mortal
Sin, with all its Circumſtances, to a Prieſt, is of
perpetual and neceſſary obligation to all, in order
to the obtaining pardon of Sin, can no where be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97965:74"/>
proved. And therefore is an horrid Impoſition,
and intolerable Tyranny upon Mens Conſciences;
and is to change the Terms of Salvation from what
God himſelf has appointed, and to make that both
eaſier and harder than he has made it, either as it
is ſaid, that Confeſſion is enough with bare Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or that it muſt be added over and above to
true Repentance it ſelf. And note, that the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Abſolution, when it is given, is not Authoritative
and Judicial. For ſo to abſolve Sinners, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
Sins, belongs only to God, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 7. Iſa. 43.
25. who is the only Lawgiver, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 12. or to
Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who hath the Key of</hi> David; <hi>who openeth
and none ſhutteth,</hi> Rev. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. who alone hath the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
independent, and abſolute Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to do all things in the Church. And whereas
he hath likewiſe given unto the Paſtors of the
Church the Key of the Kingdom of Heaven, they
then open Heaven, when they declare the Grace of
God to repenting Sinners; they ſhut Heaven when
they declare the Judgment of God to impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
But if they be ignorant or wicked, let them
pardon the Impenitent, and excommunicate the
Good, that which they do on Earth is not ratified in
Heaven. The Authority they have to pardon Sin, or
to abſolve the Sinner, being only miniſterial, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
and conditional, upon the profeſſion and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the Sinner's Faith and Repentance.</p>

But then it is the good Works themſelves that are
truly meritorious of Eternal Life. And the Grace

And that being done, the Acts or Works them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

               <p>So, <hi>Luke 12. 32. Fear not, little Flock, it is your

Kingdom of Heaven is repreſented as a Gift, and
that as flowing from the Father's good Pleaſure,
and therefore not from their merit.</p>
               <p>So again, <hi>John 10. 28. My Sheep hear my Voice,

Mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and
renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, that being juſtified by his
Grace, we ſhould be made Heirs according to the Hope of

It is allowed by our Adverſaries, that Men by
their good Works cannot merit Remiſſion of Sin.
And they who cannot deſerve to be forgiven, how
ſhould they deſerve to have an infinite Reward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon them? But whence ſhould both one
and the other come then, but from Grace? <hi>And if

<hi>For to him that worketh is the Reward not reckoned of

for Grace excludes Merit. Where there is Merit,
there can be no Grace; and where there is Grace,
there can be no Merit. And if there cannot be

how ſhould there be Merit to obtain Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>To have a Righteouſneſs, or Works truly Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,

               </p>
               <p>That a Juſtified Perſon may merit eternal Life by
his good Works, his good Works ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and he ought certainly to have no other but
good Works; for where there is Sin, there is need
of Pardon. And 'tis ſtrange that he ſhould have
need of Pardon for ſome, and yet can merit a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Immortality by others? But now it is plain,
that every juſtified Perſon doth ſin often.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:97965:76"/>
Again, to have good Works properly meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
there muſt be a proportion between the Work
and the Reward; that the good Work may be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
price or value for the Recompence. But now
what proportion can there be, between an Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Righteouſneſs and Eternal Glory? <hi>Rom. 8. 18.
I reckon,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>that the ſufferings of this
preſent Time are not worthy to be compared with the
Glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17, 18.
<hi>For our light-affliction, which is but for a moment, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
Glory.</hi> There is no compariſon between the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the moſt glorious Martyrs, and the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently
glorious Reward in Heaven. Then there
is no equality of worthineſs of one to the other.
And if the Sufferings of the moſt glorious Martyrs
have not a Dignity and Worth in them, equal to
the Glory to come, what ſhall we ſay of all other
good Works?</p>
               <p>Nay, though our Works were perfect, as perfect
as a Creatures can be, yet there would be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between our Work and Eternal Life, that is
ſo unſpeakably great. Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
could not merit properly ſuch a glorious Reward,
as is now promiſed us in the Goſpel. For there is
no proportional dignity in the Work of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſuitable to ſo great a Glory. The moſt that can
be ſaid is, That he did not deſerve Pain or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
or that he did deſerve <hi>ſome</hi> conſideration
for the right uſe of this Free-will that was put into
his Power; but not that he deſerved ſo great, and
long, and glorious a Reward, as is promiſed us.
And how can any Juſtified Perſon now deſerve it,
whoſe Righteouſneſs is ſo ſtained and defective?
The moſt that can be here ſaid alſo, is, that it is
congruous that good Men, who labour againſt ſo
many Difficulties in mortifying their Luſts, and to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97965:76"/>
pleaſe God, ſhould not be treated in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with other Men; but it cannot be ſaid, that
they deſerve ſo great a Reward, as a bleſſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Immortality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again; be our Works never ſo perfect, yet they
could not merit Eternal Life, becauſe we do but
that which as Creatures we are bound to do, though
there were no Reward propoſed. Luke</hi> 17. 10.
When you have done all thoſe things that are commanded
you, ſay, We are unprofitable Servants; we have done that
which was our Duty to do. <hi>And we can bring no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to God by it, by which he ſhould be bound
to repay it. For,</hi> Job 22. 2. Can a Man be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto God? Or is it Gain to him, that thou makeſt
thy Ways perfect? <hi>So,</hi> Job 35. 7. If thou be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
what giveſt thou him? or what receiveth he of
thine hand? Thy Wickedneſs may hurt a Man, as thou art,
and thy Righteouſneſs may profit the Son of Man. Job
<hi>was very ſenſible of this, and therefore what little
cauſe there was of boaſting in, or relying upon the
Merits of his Righteouſneſs, though it had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo perfect. Job</hi> 9. 15. Whom, though I were Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
yet would I not anſwer him, <hi>ſays he, ſpeaking
of God,</hi> but I would make ſupplication to my Judg.
<hi>So,</hi> Pſal. 16. 2. My Goodneſs extendeth not to thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And after all, whatſoever good Work any Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Perſon doth, he doth all by a Power received
from God himſelf; and how can he merit from
God by that which he himſelf has given? For,

When there is a Promiſe of a Reward annex'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to any performance, upon condition of it, then
upon the performance of the Condition, tho it be
never ſo ſmall, and by whatſoever power it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
the Reward is due, tho it be never ſo great.
But it is due by Promiſe only, the Promiſer of meer
Grace engaging himſelf to it, and not from the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Work. And in this ſenſe Eternal Life
may be ſaid to be due to them that keeps Covenant
with God; And therefore 'tis ſometimes called a
Reward; and God will at laſt proceed with Men
according to their Works, according to the Order
aſſigned, and Condition prefix'd in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace. But ſtill the Reward promiſed is of
Grace to us, being only founded upon a free and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Promiſe, by which God hath obliged himſelf
to give it; but is not by virtue of a juſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
dignity in the Work it ſelf. But this will
not ſerve the turn of our Adverſaries, who aſſert that
Works are <hi>properly meritorious;</hi> which muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

then there is nothing that Man can do, that ſhall
be a Perfection beyond or above the Law. And the
former will appear by theſe following Texts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat. 22. 37, 38. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with
all thy Mind. And thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as

with all his Faculties. And whatſoever in due
Circumſtances can be an expreſſion of this Love
to God or Men, is here required. So that one
cannot do that Work, which, all Circumſtances
being weighed, is not required and commanded
in the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:97965:78"/>
Mic. 6. 8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is Good;
and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly,
to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi>
What is Good, and what doth the Lord require
of thee, are taken for the ſame. By which the
Prophet intimates, that that only is good and
acceptable to God, which God requires. And
whatſoever God requires, is contained in theſe
Generals, ſo that there can be no good or accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Work but what is reducible to them.</p>
               <p>Mat. 5. 48. <hi>Be ye perfect,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>as
your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of God himſelf, as far as it is imitable
by us, is propoſed as the model of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which is required of us. And unleſs there
be ſome Perfection then, which there is not the
Idea of in God, what other Perfection is there
for us to practiſe or attain, but what is required?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. All that the Apoſtle requires of
Chriſtians, is, To <hi>Prove what is that good, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
and perfect Will of God,</hi> under the Goſpel,
in order to the doing of it. Where he reduceth
all that he deſires, that Chriſtians ſhould be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the underſtanding and practice of the Will
of God. This Will of God is perfect, and the
Rule of Perfection. And 'tis a conformity to this
Will of God, which is only good and acceptable
to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 9, 10. The Apoſtle prays, that Chriſtians
may be <hi>filled with the Knowledg of his Will, in all
Wiſdom and ſpiritual Vnderſtanding; that ye might
walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, being fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in every good Work.</hi> It is the Will of God, is
the Rule of every good Work, and of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is pleaſing to him. And therefore 'tis the
utmoſt that a Chriſtian can deſire to know or do.
And this it is his duty to do: ſo that there can be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97965:78"/>
no good Work, that is pleaſing to God but what
it is his duty to do.</p>
               <p>Chap. 4. 12. Again; <hi>That ye may ſtand perfect
and compleat in all the Will of God.</hi> If a Man can
do all the Will of God, he will be perfect and
compleat. And this every Man ought to labour
after. So that there is no perfection or compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
but what is contained in the compaſs of Man's
Duty required. For there is no Perfection, but
what is regulated by the Will of God, which is
the Rule of Man's Duty.</p>
               <p>Luke 17. 10. <hi>When ye ſhall have done all theſe things
that are commanded you, ſay, We are unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
we have done that which is our Duty to do.</hi> The
ſcope of our Saviour is to ſhow, that we cannot
at any time boaſt, that we have done more than
our Duty, or what as Servants we were obliged to.
For whatſoever we do, being ſuch, it is a Debt to
our Maſter. Being <hi>bought with a Price,</hi> we ought
to do whatſoever we may <hi>glorify God</hi> in, both with
our Souls and our Bodies, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. Finally, Brethren, whatſoever things are
true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are
juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are
lovely, whatſoever things are of good report: if there be
any vertue, if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things.
<hi>What good Work or Action can there be, which is
not contained in this Command of the Apoſtle?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſome things indeed, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
nakedly conſidered, are indifferent, and do
not come under any Command. Such are Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and ſingle Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then the obſervation
of them nakedly in themſelves, is indifferent too,
and not a Perfection. But in certain Times, for
certain Ends, when the <hi>glory</hi> of God, the State of the
Church, the Edification of our Brethren, or our own
Neceſſity require it, that which is indifferent in it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97965:79"/>
ſelf, nakedly conſidered, and under no Command,
as it is clothed with theſe Circumſtances, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
neceſſary, and a down-right Duty, as far as
it can be conceived conducible to thoſe Ends. And
this is the State of things mentioned by the Apoſtle,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. And the miſtake in this Matter ariſeth
from not diſtinguiſhing between an univerſal Law,
that obligeth all, and that which obligeth only
ſome Perſons in ſome Circumſtances. Both theſe
are Laws, the violation of which is Sin; whereas
the latter have been miſunderſtood for meer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.
Now then if a Man can do no good Work, but if
it be good, it is his Duty to do, by one Command or
other, then he can have no proper merit at all;
and much leſs can he merit for others, by doing his
own Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it is ſtrange to conſider indeed, that a Man
who is not abſolutely perfect according to the Law,
ſhould yet be able to do above the perfection of the
Law. And that that is the Caſe is plain, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is pretended to the contrary. For,</hi> 1 King.

               <p>THE Neceſſity of Baptiſm we conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
and that it is a Law of Chriſt which he
hath eſtabliſh'd in the Goſpel to be for ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
But we think it very uncharitable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
that all thoſe that die without it are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
excluded from the Grace of Chriſt: nor have
all of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> been of this uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Opinion. But it is ſuppoſed, that Martyrdom,
or Penance, and Acts of Faith, Hope and Charity,
may ſupply the Defects of it. But if Children,
which are not capable of theſe, die without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
they very uncharitably hold, that they are
excluded from all part in Jeſus Chriſt. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the general Opinion, the Senſe of the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi> is to be ſuppoſed to intend it.</p>
               <p>But by what hath been ſaid in the foregoing
Chapter, it appears, that the Grace of God is not
abſolutely tied to the Sacraments, but is rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97965:80"/>
unto them. So that there is ſometimes
Sanctification, Juſtification, and the other Graces,
before the uſe of the Sacraments. As <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and was juſtified, before he was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<hi>Rom. 4. 10. Cornelius</hi> received the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
before he was baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 19. And our
Adverſaries are forc'd to grant, that there may be
Acts of Faith, and Hope, and Charity, without or
before the Application of them: As the Thief on
the Croſs believed, though he was never baptized,
<hi>Luke</hi> 23. 42. Even after thoſe words were ſpoken
by our Saviour, <hi>Except a Man be born again of Water
and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
Now if there may be this Grace of Faith without
Baptiſm, then ſo likewiſe there may be Salvation. For,
John 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that whoſoever
believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting
Life.</hi> So that if they may believe without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
then ſo likewiſe they may be ſaved; as we ſee
the Thief on the Croſs was, who entred into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
without being baptized. Sacraments are Seals
of Grace, which they ſerve to increaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
as being before; but they do not give Grace
or Salvation any other ways, than as they confirm
the Covenant, by which it is promiſed to them
who are in it.</p>
               <p>It is not the Sacraments then which make Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to have part in the Covenant of God, and the
Fruits thereof, tho by theſe Rights they are viſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiated
into the fellowſhip of the Catholick Church.
But on the contrary, they receive the Sacraments,
becauſe they belong to the Covenant of God before.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> for
himſelf and his Seed, <hi>to be a God unto thee,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>and thy Seed after thee;</hi> and upon this they were to
receive the Token of Circumciſion, as a Seal of the
Covenant, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. So that Circumciſion followed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97965:80"/>
the Clauſes of the Covenant, and did not give them
a right to it, nor make them the Children of God,
out preſuppoſed their being ſo.</p>
               <p>So in the New Teſtament, God hath taken Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
into Covenant, together with their Parents
that believe; ſo that their Children are holy already
before they are baptized, and that from the very
Birth, as being born within the Covenant of Grace.
1 Cor. 7. 13, 14. <hi>The unbelieving Husband is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by
the Husband; elſe were your Children unclean, but now
are they holy.</hi> By which he cannot underſtand <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate</hi>
in oppoſition to Baſtardy; for ſo they would
have been, being born in Matrimony, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their Parents had believed. But he means,
they are holy to God, by virtue of the Covenant, by
which he is the Parent's God, and the God of their
Poſterity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. And if the Lord be the God
alſo of Children; and if they be holy, being ſprung
from the Righteous Seed, how can they poſſibly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
though they die unbaptized? For though it be
a federal Holineſs only, which can be directly argued
from words, yet it muſt be ſuppoſed to be ſuch a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral
Holineſs, as intitles them to ſaving Benefits
contained in the Covenant; which therefore if they
die before their actual breach of the Covenant,
they ſhall not fail to attain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 14. Our Saviour therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith, <hi>Suffer
little Children to come unto me, for of ſuch is the Kingdom

on the Head of the Children of Kings, doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
to them a right to the Kingdom; but becauſe
the Kingdom belongs to them, the Crown which is
the Symbol thereof, cannot be denied them. So

Heaven is obtained for them by the Blood of Jeſus
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97965:81"/>
Chriſt, Baptiſm, which is the Sacrament thereof,
is adminiſtred to them. But the Promiſe of God,
for not being ſealed with the outward Sacrament,
is never the leſs true, nor leſs conſtant.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm ſucceeded Circumciſion, and cometh in
the room of it, and is of the ſame uſe to us as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
to the Jews, as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Col.</hi>
2. 11, 12. And Circumciſion was as neceſſary to
the Iſraelites, as Baptiſm is to us. But now behold
the Ordinance of Circumciſion. Gen. 17. 12. <hi>Every
Child that is eight days old, ſhall be circumciſed among
you.</hi> Luke 12. 3. <hi>In the eighth day the Fleſh of his
Foreskin ſhall be circumciſed.</hi> It was not to be done
before the eighth day; there is no exception made
in caſe of neceſſity. Yet ſhall we ſay, that if they
died before the eighth day, being uncircumciſed,
that then they were not ſaved? What a cruel Law
had that been then to limit Circumciſion to the
eighth day? <hi>David</hi>'s Child died on the ſeventh day,
and therefore before it was circumciſed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
12. 18. And yet he doth not doubt of the Child's
Salvation; <hi>verſ. 23. I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall
not come to me.</hi> Sure he doth not mean in <hi>Limbus,</hi> or
in Hell, but in the place of the Bleſſed. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs that
were not circumciſed, no doubt died in that time,
<hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. 5. And ſhall we think therefore they were
all deprived of eternal Salvation? And what became
of the other Sex, that were not capable of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
if the Sacrament of Circumciſion were
abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation? And if that was
not abſolutely neceſſary, then why is Baptiſm ſo?</p>
               <p>For if Baptiſm be ſo abſolutely neceſſary to
eternal Salvation, that all Children dying without
it, ſhould be excluded from the Grace of Chriſt,
then an infinite number of Children would meerly
periſh by the Fault or negligence of others, without
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97965:81"/>
their own. This would make the Salvation of a
Child to depend upon the Will of a Midwife. If
ſhe baptizeth the Child after his coming forth of
the Womb, behold he is ſaved; but if ſhe cruſheth
him, behold he is loſt for ever. What can be
more unreaſonable than this? Ezek. 18. 20. <hi>The
Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die; The Son ſhall not bear
the Iniquity of the Father.</hi> But if a little Child be
not baptized, this doth not come from his Fault;
and ſure he ſhall not be puniſh'd for the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of his Parents, or for want of opportunity.
When <hi>Moſes</hi> neglected to circumciſe his Son,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 4. God ſpared the Child, in that he was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
but ſought to kill <hi>Moſes</hi> for his careleſneſs in
the omiſſion.</p>
               <p>Note therefore, that when it is ſaid, <hi>Mark 16.
16. He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
It is plain from the following words, that Baptiſm
is not of the ſame neceſſity with Faith; for it is
added only, <hi>and he that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</hi>
But it is not ſaid, He that is not baptized ſhall be
damned, if ſo be he hath Faith. But that Baptiſm
is join'd to Faith in the Promiſe, it is to ſignify and
expreſs our duty of publickly teſtifying our Faith
in Chriſt, by our being baptized in his Name.
So that Baptiſm is here required only as it denotes
our external profeſſion of the Faith of Chriſt, which
is to be notified by Baptiſm, as the ſolemn and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Sign of it; Baptiſm being a Right divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
for that end.</p>
               <p>So again, when it is ſaid, <hi>Acts 2. 38. Repent, and
be baptized, for the remiſſion of Sin.</hi> And, <hi>Chap, 22.
16. Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy Sins,
calling on the Name of the Lord.</hi> It is ſo required
and expreſt, becauſe Men expreſs and teſtify their
Faith and Repentance by Baptiſm, that they may
obtain remiſſion of Sin. And 'tis by Baptiſm that God
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97965:82"/>
ſeals to them remiſſion of Sin, upon their Repentance
and Faith in Chriſt, therein teſtified and expreſs'd.
'Tis the faithful undertaking of the Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that is the condition of Salvation. And Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
it ſelf is required only as it is neceſſary to noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
and own this our Conſent and Covenant unto
others. And if we perform the Condition, the want
of the uſe of the Sign, when it doth not ariſe from
our own neglect, ſhall not hurt us.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. ſee in the former
Chapter.</p>
               <p>Obſerve only this farther, that by reaſon of the
Opinion of the abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſm to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath impowred Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives,
or any other Perſon, to adminiſter it in caſe
of peril of Death. But this Opinion being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
it is evident that that Practice is groundleſs,
it being the contempt (which is a virtual rejection of
the Chriſtian Faith) and not a bare want of it that
is damning. Moreover, it is plain, that our Saviour
hath committed the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to thoſe to whom he committed the Office of
Teaching; Matth. 28. 19, 20. <hi>Go teach all Nations,
baptizing them.</hi> But this Office was committed to
the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors in the Miniſtry, and
not to Women, to whom the Apoſtle hath prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it; therefore ſo is the adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
prohibited to them likewiſe.</p>

               <head type="sub">That after the Conſecration, there remains
no more of the Subſtance of Bread and
Wine in the Sacrament; but that there is
a Tranſubſtantiation, or a change of
the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine into the

Chriſt. Council of Trent. Seſſ. 13. chap.
4. &amp; Can. 2.</head>
               <p>THE Foundation upon which this portentous
Doctrine is built, are our Saviour's words of
Inſtitution, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 27, 28. and <hi>Luke 22. 19. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt took Bread and brake it, and gave unto them,
ſaying,</hi> This is my Body, <hi>which is given unto you; this
do in remembrance of me.</hi> Now we do not queſtion
but that our Saviour made his words good; but the
Queſtion is, In what ſenſe our Saviour's Words are
to be underſtood? whether in a literal and proper,
or in a figurative Senſe? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith,
in the literal and proper; we ſay, in the figurative
Senſe; and ſo conſequently that in them there is no
Foundation of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:97965:83"/>
Now to make this clear, we argue thus. If there
be no neceſſity to underſtand them in the ſenſe of
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> and there be a great deal of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to underſtand them in the figurative Senſe in
which we underſtand them; and that it is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
and unreaſonable to underſtand them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
then they ought to be underſtood in the
Senſe in which we underſtand them. For we ought
certainly to underſtand them in that Senſe, which it
is moſt reaſonable to underſtand them in. Now
that there is no neceſſity to underſtand them in the
Senſe of Tranſubſtantiation, and that there is a great
deal of Reaſon to underſtand them otherwiſe, may
appear by theſe following Obſervations.</p>
               <p>The Senſe in which we underſtand them, is very
agreeable to the Cuſtom, and Uſage, and Manner of
ſpeaking, which was very familiar among the
Jews, with whom ſuch figurative Expreſſions were
very common. For we have many of this ſort in
Scripture, it being uſual in the Hebrew Language to
ſay, Things are that which only thy ſignify and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent.
As, <hi>Gen. 41. 26. Joſeph</hi> tells <hi>Pharaoh, The
ſeven good Kine are ſeven Years,</hi> i. e. they ſignify and
repreſent them; <hi>And the ſeven good Ears of Corn are
ſeven Years.</hi> And ſo in the matter of the Sacraments;
as Circumciſion is called <hi>the Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17. 9.
and yet in the following Verſe is expounded to be
only the <hi>Token</hi> of it. So the Paſchal Lamb is called
the Lord's <hi>Paſſover,</hi> Exod. 12. 11. Yet by
<hi>Verſe</hi> 13. appears, as in all reaſon it was to be only
a ſign of it. So Baptiſm is called the <hi>waſhing of
Regeneration,</hi> becauſe it was the Sign and Seal of it.
And the Cup is by our Saviour called the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi>
becauſe likewiſe it was the Seal of it;
where the <hi>Cup</hi> is alſo taken for the <hi>Wine</hi> in the Cup.
Our Saviour ſpeaking of himſelf, ſaith, <hi>I am the
Door,</hi> Joh. 10. 9. and, <hi>I am the true Vine,</hi> Joh. 15. 1.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97965:83"/>
(the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have mightily trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
in it, if it had been ſaid, This is <hi>my true Body)</hi>
yet no Body takes theſe Expreſſions properly. This
manner of ſpeaking then being ſo common and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with that Nation, well may we interpret our
Saviour's words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
according to the nature of a Sacrament, and
the ſubject Matter thereof. So it is ſaid, that <hi>the
Rock</hi> which followed the Iſraelites, was Chriſt;
1 Cor. 10. 4. <hi>They drank of the Rock that followed
them, and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi> Sure there can be
no neceſſity of underſtanding our Saviour's Words
in another manner, when this form of Speech was
ſo common among them; but it is very agreeable
to underſtand them as we underſtand them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is but the ſame form of Speech which
was uſed by the Jews in celebrating the Paſſover,
which our Saviour and his Diſciples had been juſt
now about. And he inſtituted this Sacrament for
the like End, as the Paſſover had been; and it was
now for ever to ſucceed in its place. <hi>This Paſſover
is our Saviour and our Refuge,</hi> we are told, was the
form among the Jews; meaning, that it did put
them in mind, and repreſent to them the Salvation
which God wrought for their Fathers in <hi>Egypt;</hi>
and did likewiſe foreſhew the Salvation of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi>
the true Paſchal <hi>Lamb, that was to take away
the Sins of the World.</hi> And at the Paſſover, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Houſe likewiſe took Bread and brake it,
and gave it to them, ſaying, <hi>This is the Bread of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
which our Fathers ate in</hi> Egypt; not the very
Bread ſure, but only <hi>a Type or Figure of it.</hi> So our
Saviour in like manner, accommodating himſelf to
their Cuſtoms and Phraſes, uſed the very ſame Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols,
and expreſs'd himſelf accordingly, <hi>This is my
Body, which is broken for you;</hi> which our Saviour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in remembrance of himſelf ever after, in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97965:84"/>
the room of the Paſchal Lamb. Now how ſhould
we underſtand our Saviour's words then, but agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to the old form in the like caſe?</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is plain from the words themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
about the Inſtitution, that it was very <hi>Bread,</hi> of
which he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> For it is ſaid, <hi>He
took Bread, and gave Thanks, and brake it, and gave to
his Diſciples, ſaying, Take, eat, This is my Body.</hi> What he
took, he bleſſed; that which he bleſſed, he brake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that which he brake, he gave to his Diſciples:
What he gave to his Diſciples, of that he ſaid, <hi>This
is my Body.</hi> But <hi>he took Bread;</hi> therefore of the
<hi>Bread</hi> he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> And if it was Bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then it could not be his very Body, but only a
Symbol or Sign o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it, becauſe it was Bread ſtill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that it was Bread ſtill, ever after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration,
we have alſo the Apoſtle's words for it;
1 Cor.</hi> 10. 17. For we being many, are one Bread, and
one Body; for we are all partakers of that one Bread.
<hi>So that it is Bread ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they are partakers of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which was after the Conſecration. So again,</hi> Chap.
11. 26, 27, 28. As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink
this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come.
Wherefore whoſoever ſhall eat this <hi>Bread,</hi> and drink
this Cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the
Body and Blood of the Lord. But let a Man examine
himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that <hi>Bread,</hi> and drink of
that <hi>Cup. Where he calls it</hi> Bread <hi>three times, in
three Verſes together, even after the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner our Saviour ſpeaking of the Cup<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when he had ſaid, <hi>Mat. 26, 28. This is my Blood of
the New Teſtament,</hi> immediately after adds, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>unto you, I will not henceforth drink of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
Vine, until I drink it new with you in—my Father's
Kingdom.</hi> From whence it is plain, that it was
the Fruit of the Vine, and real Wine, which he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97965:84"/>
drank with his Diſciples; and that was after the
Conſecration.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine are
changed in the Sacrament, into the very ſubſtance
of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, when is it
done? Is it done before thoſe words were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd,
<hi>This is my Body?</hi> or in them? or after
them? If it was done before; When was it done?
or by what Command? or in what way? If it be
not done till after they are all pronounc'd, or till
after the word <hi>Is</hi> is pronounc'd, then it is falſe to ſay,
<hi>This</hi> is <hi>my Body,</hi> before the change is wrought;
which is not till after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the word <hi>Is</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd;
for theſe words are only declarative of
what <hi>is</hi> before, and are not imperative of what
ſhould be. And if it was not before theſe words
were pronounc'd, then a thing is pronounc'd to be,
which was not; which is a falſe Propoſition: And
if it had been intended, that the change ſhould
have been wrought by theſe words, then it ſhould
have been, <hi>Let this be my Body,</hi> or, <hi>This ſhall be my
Body,</hi> and not, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> which only declares
what a thing was before, and doth not command it
to be what it was not. So that in truth it only
means, that the Bread was ſet a-part by our Saviour
for the Sign and Token of his Body, when he bleſſed
it and gave Thanks.</p>
               <p>Again, our Saviour gave to his Diſciples his Body
as broken. But then his Body was really whole
and unbroken, for it was before his Paſſion, and it
was the Bread only that was broken. Therefore
our Saviour did not give his very Body, but the
Bread broken, only as a Symbol of his Body which
was to be broken. So that it was really Bread
which he gave, and not his very natural Body;
but the Bread as a ſign of his Body, and for that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97965:85"/>
reaſon called his Body, becauſe ſignifying it
And ſo theſe words are to be underſtood only in a
Figure.</p>
               <p>Are not theſe words to be underſtood in a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure?
1 Cor. 10. 17. <hi>For we being many, are one Bread
and one Body, for we are partakers of that one Bread:</hi>
Or are all Chriſtians turn'd into Bread firſt, and
then into the Body of Chriſt, by their being made
partakers of the Bread in the Sacrament? It is as
good an Argument to argue ſo from theſe words,
as to argue from our Saviour's, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> that
therefore the ſubſtance of the Bread is turned into
the ſubſtance of his Body.</p>
               <p>But the figurative way of ſpeaking is evident and
undeniable in the other part of the Sacrament about
the Cup, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20. And therefore why may not
we ſuppoſe the like in the former about the Body?
<hi>This Cup,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>is the New Teſtament in
my Blood, which is ſhed for you.</hi> Here is Figure upon
Figure, the Cup for the Wine: But neither Cup
nor Wine is the New Teſtament, nor yet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Blood neither, but the Seal of it. But as
our Saviour's Blood was the Seal of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of all the Promiſes and Benefits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it. So was the Wine a ſign of his Blood,
and as ſuch was given to the Diſciples, as a Seal of
the New Covenant confirmed by our Saviour's
Blood. And that this muſt be ſo, is alſo plain,
becauſe our Saviour gave it to his Diſciples as
his Blood <hi>ſhed.</hi> But his own natural Blood then
was not ſhed; unleſs they will ſay, it was ſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſuffered; for this was before his Suffering.
So that it muſt needs be underſtood only figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
that the Wine poured forth did ſignify and
repreſent the Blood of his which was ſhortly to be
ſhed for Sinners, and by which the New Teſtament
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97965:85"/>
was confirmed. And for that end, and becauſe of
the uſe of it mentioned, it has the name of the
Blood given to it, the Sign having the name of the
thing ſignified.</p>
               <p>And though it be thus only in a figurative and not
in a proper ſenſe, that we are to underſtand the
words of the Inſtitution, yet the Benefit and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the Sacrament will be nevertheleſs: For it
may be of equal efficacy and advantage to us, if we
outwardly receive only the Symbols, as if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the very Body and Blood of Chriſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
for the efficacy doth not lie in the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
but in the Bleſſing that goes along with the
Inſtitution. As the <hi>Water</hi> in Baptiſm, without a
ſubſtantial change in the Element, with the Divine
Bleſſing, is equally ſerviceable to the Ends of that
Sacrament, as if there were a ſubſtantial change.
So, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16. The Bread which we brake, is it not
the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> We may have
Communion with the Body of Chriſt, by partaking
of the Bread. As Idolaters may have fellowſhip
with Devils, by partaking of the Sacrifices offered
to them, without having the ſubſtance of the
things ſacrificed to them, turned into the ſubſtance
of Devils, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 20. So Believers may have
fellowſhip with Chriſt, by partaking of the Bread
and Wine inſtituted for that End, without having
the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine changed
into the ſubſtance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We ſee then it is highly reaſonable and neceſſary
to underſtand the words of Inſtitution, as other
figurative Expreſſions of the like nature are to be
underſtood. And there is not the leaſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
or abſurdity will follow upon it. But
to underſtand them in the ſenſe of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97965:86"/>
is highly unreaſonable, and is againſt
the being and deſign of the Scripture, and is alſo
monſtrouſly abſurd.</p>
               <p>If the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, then Chriſt
muſt be with us ſtill with his bodily Preſence, which
is againſt the whole current of Scripture; for he is
aſcended into Heaven, and therefore he is not here.
Acts 3. 21. <hi>The Heavens muſt receive, or retain him, until
the time of reſtitution of all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And how is he then
in the hands of the Prieſt? Col. 3. 1. <hi>Chriſt ſits at
the right Hand of God,</hi> and there we muſt ſeek him,
and not in the hands of a Prieſt, or upon the Altar.
For, ſaid he, <hi>John 16. 28. I leave the World, and
go to the Father.</hi> And therefore in his abſence he
promiſed the People another Comforter, who
ſhould abide with them, and ſupply his place, <hi>John</hi>
14. 10. But, <hi>Henceforth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.
5. 16. we know him no more after the Fleſh,</hi> he abiding
in us only by his Spirit, and we know him only by
Faith. We are not like the Diſciples of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

               <p>And if he be whole in every Wafer of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Which is a contradiction, for then he would have a
Body which is one, and not one, but many, as the
places are in which he wholly is. And it is againſt
the reaſoning of the Angel, <hi>Mat. 28. 5, 6. He is not
here, for he is riſen.</hi> But according to this Doctrine,
he might be there and riſen too; and then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel's

might be diſtant from himſelf, as that Body now

is at <hi>Rome,</hi> may meet that Body which is at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
and ſo it would be the ſame, and not the

not move at the ſame time, and it might be carried
and not carried; and it might be eaten and not
eaten; in one place eaten with Rats, and at another
place worſhip'd; and might be glorious and not be

               <head type="sub">That the Maſs is not only a commemoration
of the Sacrifice of the Croſs; but that
the ſelf-ſame Chriſt is therein offered,
that offered himſelf upon the Croſs; and
that this Sacrifice performed by the Prieſt,
is truly propitiatory for the Remiſſion of
Sins of the Quick and Dead. Council of
Trent, Seſſ. 22. chap. 2. Can. 1, 2, 3.</head>
               <p>THis is a conſequent of the Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation;
and the corporal Preſence of Chriſt
in the Sacrament, without which it cannot ſubſiſt.
For if the very Body of our Saviour be not ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
and properly preſent in the Sacrament, then
how can there be a proper Oblation of the Body of
Chriſt there? For how can there be a proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of that that is not properly and ſubſtantially
there? The Body of Chriſt being there in a Figure
or Repreſentation, there is a commemoration of
the Sacrifice of his Body which he offered on the
Croſs, and there is a repreſentation of the Sacrifice
of his Body made there; upon which account it
may be called a Commemorative Sacrifice. But
there being no proper or corporal Preſence of his
Body, there can be no proper Oblation of it. So
that the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation being refuted
before, this being a Conſequent of it, muſt fall
with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:97965:88"/>
There is the Sacrifice of Chriſt in a Figure indeed,
that is, there is a Repreſentation of the Sacrifice of
Chriſt, by the Bread broken, and the Wine poured
forth, which repreſents to us the breaking of his
Body, and the ſhedding of his Blood, in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
which he made of himſelf on the Croſs. So
the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 26. As often as ye eat
this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's
Death till he come.</hi> So that therein the Death of
Chriſt is ſhewed forth, and we have Communion
with him in his Benefits by an Act of Faith, when
we partake of the Symbols of his Body and Blood.
And it was for this End, for the nouriſhing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
our Faith, and the expreſſing our gratitude
to our dying Lord, by keeping up a grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his Death, that this holy Rite was
inſtituted. But read the Inſtitution entire, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.
there is not the leaſt intimation of any <hi>ſacrificial</hi>
Act there performed by our Saviour, or commanded
the Diſciples, <hi>He took Bread and brake it, and gave
it to them, ſaying, Take, eat, this is my Body, which is
given for you; Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> A Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is offered to God; but here is nothing offered
to God, but a repreſentation of that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Body that was
to be broken and offered, and the Bread diſtributed
to the Diſciples to nouriſh their Faith.</p>
               <p>And indeed that which our Saviour did then,
could not poſſibly be a propitiatory Sacrifice, unleſs
they will ſay, that Propitiation was made by Chriſt
before he ſuffered on the Croſs; for this that Chriſt
did was certainly before his Suffering. And what
need then of the following Oblation on the Croſs,
if Propitiation was made before? For what need
that be done again, that is ſufficiently done already?
So that we conclude, that there was no propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sacrifice offered in the Supper, becauſe there
was no Propitiation made before the Oblation on
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:97965:88"/>
the Croſs. And if there was no Propitiation made
in the Sacrament then, neither is there now, the
Inſtitution being always the ſame; and that only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
required to be done by the Diſciples, which was
then done and appointed by our Saviour, and for
the ſame Ends and no other.</p>
               <p>And we in many places find, that the purging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of our Sin, and our Sanctification and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the Fruit and Conſequent of Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
is entirely attributed to that offering of
the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which was made by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on the Croſs, and which was offered but once;
and that by this once offering all this was done, ſo
that there is to be no more offering then for Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26, 27. For ſuch an High Prieſt became us,
who needed not as the <hi>legal</hi> Prieſts, to offer up Sacrifices,
firſt for his own Sins, and then for the Peoples, <hi>and to
do this often, as they did it every Year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and often;</hi>
For this he did once, when he offered up himſelf. <hi>And
that</hi> once <hi>in him was ſufficient, to all the Ends of a
propitiatory Offering. Chap.</hi> 9. 12. For by his own
Blood he entred in once into the Holy Place, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd

<hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. For by one Offering he hath perfected for
ever them that are ſanctified. <hi>Therefore, ſaith God,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97965:89"/>
in conſideration of this once Offering of Chriſt,</hi>
Verſ. 17. 18. Their Sins and Iniquities will I remember
no more. Now, where Remiſſion of theſe is, there is no
more Offering for Sin. <hi>There is Faith and Repentance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
required on our part, that we may have benefit
in the Offering made; but there is no more Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Sin, that being ſufficiently done already by
Chriſt's own Offering.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that to talk of the neceſſity of more, or repeated
Offerings and Sacrifices for Propitiation, is in the
neceſſary conſtruction of the Fact, whatever is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
to impeach the once Offering of Chriſt,
which he made himſelf for us, of inſufficiency for
the Ends of Propitiation. And by this the Apoſtle
argued the inſufficiency of the legal Offerings, <hi>Heb.
10. 1, 2. For the Law having only a</hi> weak <hi>ſhadow of</hi>
good <hi>things to come, and not the very Image</hi> and ſolidity
<hi>of the things, can never with thoſe Sacrifices which they
offered Year by Year continually, make the comers thereunto
perfect,</hi> as touching remiſſion of Sin. <hi>For then
would they not have ceaſed to be offered? becauſe that the
Worſhippers once purged, ſhould have had no more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of Sins,</hi> for which there had been made ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
atonement. So that according to the Apoſtle,
the repetition and reiteration of Sacrifices, is a note
of their Imperfection. And by the ſame reaſon,
the Sacrifice of Chriſt once offered upon the Croſs
would be imperfect, if there were a neceſſity of its
being frequently offered. Which is manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all thoſe places before, which aſſert the
perfection and ſufficiency of Chriſt's one Offering
made on the Croſs.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there can be no Propitiation made by any
Offering, without the deſtruction of the Offering, in
the ſtead of him for whom the Offering is made. But
now in the Sacrifice of the Maſs there is no deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Offering, as our Adverſaries themſelves
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97965:89"/>
allow. Heb. 9. 22. <hi>Almoſt all things are by the Law
purged with Blood; and without ſhedding of Blood there
is no remiſſion.</hi> But now in the Maſs there is no ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Blood; for they ſay, That is an unbloody
Sacrifice. And how can that be a Sacrifice for Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
and Remiſſion then? An unbloody, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
Sacrifice, and yet a propitiatory Sacrifice,
cannot ſtand together, but are inconſiſtent. And the
Apoſtle argues, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 26. That it was not needful,
<hi>that Chriſt ſhould offer himſelf often, as the high Prieſt
entreth into the holy Place every Year with the Blood of
others,</hi> (quite contrary to what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
pretends, which teacheth, that Chriſt doth offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
often by the hands of the Prieſt in the Maſs, &amp; the
very ſelf-ſame Offering too that he offered himſelf
upon the Croſs) <hi>for then muſt he often have ſuffered
ſince the Foundation of the World.</hi> Offering and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
are join'd together; ſo that if there be an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
there muſt be a Suffering; and if there be no
Suffering of Chriſt in the Maſs, then there can be no
Offering. But now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Once hath he
appeared in the end of the World, to put away Sin by the
Sacrifice of himſelf. And as it is appointed to all Men
once to die, but after this the Judgment; ſo Chriſt was
once offered,</hi> when he ſuffered and died as a Sacrifice,
<hi>to bear the Sins of many; and unto them that look for
him, he ſhall appear the ſecond time without Sin,</hi> or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for Sin, <hi>unto Salvation.</hi> So that the time of
Chriſt's Suffering is paſt, and ſo therefore is the time
of his Offering, to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of
himſelf. And there is no more Offering of Chriſt
to be to the end of the World, becauſe there is no
more dying or ſuffering. The propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Maſs then is a meer vain pretence.</p>
               <p>Neither hath Chriſt inſtituted a Prieſthood upon
Earth to offer ſuch a Sacrifice as is pretended; for
he himſelf is the only Prieſt. Heb. 7. 23, 24. <hi>They
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97965:90"/>
truly</hi> (under the Law of <hi>Moſes) were many Prieſts,
becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of death.
But this Man,</hi> (Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>becauſe he continueth for
ever, hath an unchangeable Prieſthood:</hi> That is, The
Levitical Prieſts were a number of Men ſucceeding
one another; by which Succeſſion, proviſion was
made for the continuation of the Prieſthood, which
otherwiſe muſt have expired through the mortality
of the Prieſts. But Chriſt hath no Succeſſor in his
Prieſthood, which does not paſs from him to any
other (for that is the meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
here rendred unchangeable) becauſe he
himſelf is not mortal, but continueth for ever. So
that as he continues for ever, ſo he continues the
only Prieſt for ever. Verſ. 25. <hi>Wherefore he is able
alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by
him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi>
The Salvation which he works, is not by virtue of
any new Sacrifice, or the repetition of what he hath
offered, but by virtue of his Interceſſion, which is
founded upon the Sacrifice which he offered on
Earth. He ever living to make this Interceſſion,
thereby obtains and applies to us the infinite Merit
of his Death, without the repetition of the Sacrifice
for our Salvation. And it is the Spirit of Chriſt,
which he hath obtained by his Sacrifice and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
to be his Vicegerent now upon Earth in his
abſence, that by his Grace enables us to believe,
and ſo applies to us the benefit of our Saviour's
Death; without which ten thouſand Sacrifices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
would be of no value to us.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that while the Chief Prieſt
was in the Sanctuary, there was never any Sacrifice
offered, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. But now Jeſus Chriſt is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
prefigured by the Sanctuary, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. Therefore
whilſt Chriſt is in Heaven, there is no other true
and proper Sacrifice to be offered; for now the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
is ceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:97965:90"/>
The Sacrifices now are Prayers and Praiſes, which
Chriſt hath made all his People Prieſts ſo far, as to
offer theſe Spiritual Sacrifices, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 5. Rev.</hi> 1. 6.
and, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. the Sacrifice of Chriſtians conſiſts
in offering themſelves to God by an holy Life, and
not in offering Jeſus Chriſt, who having offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
over upon the Croſs, is now at the right Hand of
God, where he makes interceſſion for us, but is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more to be offered for us.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi>'s pretended Offering of Bread
and Wine, which they ſay did but typify the Offering
of Chriſt under the Species of Bread and Wine in
the Sacrament, and ſo is to be continued by it. <hi>Gen.</hi>
14. 18. 'Tis plain that he brought forth Bread and
Wine, not to offer to God, but to refreſh <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Men. What he did as a Prieſt, was in his prieſtly
bleſſing of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The Apoſtle makes not the
leaſt mention of his Offering, when he compares
him with Chriſt, but makes Chriſt to be of his Order
upon other accounts. Beſides, tho Chriſt himſelf be
a Prieſt after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> yet it is plain
before, that Chriſt had no Succeſſor in his Prieſthood,
but is the only Prieſt himſelf after this Order.</p>
               <p>From 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. it cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
that in the Sacrament there is an Altar and
Sacrifice, as there was among the Jews and Heathens,
but only that they who partake of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
have as truly Communion with him, and thereby
do teſtify their Communion with him, and owning
his Religion, as they who fed upon the Sacrifices of
the Gentiles, that were offered to Devils, did thereby
teſtify their Communion with Devils. The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
is made, not between the things themſelves,
which are in themſelves of a different Nature, but
between the Actions of the Men, and their ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the ſame in both ſides, and bears the

For this would have been the higheſt aggravation
of their Fault that could be poſſible, to carry
themſelves ſo very irreverently to their deareſt

But behold, there is nothing of all this; he only

of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is refuted before, and therefore
muſt needs fall with it; for it is upon the <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi>
of the Bread and Wine into the very Body
and Blood of Chriſt, and upon the preſumption of
whole Chriſt being there ſubſtantially preſent by
this Converſion, that the <hi>Adoration of the Hoſt</hi> is
founded by them. But if <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> be falſe,
and there be no Converſion; if the Bread be Bread

but confeſs themſelves, ſome of them, that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
that is given to it is meer down-right Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
               <p>And indeed, what is there in the Idols that the
Prophets mention, and the Character that they give
of them, but may be every way moſt aptly applied
to this God of the Papiſts?</p>
               <p>Read the Character that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 44. 9, to 20. And what is there there, that may
not with the ſame likeneſs be ſpoken of the Hoſt?
Firſt, the Country-man ſows Wheat, and reaps it,
and gathers it into Barns, and threſheth it out;
then 'tis groun'd and ſifted, and the Baker makes it
a Wafer, and bakes it, and ſome of it he puts to
other uſes; then the Prieſt Conſecrates it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it is a God. Is not this now as ſenſleſs as the
former, and juſt ſuch another deſcription as that?
And how is that an Idol then, and not this? Do not
the Reproaches and Ironies that the Holy Prophets
thrown on Idols<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fall full as heavy upon this that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

adored at the Maſs?</p>
               <p>So, <hi>Chap.</hi> 46. 1, 6, 7. ſee what he ſaith of Idols,
and how eaſily it may be applied. For this God too
may ſometimes fall to the Ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which then muſt
be ſcraped to take up all clean. Men carry it upon
their Shoulders, and ſometimes it hath been taken
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97965:92"/>
Captive. And may not one caſt the ſame kind of
Reproaches on this, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> doth on
thoſe, <hi>Jer. 10. 2, 3, 4?</hi> Surely the Prophets did
not urge the Matters pertinently, or did not foreſee
that the like might in time be caſt in the Chriſtians
Teeth for their Worſhip; or elſe if thoſe were
meet and proper Characters of the Idols then, and
the ſame agree to the Hoſt, then the Hoſt is an Idol
as well as they.</p>
               <p>So how doth the Pſalmiſt decipher the Idols of
the Heathen, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. But the
Hoſt doth not look near ſo well; it is a little Dough
made into a Wafer, the work of the Baker, that
doth not carry ſo much likeneſs to a Man, as to
have the ſimilitude of Members.</p>
               <p>This is liable alſo to the ſame Caſualties and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
as thoſe that the Prophets declaim ſo much
againſt. Theſe Wafer-Gods are not able to ſave
themſelves, they are not able to eſcape from Wars,
and Thieves and Robbers. The Prieſts make faſt
their Temples with Locks, leſt they ſhould be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.
They are liable to be gnawed upon by things
creeping out of the Earth; and when they are eaten,
they feel it not. Therefore if the Hoſt be taken by
a Mouſe, or any other Creature, and cannot be
found, then they do endeavour to take, kill, and
burn that Creature, and caſt the Aſhes under the
Altar. And if either Flies or Spiders chance to fall
into the Chalice, becauſe theſe little Creatures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
drink ſo little but they drink whole Chriſt, and
have him in their little Guts, the Prieſt muſt by all
means ſwallow down theſe Flies and Spiders, if he
can do it without danger of his Life, or fear of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting.
But whereas God doth in Scripture threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a wicked Church or Nation, that he would ſpue
them out of his Mouth; Were this Doctrine true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

like to him; nay, and not only vomit up their
God, but cauſe him to be burnt. For if the Prieſt
do vomit up the Euchariſt, and find the Species
whole, then he muſt reverently eat or ſwallow the
Vomit again; but if the Species appear no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, then he
is to burn it. In a word, this God of the Papiſts
is liable to all thoſe Abuſes that any thing in the
World can be, and yet cannot help himſelf. And
what greater Indications or Characters can there be
of an Idol than what belongs to this? And if the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of this may be excuſed from Idolatry, then why
may not the Worſhip of all others as well, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as little Godhead in the conſecrated Wafer, (as
hath been proved) as in their conſecrated Statues
and Images, and therefore Divine Worſhip belongs
to it as little.</p>
               <p>And whoſe Heart now would not riſe at this? that
a Wafer ſhould be adored and reverenced as God
himſelf, with the very ſame Worſhip? That that
muſt be worſhipped for God, which may be eaten, or
burnt, or loſt, or carried away by Mice? or muſt be
ſupported or carried about by Men, and cannot ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
it ſelf? That that is to be the Object of Divine
Worſhip, that hath neither Eyes to ſee, nor Ears to
hear, neither Senſe or Reaſon to feel or underſtand
what is done to it? Is this a God that is the work of
Mens hands, that the Plow-man ſows, and the Miller
grinds, and the Baker bakes? when of the ſame Meal
ſome may be uſed to other purpoſes, and this is by
the Prieſt made into a God to be worſhipped: Who
can think on this without exceeding horror?</p>
               <p>For ſuppoſing <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> not true, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before, then they worſhip that for Chriſt, by a
miſtaken ſuppoſition, as if it were very Chriſt, when
it is not ſo, but really the Elements of Bread and
Wine; and ſo do give that Worſhip to a Creature,
whatever their miſtaken ſuppoſition of it be, which
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97965:93"/>
is due to God alone; which is properly Idolatry.
Neither will it excuſe them to ſay, that they ſuppoſe
it to be Chriſt, and that they worſhip the Sacrament
only upon ſuch ſuppoſition, and that elſe they ſhould
not do it. For if that would excuſe their practice
from Idolatry, then it would ſerve as well to excuſe
the Idolatries of the blindeſt Heathens, and moſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Idolaters that ever were in the World; who
when they worſhipp'd the Sun or Fire, or any other
Creatures for Gods, they always did it upon this
ſuppoſition, that they were Gods, or elſe they
would not have done it neither. And if a Papiſt
ſhould happen upon a miſtake, to worſhip an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
Wafer, yet if he ſhould do it upon the
ſame ſuppoſition, it ſeems that it would excuſe him
from Idolatry alſo; which yet they themſelves will
not allow, becauſe his ſuppoſition is falſe. And if
there be no <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> ſo is theirs falſe alſo,
though the Wafer be conſecrated. And therefore
upon their own Doctrine, this ſuppoſition being
falſe, will not excuſe them from Idolatry. And it
is not their good Intention will excuſe their unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Act, no more than it did the Jews in worſhipping
the Molten Calf, when they kept <hi>a Feaſt unto the
Lord.</hi> And in crucifying the Lord of Glory, out of
ignorant Zeal which they had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. And no
more than it doth thoſe that kill the Diſciples of
Chriſt, and think that <hi>they do God ſervice</hi> therein,
<hi>John</hi> 16. 2. For to have an Action morally good,
it muſt be conformable to the Rule, both as to the
Matter and other Circumſtances, as well as the End.
And it is not a good Intention or End alone by it
ſelf, that is enough to conſtitute any Action morally
good.</p>

               <p>So, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 17. For we being many, are one Bread,

As many Grains of Corn make up one Loaf, being

               <p>As for the Maſs being a Sacrifice, and that that

We do not deny this Spiritual Communion, without
which the other is ineffectual. But our Saviour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

this repreſents his Blood, which is ſhed for many
for the Remiſſion of Sins. Now to all Chriſtian
People there belongs pardon of Sins by the Blood
of Jeſus Chriſt, and not only to the Prieſt: And
therefore all Chriſtian People are to partake of the
Cup, and not the Prieſts only. For to whom the
reaſon of the Command belongs, to all ſuch belongs
the Command. Again note, It is by the Blood of
Jeſus Chriſt ſhed and ſeparated from his Body, that
Remiſſion of Sins is obtained, of which they are to
keep up a Commemoration in the Sacrament. And
this Commemoration therefore cannot be kept up
by the uſe of the Bread alone without the Cup,
which hath a particular relation to his Blood <hi>ſhed,</hi>

Lord's Death till be come.</hi> So that they muſt drink
this Cup, as well as eat this Bread, to ſhew the
Lord's Death. This is to be done by both together,
and not by either ſingly. And all thoſe for whom
Chriſt died then, are obliged to ſhew his Death in
the Sacrament, by the uſe of the Cup, as well as by
the uſe of the Bread. But Chriſt died not only for
the Prieſts or Miniſters of the Goſpel, but alſo for
the People. And therefore this order concerns
both.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>But let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo
let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi> This
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97965:97"/>
is ſpoken to the People of <hi>Corinth;</hi> and it is plain,
from many Paſſages in this and the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that the People of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> did
drink of the Cup, and committed great exceſs in
their drinking. But notwithſtanding this Abuſe,
the Apoſtle doth not preſume to alter the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or to take it away. And what ſhall we

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> then of the preſumptuous boldneſs of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that dares to do this in manifeſt
defiance of, and open contradiction to our Saviour's
Command and Inſtitution, and without the leaſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of any good reaſon?</p>
               <p>If they ſay, whole Chriſt is contained in the
Bread: was it not ſo in the beginning of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Inſtitution, as well as now? And if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
notwithſtanding inſtituted the Cup, how do
they dare to take it away upon this vain Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if they knew better than our Saviour what
was fit to be done? This Doctrine of Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy
of the Blood with the Body, did not keep
our Saviour from inſtituting the Cup; and how
comes it to be ſo good a Reaſon now, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
what he was inſtituted? He hath appointed
different Symbols, one for his Body alone, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for his Blood, as ſhed and ſeparated from his
Body; the one to eat, and the other to drink.
And how ſhould the Bread, which is to be eaten,
which repreſents his Body without the Blood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
to us the Blood as ſhed and ſeparated from
his Body, by way of concomitancy, when they are
conſidered as aſunder? If ſo, then the Blood of
Chriſt muſt be eaten too with the Bread, but is
not drank; whereas our Saviour inſtituted the Cup
as a Symbol of his Blood ſhed, and ſo to be drank
apart, as the Symbol of it, and not eat by way of
concomitancy with the Bread, which is the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Symbol or Figure of his Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:97965:98"/>
But ſome have urged, that ſome of the Blood
may be apt to hang upon Mens <hi>Beards,</hi> and ſo be
profaned; and therefore for this reaſon the People
ought not to have the uſe of the Cup. As if there
were not <hi>Beards</hi> in our Saviour's Time alſo as well as
now; but they were new ſprung up, or new come
in faſhion in theſe latter Ages. But it ſeems our
Saviour did not conſider this very weighty Reaſon.</p>

who call the Reformation an upſtart Religion,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97965:99"/>
and ſay, that our Doctrine is new; and ſtill are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting

               <p>And the ſame Anſwer for ſubſtance will ſerve
for our Defence, that would do for theirs. For as
our Saviour ſaid to the Phariſees, Whatever they
may pretend about the Antiquity of their Religion,
the like the Jews might ſay to the Heathen, and
ſo we may ſay to the Church of <hi>Rome, That from the
beginning it was not ſo.</hi> Idolatry, and the worſhip
of Idols, was not from the beginning. So neither
was the Maſs, Purgatory, worſhip of Images, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints, believed or taught from the
beginning of Chriſtianity. But our Religion is as
ancient as Chriſtianity it ſelf, as the Jewiſh Religion
in worſhipping the True God, in oppoſition to the
Heathen Idolatry, was as old as that of <hi>Noah,</hi> or
<hi>Enoch,</hi> or <hi>Adam.</hi> For we believe and receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, but
what our Saviour and his Apoſtles taught and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the World, and what is contained in the
Ancient Creeds. But as the Worſhip of the one

in the Ancient Times, which <hi>Abraham</hi> was
raiſed up to reform; and ſo his Reformation was
new in compariſon of the Abuſes that were before.
So indeed the Reformation of the Corruptions and
Errors, which for many Ages had obtained in theſe
Weſtern Parts of the World, did not begin very
long ago. And if this be accuſed of Novelty, we
cannot help that, but are ſorry it was no ſooner.
All Reformation is new, in compariſon of the

they cannot be better without being reformed;

               <p>But were thoſe Errors or no, which the Church

Corruptions or no, which they practiſed? If they
were, as hath appeared in part before, have we
no Call to renounce Errors, or to reject Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
or muſt there never be a Reformation of
Things that are amiſs?</p>
               <p>If they ſay we ſhould have ſtay'd till the Church
had done it. If they mean by the Church, the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſee it is not done yet; and
how long then ſhould we have ſtayed? For
theſe very Things which the Reformation rejects,
are ſtill defended by her; and all the Proteſtations
and Applications that have been made to her, have
had no effect upon her to procure a Reformation
on her part; and we do not know when they will
have.</p>
               <p>But why muſt we ſtay till the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
had ordered the Reformation, (which we ſee
would have been long enough?) What is the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to us, but as a Siſter Church, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhe pretends of her Catholiciſm, and Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97965:100"/>
or Miſtresſhip over the reſt of the Churches,
which is refuted before? And what hath ſhe to
do then to control our Reformation, or to oblige us
to ſtay her leiſure? Or why have not Princes, and
National Churches in themſelves full Power and
Authority to reform what is to be reformed in their
own Precincts? We ſee what the good Kings of the
Jews, <hi>Aſa, Hezekiah, Joſiah</hi> did. And what did
we do, but what in a like caſe they did before?
And if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had had never ſo much
an Authority over us, yet if upon due Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſhe would not reform Errors, and redreſs
Abuſes, and yet theſe Errors and Abuſes be of a
moſt peſtilent and dangerous Nature to the Souls
of Men, and moſt contrary to the true Religion,
muſt we therefore perſiſt in theſe falſe Beliefs and
Practices, whilſt ſhe thinks fit to retain them? And
hazard our Eternal Salvation in rejecting Divine
Truth, and contradicting the Light of our Minds,
and the true Goſpel-Doctrine, meerly out of reſpect
to her? Or muſt we not provide for our own well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
our ſelves, without which we ſhould run the
hazard of Eternal Perdition, if others will not do
it who ought?</p>
               <p>Now this was the very Caſe: The Corruptions
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were ſo very great, both
in Faith and Worſhip, (as may appear partly by
this little Treatiſe) and were ſo very dangerous and
fatal to Mens Souls, and ſo univerſally ſpread, and ſo
ſtifly maintained, that there was no hope of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of them by that Church; but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
that was aſſembled to remove Corruptions, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them the ſtronger. Becauſe they could not be
brought to a better mind to renounce theſe Errors,
muſt we therefore continue to err for company?
Or, when we could no longer hold Communion
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97965:101"/>
with them, without having a Communion in theſe
Corruptions, had we not a juſt cauſe then of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

               <p>Jer. 51. 9. <hi>We would have healed</hi> Babylon, <hi>and

to his own Country.</hi> It is juſt the ſame in our Caſe;
we have remonſtrated to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her
Errors, and ſhe hath not reformed them; but on
the contrary, ſhe hath excommunicated and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
with Fire and Sword, thoſe that have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
the Truth; and therefore we had juſt cauſe to
abandon her Communion.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18. Wherefore come out from among

Rome, <hi>without being defiled with her Sins, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking

we were then obliged to</hi> come out of her.</p>

1 John 5. 21. <hi>Little Children, keep your ſelves

not then keep our ſelves from both?</p>
               <p>For it is in vain to pretend that their Doctrines,
that is, we ſay their Corruption is antient. This
was no warrant to the Jews formerly to follow the

               <p>If this be an Argnment againſt the Reformation,
the ſame might have been an Argument againſt
Chriſtianity it ſelf: For as ſoon as Chriſtianity ſpread
it ſelf abroad, were there not Diviſions then too

the legal Ordinances, and mixing the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Law with the Goſpel of Chriſt, with
whom the Apoſtles had great contention. Some
very famous Churches were leavened with this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
as that was which was in <hi>Galatia.</hi> Other ſtrange
Hereſies were broach'd in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and

And there ſoon aroſe many others that corrupted

Arians,</hi> &amp;c. which ſpread far and wide, and
continued a long time. Was this now a juſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
againſt Chriſtianity, that there were Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Hereſies among thoſe that profeſs'd
themſelves Chriſtians? And how comes it then to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97965:102"/>
be ſo mighty an Argument now againſt the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>We are ſorry indeed to ſee it fall out ſo, that
there ſhould be no better agreement amongſt the
Reformed, and that there ſhould any Hereſies ſpring
out of thoſe that pretend to the Reformation. But
we are not at all ſurprized at it, or moved to think
e're the worſe of the Reformation from the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe we don't agree in ſome things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves: For we are foretold that ſo it
ſhould come to paſs, <hi>Rom. 16. 17. Mark them which
cauſe Diviſions:</hi> It implies, that Diviſions there would
be. And, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 9. For there muſt be Hereſies, that
they which are approved, may be made manifeſt.</hi> Hereſies
are ſome of the <hi>Works of the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5. 20. And
therefore as long as the Fleſh is ſo predominant
with many, it is no wonder that there ſhould be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
which are the Works of it. If Chriſtianity
at firſt could not prevent it, we can have no expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the Reformation ſhould do it. 2 Pet. 2. 1.
<hi>There were falſe Prophets among the People, even as there
ſhall be falſe Teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring
in damnable Hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought
them.</hi> And they doing it privily, it may not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
diſcerned neither, till after ſome tract of time.</p>
               <p>But, ſay they, <hi>You have not the means of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, for you want a Judg of Controverſies, which is
abſolutely neceſſary in a Church, and therefore there are ſo
many Hereſies and Diviſions among you.</hi> But this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
means of Unity is refuted before in the
Chapter of the Infallibility of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
where it is proved, that there is no ſuch thing or
means appointed. We have as much the means of
Unity as the Primitive Church had, which was as
much as God thinks fit to appoint in the Church.
They had infallible Teachers to teach them the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of God; and we have the Doctrine which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97965:103"/>
was taught by theſe infallible Teachers recorded in
the Scriptures, which is of the ſame uſe to us as it
was to them. But neither they nor we have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Judg to dermine our Aſſent; nor can have,
unleſs you will put out the Eyes of humane Nature.
But every one is left to judg for himſelf, by the Rule
of the Doctrine delivered. God hath given us a
plain Rule, as hath been proved, and is ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
us with his Spirit in all things neceſſary to our
Salvation, if we be humble and teachable. And then
we ſhould do well enough without an infallible Judg.
But yet theſe means were not effectual in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church to prevent Diviſions and Hereſies,
becauſe Men did not uſe them aright (for all Men
will never be ſo ſincere, and honeſt and diligent as
they ſhould be) though they were ſufficient to have
done this, if Men had uſed them as they ought.
And therefore how can we expect now they ſhould
be of better ſucceſs?</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> indeed pretends to ſuch a
means of Unity, which we prove that Chriſt never
appointed, <hi>viz. An Infallible Judg of all Controverſies.</hi>
But then as they pretend to that which they think
is a greater means of Unity, ſo one would think that
they ſhould have a greater Unity too among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
But is it ſo indeed? Is there nothing but
Unity in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Are there no Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?
or were there never any Schiſms? Hath this
pretended Judg of Controverſies determined and
put an end to all Controverſies? No, he neither hath
done it, nor dares attempt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But we agree,</hi> ſay they, <hi>in all the fundamental Points.</hi>
In what? Is not the Doctrine of the Infallible Judg,
a fundamental Point it ſelf? And do they all agree
in that, and who this is? And if they did, ſo do we
agree in the ſame Rule of Faith, the Holy Scriptures.
And why is not our agreement in the ſame Rule of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97965:103"/>
Faith, as good as their agreement about the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Judg? <hi>But they all agree likewiſe, that Proteſtants
are in the wrong.</hi> And we all agree as much, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
are in the wrong. So that if this Point of
agreement ſignify any thing, here we are even with
them. But do they agree among themſelves in other
things? No, no more than Proteſtants do among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but have differences, the ſame, or as great as any
Proteſtants can have whatſoever they be. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the deciſions of their pretended infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Judg, they do as much differ in particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
in the ſenſe of thoſe deciſions, which are
for the determining of the ſenſe of Scriptures, as
the Proteſtants do about the ſenſe of Scripture,
without the deciſions of ſuch a determining Judg?</p>
               <p>Therefore we think it very reaſonable, that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould do as our Saviour directs,
when they cry out ſo much upon our Diviſions, that
they would <hi>firſt pull out the Beam out of their own Eyes,</hi>
and reconcile all Differences at Home; <hi>and then they
ſhall ſee the more clearly to caſt out the Mate out of their
Brother's Eye.</hi> Which they can never do, whilſt the
Beam is in their own; or at leaſt, I hope, we ſhall
never go to them to do it.</p>

Males of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to reſort three times
a Year, and there alone offer their Sacrifices and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
to God: And the Place made the Worſhip
acceptable to God, which was offered there; ſo that
the Worſhip was not ſo acceptable to God which
was performed in other places; for the Preſence of
God ſanctified the Place, and made it Holy; and that
ſanctified the Worſhip, and gave value to it, and
therefore it was more acceptably performed there
than in another Place.</p>
            <p>But now under the Goſpel there is no ſuch Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Places, becauſe there is no ſuch ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Preſence of God in one place more than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
for God's Preſence is no longer confined
to any one Place, but he equally accepts the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
that is devoutly offered him all the World
over.</p>

John 4. 21, 23, 24. <hi>Woman, believe me, the Hour
cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this Mountain, nor yet
at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>worſhip the Father,</hi> as the peculiar and
appropriate Place of his Worſhip, as if he were
more eſpecially preſent there, than in any other
Place, or would better accept the Worſhip per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
there, than in any other Place. For now
all ſuch religious diſtinction of Places for Worſhip
ſhall be taken away. <hi>But the Hour cometh, and now
is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in
Spirit and in Truth; for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him,</hi> as well in one place as another. And ſuch
devout Worſhippers ſhall be acceptable to him in
any Place.</p>
            <p>Mal. 1. 11. <hi>For from the riſing of the Sun, unto the
going down of the ſame, my Name ſhall be great among
the Gentiles; and in every Place Incenſe ſhall be offered
unto my Name, and a pure Offering;</hi> that is, inward
and ſpiritual Worſhip and Sacrifices, whereof the
Ceremonial here expreſs'd were but Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
And thus People are every where
to ſerve God, with true and oure Worſhip: For it
is the Service now that ſanctifies the Place, and not
the Place that ſanctifies the Service, as it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Jews.</p>
            <p>1 Tim. 2. 8. <hi>I will therefore that Men pray every
where, lifting up holy Hands, without wrath, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of God's audience and acceptance. For God
is every where preſent; and in whatſoever Place we
are, we are equally near unto him. 1 Cor. 10. 26.
<hi>The Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulneſs thereof.</hi> The
whole Earth, where God is called upon, is Holy
Land. St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed on the Sea-ſhore at <hi>Tyre,</hi>
Acts 21. 5.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Mat. 18. 20. Where two or three are gathered
together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi>
Every Aſſembly of Chriſtians met together in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97965:105"/>
Chriſt's Name; and according to his Will is the
Church and Houſe, and living Temple of God,
where he is preſent, which is not built with Stone
or Brick, but is made up of living Saints, the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Spirit; as the Church in the Houſe of
<hi>Nymphi,</hi> Col. 4. 5. of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> 1 Cor.
16. 19.</p>
            <p>The Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was but a Type and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of Chriſt's Body and Humane Nature, which
was the True Temple, in which the God-head
dwelt; and therefore he calls his Body the Temple;
John 2. 19. <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three days will I
raiſe it up.</hi> And therefore after the Incarnation of
Chriſt, in which the Figure and Type of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was accompliſh'd, God would no
more have a Figurative Temple. And now Chriſt
is aſcended into Heaven, there is no Temple upon
Earth, but the Saints themſelves, who are the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and who offer up ſpiritual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, which are
acceptable to God, not as performed in this and the
other place, as if they derived acceptance from the
Holineſs of any Place, but by the Offering of the
Body of Chriſt once for all, through the Eternal
Spirit, with which he ſits at the right Hand of God
in the Heavens, to make Interceſſion for us, and to
procure the acceptance of our Perſons and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
            <p>Much leſs then is there any Holineſs in Places
derived from any Saints, from whom the Popiſh
Churches yet derive their Holineſs. It was the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Preſence of God which was thought among
the Jews to render the Place Holy; for where God
is peculiarly preſent, there it is <hi>Holy Ground.</hi> But
now it is from the Saints, and the Worſhip that is
performed to them in ſuch a Place, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
that are placed there, that the Popiſh Holineſs
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97965:105"/>
of moſt of their Places is derived. And it is a
great Act of Devotion with them to go in Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
to viſit and worſhip at ſuch Places, as to our
<hi>Lady of Loretto, Montferrat,</hi> to <hi>St. Thomas</hi> at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,
St. Winifred</hi>'s <hi>Well,</hi> and ſuch-like Places.
And they think their Services performed in ſuch
Places, are very acceptable for the Place ſake. Now
if there be no appropriate Holineſs in Places with
reſpect to the Preſence of God peculiarly in them,
which renders the Worſhip acceptable: Who can
believe that the Shrines of Saints can derive any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
to the Service?</p>
            <p>Yet we do not deny, but in common decency, that
ſome peculiar Reſpect ſhould be ſhewn to ſuch Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where we ſolemnly worſhip God. But it is the
Worſhip that is there performed to God (and not
the Preſence of God, that is ſuppoſed to be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
there, more than in any other Place) that doth
ſanctify the Chriſtian Places of Worſhip, whatever
Sanctification they have. But it is not the Place that
doth ſanctify the Worſhip; as it was among the
Jews, where <hi>the Altar ſanctified the Gift,</hi> Matth. 23.

of Trent. Seſſ. 7. Can. 8.</head>
            <p>THE Sacraments are Seals of the Covenant and
Promiſe of God on his part made with Men,
which they confirm to us, upon our ſuſception or
receiving of them, and the performance of the
Condition which on our part is required, and
which we enter into a ſolemn Engagement to do,
and do make a viſible profeſſion of in them. And
it being a Covenant of free Grace, which God
makes with Man, and by which he really intends
to procure our Salvation; it muſt needs be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
by virtue of this Covenant, that God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
with Men with ſuch meaſures of his
Grace (without which in this corrupt and fallen
State we could do nothing) by which now we may
be enabled to do what on our part is required.
And upon our ſolemn engagement of our ſelves to
God in this Holy Covenant on our part, it is not
to be doubted but the Spirit of Grace ſhall be given
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97965:106"/>
to us, to enable us to perform all the Duties and
Conditions of the Covenant neceſſary to Salvation.
But the Grace which is given, is the effect of the
Spirit, and is given by virtue of the Covenant and
Promiſe. The Sacraments do no otherwiſe exhibit
it to us, than as they confirm the Covenant on
God's part, by which it is given; and aſſure this
Gift to us, upon our performance of our part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Holy Ghoſt doth call the Sacraments, Signs
and Seals of the Grace of God; as,</hi> Gen. 17. 11.
Ye ſhall circumciſe the Fleſh of the Fore-skin, and it
ſhall be <hi>a</hi> Token or Sign of the Covenant between me and
you. <hi>And,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. He, <hi>that is,</hi> Abraham, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Faith. <hi>But it cannot be any where found,
that the Sacraments are called Veſſels, containing
the Grace of God. And it was a</hi> Seal <hi>of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
made to</hi> the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he
had, yet being uncircumciſed. <hi>So that</hi> Abraham'<hi>s Faith
went before the Sacrament of Circumciſion, and
was not wrought by it. And,</hi> Verſ. 9, 10. <hi>This</hi>
Faith was reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteouſneſs; not
in Circumciſion, but in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion. That ſo (verſ.
11. <hi>believing before Circumciſion)</hi> he might be the
Father of all them that believe, though they be not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed;
but who alſo walk in the ſteps of that Faith
of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he had being yet <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Abraham</hi> believed and was juſtified before
Circumciſion, and therefore his Faith and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not wrought by the Sacrament of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;
ſo <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company received the
Holy Spirit before they were baptized. As i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
plain from the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 10. 47. <hi>Can
any Man forbid Water, that theſe ſhould not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi>
Which teacheth us, that God doth neither tie his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97965:107"/>
Grace to the outward Circumciſion, nor yet to the
Water of Baptiſm. The uſe of theſe Sacraments
was not to work that Grace which they had before,
but to be a ſolemn Engagement to them to perform
their part of the Covenant, and to confirm the
Promiſe of God to them. And therefore we find
alſo Faith required, before Baptiſm can be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred:
<hi>Acts 8. 36, 37. What doth hinder me</hi> (ſays
the Eunuch) <hi>to be baptized? And</hi> Philip <hi>ſaid, If
thou believeſt with all thine Heart, thou mayeſt.</hi> Faith
is pre-required before Baptiſm, and therefore is not
wrought by the Sacrament of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>We find indeed, that upon the ſolemn profeſſion
of their Faith, by their admiſſion of the Sacrament
of Baptiſm, there were ſometimes greater meaſures
of the Spirit poured out upon ſome, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 5, 6.
But it was in conſideration of their Faith, which
went before Baptiſm, that theſe Meaſures of the
Spirit were given to them. Their Baptiſm was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a teſtification of their Faith; Epheſ. 1. 13. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ye believed, ye were ſealed with the Holy Spirit of
Promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when Baptiſm is called the <hi>Baptiſm of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
it is not becauſe Repentance was wrought by
it; but becauſe it was a Sign and Teſtification of it,
and farther engaged to it.</p>
            <p>We therefore alſo find, that Juſtification and
Salvation are every-where in the Scripture aſcribed
to Mens Faith and Repentance; and not to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
as they would be, if the Sacraments
were the proper and immediate Cauſes of that
Grace, by which we are juſtified and ſaved. Thus,
<hi>Rom. 1. 17. The Juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> And ſo,
<hi>Gal. 2. 20. I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> And
this Faith, and ſo all Grace and Holineſs is wrought
by the Spirit, by means of the Word. Rom. 10.
17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97965:107"/>
God:</hi> And, <hi>John 3. 8. As the Wind bloweth where it
liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not
tell whence it cometh, or whither it goeth; ſo is every
one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> God oftentimes in an
imperceptible manner conferring his Grace, and not
confining it to the Sacraments: So that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
do not give, but only ſeal to us the Promiſe
of Grace and Life.</p>
            <p>1 Pet. 3. 20, 21. <hi>In the Ark of</hi> Noah, <hi>a few, that
is, eight Perſons, were ſaved by Water. The like Figure
whereunto even Baptiſm doth now ſave us.</hi> But by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
I mean, <hi>not the putting away the filth of the
Fleſh;</hi> or that the outward Act of waſhing the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſerveth to this Salvation, which God doth not
lay on any outward Ceremony, otherwiſe than as it
is an Act or Exerciſe of our Faith and Obedience.
<hi>But the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God,</hi> in
the Covenant of Baptiſm, when a Perſon being
ask'd, doth really and faithfully engage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to believe in, and give up himſelf to God
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and to renounce
the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil. <hi>Baptiſm is
but the celebration of this ſaving Covenant; and it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting
ſincerely, that is the Condition of Salvation,
and waſhing is but the Sign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As, <hi>Rom. 2. 25. Circumciſion verily profiteth, if thou
keepeſt the Law; but if thou be a breaker of the Law,
thy Circumciſion is made <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion.</hi> So it may be ſaid
of Baptiſm, with reſpect to the Goſpel. It is not
any Sacrament in it ſelf, that gives Grace or Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or acceptance with God; but thereby the
Benefits promiſed are ſealed to them that perform
the Conditions. Thus, <hi>verſ. 28, 29. He is not a Jew,</hi>
whom God will accept and juſtify, <hi>who is one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi>
only in the Ceremony; <hi>Neither is that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi>
acceptable, <hi>which is only outward in the Fleſh,</hi>
and therefore 'tis not the external Sacrament which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97965:108"/>
gives the Grace; <hi>but he is a Jew,</hi> juſtified and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of God, <hi>that is one inwardly; and Circumciſion
is that of the Heart in the Spirit, and not in the Letter</hi>
or Ceremony, <hi>whoſe Praiſe is not of Men, but of God.</hi>
The like may be ſaid of the Chriſtian and his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
So, <hi>Gal. 5. 6. For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion,</hi> nor the
outward waſhing of Baptiſm neither, <hi>but Faith
which worketh by Love.</hi> 'Tis this, and nothing elſe
that avails to the Chriſtian's Salvation. But if the
Sacraments themſelves did work Saving-Grace, the
ſame might be as well affirmed of them.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid indeed, Rom. 6. 4. <hi>We are buried with
him by Baptiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed
up from the Dead, by the Glory of the Father, even ſo we
ſhould alſo walk in Newneſs of Life.</hi> The meaning of
which is this, that we by our Baptiſm enter into a
Profeſſion, Engagement, or Undertaking, to give
over all Sin, and to live a new regenerate Life, in
conformity to the Death and Life of Chriſt. This
Profeſſion was repreſented and ſignified by their
going down into the Water, and being, as it were,
buried in it, and then riſing out of it again. It is
not Baptiſm which works this Grace of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but that proceeds from our believing, Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and hearty ſubmitting our ſelves to <hi>the form of
Doctrine delivered to us</hi> by the Spirit of Grace in the
Goſpel, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. And it is <hi>by the Spirit</hi> that we are
enabled <hi>to mortify the Deed of the Body,</hi> Rom. 8.
But Baptiſm teſtifies and repreſents our Profeſſion
and Engagement to do it.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid alſo, <hi>Gal. 3. 27. As many of you as have
been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> his Spirit
and Nature, and are become his Members. There,
being <hi>baptized into Chriſt,</hi> ſignifies thoſe that have
ſincerely conſented to that baptiſmal Covenant, of
which the outward Baptiſm was a Badg and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:97965:108"/>
It was not by virtue of their Baptiſm, but by
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of their Faith which they profeſſed in their
Baptiſm, that they became Members of Chriſt.
Verſ. 26. <hi>Ye are all the Children of God, by Faith in
Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> According to <hi>John 1. 12. To as many
as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons
of God, even to them that believed in his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, <hi>John 3. 5. Except a Man be born of Water and
the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. It is the Spirit's Regeneration which
is aſſerted, and which is only mentioned, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.
But this ſpiritual Regeneration was repreſented by
the Water of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>So, <hi>Tit. 3 5. The waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> that is,
Regeneration ſignified and ſealed in Baptiſm; or,
which is to the Soul, as a laver or waſhing is to the
Body to cleanſe it from Sin.</p>
            <p>So, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 25, 26. Chriſt loved the Church, and
gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it, and cleanſe
it, with the waſhing of Water by the Word.</hi> It is the
Regeneration it ſelf which is there intended by the
waſhing of Water, which is ſaid to be wrought by
the Word; becauſe by the means of the Word we
are cleanſed from the filth of Sin, as the filth of
the Body is cleanſed by the waſhing of Water. But
yet this Regeneration is ſignified and repreſented in
Baptiſm, and there all do make a profeſſion of it.</p>
