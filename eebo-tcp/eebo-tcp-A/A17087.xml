         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

other kinde of Ceremonies in

            <p>Now was come the .xi. day,

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to appeare before the

sayd Commissioners. They as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled
in great number to Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
Colledge: where (as we
tolde you before) they were all
lodged, geuinge attendaunce to
brynge them whether so euer it
should please them to go, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
as it became them to do.</p>
            <p>There Iohn Stokes common
Oratour of thuniuersitye, one of
the popishe supersticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for none
other but suche in those dayes
might be promoted to any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
made an oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the name
of all the rest. And whereas he
had certaine articles to entreat
vpon appoyncted to him before
by the byshop of Westchester,
and thothers, he talked muche
of thuniuersitye, muche as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng
them, and many thinges
also of the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in times past,
whyche had bene almost euerye


<pb facs="tcp:6382:14"/>
mannes matter to entreat of, in
euery oracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in euery sermon.</p>
            <p>First of all he said that thuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie,
whyche in lookinge for
theyr comming had ben a while
disquieted, beyng nowe by their
presence greatly refreshed, was
very glad to beholde theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce.
In token wherof, the
whole vniuersitye, with all her
stude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes was come out by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
to welcome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; al the hou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses
in <hi>Cambrydge</hi> with their stu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dentes
of all degrees were asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
togither in that place. For
whose certain &amp; tried good wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
in that behalfe, he durst take
vpon him as in the name of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all, to warrant theyr honoures,
that euery one of them seuerally
and al in one accorde generally,
did with earnest desire and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge


<pb facs="tcp:6382:14"/>
hartes, greatlye reioyce at
theyr comminge thyther. For
they were all fullye perswaded,
that the businesse whiche they
went in hande wyth, should be
profitable to the redresse of the
vniuersitye, and that in a matter
so necessarye to the saluacion of
all men, no trauaile nor payne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takynge
should on theyr part be
forslowed. To the confyrma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of whyche opinion, he sayde
he was able to alledge manye
proofes, howebeit he woulde let
passe all others, and touche none
but those thynges that were so
annexed to the matter that they
had in hande, as by no meanes
they might be well w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drawen or
seperated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which thinges
were in noumber certayne and
determinable, but in effecte and


<pb facs="tcp:6382:15"/>
working infinite: insomuch that
it passed any mannes power to
entreat of them at the full. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
he desyred theym to
geue him the hearing paciently,
whiles he made a bryefe dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the same. Hereupon
taking a new occasion to talke,
he began fyrste with Cardynall
Poole, saying, that he had resto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
the religion troden vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>foote,
he had vndershored the
common wealth readye to fall
downe, he had brought agayne
(as it were out of exyle) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and lawes of oure forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
well nye abolyshed and
worne out of memorye. This
<hi>Poole,</hi> this worthye Englyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
our true Moyses, was the
authour of this commission, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whose most excellent hyghnesse
as from a moost plentifull wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring


<pb facs="tcp:6382:15"/>
of all vertues, innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
commodities had flowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all partes of this his natyue
countrey. For the whyche one
bond of alyance, albeit the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
had sufficiente cause to
conceyue good opinion of hym,
forasmuch as he was of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
of the same publyke weale:
yet was there an other more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bond, whereby his grace
and they were most streytly lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
together. For the last yeare
past he had taken the same most
gently into his graces protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
assuringe by his letters, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as he
had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon him frely to kepe
it, so also woulde he mainteyne
and defend the same in such sort
that not onely thincommodities
(if there were anye that myght
hinder theyr studyes) shoulde be
remoued, but also wold further


<pb facs="tcp:6382:16"/>
them in all thinges, that myght
redound to the garnishing of the
vniuersitye, or wherby the digni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
&amp; estimacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same might
most be aduaunced or encreased
The which thing had both here
tofore established their hope, and
nowe also brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into that
beliefe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they must nedes thinke
all his graces ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlenes, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
together into this one visi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacion:

            <p>Agaynst the which wyshe foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the common vtility did
repugne, by the which the moste

For after the time that through

            <p>For nedes must that disease be

Wyth suche a kynde of dysease
the vniuersitye was striken.</p>
            <p>For whereas to other affayres

in this case of Religion (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

it hath escaped the vnauoydable
peril of hell fyre. The whych the
Uniuersitye doth nowe also
clearely see, assuredlye beleuinge
that there was neuer plague
that lyghted vpon anye place,
with the whiche this realme in

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6382:18"/>For it were a longe matter to

what commotions and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multes

the which although

for as muche as they

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6382:19"/>But by the way, if these thinges
were graunted to be the daly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

so disagreable wyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues,
that they were wrapped in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable

Whereof the first toke his begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning

            <p>The Byshoppe of Westchester,

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to obliuion for euer. Nowe
forasmuche as he was buryed
with great pompe &amp; solemnitye,
we thinke it necessarye, that his
burninge be executed with no
lesse solemnitie and furniture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6382:37"/>This assuredly is our meaning
and this toucheth al the degrees
of thuniuersitie. For it is a fowle
shame and not to be borne with,
that so great reuerence shoulde
be done vnto heretiques. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it behoueth euery man by al
meanes, to shewe euident toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

of hygh treason, it be lawfull to
atteynt a person that is dead, it
standeth with reason, that these
persons beinge more pestiferous
and hurtfull than those that are
giltye of treason, shoulde abyde
like iudgement. When they wer
buried, orations were made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the degrees of thuniuersity,
and sermons preached to the


<pb facs="tcp:6382:37"/>
people: the like thinge nowe also
when they shalbe burned, do we
purpose to haue. Nowe for by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I vnderstande that thou
art an expert oratour, and canst
handle thy selfe wel in that feat,
I would chose thee before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

I couet they preferment.</p>
            <p>There is but one in all the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity,
that when he was a yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
man was my pupill, Nic. Carre
by name, whome for the good
wil I beare him in that respect)
I wil ioine <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ellowe with thee in
this matter, to thentente thou
mayst well perceyue therby, that


<pb facs="tcp:6382:38"/>
I commit this charge vnto thee
to do the honour. The man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
this his Oracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mistrust
answered in this wise. He wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all his hart, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this case, shold
be reserued to his betters, saying
that he was not desirous of that
honour: for men would not geue
credit to his wordes, neyther
was he able to deuyse what to
saye against so worthy a person,
(inespecially that might seme to
haue any likelyhod) in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> behalfe.
For he knew not the mannes ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and conuersacion. But as
farre as he could gather bi other
mens talke, he was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of such
integritie &amp; purenesse of lyuyng,
that not euen his enemies could
fynde any thyng blame worthye
in him. As for his doctryne, it
passed his power to iudge of it,


<pb facs="tcp:6382:38"/>
howsoeuer he were demed to be
of a corrupt religion, whereof he
was not able to determine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderynge
it was a doubtfull
Question amonge so great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
clerkes. But this was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestlye
apparante, that <hi>Bucer</hi>
vndoubtedly was a man of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
knoweledge and dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
of witte: The whych for him
to abase, he thought it an vntol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
vnshamefastnesse.</p>
            <p>Finallye, for thestimacion of so
weyghty a matter it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to put some meeter persons
to the defence of it. For neyther
in yeares was he graue &amp; aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ynoughe, neyther in witte
prompte nor readye ynough, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in eloquence sufficientlye
furnished to take that matter
vppon hym. And if so be it, that


<pb facs="tcp:6382:39"/>
he were able to do anye good he
might serue their turne in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matter. The bishop was stil
more earnest vpon him, &amp; when
he sawe it auailed not to vse this
kinde of persuasion with him, he
fell into a rage, and at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed
him selfe and all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
For all this earnest entrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taunce
was not to haue had him
saye somewhat againste <hi>Buc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r,</hi>
(albeit it was part of his desyre
as occasion should serue) but to
thentent, that such as he suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igion, should speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them selues. And therfore
he added moreouer, saying: thou
at his buriall didst blaze and set
him out marueylously with epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphes
and sententious meters,
wherfore nowe also thou shalte
neyther wil nor chose, but speake
in the contrarie parte: and thys


<pb facs="tcp:6382:39"/>
to do, I streyghtlye charge thee
in mine owne name, and in the
name of my felowe Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
After many wordes, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
answered, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was
able to shewe anye thinge of his
doing, &amp; if any could be brought
before him, he would condiscend
to satisfye their pleasure: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he would not by any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
be induced to speake against
him. At length when none of his
writinges coulde be shewed, the
bishop desysted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his purpose.</p>
            <p>By this time, the sentence of

            <p>The very same daye the Uice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauncellour

he were so vnwyse to thinke it

            <p>The old man being amased, and

<hi>Ormanet,</hi> being sore

the man narowly: howe manye

being more disquieted him selfe,
he was not able to answere one

Wherfore one of the fellowes of

this moste filthye executioner of

had cast from vs both our myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

setting a fayre glosse vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al their

selues in credite with men, to
thentent that when oportunitye
should serue, they might to theyr
owne most aduauntage, deceiue
men vnwares. Surelye, they
might not in anye wise seeme to
do those thynges, whyche they
were most chiefelye bente vpon

that they should not see theym,

but they coulde not so escape vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>espyed.</p>
            <p>About this time they sent out

<pb facs="tcp:6382:50"/>
not make men to muse &amp; breake

that before theym the Colledges
of Eton and Winchester had
done the like. The cause whye
they coueted to be certifyed here
in, was for none other purpose,
but to thentent that they theym
selues myghte see, whether that
they, to whose charge the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
and administration of those
goodes was committed, hadde
behaued theym selues so truelye
and faythfullye, as by theyr othe
they were bounde to do. This
pretence made these diligent and
curyous stewardes of other
mens goods. But it was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
well ynoughe, that thys was
rather a fayned allegacion, than
a true tale. For it was their

(moued wyth these so wholsome

the common saluation of you al (

not to be committed, that beyng

that we shold do somewhat
at so earnest entreatance &amp; sute

<pb facs="tcp:6382:53"/>
But for bicause we were willing
that their defendours should be

wyth our eyes this Uniuersitye

the loue of sincere religion not

&amp; strengthened through
his continuall and daylye prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge. In so much that at suche
time as he was sodaynly taken
from vs, there was scarce anye
man that for sorowe could finde
in his hearte to beare with the

that eyther he wyshed with all

Therfore al men euidently decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
at that time both howe sore
they tooke his death to hearte,
and also, how hardly they could
away with the misture of such a
man. As long as the ardent loue
of his religion (wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we wer
inflamed) flourished, it wrought
in our hartes an incredible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of his presence amorvs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6382:75"/>But after the time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the godlye
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ceased to be any more in our

burning loue of religion by litle
&amp; litle waxed cold in our mindes
&amp; according to the times y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came
after (which were both misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
&amp; to our vtter vndoing) it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
not by litle &amp; litle to be dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,
but it altogither vanished
away and turned into nothing.
For we fel againe into the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesomnesse
of the popishe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine:
the old rites &amp; customes of
the romishe churche were resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
againe, not the garnishment
&amp; beatifiyng of the Christen reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
(as they surmised) but to
thutter defacing, violating, and
defiling of the same: Death was
sette before the eyes of suche as
perseuered in the christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrine
that they had learned before:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6382:76"/>They were banished the relame
that could not apply them selues
to the time, and do as other men
did: such as remained, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
eyther to dissemble, or to
hide theym selues and crepe into
corners, or els by drinkinge as it
wer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charmed cup of <hi>Circes,</hi>
to be turned and altered, not
onelye from the nature of man
into the nature of brute beastes,
but (that farre worse and much
more monstruous is) from the
likenesse of God and his Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
into the likenesse of deuels.
And all England was infected
with this maladye. But I wold
to God the corruption of those
tymes whyche ouerwhelmed all
the whole realme, had not at

there was not one but that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

some sorowe and calamitye pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly

the rest (of the which to entreat
this place is not appoynted, nor
the time requireth oughte to be

the Muses (which we cal thuni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersity)
may be a sufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
what we may iudge of all
the rest of the bodye. For certesse
my brethren, the thinge is not to
be dissembled that can not be
hidden. We applying our selues
to those most filthy times, haue
moste shamefullye yelded lyke
fayntharted cowardes, whyche

rather immanitie &amp; beastly cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltye:

not be so satisfyed, but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed

in euerye singular place, was
executed a singuler kinde of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie:
insomuch that there was
no kinde of cruelnesse that could
be deuised, but it was put in vre
in one place or other) This was
proper &amp; peculiar to Cambridge,
to exercise the crueltye vppon
the dead, whiche in other places


<pb facs="tcp:6382:78"/>
was extended but to the quicke.
Oxford burnt vp the right reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend

albeit they did no harme to the

no paine, neyther doth the fame
of godly persons depende vpon
the report of vulgar people, and

howe muche more gentle than

otherwise an earnest defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the popyshe doctryne?
Who agaynste his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen
let passe no crueltye,
whereby he mighte extinguyshe
wyth fyre and sword the lyghte
of the Ghospell: and yet he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
forreyners, because the
ryghte of theym is so holye, that
there was neuer nation so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
that woulde violate the

power the renoumed clerke Pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter


<pb facs="tcp:6382:81"/>
Martyr, then teachynge at
Oxforde, he would not kepe him
to punishe him, but (as I haue
heard reported) when he should
go his way, he gaue him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to beare his charges. So
that the thing which he thought
he myghte of ryghte do to his
owne countreymen, he iudged
vnlawfull to do to straungers.
And whom the lawe of God
could not withhold fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
murtheringe of his owne
countreymen, him did the lawe
of man bridle from killynge of
straungers: the which hath euer
appeased all barbarous beastly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and mitigated al crueltye.
For it is a poynte of humanitye
for man &amp; man to mete together

Now, to entreat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I say, are the iust causes which
haue so sore prouoked the wrath
of God against vs. Bicause that
in doing extreame iniurie to the

that newe kinde of wickednesse
suche as man neuer heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

happened contrary to mens

do dye. The conuersion of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers,
vnder whose yoke our nec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes

importunate crueltye of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
agaynst the Christians
which executed that wickednes
for making satisfaction wherof,
we ar gathered together thys

ensued after his death: but after
his burninge ensewed yet gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouser

and that he geueth no eare to

for whom that congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was called, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge

               <pb facs="tcp:6382:86"/>For it were more reason that he

the pith of the matter, wherein
he blamed greatlye that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
crueltye of the Courte of
Rome, so fierslye extended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the dead. He sayd it was
a more heinous matter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was
to be borne wyth, to haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
such extreame cruelnesse to
them that were aliue, but for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
man to misbehaue him selfe
in suche wise toward the deade,
was suche a thinge as had not
lightly bene heard of. Sauynge
that he affirmed this custome of
excommunicating and cursynge
of dead folks, to haue come first
from Rome. For <hi>Euagrius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
in his writinges, that
<hi>Eutichius</hi> was of the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
induced by thexample of
Iosias, who slewe the priestes
of Baall, and burnte vp the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of theym that were deade,


<pb facs="tcp:6382:87"/>
euen vpon thaltars. Whereas,
before the time of <hi>Eutichius</hi> this
kinde of punishement was wel
nere vnknowen, neyther after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vsurped of any man (that
euer he hearde of) vntill a nyne
hundred yeares after Christ.</p>
            <p>In the latter times (the whyche
how much the further they wer
from that golden age of thapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels,
so much the more they wer
corrupted) this kinde of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
beganne to creepe further.
For it is manifestlye knowen,
that Stephen the sixth Pope of
Rome, digged vp Formosus his
last predecessour in that sea, and
spoyling him of his Popes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parayle,
buried him agayne in
laye mannes apparayle (as they
call it) hauinge first cutte of and
throwen into Tyber, his twoo
fyngers, with which (according

after, Sergius the third encre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
also againste the same For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosus.
For taking vp his deade
bodye and setting it in a Popes
chayre, he caused his heade to be
smiten of, and his other thre fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to be cut from his hande,
and his body to be cast into the

why so great cruelty was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
(by the report of <hi>Nauclerꝰ</hi>)
was this: bycause that Formo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6382:88"/>This kinde of crueltye vnheard

            <p>But nowe, or euer they had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlye

it is to be wished, that seinge
it began among them, it myght
haue remayned still with thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
therof, and not haue bene
spred ouer thence vnto vs. But
such was the nature of all euell,
that it quickly passeth into exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple,
for others to do the like.</p>
            <p>For about the yere of our Lord
1400. Iohn Wicklyfe was in
lyke maner digged vp, &amp; burnte
into ashes, and throwen into a

a man a of worshipful house
bicause he had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his last

by faith in Iesus Christe, and
that there neded not the helpe of
anye man thereto, whether he
were in heauen or in earth, and
therfore bequeathed no legacye
to that purpose as all other men
were accustomed to doe. This
dede was done sithens we may
remember aboute the .xxii. yeare
of the raygne of Henry the .viii.
the yeare of our Lorde. 1530.</p>
            <p>Nowe seing they extended such
crueltie to the deade, he sayde it
was an easye matter to coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
what they would do to the
liuing. Wherof we had sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
triall by the examples of oure
owne men, these fewe yeares
past. And if we woulde take the
paynes to peruse thynges done


<pb facs="tcp:6382:89"/>
somwhat lenger ago, we might
fynde notable matters oute of
our owne Chronicles. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,
it was sufficiente for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
demonstration of that
matter, to declare the beastlye
butcherye of the Frenche kyng,
executed vpon the Waldenses,
at Cabryer, and the places nere
thereabout, by his captaine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
about the yeare of our lorde
1545. than the whiche there
was neuer thinge read of more
cruellye done, no not euen of the
barbarous Paganes. And yet
for all that when diuers hadde
shewed theyr vttermost cruelty:
both agaynste these and manye
others, they were so farre from
theyr purpose in extinguishynge
the lyght of the ghospell, whych
they endeuored to suppresse, that
it increased dayly more &amp; more.


<pb facs="tcp:6382:89"/>
The which thing Charles the .v
(than whom all christendome
had not a more prudent prince,
nor the church of Christ almoste
a sorer enemy) easely parceiued,
and therfore when he had in his
hand Luther dead, &amp; Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and Pomeran, wyth certayne
other preachers of the Ghospell
aliue, he not onelye determined
not any thing extremely against
theym, nor violated theyr gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
but also entreatinge theym
gently sente them awaye, not so
much as ones forbidding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
publishe openly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
professed. For it is the nature of
Chrystes Church, that the more
that Tyrauntes spurne against
it, the more it encreaseth and
flourysheth. A notable proofe
assuredly, of the prouidence and
pleasure of God in sowynge the


<pb facs="tcp:6382:90"/>
the Ghospell, was that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minge
of the Bohemians vnto vs, to
thentente to heare Wycklyfe, of
whom we spake before, who at
that time reade openlye at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde:
and also the going of our
men to the sayde Bohemians,
when persecution was raysed
agaynst vs. But much more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
was it, that we had seene
come to passe in these our daies:
that the Spaniardes sent for in
to this realme of purpose to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the Ghospell, as soone as
they were retourned home, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenyshed
many partes of theyr
Countreye, with the same truth
of religion, to the whych before,
they were vtter enemyes. By
the whyche examples, it myghte
euidently be perceyued, that the
Princes of this world labour in
vayne to ouerthrowe it, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe


<pb facs="tcp:6382:90"/>
howe the mercye of God
hath sowen it abrode, not onely
in those countreyes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we spake
of, but also in Fraunce, Poole,
Scotlande, and almoste all the
rest of Europe. For it is sayde,
that some partes of Italye, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe
it be vnder the Popes
nose) yet do they of late enclyne
to the knowledge of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
truth: Wherfore sufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
and profe myght be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the successe and encrease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof, to make vs beleue
that this doctryne is sent vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
heauen, vnlesse we will wilfully
be blynded. And if there were
anye that desired to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
more at large in the matter,
he myght aduisedly consider the
viage that themperour and the
Pope with bothe theyr powers
togither, made ioyntly agaynst


<pb facs="tcp:6382:91"/>
that was reported of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
<hi>zisca:</hi> who when he shold
die, willed his body to be flaine,
and of his skin to make a parch
ment to couer the heades of a
drom. For it shold come to passe,
that when his ennemies hearde
the sounde of it, they should not
be able to stand against them.</p>
            <p>The like counsell (he sayde) he
hym selfe nowe gaue theym as
concerning Bucer. That like as
the Bohemians did with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> skin
of <hi>zisca,</hi> the same should they do
with the argumentes and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of Bucer. For as soone as
the Papistes shoulde heare the
noyse of him, their gewgawes
should forth with decay. For sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
that they vsed violence to
such as withstoode theym, theyr
doctrine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned nothing that
myghte seeme to anye man (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing


<pb facs="tcp:6382:91"/>
but meane vnderstanding
in holy scripture) to be grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded

such as could not play the

them fauored of open force, and
some of ridiculous foolishenes.
For what was this firste of all?
was it not friuolous? that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
space of three yeares togyther,
masse shoulde be songe in those
places wher Bucer &amp; Phagius
rested in the lorde without anye

Neither myght he omit in

of no reputacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet was he not

            <p>Neither were diuers other mo

<pb facs="tcp:6382:93"/>
at theyr owne pleasure. In the
condemnacion of Bucer and
Phagius (to saye the truthe)
they vsed to much crueltye and
to muche violence. For howeso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
it went with the doctryne
of Bucer, certainlye they coulde
fynde nothing wherof to accuse
Phagius, in as muche as he
wrate nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came abroode
sauing a fewe thinges that he
had translated oute of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe
and Chaldye tounges,
into Latyn. After his comming
into the realme, he neuer read,
he neuer disputed, he neuer prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched,
he neuer teached. For he
deceased so sone after, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could
in that time geue no occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for
his aduersaries to take hold on,
whereby to accuse him whom
they neuer heard speak. In that
they hated Bucer so deadly, for


<pb facs="tcp:6382:93"/>
thallowable mariage of the cler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gye,
it was their owne malyce
conceyued agaynst him, &amp; a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
slaunder raised by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues.
For he had for his defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in that
matter, (ouer and besides other
helpes) the testimonie of Pope
Pius the seconde, who in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
place saieth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s priestes wiues
were taken from theym, but for
more weyghtye causes were to
be restored againe. And also the
statute of the Emperour, they
call it the <hi>Interim,</hi> by the which
it is enacted, that such of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
as were maryed should not
be diuorced from theyr wiues.
Thus turning his stile fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this
matter, to thuniuersitie, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
in fewe words their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulnesse
towards these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For if the lorde suffered not the

Amos)<note place="margin">Amos ca. 2</note> let vs assure oure selues
he will not suffer so notable a
wronge done to his godly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
vnreuenged. Afterward
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> condemnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(which we told you in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former
actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by Perne
the Uicechancellor in the name
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al) being somewhat more
moued at the matter, he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
them how much it stood
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hand, to vse great circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectnesse,
what they decreed
vpon any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their voyces in
admitting or reiecting any man
to the promotions &amp; degrees of
thuniuersity. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which should
take his authoritie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shold
be a great preiudice to al thother
multitude, which (for thopinion


<pb facs="tcp:6382:94"/>
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it had of their doctrine, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
allowance, &amp; knowledge)
did thinke nothinge but well of
them. For it wuld come to passe,
that if they would bestow their
promocions vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> none but meete
persons, &amp; let the vnmeete go as
they come, both the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welth
should receiue much commodity
&amp; profite by them, &amp; besides that
they should highlye please God.
But if they persisted to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in doing therof, they shold
greuouslye endomage the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weal, and worthely worke
theyr owne shame and reproch:
ouer and besides that they shold
greatlye offende the maiestye of
God, whose commaundemente
not to beare false witnesse, they
should in so doynge breake and
violate.</p>
            <p>In the meane while that he


<pb facs="tcp:6382:95"/>
was speaking these and many
other things before his audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
many of thuniuersitye to set out
and defend Bucer withal, beset

supplication and praiers.
