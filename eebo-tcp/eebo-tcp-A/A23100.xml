            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected certaine doctrines and Meditations, out of ſundrie works of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to mine owne priuate contentment: In time following, ſome of my learned friends, by chance peruſing and liking the order and method of them, it put me in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to make them more knowne through the Engli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of them. And honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ladie, firſt out of that Booke (vnder the name of <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) intituled of the
<pb facs="tcp:23598:3"/>
Spirit and Soule, I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mine owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, diſpoſed &amp; framed 15. portions, or particulars out of many Chapters in that booke. They are eſpeciall &amp; eaſie teachings to many, that yet know not what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are, that thereby (conſidering and beholding well of what they are made, and their ſubſtance, which is of the Soule and Body v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, and yet falling too often at variance, will not be perſwaded the one by the other) they may, feeling their owne miſerie by it, ſeek and deſire higher after many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine knowledges, which may keepe their ſoules and bodies in vnitie, and to bee at peace with God. Then
<pb facs="tcp:23598:3"/>
for the Meditations, that follow, I gathered them out of that bleſſed man his woorkes, euery where when I thought which might mooue a godly minde: not ſetting downe whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters neither, except foure or fiue, but parcels thereof: and contented partly with bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, as alſo ſome time in a chapter, meeting with the ignoraunce and corruption of that time, in praying to Saints: I left that part out, which inuocation is a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not poſſible to haue any office allowed it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer through the whole ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture: but by the large au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie thereof it is moſt forcibly extruded. And no doubt, but <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his
<pb facs="tcp:23598:4"/>
time found it ſo, <hi>lib. contra Parmenid.</hi> 2. <hi>cap</hi> 8. For he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſtian men doe togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commend themſelues in their prayers, but hee for whom none maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, but he himſelfe for all: Hee is the verie, onely and true Mediator. And ſaith <hi>Ambroſe, lib. de Iſaac &amp; anima,</hi> He is our mouth by which we ſpeake to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: our eye by which we ſee the father: our right hand by which wee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs to the father: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes then by whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, neither wee nor all the Saintes hath any thing with God. And I intend not, that theſe abſtracts out of thoſe prayers and meditations, vnto part
<pb facs="tcp:23598:4"/>
of which I haue after my iudgment, applied ſome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes out of the Pſalmes, ſhuld be vſed of any, for, or as in ſtead of their prayers, for that cannot bee, they haue beene long ſithence offered vp by that holy man, they were his owne. But now they are to be taken as moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers &amp; ſtirrers vp of others, to heauenly contemplation, contrition, and holy ſorrow. Our perfect prayer with the duties thereto belonging, riſeth of faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which commeth by hearing and reading the Scriptures, whereby tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the holy ghoſt, we are made able to ſeeke Chriſt, and ſo the inuiſible father, who is not found elſewhere,
<pb facs="tcp:23598:5"/>
but in Chriſt, that thus wee are come to haue a certaine communication with God, in which (entred into the Sanctuarie of heauen) wee haue to doe with three per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons, As <hi>Gregorie Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene</hi> vpon the Trinitie wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. I cannot (ſayeth he) thinke of one, but preſently I am compaſſed round, with the brightneſſe and glorie of three: Neither can I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of three, but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly I am brought again to one. And ſo in our prayers it is with vs. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth thus <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. God hath ſent the Spirit of his Sonne into our hearts, which crieth Abba father, which ſpirit ſo ſent, proceedeth from the Father and the Son, and ſendeth vs

forth-with to call on the Father, through his Sonne. And alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. That ſpirit in our hearts certifieth our Spirit, that wee are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. And the ſame moſt holy 3. perſons &amp; one God, keepeth ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate courſe in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that no Saint in heauen can come betweene the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt and our redeemer, to intreat him to heare vs, or to bee ioyned with him, or to bee in his ſtead for an in terceſſor: his leue and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe maketh vs worthy through his ſpirit to come to him our ſelues. As alſo that holy Spirit which is the cauſe that wee haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Scriptures, prompteth vs how to pray
<pb facs="tcp:23598:6"/>
how to edifie, and how to anſwere our aduerſaries, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible &amp; inuiſible.

ſubſtance, as ſelfe one of pure nature, for in theſe two words, as there is not vnderſtood a double ſubſtance, yet in them, there is a difference to be noted, by a double force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the ſame eſſence or be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing in a man. As thus the ſpirit is taken as the high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er, and the ſoule is taken as the lower, or inferior part. The ſoule, in that it is a liuely, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting thing, and maintaining life, in the body, is reckoned as it were the lower part. But the ſpirit in that it is ſpirituall, flyeth vp to
<pb facs="tcp:23598:42"/>
the higheſt, and is ſerued from the Soule, that it might be vnited to God: becauſe as it is written, that cleauing to God is one ſpirit with him. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that diuiſion, of the ſpirit from the ſoule, and maruailous, which bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted vp vnto the Lord, is transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Image.

And the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is the higher and purer part, is exalted
<pb facs="tcp:23598:43"/>
into excellent glory, and reioycing. My ſoule, ſaith the virgine, doth magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Lord, and my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reioyceth in God my Sauiour. Men may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, being touched by the word of God, either in their ſorrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition (being caſt downe by the power of the ſame word) or comforted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, how the ſoule and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are deuided.

               <p>THe reaſonable ſoule &amp; belonging to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Image &amp; likenes of God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creator by his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, &amp; loue him becauſe of his likenes: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of God, it hath reaſon, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his likenes it hath loue or charity, for as the creator which created ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to his own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, is charity good and iuſt, pacient &amp; méek, pure
<pb facs="tcp:23598:46"/>
and pitiful with other no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table and holy vertues read of him. So a man is created, that hée ſhould haue charity, that hée ſhould bee good and iuſt, patient and méeke, pure and pitifull. Which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, any man, by how much the more hee hath them in himſelfe, by ſo much the nearer he is to God, and beareth the greater likenes of him his Creator. But if any man, by the wrong wayes of vices, and the crooked turnings of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, doth out of kinde, wander from this moſt
<pb facs="tcp:23598:46"/>
noble likenes of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, then it ſhall become of him, as it is written, A man when hee was in honor did not vnderſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. for what greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may there bee to a man, then to bee made according to the likeneſſe of his creator, and to bee adorned with the ſame robes of vertues, that he is of whom it is reade. The Lord is King, and hath put on glerious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, &amp;c. Which is, that he is glorified with al the ſhining of vertues, and garniſhed with the honour of all goodneſſe.
<pb facs="tcp:23598:47"/>
What greater diſgrace may there be to man, or vnhappier miſery, that this glory of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor being loſt, hee ſhould ſlide and fall into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſimilitude of a bruite Beaſt.

the nobleneſſe of good conditions, and maners, and the exerciſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that when hee ſhall appeare, what he is, then hee may ſhew himſelfe, like vnto him that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailouſly made him to his likeneſſe in the firſt man, and more maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly renued him in the ſecond.</p>

               <p>WOnderfull is the fellowſhip of the fleſh and the ſoule, the breath of life, and the clay of the earth: for thus it is written, God made man of the clay of the earth, and breathed into his noſtrels, the breath of life, giuing to him ſenſe, and vnderſtanding, that by ſenſe, hée ſhould quicken the clay aſſotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him: and by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he ſhould rule
<pb facs="tcp:23598:50"/>
and gouerne it, and by that vnderſtanding, hée ſhould enter inwardly into himſelfe, and behold the wiſdome of God; and that by ſenſe, hée ſhould goe forth, and behold the workes of his wiſedome. By vnderſtanding hée hath enlightened man inwardly, and to ſenſe he hath abroad, beautified, and made things ſo faire that man might find de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and recreation in both of them: felicity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and outwardly: and abroad pleaſure and gladneſſe. But becauſe the outward good things
<pb facs="tcp:23598:51"/>
canot indure long: man is commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from them, to things inward, and from thoſe inward things, to aſcend to higher mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For, of ſo great a dignity, is the ſtate and condition of man, that no good thing, beſides the chiefe good, may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice him. It is very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, that ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe &amp; contrary things, one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, might conioine together in one. Neyther leſſe maruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous is it, that the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and liuing God, hath ioyned himſelfe to
<pb facs="tcp:23598:51"/>
our molde and clay, that God and clay ſhould bee vnited together, ſo great a highneſſe, and ſo much baſeneſſe: for nothing is higher then God, and nothing more baſe then ſlime and clay. Maruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous was the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, and maruailous the ſecond, nor leſſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous ſhall the third bée, when men, Angells, and God, ſhall bee one ſpirit. For with the ſame goodneſſe is man good, with the which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are good, and with that ſelfe goodneſſe, both, and either of them are
<pb facs="tcp:23598:52"/>
bleſſed. If ſo it bee, that both doe deſire the ſame thing, with the ſame will and the ſame ſpirite. For if God could ioyne ſuch a differing and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in nature, as is of the fleſh and ſoule, to bée of one league, confedera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy and friendſhippe, no doubt, it is as poſſible for him, to exalt and extoll a reaſonable ſpirite, to the partaking of his glory, which is brought lowe, euen to the company of an earthly body, that the ſame body being glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it may bee to it a glory, which was a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
<pb facs="tcp:23598:52"/>
yea euen to the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of thoſe bleſſed ſpirits, which haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill in their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and purity. Very certainely the moſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hath created man to that purpoſe, of his onely and méere loue, without any neceſſity, that hee might become partner of his happineſſe, If therfore ſo much ioy, and ſo great gladneſſe, is in this temporall life, which conſiſteth by the preſence and company of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in a corruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then how much more gladneſſe, and ioy
<pb facs="tcp:23598:53"/>
ſhall there be in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and euerlaſting life, which conſiſteth by the preſence of the Godhead, in a reaſonable ſpirite. Therefore let the body bee ſubiect to the ſoule, and the ſoule to GOD, and it ſhall be one ſpirite with him, ſo that it re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maine in humility, and acknowledge the grace and fauour of him the Creator of it, by whom it is to be exalted and glorified.</p>

               <p>IT is his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that wee ſhould abide in his loue, Abide you, ſaith hee, in my loue: For my loue he hath coupled man vnto him that hee ſhould haue him alwaies, and ſhould euer remaine in him, delighting, reioicing, and magnifying of him, and in him. Man is coupled by loue vnto his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: for it is the onely bond of loue, that bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them together. By

the loue of God, all of vs cleaue vnto him: by the loue of our neighbor, we are all one together, that the goodes of all ſhould become the goodes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any one hath not of himſelfe, hee ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe it by another. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and loue is the way of God to men, and the way of men to God: for through loue God came to men, hée came into men, and hee was made man. By charity and loue men loue God, they chuſe him aboue all thinges, they flie vnto

Wherefore God was made man, that hée might make bleſſed the whole man in himſelfe, and that the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of man, might be to him, and that all the loue of man ſhould bée in him.

<pb facs="tcp:23598:60"/>
Prone wee are to euill, and if the mercy of God kéepe vs not, likely we are of our ſelues to fall into euery vice: nor to riſe from them, except the mercy of God follow vs at hand, to holde vs vp. The Prophet well knew this when he ſaid, Thy mercy O Lord, is before mine eyes, which kéepeth mée, and let thy mercy follow me, that it may ſuſtaine me. Weak and vnable wee are to goodneſſe, neither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the grace of God to doe any good, or able to perſeuere in any good
<pb facs="tcp:23598:60"/>
thing. This alſo the Apoſtle did know, when he ſaide: By the grace of God I am that I am, and becauſe his grace in me is not in vame, his grace remaineth in mee. This double knowledge had <hi>Abraham</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, when he ſaide, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde I haue taken vpon me to ſpeake vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord which am but duſt and aſhes. In truth man is but duſt: for as duſt is forced about with euery winde and is caſt downe and there remaineth. So man may fall into euery vice, neither can
<pb facs="tcp:23598:61"/>
moue to riſe except the mercy of God ayde him. Alſo man is aſhes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as aſhes bringeth forth neyther budde, nor ſproute of it ſelfe, neither the receiued ſéede ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of it: So a man neither can doe good, nor remaine in any good thing, without the grace of God. Therefore wée ought to render great thankes vnto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hath granted many good things vnto vs, and many euils that wee haue done hee hath pardoned vs, and hath preſerued vs from many
<pb facs="tcp:23598:61"/>
euils, which wee might haue done, as likely as many others which wee haue committed &amp; done. for what euill ſoeuer wée haue not done, it is through his mercy that we haue not done it: for if he had ſuffered it, ſurely we had done it aſwell in déed as will. And in ſooth I do not know, whether wee ought to loue him more for thoſe thinges, which hee hath forgiuen vs, or for thoſe ſins which hée hath kept vs frée from. For although wée haue not done them, wée ought to thinke as if wée

Knowledge or learning, is when a man is inlightned by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Meditation, to the knowledge of himſelfe. Compunction, is when through the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Prayer is a deuotion of the minde, conuerting to God, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough holy and humble affection. Affection is a certaine ſelfe will, and ſwéete inclination of the mind, wholy towardes God: for there is nothing mouing God ſo much to loue and mercy, as the

pure affection of the minde. Mens natures is to loue and prayſe the knowledge of heauenly and earthly thinges. But they are much better that preferre before this knowledge, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereby to know themſelues. For truely more prayſe worthy is the ſoule, that knoweth his owne infirmity, and miſery, then it which ſearcheth the courſe of the ſtarres, and natures of things.
