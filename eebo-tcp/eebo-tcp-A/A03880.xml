            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>THE FIRST CHAPTER.</hi> Of the true state of the Question.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING already in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Treatise spoken of the written Word of God, and of all other things therunto belonging, now it remayneth we speake a litle of the vnwritten word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But to the end that the state of this controuersy may more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be vnderstood, I will heere set downe foure things diligently to be considered in this matter we treate of. The first is, that by the vnwritten Word we only vnderstand that which is not written in the old or new Testament, for of the vnwritten word of God in this sense is our whole Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy in this place. Wherefore that obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16201:3"/>
of our Aduersaries is both friuolous and nothing worth, to wit, that the word of God which we call the vnwriten word, may be found extant eyther amonge the holy Fathers, or in the books of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, or other Canons of the Church. But this nothing belongeth vnto this purpose: for it is sufficient for vs that this word of God is not written in any booke, eyther of the old or new Testament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second is that a thing may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the holy Scripture 2. wayes. The one way is implicite, that is to say, in some generall principle from whence this other may be certaynly deduced, and in this sense we acknowledge that the whole word of God is conteined in holy writ, and not only in Scripture, but also in the Apostles Creed, yea euen in that one article, <hi>I belieue the Catholike Church,</hi> so that it be diligently examined and well vnderstood, as <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Aug. in the 140. quest. vpon Exodus. Tom: 4. Matt. 22. v. 40.</note> very well noteth. For so, sayth Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the whole Law and Prophets doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon two precepts of charity, as in the same place S. <hi>Augustine</hi> noteth. For seing that the holy Scripture teacheth that we are bound to belieue the Church in all things, &amp; that it can neyther deceiue vs nor be deceiued, as we will euidently proue in the next Controuersy in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Chapter,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16201:3"/>
it consequently also teacheth the whole and entire word of God, seing that all that which is not expressed in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, is conteined expresly in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, the which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture commendeth vnto vs as infallible, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> very well sayth, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth<note place="margin">S. August: Tom. 7. contra Crescon. Grammat. c. 33. &amp; de vnie. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. c. 22. in fine. Matt. 17. v. 5. Matt. 18. v. 17. Luc. 10. v. 16.</note> in many places. For euen as God the Father comprehended in these few words (<hi>This is my wellbeloued Sonne, heare him</hi>) the whole word of God, so Christ proposed vnto vs the whole word of God, when he commaunded vs to heare the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And in this sense do the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers oftentymes say, that all the points of fayth are conteined in the holy Scriptures, to wit, in that generall principle in the which they admonish vs to belieue the Church: but many of the holy Fathers say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are falsifyed &amp; corrupted by <hi>Martinꝰ Ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius.</hi> and some <hi>Caluinists,</hi> as may be seene in <hi>Iudocus Ruesten</hi> in his first tome defending the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> against <hi>Kemnitius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Secondly a thing may be conteined in expresse words in the holy Scriptures, as that Christ is borne, suffered, and risen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine &amp;c. And in this sense we deny that the whole word of God is conteined in the Scriptures. That obiection of our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries by this may easily be answered, when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16201:4"/>
they say that we affirme, that Traditions are the vnwriten word of God, and yet we goe about to proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Scriptures. For we do not proue euery particuler Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by expresse words of Scripture, but we only deduce and gather them out of it, and conuince in generall, that there are Traditions.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The third thing which is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, is, that our Aduersaries being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced by truth, doe acknowledge that many things were deliuered vnto vs by the Apostles, besids those which are written. <q>But, say they, those were only externall rites and ceremonies, seruing only for the ornament or discipline of the Church, but nothing concerning doctrine of fayth was deliuered by the Apostles, which they haue not set downe in writing.</q> So <hi>Caluin</hi> and<note place="margin">Caluin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. 4. sess.

                  </gap>.</note> some others which follow his opinion. Wherfore it remayneth for vs to proue that not only external ceremonies, but also those which belong vnto the doctrine of fayth were deliuered vnto vs by the Apostles, and that they were neuer expressely set downe in writing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The fourth thing is, that seing our Aduersaries cannot deny that which was obiected vnto them by Catholikes, to wit, that the Scripture in many places maketh
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16201:4"/>
expresse mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word of God prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, deliuered, and diuulged ouer the whole world (as we haue already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red euen out of the holy Scriptures) they are wont to answere, that long since in the Apostles tyme this word of God was deliuered, preached, and not written, but the Apostles afterwards set downe in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the preached word of God, or at the least as much therof as was necessary vnto saluation. The which solutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> albeit it be very weake and friuolous, seing that it relyeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no sure ground, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that it may more fully be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted we will declare hereafter, that many of the chiefest points of faith were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely set downe in writing by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. And thus much of the state of this Question.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Out of the first and chiefest principles of faith, it is clearly conuinced, that there are <hi>Traditions.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE first argument wherby we proue <hi>Traditions,</hi> is taken out of some of the chiefest principles of faith. For there are three chiefe and most necessary points of faith, yea the thiefe grounds of our whole faith which are not to he found expressely in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The first, that there must needes be some Catalogue or Canon of the sacred Bookes aswell of the old as of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, the which all Christians with an assured faith should imbrace as a most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and an vndoubted truth, and this is a very necessary point of faith, yea of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth the authority of all the bookes of holy Scripture, because by this Canon the sacred and true books of Scriptures are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and made knowne from all those which be Apochriphall; especially because aswell in times past as in these our daies
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16201:5"/>
there hath byn so many, and so great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersyes about the Canonicall and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriphall bookes of Scripture; and such a Canon was altogeather necessary aswell in the auncient Church before Christ, as in our present Church after Christes tyme; the which also our Aduersaries themselues haue learned by experience. For they haue also placed their new Canon of the bookes of holy Scripture in their <hi>Confession</hi> made at<note place="margin">Confess. Rupellana. Act. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Rochell,</hi> and in the later end of some of their Bibles, and yet neyther in the tyme of the old Testament, nor in the tyme of the new Law, was this Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer written downe in the Bibles themselues.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I know our Aduersaries, that they may escape this argument, do runne to the inward instinct of the holy Ghost, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by say they, we know what booke is Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, and what is not. But this answere is refuted &amp; reiected before, where we haue shewed that the holy Ghost doth not moue vs to belieue any thing with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, which is not the word of God. If<note place="margin">Supra c. 5.</note> therfore the holy Ghost moue vs to belieue that some bookes are Canonicall, and some are not, it is necessary that this be the word of God. We aske therefore of them, whether this is the written word of God or the vnwritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if it be the written word,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16201:6"/>
in what Booke or Chapter is it to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d? if it be no where to be found, our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries must needes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, that by the instinct of the holy Ghost they also belieue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written word of God, or <hi>Traditions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The second principle of faith is, that we must necessarily, with an assured and firme faith belieue, that all those Bookes eyther of the old or of the new Testament which we now retaine, are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely deliuered vnto vs entyre and vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted through so many handes, so many ages, so many vexations and persecutions of the Christians, for otherwyse the whol credit and authority of those bookes will decay and perish. But this is no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant or written, for neyther the Prophets or Apostles haue euer written, that their bookes should neuer be falsified or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by any, yea it appeareth sufficiently<note place="margin">Supra c. 9. 10. 12. &amp; 13</note> by that which hath byn already said that they were falsified and corrupted in many bookes by the Iewes and Heretikes. Let our Aduersaries therfore tell vs where it is written, that this holy Scripture which we haue now, is not corrupted or falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.</p>

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="4">4.

For there is no Catholike nor Scholasticall Doctor<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. sess. 7. can. 2. de baptism.</note> who hath euer eyther thought or written so, yea the playne contrary is defined by the Catholike Church as a poynt of Fayth.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The sixt poynt of fayth, is that bread and wyne is only the necessary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16201:13"/>
This poynt of faith is also very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the Church, least so great and so excellent a Sacrament should be propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; yet our Aduersaries will neuer be able to proue it effectually out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture only. For by this word (<hi>Bread</hi>) any kind of meate is oftentymes signifyed in Scripture; of <hi>wine</hi> it is farre more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For the Scripture maketh only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Chalice,</hi> and not of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor which was in the <hi>Chalice;</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe acknowledgeth that<note place="margin">Luc. 22. v. 18. Calu. ibid. insua har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia. Beza Epist. 2. citata.</note> those words (<hi>of the fruite of the vyne</hi>) were spoken before the institution of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The which when <hi>Beza</hi> easily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, heere also he went about to bring in another error, least indeed he should be forced to forsake his former principle of belieuing only Scriptures. For he was not afraid to write that he erred nothing from the institution of Christ, who in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of the Eucharist should vse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of the bread appointed for that purpose, any other vsuall meate; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of the wyne any other ordinary kind of drinke, and by this meanes one may consecrate the Eucharist eyther in cheese, flesh, fish, or egges, as also in milke, water, beare, or vineger, or any other liquor
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16201:13"/>
which hitherto was neuer heard of in Gods Church. And yet for all this <hi>Beza</hi> is not ashamed to attribute this most absurd error of his to all <hi>the Scholasticall Doctors.</hi> For of both these errors he treateth in the words before alledged, because when he sayth <hi>the Scholasticall Doctors</hi> were of no other opinion, he speaketh as well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the matter of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as of the matter of <hi>Baptisme.</hi> After this manner our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries do force so many and so great errors out of that their principle of belieuing only Scriptures, wherof more might be alledged, which for breuities sake we omit.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But there is one thing I cannot let passe, because therby we clearly conuince that the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Church do not only contayne vnwritten points of fayth, but (that which is more) euen in our Aduersaries iudgment they change and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish such things as are expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in Scriptures: for euen in the Table of the Law of God, which is sayd to be written by Gods owne hand, in<note place="margin">Exod. 34. v. 1.

testimony of Scripture. The <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi> I say being also deceiued by that Common principle of our Aduersaries of blieuing only Scriptures, they go about to bring the obseruation of the Sabboth day into vse and custome agayne, and for this cause they are called <hi>Sabatharians,</hi> but not<note place="margin">Vide Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teolum V.

            <p n="2">2. Among the <hi>Grecians S. Chrysostome</hi> is the most famous, who doth not only affirme it but also manifestly proueth it out of holy Scripture. For when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth those words of the later Epistle<note place="margin">2. ad Thes. c. 1. v. 14.</note> to the Thessalonians: <hi>Therefore brethren stand and hold the Traditions which you haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether it be by word or by our Epistle,</hi> he writeth thus: <hi>Hence it appeareth,</hi> sayth <hi>S.

            <p>THE fourth argument wherby we proue <hi>Traditions,</hi> is taken out of the doctrine of our Aduersaries. For all those things which our Aduersaries do affirme to be poyntes of fayth against the Catholike doctrine, they teach and belieue them without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Scripture. For it cannot be found expressely in Scripture, that <hi>fayth only iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeh,</hi> that there are only two <hi>Sacraments</hi> of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16201:15"/>
the new law, <hi>that none should pray for the dead &amp;c.</hi> for all these things and many others which they teach against vs, they gather only out of Scriptures, and that by some false and very weake consequence; but it is no where expresly written, that fayth only iustifieth, that there are only two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, that we must not pray to Saynts or for the dead &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Moreouer there can no Catholike be found who doth not receaue and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly belieue the whole authenticall text of the holy Scripture, why do they ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemne vs, when they affirme that nothing is to be belieued besids the text of Scripture, wheras the whole Controuersy betwixt them and vs, is of the vnwritten points of fayth which, we affirme, &amp; they deny?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Aduersaries being conuinced by this argument, do now at the last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that not only that is to be admitted and belieued as the pure word of God<note place="margin">Beza de notis Eccl. pag. 137. volum. 2. Theol. Tract. edit. an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="4">4. But when they answere thus, they are forced to depart and forsake that their first principle, wherby they affirmed that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16201:16"/>
all the poynts of fayth are expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in Scriptures, and that they were set downe in writing by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Furhermore not perceauing so much, they ioyne in opinion with vs, so that they must needes indeed confesse that the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Church are altogeather necessary. For such things as are gathered out of Scriptures do rather belong to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> then to expresse Scripture. For that which only, consequently, &amp; by reasoning &amp; discoursing is gathered out of Scripture albeit it very well and necessarily may be deduced from thence, is not expressely in Scripture, but only obscurly, <hi>secretly,</hi> or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually is conteined therin. For no man can truly say, that the conclusion which is only inferred out of the premisses is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly conteyned in the same premisses, for otherwise our discourse and arguing were vayne and to no purpose. But ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we reason and discourse to the end, that, that which lyeth hidden virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the premisses may be expresly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfested in the conclusion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And that we may alleadge an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample out of the Scriptures themselues, when God the Father sayd, <hi>This is my welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 17. v. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Sonne, heare him.</hi> Out of these wordes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16201:16"/>
we may very well gather, and by a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry consequence, that the whole doctrine of Christ our Lord is to be heard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of all: yet none will say, that all the doctrine of Christ is conteyned expresly in those few wordes. And truely the holy Scripture is so fertill &amp; plentifull that many pointes of faith do as yet lye hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and vnknowne therin, which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath neuer byn gathered togeather by any, but these thinges are conteyned vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and not expressely in it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Moreouer after so many debates and contentions, after so many bookes set forth against vs, after so many slaunders wherby our Aduersaries charge vs, as though we taught that the Scriptures are imperfect, they at the last returne to our opinion. For we do not deny, yea we willingly acknowledge, that all those things which rightly and without errour are deduced or gathered out of the expresse wordes of the holy Scriptures, do belong vnto the written word of God, and are contayned in holy writ obscurely, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely, virtually, and not plainly. For in that God doth reueale any thing in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse wordes, consequently, and virtually he reuealeth all things which necessarily and without any errour may be deduced
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16201:17"/>
from thence.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We graunt also that the Scripture consequently, mediatly, &amp; virtually, as in a generall principle conteyneth all things necessary to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea in that one only article of the Creed, <hi>I belieue the holy Catholike Church;</hi> in those few words also of Christ,<note place="margin">Luc. 10. v. 16.</note> 
               <hi>he who heareth you, heareth me,</hi> if the collection be rightly framed, as we haue also said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the 25. Chapter. But when these thinges are gathered togeather which are not expressely in Scripture, there is scarse any of them which is not vncertayne &amp; doubtful without the authority and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Wherefore these col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections do manifestly conuince the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and authority of <hi>Traditions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. But that these collections may be vncertayne and deceytfull, both experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teacheth vs: experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Heresies haue had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning not from the Scripture alone in it selfe, but from these collections badly framed and made. For there is not almost any one heresy which is only grounded on the expresse wordes of Scripture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some other collection, seing that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Heretikes both in tymes past as now also go about to proue and gather their heresies from the Scripture by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne

               <hi>Gods before me,</hi> do gather but foolishly that the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne is not God, the holy Ghost is not God. So the Diuell himself against Christ<note place="margin">Matth. 4. v. 6.</note> vsed this reason, <hi>It is written, God hath giuen his Angells charge of thee,</hi> therfore cast thy selfe downe headlong. Lastly all the arguments indeed which our Aduersaries at this tyme alleadge against vs out of Scriptures, and all the errours which they haue inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do take their beginning and strength from their new illations and reasons, and not out of the bare and playne words of Scripture, as will manifestly appeare in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of the Controuersies.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The reason also is manifest why these their collections and reasons are vncertaine and doubtfull. For in nothing can one more easily or more often erre, then in these illations. The which may proceed of many causes; ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because the illation it selfe is bad and Sophisticall, or because the place of Scripture from whence it is gathered is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16201:18"/>
falsified by some false exposition therof, or because the proposition which is assumed and adioyned to the wordes of Scripture is false and ambiguous, or because one or more wordes in that collection are vsed doubtfully, that is to say, in one sense in the premises, and in another in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion; or lastly because there hapneth some errour to be in the collection which maketh it weake, Sophisticall, and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Besides that, there are so many and so contrary illations of diuers men, that the authority of the Church is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather necessary in matters of faith, that there may arise a certaine and an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted faith of these matters, of which sort Traditions are, that is to say, the doctrine of the whole Church.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But when one belieueth such an illation with a diuine or Catholike faith, he must needes know two thinges, the one is, that the expresse place of Scripture from whence this conclusion is deduced must certainly be well vnderstood by him which disputeth: the other is, that he who maketh such a deduction and colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can neyther deceiue others not be deceyued himselfe. But none can know eyther of these without the <hi>Traditions</hi> of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16201:18"/>
the Church, seeing that otherwise there is none which may not be deceiued some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes: All collections therefore which produce or breed fayth in vs, do most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuince and shew the authority and necessity of Traditions.</p>

            <p>THE fift argument wherby we proue, that many things are to be belieued which are not expressed in holy Scriptures, is taken out of the absurdities which do ensue of the contrary doctrine. For hauing once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that nothing is to be belieued which is not expressed in Scripture, all old heresies are renewed, and a great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaynty and confusion of all things is brought into the Church of God, yea euen the way to <hi>Atheisme</hi> is layd open, because hauing once reiected &amp; despised the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, all the poynts of fayth from the Apostles tyme till now explicated and proued by the auncient

            <p n="2">2. Neyther do we know by an assured Catholike fayth, whether there were euer any <hi>Fathers or Councells</hi> but by the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Church But neyther do we know any other way but by fayth, whether since the Apostles tyme till now there were any Catholikes or not? because of those things which were done since the tyme and death of the Apostles, there is nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in holy Scripture, seeing that all the bookes therof were written before the death of the Apostles. But such things as haue byn donne since till now, cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyse be knowne but by the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neyther is it sufficient to say, that we know these things by the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call histories.

cannot produce a diuine fayth in vs: this experience it selfe doth clearly teach vs. For our Aduersaries do somtymes doubt whether <hi>S.

            <p>THE first argument wherby our Aduersaries oppugne <hi>Traditions,</hi> and which they vse very often, the which also as inuincible they haue added to the confession of their<note place="margin">Rupellana confessio Artic. 5. Deut. 4. v. 2.

            <p n="2">2. But this argument is erroneous and the weaknes thereof is very great for many causes. First because in those words there is no mention made of the Scripture nor of the written word of God, but only of the word preached and deliuered <hi>viua voce. Thou shalt not add</hi> (sayth the Scripture) <hi>to the word that I speake vnto you,</hi> he doth not

Wherefore if our Aduersaries obiect against vs that we adde any thing against this precept, we may more iustly obiect vnto them, that they detract farre more then we add, seing that they neyther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the <hi>Circumcision,</hi> nor the <hi>legall Sacrifices,</hi> nor other Ceremonies which are so often and so straitely commaunded in <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</hi> It cannot truly be denyed, but that this is to detract somewhat from those thinges which <hi>Moyses</hi> commaunded; and therfore our Aduersaries must needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that these are the wordes of the old Law, and consequently to appertaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnto vs. Out of this which hath byn said, it followeth, that our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do very indiscretly &amp; foolishly boast and bragge of those wordes of <hi>Moyses.</hi> For in the exposition, thereof they erre farre from the truth, and a great deale more in the application, when they go about to proue that we are also bound and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by them.</p>

that place there is no mention made of Scripture only, but of al the word of God. And it is most true that nothing should be added to all the whole word of God, the which is to be belieued with a Catholike faith as the true word of God. For as we haue said before, our faith relyeth only of the word of God, but the Scripture only is not all the word of God, because all <hi>Traditions</hi> also which contayne poynts of faith belong therunto, as we haue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently<note place="margin">Supra. c. 2.</note> proued already. But they add to the word of God, &amp; are lyars who affirme that God sayd this, or that, which indeed he neuer spake.

               <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Wherin is examined that place of <hi>S. Pauls</hi> Epistle to the Galathians, the which our Aduersaries do obiect against Traditions.</head>
            <p>THE third argument our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries take out of the first<note place="margin">Confess. Rupell. Art. 3.</note> Chapter to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> the which they haue also added to their confession of fayth as inuincible. For they haue omitted their second argument as not strong inough for their purpose. But thus they frame their argument: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle sayth twice an <hi>Anathema</hi> to those<note place="margin">Gal. 1. v. 8. &amp; 9.</note> who teach any thing besids that which he hath taught: therefore nothing is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued or belieued but Scripture. Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries haue this place of the Apostle often in their mouthes, wherefore it shalbe examined more exactly. We answere ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that our Aduersaries do erre heere for two reasons, first because our whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy is of the written word of God, but in these words there is no mention made of the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word, or of Scripture, but only of the word preached and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16201:23"/>
               <hi>viua voce</hi> to the <hi>Galathians</hi> by <hi>S. Paul.</hi> And hence it is that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> farre otherwise<note place="margin">S. August. Tom. 7. de vnit. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. c. 24.</note> then our Aduersaries, disputing against the <hi>Donatists</hi> proueth by these words of the Apostle, that we are bound to admit and belieue the Traditions of the Church: as for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, that those who are once order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lawfully christened by <hi>Heretiks,</hi> are not to be baptized againe. And well truly; for that which is <hi>viua voce</hi> deliuered, is a <hi>Tradition,</hi> and not Scripture. Moreouer if the Scripture only conteyned expressely all the poynts of fayth, the Apostle would rather haue proposed the Scripture as the rule of faith then his owne preaching, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Scripture is manifestly well knowne to all Nations, but his owne preaching to the <hi>Galathians</hi> only. But our Aduersaries vrge againe and say, that all that which the Apostle preached to the <hi>Galathians</hi> was written eyther before that tyme or afterward by <hi>S. Paul</hi> and the other Apostles: they say this, but they proue it not. For this is no where written in holy Scripture, and so whyles they goe about to perswade vs, that all points of fayth are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they coyne &amp; inuent a new point, which is no where extant in Scripture, that is to say, that all such things as <hi>S. Paul viua voce</hi> taught the <hi>Galathians,</hi> are written.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16201:24"/>
But we following herein <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> do<note place="margin">S. Aug. Tom. 9. Tract. 96. in loan &amp; Tom. 7. de v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>itat, Eccles. c. 21. in fine.</note> gather much better by these words, and infer thus against them. If there must be nothing belieued, but that which <hi>S. Paul</hi> preached to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and that none knoweth certainly what are those things which he preached, but by the <hi>Traditions</hi> and doctrine of the Church, it followeth manifestly that besids the Scripture we must also belieue the <hi>Traditions</hi> and <hi>doctrine</hi> of the Church; seing that without them we cannot certainly and without errour know what were those things which the <hi>Apostle</hi> taught the <hi>Galathians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly our Aduersaries do erre in that they doe not rightly expound that particle in the wordes of S. <hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>praeter</hi>) (<hi>besides</hi>) but rather contrary to the Apostles meaning.

But now that this word may not only be thus vsed, but that also it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be so vnderstood and taken in this place, we haue shewed by the absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which would otherwise follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The first is that <hi>S. Paul</hi> would haue sayd <hi>Anathema</hi> to S. <hi>Iohn Euangelist,</hi> who many yeares after the preaching of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> yea after his death, wrote his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps,</hi> wherein there are many new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations which <hi>S. Paul</hi> had not preached to the <hi>Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> because they were not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reuealed by God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The second absurdity, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> had pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced an <hi>Anathema</hi> vpon all those who in his tyme by a propheticall spirit did dayly prophesy new things. For in<note place="margin">1. ad Cor. 14. v. 2. 4. 26. &amp; 30.</note> the Apostles tyme there were many such as appeareth by the first epistle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.</hi> And <hi>S. Paul</hi> could not preach to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> which God had not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The third absurdity, the Apostle
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16201:25"/>
for the same reason had pronounced <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> against <hi>S. Luke</hi> who in the <hi>Actes</hi> of the Apostles relateth many thinges which happened long after <hi>S. Paul</hi> left <hi>Galatia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The fourth absurdity, the Apostle for the same cause also had condemned himselfe with the said <hi>Anathema.</hi> For he wrote many Epistles after he had left <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,</hi> wherein he relateth many thinges which hapned afterward vnto him ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Rome,</hi> or in other places.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Lastly it is an absurd thing to think either God after those wordes of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galathians</hi> could reueale to men no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more by an Angell sent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or that the said Angell who by the commaundement of God should reueale any new thing, but not contrary to faith, should incurre that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Anathema</hi> by <hi>S. Paul,</hi> seing that this were to wrest the <hi>Anathema</hi> vpon God himselfe, who commaunded the Angell to do so. This place therfore cannot be vnderstood of diuers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct thinges from those which <hi>S. Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Galathians,</hi> but only of contrary and opposite thinges vnto them. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this sense of the word (<hi>praeter</hi>) all the foresayd Absurdities doe cease. For neyther <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in his <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> nor
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16201:26"/>
               <hi>S. Luke</hi> in the <hi>Actes of the Apostles,</hi> nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which did prophecy, nor <hi>S. Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, euer wrote or taught any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which <hi>S. Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians.</hi> But euen God himself cannot<note place="margin">Ad Hebr. 16. v. 18.</note> reueale the contrary by an Angell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause according to the Apostle, It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for God to lye.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Neyther is it sufficient for me to say that those thinges which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reuealed and written, were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary pointes of faith to saluation. For <hi>S. Paul</hi> did not say, if any shall Euangelize vnto you any point necessary to saluation: but absolutely, if any shall Euangelize any thing <hi>contrary</hi> to that which you haue recevued. Moreouer all these thinges which were afterward set downe in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture were true pointes of faith, the which euery Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is necessarily bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to belieue, if not expressely, yet at the least virtually and generally euery one is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to belieue with an assured faith all those things which are in holy Writ to be most certaine and true.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Finally euen our Aduersaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession doth conuince this to be most true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for now they acknowledge that all those thinges which by a necessary conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce are deduced out of the Scriptures do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

For the antecedent wherby some other thing may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is distinct from that which is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For it were a ridiculous illation if one and the same thing should be inferred from it selfe. But that which is inferred in a good collection is neuer contrary to the antecedent. The Apostle therefore speaketh of doctrine contrary to his, and not absolutly of any other distinct do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Wherein other obiections of our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries against Traditions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suted.</head>
            <p>THE fourth argument is deduced<note place="margin">Apoc. vlt v. 18. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. 5.</note> out of those words of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps</hi> which they also cite and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in their confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at <hi>Rochell. If any man shall adde to these things, God shall adde vpon him the plagues written in this booke.</hi> But who doth not see that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> speaketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly of the booke of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> only, and not of the whole Scripture, for he sayth, <hi>I testify to euery one hearing the words of the Prophesy of this booke, if any man sall adde to these things &amp;c.</hi> and in the 19. verse follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>If any man shall diminish of the words of the booke of this prophecy &amp;c.</hi> he speaketh ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only of the propheticall words of the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> For it is manyfest otherwise out of Ecclesiasticall histories, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> wrote his Ghospell after the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and consequently that he added many things<note place="margin">S. Hier. de script. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. in Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Apost.</note> besids the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> But let our Aduersaries take heed least they incurre those paynes which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> threatneth to those which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16201:28"/>
adde or detract any thing from the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps;</hi> seing that they so often and so bould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrest the prophesies of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> to many strange senses against the Pope and the Catholike Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Aduersaries alledge many other things, but their arguments which be of lesse moment are taken out of those places of Scripture which commend vnto vs the great excellency of holy Scripture. But all these are very easily confuted by that<note place="margin">Supra c. 25.</note> one ground, which as we haue declared before euen our Aduersaries do admit, to wit, that to the end the holy Scripture be perfect in it selfe and sufficient to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting saluation, it is not necessary that it should expresly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyne al points of fayth, but it is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that all such poynts may be deduced by a good consequence out of it. But all the Traditions of the Church which belong vnto fayth may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Supra c. 25.</note> as we haue sayd out of Scripture, the which also we declare more at large in euery one of these controuersies. Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries therfore haue not reason to say that we teach the Scripture to be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or insufficient. For as concerning this sufficiency and perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Scripture they are forced at least to yield and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe vnto our opinion herein: but these
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16201:28"/>
their arguments, whereof they make great account, we haue therfore alledged, to the end all may know how badly they interpret the holy Scriptures, and by how friuolous reason they are perswaded to forsake the Catholike fayth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But euen this sufficiency of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which they prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, they proue very foolishly by those wordes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, wherein he teacheth, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture<note place="margin">Ad Tim. 3. v. penul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> is very profitable; as though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth euery thing which is profitable for obtayning some particuler end or purpose, were also absolutely sufficient then the which nothing can be spoken more absurdly. The head truely is not only profitable, but also necessary, that a man may liue, but who I pray you will say that the head only without the rest of the body is sufficient for the lyfe of man. But to our late Aduersaries to the end they may make this their discourse or reason the stronger, say, that in humane thinges not euery thing which is profitable is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sufficient, but in diuine matters what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is profitable, is also sufficient, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto<note place="margin">Iunius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Bell. controu. 1. lib. 4. c. 10. nota 44.</note> 
               <hi>Iunius</hi> like a fine young stripling ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that this can be ouerthrowne by no sophistry. But who doth not see that the <hi>Eucharist</hi> by the diuine vertue thereof is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16201:29"/>
profitable to the obtayning of eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and yet notwithstanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Baptisme</hi> it is not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith and pennance: the same may be sayd of Baptisme and of euery booke of Scripture. Yea euen the Apostle doth not speake of the whole Scripture, as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries thinke he doth, when he saith, that euery Scripture is profitable, but of euery particuler part thereof. For how<note place="margin">S. Hier. de Script. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. in Ioan Apost. 2. ad Tim. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. v. penult.</note> could he speake of a thing which was not then extant. But as then the Ghospell of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was not yet written nor the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps. For these were after <hi>S. Pauls</hi> death written by <hi>S. Iohn:</hi> hence it is that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>S. Paul</hi> doth not say the whole Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but euen Scripture inspired by God is profitable. For there is not one parte of Scripture which is not profitable vnto vs if it be well vnderstood. Yea for all that notwithstanding euery one part precisely in it selfe abstracting from the rest of the Scripture (as all do very well know) is not sufficient.</p>
            <p n="4">4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Finally it is also to be considered that all those places wherin the integrity, perfection and vtility of the Scripture is commended vnto vs, must needes be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not of the bare wordes only, but<note place="margin">Supra c. 3.</note> of the same well and rightly vnderstood.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16201:29"/>
But this true vnderstanding of the words cannot otherwise be had then by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Supra c. 4</note> and the vnwritten doctrine of the Church it selfe, as we haue already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Wherefore all those places which do commend vnto vs the holy Scriptures, do also consequently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto vs Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and the vnwritten Word of God, seing that therein consisteth the principal part of holy Scripture, to wit, the true sense of the wordes.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Wherein is declared how we may know the Apostolicall Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</head>
            <p>AMONG the other arguments of our Aduersaries this is one that we cannot know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which are the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Apostles, seing that many Heretikes in times past pretented also that their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resyes were agreing to Apostolicall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Moreouer they obiect that <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> may easily be corrupted and changed, and for this cause, Scripture was ordayned that the doctrine deliuered by word of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16201:30"/>
mouth might continue the longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any falsification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or corruption. But we answere to this their reason: that the auncient Heretikes also by supposed and false Scriptures which they attributed falsely to the Apostles, did confirme and proue their heresies. <hi>Many thinges,</hi> saith <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">8 Aug. de Ciuit. Dei l. c. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <hi>were alleadged by heretikes as though they were the sayings of the Prophets and Apostles. But yet for all that they were not iudged to be the most certaine and Canonicall Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But the Traditions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles may so certainly and easily be known from supposed and false Traditions, as the Canonical Scriptures may be knowne from the Apocriphall, for they are both knowne by the same meanes and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that is to say, by the authority, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and testimony of the Catholike Church, which neyther can deceiue any nor be deceyued her selfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And albeit speaking of humane matters the Scripture is more certaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Tradition alone, yet it hapneth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in matters concerning God, because in these there is the authority of God, and the continuall assistance of the holy Ghost hath place, which doth not suffer the Church to erre, and hence it is, that the Tradition only of the Church which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16201:30"/>
is not so much written in paper as is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the hartes of Christians, is a most certayne, and faithfull keeper of all the<note place="margin">2. ad Cor. 3. V. 3. 4.</note> pointes of our diuine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>aith.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Moreouer, if euen Christ himself had with his owne hand writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in brasse all the pointes of our faith, they should notwithstanding not haue had so great certainty, as now Ecclesiasticall Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions haue, vnlesse the same keeper of the diuine doctrine had byn also present. For that which is imprinted in brasse, may be rased and blotted out, and the brasse it selfe may be consumed by fyre. But those thinges which are imprinted in the hartes of Christians by the holy Ghost, can neuer perish, or be any way changed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And what we haue said of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apostolicall Traditions, is to be vnderstood whether the Church assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in a generall Councel declared it so, or it became knowne and manifest by the continuall and generall custome of the whole Church. Also, whether the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion be of Tradition belonging to faith, or only belonging to rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>es<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For of the Tradition belonging to faith (that is to say, of not baptizing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine those which are baptized once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by heretikes) are these wordes of St.

               <hi>there can no example be alleadged out of Canonicall Scriptures, yet notwithstanding we hold the truth of the same holy Scriptures in this matter, when we do that which generally the whole Catholike Church holdeth, the which euen the authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themselues commend vnto vs: so as, because the holy Scripture cannot erre, whosoeuer feareth to be deceaued by the difficultie or obscurity of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, let him go to the same Church for counsell, the</hi>
