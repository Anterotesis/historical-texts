            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Draw neere, and buy sweet Milk and Honey.</l>
            <l>Have amongst you with mine Holy Water-pitcher.</l>
            <p>HEE that hath Eares to heare, let him heare: for loe, I grant most powerfull Pardons to all sort of Nations, Religions, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: <hi>Protestants, or Papists, Puritanes or Atheists,</hi> all shall be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted for ready money. And to shew that I am not minded to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son any of you; therefore, here I shall I take a large taste my selfe of such purgatory stuffe, as I am to deliver unto every one of you: &amp; so (in conceit) swallow over mine own pardon, which I brought with me in a boxe from <hi>Rome.</hi> To wit, although I begui<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Now come apace, both <hi>papist, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, and Atheist,</hi> young and old, whatsoever, come with courage, for I refuse no sort of money: and you shall understand, that these my pardons are not altogether popish: for the Pope granteth pardons to none except the money be presently laid down: but as for my selfe, I will trust any one a pardon as long time as he will grant to hold his finger in the fire. Yea, I will be kinder yet: whosoever hath no mony to buy his pardon I will freely give it him for his coat.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I must of force grant pardons unto all those men who have wicked wives, yea, without rehearsing their faults whatsoever. And more then that, suppose I should never looke the Pope in the face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, yet I absolutely absolve the aforesaid persons from any other purgatory than that which they suffer here in the company of an ill wife.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let <hi>Demas also come, and receive his pardon for two pence; for although he thought to win a world of Goods by preaching the Gospell,</hi>

                           <head>A Popish Relation.</head>
                           <p>VVHen <hi>Christ</hi> walked on earth with his Disciples, <hi>Peter, Iohn, Iames,</hi> &amp; the rest they passing by a little Village (say they) they heard two women, as they thought, scolding together at the speed, with many faire <hi>Curses, Malisons &amp; vengeances.</hi> So that Christ said to <hi>Peter,</hi> Goe thou to yonder couple, while I tarry here, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them in my name, to leave flyting, banning, and swearing.</p>
                           <p>Now mine Author saith, that it was the Divell and a woman fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, to exercise themselves, even because she had hired him
<pb facs="tcp:94301:4"/>
to teach her to out-scold all her Neighbors. But when <hi>Peter</hi> came and preached unto them, they defyed him, &amp; spat upon him: so that <hi>Peter</hi> being wrathfull, drew his sword, and cut off both their heads, &amp; went and told his Master what had hapned. Whereat Christ being offended, said unto <hi>Peter, thou hast done wickedly to slay those poore Creatures in their sinnes: therefore goe thou back unto them, and I will give thee power and commandement, to set their heads on againe, that they may repent, and be saved.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Then <hi>Peter</hi> running in his hasty anger, tooke up the womans head and set it upon the Divell, and set the Divels head upon the woman: and, as I thinke, there it remaineth yet; for surely it must needs be a Divels head, which hath such an evill tongue within it, as surpasseth the Stings of Asps and Adders: yea, curseth all her kindred, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth her husband the Countrey. Then with what reason can you blame our women to cover such heads as those? You know, that who so hath but the least blemish or Scar of a Wen, Mole, or Wart, will strive to hide it. And thinke ye it then unlalwfull for a woman to hide that ugly Blemish, even Satans head, standing upon the shoulders of our dainty Dames, as well as upon our grosse <hi>Kichin-stuffe,</hi> and upon tripping minsing Mistresse, as well as upon Meg with the Mealie mouth? I deny not indeed, but that it was a custome in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, for the Whores to cover themselves with Vailes, sitting by the <hi>High-wayes,</hi> that thereby they might be knowne to be of that light Occupation. But this was far from any custome of honest Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, howsoever both Ginny and my Lady are now alike muzzeled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their snouts, so that even honesty it selfe cryeth, Fye for shame, upon them. Yet, I say they shall be pardoned for the causes before mentioned. And because it is said, that this whorish sort of covered heads and faces, is most usuall in our <hi>Brittanian North,</hi> therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin first to prepare your Pardons, wishing you also to prepare mony, for indeed yours is a cold Soyle, and who dare forbid you therefore to be <hi>covered? A certaine English-man saith, that Pope Ioanna had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Divels head on her shoulders, and that all the Popes ever since have bin of her brood, even because (saith he) they were all womanly and divellish.</hi>

The <hi>Corn-mongers,</hi> and <hi>Fore-stallers</hi> of the Markets, must not here be neglected: but yet I bid them take heed, that they follow not the example of their Fore-fathers too much: whereof some have hanged themselves, some drowned themselves, &amp; other some cut their owne throats. Amongst whom, I must needs here tell you of one, who having abundance of Corne and Meale, even in the time of extreame Dearth, yea, and of Famine saith mine Author, yet still and still kept up his victuals, in hope that the prices would grow higher, and higher yet. But, as God would, the prices came downe, and the Corn grew so cheap, that this jolly Marchant went to buy a roap to hang himfelfe: but comming to the Roapers shop, his greedy sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack would but serve him to give a groat for a Roape, whereas the Roaper would not sell it under 6 <hi>pence:</hi> so that he thought in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that in a short time the prices of roaps would come downe, as the corne had done, so that he hoped to buy a sixpeny rope for two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and then to hang himselfe good cheape.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Let the <hi>point-makers, and Button-makers,</hi> then draw neare, and receive their conjunct pardon, not each for <hi>two pence,</hi> but the one for as many points, as will goe round about the <hi>knees of my breeches</hi> in pompe, and the other as many buttons; for though I need them not now, yet J know not how soone.</p>

And of force I must also pardon the pretty <hi>Pin-maker,</hi> &amp; that for a paper of pins to my wife: alwayes, I pray thee beware, that they be good indeed with faire heads, and fast set on: or else; I assure thee, she will not sticke to curse both thee, who made them, and mee who brought her them.</p>

            <p n="14">14. Here now I grant a pardon to a loving woman, who gave a discreet answer, when she was asked if her husband was hang'd, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>He was hang'd once, but now he is not:</l>
               <l>In spite of his Foes, his Friends did ease that.</l>
               <l>For my dearest Love had not hung houres twaine,</l>
               <l>But I got his pardon, and cut him downe againe.</l>
            </lg>
            <p n="15">15. Now at the last, I must also give a pardon to an holy Priest, who was clowting of his shooes when his Neighbors called upon him, to goe quickly (before another came) and win money, to bring a dead Corps to the grave: and he being in such haste, could not find his knife to cut away the Lingell, but let it traile after him to the church, and sung this holy Quire-song the space of a mile, betwixt the house and the grave, with many repetitions, as followeth:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Yee that follow mee behind,</l>
               <l>Tread not on my Lingels end,</l>

               <head>A Tale of the Popes Consecration.</head>
               <p>MOST of all to be accounted, is that holy and miraculous Stoole at <hi>Rome,</hi> saith one, wherewith they chuse the Pope, and prove him to be a Man, not a Woman; for he that is chosen to be Pope, on the day of election, is set in this stoole, and a Cardinall standing on either side, they strip up their sleeves, and with their naked hands and armes, feele from under the stoole, whether it be a Man or a Woman, and so give <hi>Declaration</hi> unto the whole rabble there conveened,</p>
               <p>And this hath bin their Custome ever since the English-woman beguiled them, who was their Pope, about the space of 3 yeares, even Successor to <hi>Leo</hi> the 4. <hi>Anno</hi> 852.</p>
