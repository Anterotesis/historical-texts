         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DECLARATION AND MOTIVE Of the Perſons truſted, uſually meeting at Salters Hall in BREADSTREET, to all well affected perſons in the ſeverall Pariſhes within LONDON, and the parts adjacent, for Contributing the value of a Meale weekly, towards the forming of ſome Regiments of Voluntiers, to be payd during theſe times of Danger.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas for better preſervation and ſafeguard of the City, againſt the continued deſperate practiſes, and wretched deſignes of the many Adverſaries of the Peace thereof, viſible to every eye not wilfully blinded: The Committee for the Cities <hi>Militia,</hi> mindfull by all good wayes and meanes, of diſchargeing the truſt in them repoſed, have by the labour and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſome truſted Perſons, in nature of a Sub-Committee, by them authorized for that purpoſe, brought neere unto a readinefſe of Liſting and forming divers Regiments of Horſe and Foot, compounded and made up of honeſt and well-affected Perſons, Reſiants in the City and Neighbourhood thereof, under command of known and truſtie Officers, which new Regiments are to be as Auxiliaries to the Trained Bands, and to be uſed for defence of Parliament, Citie, and parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, as occaſion ſhall require: And whereas for proviſion of Horſe and Arms, weekly diſciplining of ſo great liſted num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and for defraying of other Charges incident to a ſervice of this nature, and neceſſary for the carrying on and perfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this great Worke, ſo much concerning the preſervation of this place, and therein the ſafety and well-being of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and the whole State, ſome courſe muſt needs be held; and yet that the ſame may be with the leaſt trouble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencie that may bee, and with all poſsible eaſe and indifferency; reſpect being had to the many burdens incumbent upon this City and disburſements of the ſame: It is therefore upon due conſideration had of the premiſſes propounded, and as a fit way to effect in ſome good meaſure the aforementioned good intendments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by direction and advice of the ſaid Sub-Committee, and divers Reverend Divines, and other worthy Perſons knowne well-willers and actors for the publike; as their joynt ſuite and hearty requeſt to all well-affected Perſons and Families of the Citie, Suburbs, and parts adjacent, recommended and deſired; That du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe times of imminent and evident dangers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all ſuch Perſons and Families ſenſible of the premiſſes, and willing to promote their own ſafety, and the meanes thereof, will according to the preſident begun by thoſe who recommend this, be pleaſed every of them to abſtaine and forbeare ſome one Meale in the Weeke, and on every <hi>Munday</hi> (the firſt payment beginning on Munday next the eigth of this inſtant <hi>May)</hi> pay and deliver the true value thereof, to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors nominated for their ſeverall Precincts, who are to pay over the ſame to Treaſurers eſpecially entruſted therewith, of whoſe accounts and disburſements for the ends aforeſaid, exact care will be taken, which in all probability will be a good way without burden or difficulty to advance weekly conſiderable ſummes for theſe good uſes. And although this be not impoſed but deſired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and expected as a free will offering to helpe on ſo good a Worke, yet it is hoped that none will oppoſe it, who are ſenſible of their owne danger, and love their ſafeties, eſpecially if they conſider (amongſt many other weighty Reaſons which might be rendred.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all of every condition are concerned in the Danger, and by Gods blesſing in the Deliverance and therfore all ought to contribute their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards their juſt defence, poore aſwell as rich being able to allow their ſhares herein, for that in effect it takes nothing from their purſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This being no Faſt properly ſo called, but a Meales voluntary abſtinence once a weeke, is no more then what we do each weeke commonly undergo, by reaſon of our other worldly imployments; and therefore ſuch an abſtinence for ſo good a purpoſe, ſhould not be thought too ſtrict a performance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is nothing more equall, or can leſſe be expected, then that reaſonable proviſion ſhould be made for them, that under God are likely to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of ſo great a good for us, and are to expoſe their lives to the utmoſt hazards for defence of us and ours. We adde no other reaſons drawn from policie, as the feared Famine, ſaving of Victualls, or the like (which with prudent men, and as theſe times are will bee of no ſmall conſideration) but we conclude with this, that the end of our eating and drinking is but to ſupport and preſerve our naturall lives, and the end of this abſtinence is not onely to preſerve our lives and theirs alſo who adventure for us, but to preſerve to us and them and our poſterities, what ſhould be more deare then all our lives, even Religion (the life of our lives) and our Laws and Liberties, which no good man will willingly ſurvive, nor wiſe man doubt, but that they are ſufficiently endangered, if not lie a bleeding; and if the Parliament and this Citie (the great maintainers of them) ſhould miſcarry (which God forbid) to all humane judgement are quite loſt. It will be therefore our wiſdome before God and man, and our duty too (as we conceive) to further this, and all other good ſuggeſted wayes, tending to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them. And ſo we leave the deſigne to Gods bleſſing, and the conſideration of all ſuch as hereof are made partakers, and are alike with us concerned in the common ſafety.</p>
