            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>§. 1. THE Church is a Body or ſociety of men ſeparated from the reſt of the
World, and united to God and to themſelves by a Divine Covenant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> He ſaith this is the plaineſt deſcription he can give:
That is not the fault of his Auditors or Readers. 1. As to the <hi>Genus,</hi> a
Community of equals without Rulers is a body: but I ſuppoſe he meaneth
not ſuch. 2. Is it enough that it be of <hi>Men?</hi> ſure now they ſhould be
<hi>Chriſtians?</hi> 3. Many are <hi>ſeparated from the reſt of the World, ſecundum quid,</hi>
that are no Chriſtians; ſome in one reſpect and ſome in another, and none
in all reſpects. 4. <hi>Vnited to God,</hi> is an ambiguous word, no <hi>Creature</hi> is
<hi>Vnited</hi> to him perfectly ſo as to be thereby what he is, <hi>God,</hi> in the created
Nature. Only Chriſt is united to him Hypoſtatically in his created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
All are ſo far united to him in natural being, as that in him they
live and move and have their being: And the Nature of man is one ſort of
his Image: All things are united to him as effects to their conſtant efficient.
The Church ſhould not be defined without any mention of Chriſt: The
Churches Union with God is by Chriſt. 5. Chriſt himſelf as Head is an
eſſential part of the Church, and ſhould not be left out of a Definition, thô
the meer Body may in common ſpeech be called <hi>the Church,</hi> as the People
may be called <hi>a Kingdom.</hi> 6. Will any <hi>Divine Covenant</hi> ſerve? or muſt it
not be only the Baptiſmal Covenant? 7. Is it called <hi>Divine</hi> only as <hi>made
by God,</hi> or as <hi>commanded by God and made by Man,</hi> or as mutual? Certainly
Gods Law and offered or Conditional Promiſe is moſt frequently called <hi>His
Covenant</hi> in Scripture; and this uniteth not men to God, till they conſent
and Covenant with him. Their own <hi>Covenant Act</hi> is neceſſary hereto: And
that is a <hi>Divine Covenant,</hi> only as commanded, and <hi>accepted</hi> and done by
Gods aſſiſting Grace. 8. The form of a Church is Relative, and the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi>
is eſſential to a Relation. It is no definition that hath not the End
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61069:4"/>
of the Aſſociation: Therefore this is none at all; and ſo the beginning tells
us what to expect.</p>
                     <p>This deſcription hath nothing in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what may agree to divers forms
of Society, and ſo hath not the form of a Church: And if he intended not a
Definition, but a looſe deſcription, I would a defining Doctor had had the
Chair, during this controverſie.</p>
                     <p>Let us try this deſcription upon a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Kingdom, Army, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
or ſuppoſe them meer Deiſts.</p>
                     <p>1. Such a Kingdom, Army, or Navy may be a Society. 2. Of Men.
3. Separated from the reſt of the World <hi>ſecundum quid &amp; ad hoc</hi> (and none
are ſeparated from it <hi>ſimpliciter &amp; ad omnia:</hi> e. g. No man is Separated from
the common humanity, No Deiſt from any but Atheiſts, and no Chriſtian
in believing a God and the Law of Nature and Nations.) 4. They are
<hi>Vnited to God</hi> ſo far as <hi>owning a God</hi> and Worſhipping him amounts to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Union of the Creature with the Creator in whom he liveth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And no unregenerate ungodly Chriſtian is united to him ſavingly. 5. They
are united among themſelves. 6. This is by a Covenant: 7. And by a
Covenant Divine, as to <hi>command, approbation</hi> and <hi>object.</hi> It is God that they
Covenant to own and obey: The common Profeſſion of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi>
is, <hi>There is one God, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>is his Prophet.</hi> It is Divine in <hi>tantum</hi> as
commanded. For God Commandeth all men to Own him; to believe that
<hi>God is,</hi> and <hi>that he is the Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him:</hi> And God ſo
far approveth it: St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Thou doſt well</hi>) to him that believeth
there is a God, much more that is profeſſedly devoted to him.</p>
                     <p>Let us by this examine the Jewiſh Church: <hi>Jews</hi> now may be 1. A Body,
2. Of Men, 3. Separated from the reſt of the World, even in Religion
and Church pretenſions. 4. United to God as Creatures, as Men, as the
corporal ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as profeſſing Belief, Love and Obedience to
God, as their God. 5. Strictly united among themſelves: 6. By a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
7. Which God once commanded, and ſtill approveth ſo far as they
own God.</p>
                     <p>Let us conſider whether this deſcription take not in, thoſe in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that fear God and work Righteouſneſs, that never heard of Chriſt,
(being thus combined.) And whether the Kingdom of God, be not larger
than his Church: Joyn the Head and Tail of this mans book together, and
by the Head (the deſcription) for ought I ſee, <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> if not
almoſt; all Heathens, are the Church: But at the End, I think none on
Earth is the Church: At leaſt none that ſeparate from a pair of Organs, or
an ignorant Curate; Nor can any man know who.</p>

P. 3. §. 3. <hi>And in many places, his Confuſion and grand errour is repeated,
that the</hi> Chriſtian Church is but one: <hi>p.</hi> 7. We know no Church but what all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
are members of by Baptſme, which is the Vniverſal Church; <hi>p.</hi> 8. There is
but one Church, of which all Chriſtians are members, as there is but one Covenant;
<hi>p.</hi> 19. If there be but one Church and one Communion, of which all true Chriſtians
are members, <hi>&amp;c. p. 23. I am no otherwiſe</hi> a member of any particular Church,
than I am of the Vniverſal: <hi>p. 40. It's a</hi> ſchiſmatical Notion of memberſhip that
divides the Chriſtian Church into diſtinct memberſhips, and therefore into the diſtinct
Bodyes: <hi>And. p. 19. and often he ſaith,</hi> thoſe Churches which are not members
of each other, are ſeparate Churches and Schiſmaticks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> I had hoped that no man but Mr. <hi>Cheny</hi> had talkt at this rate.</p>
                     <p>I. It's agreed on, that there is but one Univerſal Church: The contrary
is a Contradiction. 2. It is agreed, that there is no lawful particular
Church which is not a part of the Univerſal. 3. That whoever hath juſt
Union and Communion with a true particular Church, hath Union and
Communion with the Univerſal: 4. That all men in their Worſhip of God,
ſhould accordingly perform it (and do all that they do) as Men in that
Relation to the Univerſal Church: None of this is controverted.</p>
                     <p>II. But I had hoped never to have heard any but <hi>Seekers</hi> ſay, that there are
<hi>not many lawful</hi> particular Churches, <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the whole and from one
another, though not disjunct in the Common Eſſentials. For the proof of
the contrary,</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>I begin with that which I expect ſhould be moſt powerful; The mans
own after-Confeſſions, to which he is oft brought.</hi> Pag. 8. Diſtance of Place
and the neceſſities and conveniences of Worſhip and Diſcipline, has divided the
Church into ſeveral parts and members, and Particular Churches, <hi>&amp;c. So</hi> pag. 14.
pag. 19. All Chriſtian Churches ought to be members of one. <hi>More fully</hi> p. 20,
21. <hi>This is</hi> ad hominem, Yea and Nay <hi>is his Reſolution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>But I'le bring other Arguments that prevail more with me. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures oft tell us of</hi> many Churches, <hi>therefore there are many.</hi> Act.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61069:5"/>
the Apoſtles or this</hi> Reſolver <hi>be to be believed: They ſay there are</hi> many
Churches, <hi>parts of</hi> One; <hi>he ſaith,</hi> There is but one, and it's Schiſmatical to divide
it into diſtinct memberſhips <hi>or</hi> Bodyes, <hi>&amp;c. It's no Schiſme here to ſay, I am for</hi>
Paul <hi>and the Holy Scripture: Let who will believe the contradictor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>3. My next Argument is this: Where there are many Political Societies,
conſiſting of Chriſtian Paſtors and People, profeſſedly aſſociated <hi>for the</hi>
ordinary Exerciſe of thoſe Relations as ſuch, in holy Communion, in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Doctrine, Worſhip, Order and Converſation, for Edification in
true Faith, Hope, Love and Obedience, and the Glorifying of God
therein. There are many diſtinct true Churches, parts of the Church
Univerſal;</q> 
                        <hi>But on Earth there are many ſuch Societyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Either the controverſie is <hi>De re</hi> or <hi>de nomine</hi> (for we called <hi>Separatiſts</hi>
uſe to ſeparate theſe.) 1. If <hi>de re;</hi> Let the exiſtence of the thing defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
be tryed by Scripture, Reaſon and common Experience: 2. If <hi>de nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne;
Forma quae dat eſſe dat Nomen:</hi> Here is the true <hi>ſpecifick form</hi> which is
found in many ſingle Churches, <hi>ergo</hi> the Name of ſuch <hi>ſingle</hi> (or individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al)
Churches is due to them.</p>
                     <p>4. Again <hi>ad hominem,</hi> from the conſequences: 1. If there be not many
ſingle Churches in the Univerſal, then there are not many Patriarchal, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
Provincial, Metropolitical, Dioceſan, or Parochial Churches: For
<hi>non entium non datur numerus:</hi> Many <hi>nothings</hi> is a contradiction <hi>Multae ſunt
ergo ſunt; Ab eſt tertij adjecti ad eſt ſecundi valet argumentum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if there be not many, then 1. All the Pariſh Churches in <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but one, and not many, a Patron can have right to preſent to no one as
a Church, more than to another. 2. Then the Parſon, Vicar or Curate
is no more the Parſon of one Church than of another; nor bound to no
more Care and Duty; for there is but one. 3. Then no one is bound to
go to one Pariſh Church more than another; for there is but one. 4. Then
the Temple and Tithes belong no more to one than another. 5. Then no
Biſhop is the proper Biſhop of one Dioceſan Church, more than of another.
6. Then all the revenues of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> are no more appropriate
to one Church than to another. 7. Then you owe no more Obedience to
the Biſhops of one Dioceſan Church than another: 8. Then you make the
King no more Head or Governour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
9. Then a Dioceſan oweth no Reverence to a Metropolitane Chruch
(if there be none ſuch.) 10. Then many Churches cannot have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor ſend Biſhops to Councils; (if there be not many) 11. And the
charge of Separation from a Church that is no Church, is a contradiction.</p>
                     <p>5. I adde, from Parity of Reaſon, if many diſtinct ſubordinate Societies
may make one Civil Body Politick, ſo they may one Univerſal Church: But
the Antecedent is undoubted. If it be Learnedly ſaid with Mr. <hi>Cheny,</hi> that <hi>one
whole cannot be Part of another whole;</hi> One may attain the perfection by that
time he hath worn the Breeches but a few years, to know that a whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61069:5"/>
may be part of a whole Village, and a whole Vicinage be part of a
whole City, and a whole Colledge be part of a whole Univerſity; and a
whole City part of a whole Kingdom; and a whole Kingdom part of the
whole Earth.</p>
                     <p>And if it be objected, that the Names of the <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>parts</hi> are here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
but a <hi>Church</hi> and a <hi>Church</hi> are the ſame Name. I Anſwer, at the ſame age
one may learn that the ſame Name proveth not the ſameneſs of the things
Named; and that <hi>ex penuria nominum</hi> the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> the <hi>Totum</hi> and
<hi>Parts</hi> have oft equivocally the ſame Name, with the Addition of juſt Notes
of diſtinction. Sometimes an Academy of many School is called <hi>Schola,</hi> and
ſo are the ſingle Schools therein: The City of <hi>London</hi> is a <hi>Society;</hi> and ſo
are the Societies of Merchant-Taylors, Drapers, Mercers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therein.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. But theſe Churches muſt be members of one another, or they are Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. How can that be, if they be all but one. 2. This is alſo above or
below the <hi>ferula</hi> age. They are no members of one another, but all members
of the whole: Yet how oft have we this with the ſting of Schiſme (as <hi>Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
as <hi>Murder of Adulter</hi>) in the Tail of it. The hand is not a member or part
of the Foot, or the Foot of the Hand, or the Liver a member of the Lungs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but each one of the Man: If ever I were a Schoolmaſter again, I would
perſwade may Boyes, that A is not a member of B, nor B of C, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but each
of the Alphabet; And that one leaf of their Book is not a member of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but both of the Book; And if they were ripe for the Univerſity, I would
perſwade them that <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge is not a member of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> nor
that of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> &amp;c. but all of the Univerſitie of <hi>Oxford.</hi> And I think that
<hi>Briſtol</hi> is not a member of <hi>Exeter</hi> or <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> &amp;c. but all of <hi>England;</hi> and
that the Company of Stationers are not part of the Society of Merchants or
Drapers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all of <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What a Priviledg is it, that a Man may believe this about any ſuch thing
without Schiſme and Damnation! And how dreadful to fall into ſuch Church-mens
hands that in their Caſe make it Schiſme, Separation and Damnation.
But there is a Remedy.</p>
                     <p>§. 5. <hi>But he hath reaſon for what he ſaith:</hi> p. 3, 4. [Indeed it <hi>is</hi> extreamly abſurd
<hi>and</hi> unreaſonable, to ſay, that the Chriſtian Church, which is built on the ſame
Foundation, <hi>&amp;c. who</hi> enjoy all Priviledges <hi>in</hi> Common, ſhould be divided into as diſtinct
<hi>and</hi> ſeparate Bodies, thô of the ſame kind and nature, <hi>as</hi> Peter, James <hi>and</hi>
John <hi>are</hi> diſtinct Perſons—It's abſurd to ſay, <hi>That</hi> where every thing is common
there is not one Community.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Let us not ſwallow this without Chewing: 1. Whether all be
<hi>extreamly abſurd</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable</hi> which ſuch Doctors call ſo; I am grown
to doubt as much as whether all be Schiſm which Schiſmaticks call ſo: <hi>Ipſe
dixit</hi> is no Proof.</p>
                     <p>2. What the meaning of this great, Decantate Word [<hi>Separate</hi>] is;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61069:6"/>
muſt anon be enquired: But, may not Churches be <hi>diſtinct</hi> and not culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſeparate? He confeſſeth afterwards both local diſtinction and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
                     <p>3. How far are the <hi>Vniverſal Church</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> Churches diſtinct? As
<hi>Whole</hi> and <hi>Parts?</hi> Muſt the World at laſt learn that <hi>Whole</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> are
not diſtinct? If you take it for abſurd to diſtinguiſh a Man from a Body,
or from a Liver, Hand or Foot, Diſſenters do not; nor to diſtinguiſh a
Colledge from an Univerſity, a Houſe from a Street, a Street from a
City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But how are the Particular Churches diſtinguiſhed one from another?
Reader, ſo conſtantly do ſuch men fight with themſelves, that it's meet
to ask, whether they that thus ſay there are not many diſtinct Churches,
do not aſſert a far wider difference between many, than thoſe they diſſent
from. We affirm that there are many, and that they differ not <hi>in ſpecie,</hi>
but <hi>numero,</hi> as Colledges, Cities do among themſelves; but theſe men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this, hold not only a numerical, but a ſpecifick difference, even as
Parochial, Dioceſan, Provincial, Patriarchal, National; at leaſt Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Dioceſans differing <hi>Ordine vel Specie</hi> with them, the Church deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
from them muſt do ſo too.</p>
                     <p>§ 6. <hi>But he confirms it. [Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> thô they partake of the
ſame common nature, yet each of them have a diſtinct Eſſence and Subſiſtence of their
own, and this makes them diſtinct Perſons; but where the very Nature and Eſſence
of a Body or Society conſiſts in baving all things common, there can be but one
Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I hope its no culpable Separation to diſtinguiſh things as differing
<hi>ſpecie &amp; numero;</hi> and this is the Doctors meaning, if his words are ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant:
and the common way of expreſſing it would have been, [Peter <hi>and</hi>
John <hi>differ numerically but not</hi> in ſpecie; <hi>but two Churches differ neither</hi> ſpecie
<hi>nor</hi> numero.]</p>
                     <p>And 1. Reader, whereas he ſaid before, that the <hi>Church is not divided into
diſtinct Bodies,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> &amp;c.] did you think till now, that <hi>James</hi>
and <hi>John,</hi> and the Doctor, and the ſeveral Biſhops had not been diſtinct
parts of the Church in their diſtinct natural bodies?</p>
                     <p>2. And why may there not be diſtinct Politick Bodies, or Compound in
one whole as well as natural? certainly, all things corporeal ſave Attomes
are Compounds: A Muſcle, a Hand, a Foot, parts ſimilar and diſſimilar
in man are all compounded of leſſer Parts. If many Students may make one
Colledge, why may not many Colledges make one Univerſity? It's ſtrange
if a Doctor deny this.</p>
                     <p>3. But let us conſider of his Reaſon, and enquire 1. <hi>Whether the Church
have all things Common. 2. Whether the very Eſſence of it conſiſt in this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I. It is granted that the whole <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species</hi> is found in
every individual of that <hi>Species,</hi> Natural or Politick; but did we ever hear,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61069:6"/>
till Mr. <hi>Cheny</hi> and this Doctor ſaid it, that Politick Bodies differ not <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
as well as Natural? The Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France</hi> are two;
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> long ſtrove which ſhould be uppermoſt,
but who ever ſaid that they were not two?</p>
                     <p>II. Have they all things common? Diſſenters would have excepted
Wives and Husbands, (thô the Canons called Apoſtolical do not;) Why
ſhould the Eſſence of a Church lie in this, and not the Eſſence of a City or
Kingdom? Tories in <hi>Ireland</hi> would have all common; Merchants and
Tradeſmen, Knights, Lords and Princes here would not. But it's no Schiſm
here alſo to diſtinguiſh <hi>ſimpliciter &amp; ſecundum quid,</hi> Propriety and the uſe
of Propriety: There is no <hi>Community</hi> without <hi>Propriety:</hi> Men have firſt a
Propriety in themſelves, their members, their food, the acqueſts of their
Labours, their Wives and Children, and Goods. And they conſent to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
to preſerve this Propriety, becauſe every man loveth himſelf: And
yet they muſt uſe their Propriety, (even of Life) for common good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all are better than one: But if they had no Propriety they could not
ſo uſe it for the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>And I never conformed to the Doctrine that denyeth <hi>Propriety</hi> in Church
Members and Particular Churches, and thought all ſimply <hi>common.</hi> I'le
tell you what <hi>Particular</hi> Churches have to individuate them, not common
to all.</p>
                     <p>1. They conſiſt of individual natural Perſons, <hi>many</hi> of which as much
differ from <hi>many</hi> other Perſons, (thoſe in <hi>England</hi> from thoſe in <hi>Spain</hi>) as
<hi>one man</hi> doth from <hi>another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Their Graces and gifts are numerically diſtinct (Faith, Hope, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
from thoſe of other Churches thô <hi>ejuſdem ſpeciei. 3. England</hi> and <hi>France,
London</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> have Churches of different <hi>place</hi> and <hi>Scituation:</hi> 4. But
the <hi>formal individuating</hi> difference is their neareſt Relation to their ſeveral
<hi>Paſtors;</hi> as ſeveral Kingdoms, Cities, Schools are numerically diſtinct by
their diſtinct Kings, Maiors, School-maſters, ſo are ſeveral Churches <hi>ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
ſpeciei. 1. Theſſ. 5. 12, 13. Know thoſe that are among you and over you in
the Lord, and eſteem them highly in love for their</hi> Works ſake. As every mans
Wife, Children and Servants muſt be uſed for the common good, and yet
are not common, one mans Wife and Children are not anothers; So the
Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> &amp;c. muſt govern his Church for the good of the
Univerſal; but he is not the Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter, Norwich, Paris, Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are differences enow to conſtitute a <hi>numerical</hi> difference of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:
<hi>Paul</hi> diſtinguiſheth the Biſhops of <hi>Philippi, Epheſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> &amp;c. from others.</p>
                     <p>Do you yet ſee no <hi>Priviledges</hi> that one hath Proper, and not common to
all? none that make a difference <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> but both <hi>

                           </gap>umerical</hi> and <hi>gradual.</hi> 1. All Churches have not Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Doctor <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi>
Doctor <hi>Sherlock</hi> to be their Teachers: Air Churches be not taught all
that's in this Reſolver. 2. All Churches have not men of the ſame ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61069:7"/>
nor excellency of Parts: It was once taken for lawful to account them
<hi>ſpecially worthy of double honour who laboured in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> and to
eſteem men for their <hi>works ſake. Paul</hi> ſaith of <hi>Timothy, I have no man like
minded.</hi> If thoſe that heard not a Sermon in many years differed not from
your Congregation, why do you preach?</p>
                     <p>I am reproached in Print for telling the world this notorious truth; That I
lived till ten years old, where four men, four years hired ſucceſſively were
Readers and School-maſters; two Preached (as it was called) once a
Month, the other two never: Two drank themſelves to beggery. After
I lived where many Pariſhes about us had no Preachers: The Pariſh that I
lived in, had a Church with a Vicar that never preached, and a Chappel
with a Parſon eighty years old, that had two Livings twenty Miles diſtant,
and never preacht: His Son a Reader and Stage-player was ſometime his
Curate: His Grand-ſon, my School-maſter, his Curate next that, never
preacht in his life, but drunk himſelf to beggery. One year a Taylor read
the Scripture, and the old man (the beſt of them all) ſaid the Commmon-Prayer
without book (for want of ſight.) The next year a poor Threſher
read the Scripture. After that a Neighbours Son (my Maſter) was Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
who never preacht but once, and that when he was drunk, (in my
hearing) on <hi>Mat. 25. Come ye Bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>go ye Curſed;</hi>] the ſaddeſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
that ever I heard. Theſe things were no rarities: Now my aſſertion
is, That the Church that had ſuch as <hi>Auſtin, Chryſoſtome, Jewel, Andrews,</hi>
and ſuch worthy men as <hi>London</hi> now hath many, had Priviledges diſtinct
from theſe, (and many the like) that I was in.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay that every Biſhop and Preacher is as much the Biſhop and
Preacher to all other ſingle Churches, as to that which is his Title; then
1. He muſt be condemned for not <hi>teaching</hi> them all. 2. Then he may claim
maintenance from them all. 3. Then he may intrude into any mans Charge.
4. Then no Church is unchurcht for want of a Biſhop, for any one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
is Biſhop to every Church in the World; and ſo <hi>ubi Epiſcopus ibi
Eccleſia,</hi> ſignifieth but that Church and Biſhop are on the ſame Earth; and
<hi>Eccleſia eſt Plebs Epiſcopo adunata</hi> may be verified if there be but one in the
World. 5. And ſo Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> and ſuch are ſelf-confuted before you are
aware: <hi>Geneva, Holland,</hi> and all Presbyterians are true Churches, for they
have all Biſhops; <hi>e.g.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> is Biſhop to them all: For if
one man be no more a Member of one ſingle Church than of another, and
ſo no more a Subject to one Biſhop than to another, then one Biſhop is no
more Paſtor of one Church than of another.</p>
                     <p>7. And how can you magnifie the Church of <hi>England</hi> for a Wiſe, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Pious Clergy above other Churches, if all Priviledges be common, and
they have no proper Paſtors of their own.</p>
                     <p>8. Do you think that the Church, <hi>e. g.</hi> Of <hi>Hippo,</hi> that was in <hi>Auſtins</hi>
dayes, was the ſame numerical ſingle Church with that which is there now,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61069:7"/>
(were there any) or with the Dioceſan Church of <hi>London?</hi> if not, then
at leaſt diſtance of time, and change of Perſons maketh divers Particular
Churches; and it's no more againſt the unity of the Church Univerſal to have
divers particular Churches in it in the ſame Age, than in divers Ages.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, Diverſity of matter and form maketh a numerical Diverſity
(as of Natural, ſo) of Politick Bodies of the ſame <hi>ſpecies:</hi> But the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna, Thyatira, Philadelphia</hi> &amp;c. were of divers matter and
form numerically; <hi>Ergo</hi> they were divers Political Churches.</p>
                     <p>Sure God doth not commend <hi>Laodicea</hi> for <hi>Philadelphia</hi>'s Church Virtues,
nor condemn the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for the other Churches Sins.</p>
                     <p>And if the Angels be Biſhops, why are ſome Biſhops praiſed as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of ſuch Churches, and the Biſhops of other Churches threatned.</p>
                     <p>But I confeſs this is a ready way to end the Controverſies between the
Biſhops of ſeveral Churches which ſhall be greateſt, if they be all but one.</p>
                     <p>But I hope that when the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Church was corrupted,
it is not true that every Biſhop and Church fell with him, (or with any
that hath turned to Mahumetaniſm.)</p>
                     <p>To be no longer on this, (which I thought no Prelatiſt would ever have
put me on) if theſe men ſpeak not notoriouſly againſt Scripture, againſt
the conſtant Language of Canons and Fathers, Hiſtorians and Lawyers,
and all Antiquity, and all Chriſtian Countreys and Divines, (yea, even
thoſe that at <hi>Trent</hi> would have had only the Pope to be of immediate Divine
Right) then I know not any thing by Reading. And if poor Nonconformiſts
muſt be put to defend themſelves againſt ſuch ſingularities, and be Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
unleſs they will differ from all the Chriſtian World of all Ages, there
is no Remedy.</p>
                     <p>§ 7. But <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6. he tells us, [<hi>that</hi> a Church is made by a Divine Covenant—God
only can conſtitute a Church: Such Perſons, if there be any ſo abſurd, are not
worth diſputing with, who dare affirm the Church to be an humane Creature, <hi>or</hi>
the invention <hi>of</hi> men.—And no Church can depend on humane Contracts; for
then a Church would be a humane <hi>Creature and</hi> Conſtitution, whereas a Church can
be founded only on a Divine Covenant—</p>
                     <p>1. Who would think but this man were a Nonconformiſt, that talks
ſo like them (<hi>e. g. Ameſius in Medul. Theol.</hi>) againſt humane Church Forms?
But what then will Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> and almoſt all other Biſhops and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
be thought of, who affirm Patriarchal and Metropolitical Churches (and
many of the Dioceſane) to be but humane Conſtitutions and Inventions.
And if theſe be not worth the diſputing with, it ſeems, that you differ from
them more than Separatiſts do: and then were not all theſe Schiſmaticks?
and then, are not you a Schiſmatick if you communicate with them? yea,
your Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> himſelf maketh Dioceſan Churches to be a humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and A. Biſhop <hi>Bromhall</hi> much pleadeth for mans power to make Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal
Churches; and ſo do ſuch others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61069:8"/>
2. But is it true that humane Contracts make not a Church? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not
alone: But I think that all Churches are made by mutual Contracts, and
humane is one part of that which is mutual.</p>
                     <p>1. As to the <hi>Vniverſal Church,</hi> 1. God as Legiſlator and Donor, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuteth
the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Covenanting by Baptiſm, and therein he commandeth
mans conſent to his <hi>offered Covenant;</hi> and conditionally promiſeth to be our
God: But, <hi>Conditionale nihil ponit in eſſe:</hi> This much maketh no Chriſtian,
nor Church. To command a man to be a Chriſtian, and conditionally to
promiſe him life if he will be one, proveth him not to be one; elſe all
were Chriſtians that reject an offered Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>2. But when man <hi>conſenteth</hi> and covenanteth with God, then Gods condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
gift becomes actual and efficacious, the man being a capable Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and not before: and in this it is the Contract that is the <hi>Fundamentum
Relationis;</hi> but a ſingle Promiſe is not a mutual Covenant or Contract.</p>
                     <p>So that it is no wiſer Divinity to ſay, Gods Covenant and not mans conſent,
Covenant or Contract with God, doth make Chriſtians, and the univerſal
Church; than it is ſober Reaſon to ſay, That Gods Inſtitution of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
or Magiſtracie only doth make the Relation of Husband and Wife, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their covenanting conſent, or doth make Common-wealths, without
the conſent or Covenant of Sovereign and Subjects. Did this Doctor think
that <hi>Voluntarineſs</hi> is not as neceſſary to the Relation of Chriſtianity as to
the Relation of Prince and Subjects; yea, or of Husband and Wife? if he
do, he is ſhamefully miſtaken. Baptiſm delivereth men poſſeſſion of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Grace</hi> and <hi>right</hi> to Glory; and can men have this againſt their wills? One
would think by the Doctrine and courſe of ſome men, that they could
force men to Pardon and Salvation! if I believed that their force could
accompliſh this, I would never call it Perſecution. If they can force men
to be true Chriſtians, they may force them to be juſtifyed and ſaved; and
then they are very uncharitable if they do not: Let them then ceaſe preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and diſputing us to their Opinion, but bring us all to Heaven whether
we will or not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Yea the ſelf-contradictor, playing faſt and looſe, confeſſeth</hi> p. 6. <hi>That</hi>
no man at age can be admitted to Baptiſm, till he profeſs his faith in Chriſt, and
voluntarily undertake the Baptiſmal Vow: <hi>And is not that</hi> humane <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, he knoweth that the Liturgie maketh even Neighbours or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
vow and covenant, both in the name of the Child and for the Child.
And ſo neceſſary doth the Epiſcopal Church think <hi>humane Covenanting,</hi> that
without this no Child muſt be Baptized publickly though the Parents would
covenant, and that they can neither for Love nor Money (for many poor
men hire Godfathers) get any one (much leſs three) who examined, will
ſeriouſly purpoſe to perform the Covenant for the Childs holy Education
which they make.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61069:8"/>
II. But is not <hi>humane Covenanting</hi> a cauſe of <hi>ſingle Church</hi> Relation as well
as of <hi>univerſal?</hi> I ſee no cauſe to doubt it; and I am ſure that the Church
for a thouſand years (before and ſince Popery came in) have declared him
no Biſhop that comes in without <hi>conſent</hi> of Clergie and People; which
<hi>Conſent</hi> is their covenanting act.</p>
                     <p>To make a ſingle Church, manifold conſent goeth to the <hi>Fundamentum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationis.</hi>
1. God commandeth ſingle Church Officers, order and conſent,
and promiſeth them his bleſſing where they are met: The Lord and his
Angels are among them: No command is vain, and without a virtual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
2. To this a threefold humane conſent is needful, Ordinarily:
1. the Perſons called. 2. The Ordainers (when it may be had.) 3. The
Peoples. He that formerly, from the Apoſtles dayes, for a thouſand years,
ſhould have ſaid, that neither the covenanting, that is the <hi>conſent</hi> of the
Paſtor, or People, or Ordainers, is neceſſary to the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Church Relation or Form, would have been taken for a wild-brain'd
Schiſmatick at leaſt.</p>
                     <p>§ 8. <hi>But ſaith this Doctor (and another of them)</hi> [p. 6. But the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Church Covenant between Paſtor and people, is of a very different nature
from this: Vnleſs any man will ſay, that the voluntary Contract and Covenant which
the Independents exact from their Members, and wherein they place a Church ſtate,
be part of the Baptiſmal vow; if it be not, then they found the Church upon a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Covenant; for Chriſt hath made but one Covenant with Mankind which is
contained in the Vow of Baptiſm; if it be, then no man is a Chriſtian but an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Alas for the Church that is taught at this rate!</p>
                     <p>1. I never ſaw what Independents do in this caſe; but I think none of
them that are Sober own any other ſort of Church but the <hi>univerſal,</hi> and <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Churches</hi> as members of it, and therefore require no Contract but 1. To
the Covenant of Baptiſm or Chriſtianity. 2. To the Duties of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church-relation.</p>
                     <p>2. And nothing is here of neceſſity but <hi>manifeſted Conſent</hi> (which is a
real Contract) but a clearer or a darker, an explicite or implicate conſent
differ only <hi>ad melius eſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Is not God the Author of Magiſtracy, Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is it any
violation of Gods part, if Rulers and People, Husband and Wife be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters
by his command?</p>
                     <p>4. Is it any renuntiation of Baptiſm to promiſe at Ordination to obey
the Arch-Biſhop and Biſhop, and to take the Oath of Canonical Obedience?
Is it not ſtill exacted? Are not the Takers of it obliged? are not Covenants
impoſed on all that will be Miniſters in the act of Uniformity? are not
multitudes kept out and caſt out for not making theſe Covenants? <hi>Quo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neam
nodo,</hi> &amp;c. How ſhould one deal with ſuch ſtippery men? Good Mr.
<hi>Zachary Cawdry</hi> that wrote to have all men to covenant Submiſſion to Biſhops
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61069:9"/>
and Pariſh Miniſters, did not dream that it was any violation of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                     <p>5. Do not men owe duty to their Paſtors which they owe to no others?
If not, put them not on it: Why are you angry with them for going from
you? Why doth the Canon ſuſpend thoſe that receive them to Communion
from another Pariſh that hath no Preacher? Why are we ruined for not
covenanting as aforeſaid? if yea, then is it againſt Baptiſm to promiſe to
do our duty?</p>
                     <p>6. But hath God commanded or inſtituted no Covenant but Baptiſm?
Yes ſure, the Matrimonial at leaſt; and I think Ordination is covenanting
for the Miniſtry: Did not the Apoſtle <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. ordain Elders in every
Church? if you would have [by <hi>Suffrage</hi>] left out of the Tranſlation, no
ſober man can doubt but it was by the Peoples conſent; and was it without
their conſent that <hi>Titus</hi> was to ordain Elders in every City? Could any then
come otherwiſe in? Did not all Churches hold and practiſe this after, and
was it none of Gods Inſtitution? If ſo, God requireth us not to take any
of you for our Biſhops or Paſtors: Who then requireth it? What meaneth
<hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>they gave up themſelves to the Lord and to us, by the Will
of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. Can the wit of man imagine how it is poſſible without conſent, for a
man to be made the Paſtor of any Flock? Who ever ordained a man againſt his
will? or for any man to have Title againſt his will, to the proper over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
and paſtoral care of any one Paſtor, or the priviledges of any Church?
If any think they may be cramm'd and drencht with the Sacrament, or that
an unwilling man may have a ſealed pardon and gift of Salvation delivered
him, he will make a new Goſpel. And how any particular Paſtor is bound
to give that man the Sacrament ordinarily, that conſents not ordinarily to
receive it of him, I know not. No man is a member of any City, or any
Company of Free-men in the City, but by mutual conſent; and the Oath
of Allegiance and Supremacy to the King maketh not the Oath of a Citizen
as ſuch or of a Member of a Company as ſuch, unlawful.</p>
                     <p>8. Doth this Doctor think that he ever yet proved to ſober men,
that the Covenant aforeſaid, of Godfathers and Godmothers, to make
Chriſtians, and members of the univerſal Church, is more (or ſo much)
of Gods Inſtitution, than the Contract or Conſent between Biſhops or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
and People to make a ſingle Political Church?</p>
                     <p>9. If it follow not, that no man is the Kings Subject that ſweareth not to
the City; It will not follow, that none is a Chriſtian, but an Independent, or
Church-conſenter.</p>
                     <p>10. How are your Pariſh or Dioceſan Church members known to your
ſelves or any others? Are all that dwell in the Pariſh or Dioceſs your Church
members? Then Atheiſts, Sadducees, Hobbiſts, and all vicious men and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
that never communicate, are ſuch: Yea thoſe that you call Separatiſts.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61069:9"/>
If it be every tranſient Communicant, have you a proper Paſtoral care of
every Travellers Soul that ſo communicates with you? You after plead that
his very ordinary Communion maketh him not a member, if he be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be one. And is not his conſent then neceſſary? Or if ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
be the teſt (how few then of great Pariſhes are of the Church) yet
that is becauſe ſuch Communion ſignifieth their Conſent to your over-ſight
of them.</p>
                     <p>§ 9. But it's much to be approved which <hi>p.</hi> 5. and oft he ſaith, that
<hi>to be taken into Covenant with, God, and to be received into the Church is the very
ſame thing,</hi> as to the Univerſal Church. By which all his groſs Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Accuſations after wards are confuted. No, man then is out of the Church
that is not out of the Baptiſmal Covenant, either by not <hi>taking</hi> it, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
ſome <hi>Eſſential part</hi> of it? And when will he prove, that to take him,
rather than Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> that was caſt out, to be a Teacher or Paſtor at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans,</hi>
or to take this man and not another to be the Lawful Biſhop or Prieſt,
and to obey him in every Oath and Ceremony, is an Eſſential part of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal
Covenant, or of Chriſtianity? But; ſuch a rope of Sand, as Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
and this man tye together, to bind men to their Sect, will ſerve turn with
ſome that know not who ſpeaks Truth, by any ſurer way than prejudice.</p>
                     <p>§ 10. <hi>His Doctrine of</hi> Separation <hi>and</hi> gathering Churches out of Churches <hi>is
anon to be conſidered: But whereas he addes,</hi> p. 7. [<hi>Theſe men convert
Chriſtians from common Chriſtianity, and the Communion of the Vniverſal Church
to Independency.]</hi>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> My acquaintance with them is ſmall, ſave by reading their Books:
And there are few Men of any Common Denomination (Epiſcopal, or
other) that are not in many things diſagreed. But I muſt in Charity to them
ſay, that as far as I can judge by their Writings or Speech, he palpably
ſlandereth them; and that none that are grave and ſober among them do
ſeparate their Churches from the common Chriſtianity or the Univerſal
Church, any more than the Company of Stationers, Ironmongers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
ſeparated from the City of <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>London</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> or Trinity
Colledge from the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford.</hi> I never met with
man, and I am confident never ſhall do, that doth not take his Independent
Church to be part of the Univerſal, and Dependent as a part on the whole.
If belying others ſtopt at words, the wrong were ſmall: But when it's made
but the ſtairs to hatred and deſtroying, it's his way to cure Schiſm that is
commonly painted with Horns and Cloven feet. If a man come from a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Village and be made by Covenant a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> how prove you
that he renounceth King or Kingdom?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But he ſaith,</hi> p. 9. Thoſe who wilfully ſeparate from the Corporation to which
the Charter was granted, forfeit their Intereſt in the Charter.</p>

them to congregate in diſtinct ſingle Churches (as <hi>London</hi> Charter
doth to erect ſeveral Companies, and the Univerſities ſeveral Colledges?)
2. And that God hath not in his Word given order or command for ſuch
ſingle Churches: But that the Apoſtles and <hi>Titus</hi> by fixing Elders to their

that their ſubordinate Churches have not need of diſtinct ſubordinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

                        <hi>It may be he will ſay that the</hi> Dioceſan depend on the Vniverſal, but the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian

                     <p>I Anſwer, Dependance is either that of <hi>Subjects</hi> on Soveraign or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates

But the Promiſe to Juſtifie all Believers juſtifieth each ſingle Perſon
when he believeth. If the King ſhould make one common Law to command
all his Subjects that are Freeholders to live in Corporations or Hundreds,
deſcribed with their priviledges, thoſe priviledges would be all theirs that

no ſpecial duty to the Biſhops, Prieſts, Churches or Neighbours where we

particular Churches, muſt not men <hi>Conſent</hi> to their Relations and Duties?
Is it a ſin to Promiſe Duty? 4. Sure it is not meer <hi>Place,</hi> but a mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Paſtors and People that diſtinguiſheth theſe Churches. The Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
preach't once in the ſame Places that you do, and yet you take
them not for the ſame Church Paſtors. If one from <hi>York</hi> or <hi>Cornwall</hi> come
into your Pulpit without conſent, do People ſtand as much related to him as
to you? Some men are of extraordinary ſufficiency to reſiſt and conquer
the cleareſt evidence of Truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But he addes</hi> [every Act of Communion thô performed to ſome particular Church,
is and muſt be an Act of Communion with the whole Catholick Church.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> And who denyeth this? No ſober Independent or Presbyterian that
ever I met with. It's a weighty Truth.</p>
                     <p>§. 17. P. 14. <hi>Saith he</hi> [Praying, and Hearing and Receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

with any other true and Orthodox part of the Church, thô in the remoteſt part of
the World.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> I think that's not true: With the remoteſt parts you have only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Communion with the Church Univerſal: In <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London</hi> you
have that and more; even ſpecial ſubordinate Communion with your own
King, Biſhop and Flock.</p>
                     <p>2. And hath not the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſuch Communion in obedience to
its own Laws; (as the Act of Uniformity,) Convocation and Canons,
which you have not with all abroad? Do your Biſhops in Convocation make
Canon Laws for all the World? Do you Swear Canonical obedience as much
to the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>Haffnia,</hi> &amp;c. as to your Ordinary? Do the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of all Churches impoſe our Liturgy, or <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicate all that
affirm any thing in it, or our Ceremonies or Church Government, to be
againſt Gods word? Sure this is a peculiar kind of Communion.</p>
                     <p>3. If not, why are all the Nonconformiſts caſt out that offer to officiate
and Communicate on ſuch terms as are common to all ſound Churches?</p>
                     <p>Pag. 15. <hi>Saith he</hi> [There is nothing in all theſe Acts of Communion which does
more peculiarly unite us to ſuch a particular Church than to the whole Chriſtian

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> What, neither in theſe <hi>Acts</hi> nor any other! Then we are no more bound

                     <p>§. 18. P. 20. <hi>Saith he</hi> [There is no other Rule of Catholick Communion for

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. Elſewhere you added [<hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>Orthodox:</hi>] Elſe they that live
with Arians, Socinians, Papiſts (in <hi>Spain, France, Italy,</hi> &amp;c.) are bound
to communicate with them in all Religious Offices and obey them. 2. This
concludeth, that where Presbytery or Independency is the way of the place
where we live, all muſt thus communicate and obey. The King and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
then may make any way to become our Duty. 3. If you tell us that
<hi>it's only with</hi> the <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Orthodox,</hi> you were as good ſay nothing, unleſs
you tell us who muſt judge that, whether the People themſelves, or who
for them. 4. But if this be the <hi>only rule</hi> for private Chriſtians, what ſhall they
do, <hi>e. g.</hi> in <hi>Aethiopa, Egypt, Syria,</hi> and many other Countreys where the
Churches are ſuch as General Councils and other Churches judge He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks

Conſtantinople,</hi> &amp;c. one party is uppermoſt (by the Judgment of
Councils and Prince) one Year, and another contrary party the next.
And what ſhall they do where the Prince equally tolerateth both, and it's
hard to know which is the more numerous? as in <hi>Zeno</hi>'s and <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi>
Reign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what ſhall they do when many Churches in one City are of
divers Tongues, as well as Cuſtoms? Have the <hi>Greeks, French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
in <hi>London</hi> no rule of Catholick Communion but communicating in all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                     <p>1. A Traveller of another Country, who on his journey communicateth
with every Church where he paſſeth, is not a fixed Member of that Church:
for, 1. The Paſtor or Biſhop hath not that peculiar Charge of him as of
fixed members. 2. He is not bound where he paſſeth to take ſuch notice of
the lives of Communicants or Paſtors, and to admoniſh the Offenders, and
tell the Church, as fixed members are. 3. He hath not the right in chooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Doctrines, lapt up in confuſion by men that abhor diſtinction, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
not what they ſay; I will firſt lay down that truth that he fights
againſt, with convincing evidence, and then ſhew you the miſchief of his
falſe Doctrine and Application.</p>
                     <p>§. 2. The confuſion of theſe Words [<hi>Church, Communion, Separation</hi> and
<hi>Schiſm</hi>] which every one ſignifie divers things, is the chief means to blind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and deceive his Reader; whether it do ſo by himſelf I know not.</p>
                     <p>I. The Word <hi>Church</hi> ſignifieth ſometime the univerſal Church; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
a ſingle Organized Church as part of it, and ſometime humane combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of ſuch ſingle Churches; and that into Dioceſan, Claſſical, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
Patriarchal, National, and Papal.</p>
                     <p>II. The Specification and Nomination of Churches is from the formal
cauſe, and the proper Government is that form: And the Individuation is
from matter and form, but principally from the form.</p>
                     <p>III. The Union of Paſtor and Flock in Relation makes that which is a
form aptitudinal (as the Soul to the Body) to be the form in act (as the
Union of Soul and Body) and Gods command and conſent with the
conſent of the neceſſary relate and correlate cauſe that union.</p>
                     <p>IV. Union is in order to Communion, which is primary by the exerciſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61069:13"/>
of the formal powers on the matter, and ſecondary by the action of all the
parts according to their ſeveral capacities and Offices.</p>
                     <p>V. The Union of the Church is of divers degrees. 1. The formal Union
of the Head and Body, which maketh it eſſentially the [<hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi>]
2. The <hi>Vnion of the parts among themſelves as Chriſtian,</hi> which maketh
them a <hi>Body</hi> capable of Union with the Head. 3. The Union of the parts
as unequal Organized, the Official with the reſt, which maketh it an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
Body,</hi> fit for its ſpecial uſe and welfare. 4. Union in <hi>integrity</hi> of
parts, which maketh it an intire Body. 5. Union in due temperament and
Qualities, which maketh it a <hi>healthful</hi> Body. 6. Unity in <hi>Common Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>
which make it a <hi>Comely Beautiful</hi> Body joined with the reſt. But, 7.
Union in mutable Accidents is unneceſſary and impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>VI. Theſe ſeveral degrees of Union are found in Bodies natural and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
1. The Union of Soul and Body makes a man, and an Embryo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be organized. 2. The Union of the Body maketh it capable of the
Souls further Operation. 3. The Union of the Organical, chief parts, (as
Heart, Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to the reſt make it a true humane Body compleated
to the nutriment and action of Life. 4. That it have Hands and Fingers,
Feet and Toes, and all integral parts, makes it an intire Body. 5. The
due ſite, temperament and qualities of each part make it a ſound Body.
6. Comely colour, hair, action, going, ſpeech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make it a <hi>comely Body.</hi>
7. To have all parts of equal quantity and office, would make it uncomely:
And to have the ſame hair, colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is unneceſſary at all.</p>
                     <p>1. The Union of King and Subjects as ſuch makes a Kingdom. 2. That
the People be agreed; for one conjunct intereſt and Government maketh
them a <hi>Community</hi> capable of Politie or Government. 3. That there be
Judges, Maiors and Juſtices, and ſubordinate Cities of Societies, maketh
it an Organized Body, in which Kingly Government may be exerciſed to
its end, the common good. 4. That no profitable part be wanting, (Judge,
Juſtice, Sheriff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) maketh it an <hi>entire</hi> Kingdom. 5. That all know
their place, and be duly qualified with Wiſdom, Love, Juſtice, Conſcience,
Obedience to God firſt, to the Sovereign Power next, to Officers next, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
maketh it a found and ſafe Kingdom. 6. That it be well ſituate, fertile,
rich, eminent in Learning, Skill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> maketh it an adorned beautiful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
7. That all be equal in Power and wealth is deſtructive; and that
all be of one Age, complexion, calling, temper, degree of knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
is impoſſible: And that all have the ſame language, cloathing, utenſils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
is needleſs at leaſt.</p>
                     <p>VII. Jeſus Chriſt is the only Univerſal Soveraign of the Church, both
of vital influence and Government; nor hath he ſet up any under him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Monarchical, Ariſtocratical, Democratical, or mixt, Pope, Council,
on diffuſed Clergy, that hath the Power of Legiſlation and Judgment as
governing the whole Chorch; but only Officers that <hi>per partes</hi> govern it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61069:14"/>
them, each in his Province, as Juſtices do the Kingdom, and Kings
and States the World; nor is any capable of more.</p>
                     <p>VIII. To ſet up any <hi>univerſal Legiſlators</hi> and Judge, (Pope or Council)
is to ſet up an Uſurper of Chriſts Prerogative, called by many a Vice-Chriſt
or an Antichriſt; and as bad as making one man or Senate the Soveraign of
all the Earth; and to attempt the ſetting up of ſuch or any <hi>forreign Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
in this Land, is to endeavour to perjure the whole Kingdom that is
ſworn againſt it in the Oath of Supremacy, and ſworn never to endeavour
any alteration of Government in Church or State in the Corporation Oath,
the Veſtry Oath, the <hi>Militia</hi> Oath, the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath, with the Uniformity
Covenants: And if any ſhould endeavour to introduce ſuch a forreign Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
who themſelves have had a hand in driving all the Kingdom to all theſe
Oaths againſt if, I doubt whether all the Powers of Hell can deviſe a much
greater crime againſt Clergy, Cities, and all the Land. Good reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had Doctor <hi>Iſaac Barrow</hi> to write againſt it as he hath done, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and all ſuch as of late go that pernicious way, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Church Union and Communion. As if one univerſal Soveraign and
Legiſlator and Judge, were not enough to unite Chriſts Kingdom, or man
could mend his univerſal Laws, and could not ſtay for his final judgment;
and Churches and Kingdomes might nor till then be ruled without one hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
univerſal Soveraign by neceſſary and voluntary agreement among
themſelves.</p>
                     <p>XI. To be a true Believer or Chriſtian, (or the Inſant ſeed of ſuch) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, according to the ſenſe of
the Baptiſmal Covenant, uniteth each Member firſt to Chriſt himſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
and conſequently to his Body or Church; and this <hi>coram Deo,</hi> as ſoon
as it is done by heart conſent; and <hi>coram Eccleſia,</hi> regularly, as ſoon
as he is inveſted by Baptiſm; which Baptiſm, when it may be had ſo, is
regularly to be adminiſtred by none but an authorized Miniſter or Deacon;
but if through neceſſity or miſtake it be done by a Lay-man, the Ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
took it not for a nullity, much leſs if the Baptizer was taken for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
by miſtake, being in his place; and if no Baptiſm can be had, open
covenanting is vallid.</p>
                     <p>X. The Papiſts (and their truckling Agents here) have here hampered
themſelves in a fatal contradiction: To make themſelves maſters of the
World, they would perſwade us, that Sacraments only regenerate and
ſanctifie, and that God ſaveth none (by any known way and grant) but
by his Covenant Sealed by the Sacraments; and that he authorizeth none
to adminiſter this Covenant but Prelates and their Prieſts, and none can
validly have it from other hands: And ſo if you will but abate them the
proof of many things that ſtand in the way, Heaven and Hell, Salvation
and Damnation are at the will and mercy of ſuch Prelates and Prieſts. But
unhappily they cannot retrieve their old Opinion, but maintain that Lay-men
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61069:14"/>
and Women may baptize in neceſſity validly, and that Baptiſm puts one
into a State of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>XI. As he that ſwears and keeps his Allegiance to the King is a Subject
and Member of the Kingdom, though he be no Member of any Corporation;
ſo, though he diſown a thouſand fellow Subjects; yea, though he deny the
Authority of Conſtable, Juſtice, Judge; ſo he that is devoted to Chriſt
truly in the Baptiſmal Covenant, is a Chriſtian, and a Member of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church, though he were of no particular Church, or did diſown
a thouſand Members, or any particular Officer of the Church.</p>
                     <p>XII. All faults or crimes are not Treaſon: A man that breaketh any Law,
is in that meaſure Culpable or puniſhable: but every breach of Law, or
wrong to fellow Subjects or Juſtices, as it is not Treaſon, ſo it doth not
prove a man no Subject; though ſome may be ſo great as to deſerve death
and make him intolerable: And ſo it is in the caſe of our Subjection in the
Church to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>XIII. To own Chriſts Inſtituted <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Church Officers is needful to the
juſt Order, Safety and Edification of the Church (as to own the Courts of
Judicature, Juſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Kingdom) but to own this or that <hi>numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Officer</hi> as truly commiſſioned, is needful only to the right adminiſtration
of his own Province.</p>
                     <p>XIV. As Chriſt did his own work of <hi>univerſal Legiſlation</hi> by himſelf and
his <hi>Spirit</hi> eminently in the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, who have recorded all
in Scripture, ſo he ſettled Churches to continue to the end aſſociated for
Perſonal Communion in his holy <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip, Order</hi> and <hi>Converſation</hi>
with authorized Miniſters, ſubordinate to his adminiſtration in his <hi>Prophetical,
Prieſtly, Kingly</hi> and <hi>Friendly</hi> Relations. And thô theſe may not always or
often meet in the ſame place, their neighbourhood maketh them capable of
<hi>Perſonal</hi> preſential Communion, as men that may know and admoniſh each
other and meet by turns, and in preſence manage their concerns; which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceth
ſingle Churches of the loweſt order from aſſociated Churches of men,
that have Communion only by others at diſtance.</p>
                     <p>XV. As Logicians ſay of other Relations, the <hi>matter</hi> muſt be capable of
the <hi>end,</hi> or it is not capable of the name and form; ſo is it here: <hi>e. g.</hi> It is
no <hi>Ship</hi> that is made of meer Sponge or Paper, or that is no bigger than a
Spoon; it is no Spoon that is as big as a Ship: One Houſe is not a Village,
nor one Village a City, nor a City a meer Houſe. So twenty or an hundred
or a thouſand Pariſhes aſſociate, cannot be a <hi>ſingle Church</hi> of the <hi>firſt or loweſt
Order,</hi> being not capable of <hi>mutual Knowledge, Converſe</hi> or <hi>perſonal preſent
Communion:</hi> Nor are two or three Lay-men capable to be ſuch a Church,
for want of due matter. But ſuppoſing them capable, thô a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>rich</hi>
Church have advantage for <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> yet a <hi>ſmall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and <hi>poor</hi> one is
<hi>ejuſdem ordinis</hi> as truely a Church; and ſo is their Paſtor, as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Eugubium;</hi> ſo <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Mijuma,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gregory Neocaeſar</hi> was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61069:15"/>
equally Biſhop of nineteen at firſt, as after of all ſave nineteen in the City.</p>
                     <p>XVI. If the Apoſtles have Succeſſours in their care and Superiority over
many Churches, it will prove that there ſhould yet be men of eminent worth
to take care of many Churches, and to inſtruct and admoniſh the younger
Miniſters: But it will neither prove 1. That they ſucceed the Apoſtles in
the extraordinary parts of their Office. 2. Nor that they have any forcing
power by the Sword. 3. Nor that one <hi>Church</hi> hath power over others by
Divine right; for the Apoſtles fixed not their power to any particular
Churches, but were general <hi>Viſitors</hi> or Overſeers of many: Yet if the ſame
Man who is fixed in a particular Church, have alſo the <hi>viſiting admoniſhing
overſight</hi> of many as far as was an Ordinary part of the Apoſtles Office, and
be called an Archbiſhop, I know no Reaſon to be againſt him.</p>
                     <p>XVII. There be <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>Integral</hi> Acts of the Sacred Miniſtry inſtituted
by Chriſt: Theſe none may take the Power of from any Miniſters, nor alter the
<hi>ſpecies</hi> or <hi>integrity</hi> of the Office, by ſetting up any ſuch Superious as ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of that which Chriſt hath inſtituted, or arrogating the like uncall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But as in <hi>worſhip,</hi> ſo in <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Church Government,</hi> there are undetermined
accidents: As to chooſe the time and place of Synods, to preſide and moderate
and ſuch like: And theſe the Churches by agreement, or the Magiſtrate may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to ſome above the reſt: And if the Magiſtrate affix Baronies, Honours, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
or his own due Civil forcing Power, and make the ſame Men Magiſtrates
and Miniſters, whether we think it prudent and well done or not, we muſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and obey them.</p>
                     <p>XVIII. Some call theſe <hi>humane Accidental Orders, forms of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and affirm (as Biſhop <hi>Reignolds</hi> did, and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his Ireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
and many excellent men by him cited) that no <hi>form</hi> of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is of <hi>Divine Command.</hi> Which is true of all this ſecond ſort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is but Accidental aud humane; but not at all of the firſt ſort
which is Divine and Eſſential to Chriſt himſelf firſt, and to Paſtors as ſuch
by his appointment; ſo that the eſſential Government of the Univerſal
Church, by Chriſt, and of each particular Church by Paſtors ſpecified by
him (if not of Superviſors of many as ſucceeding Apoſtles and Evangeliſts in
their Ordinary work) are of unalterable Divine right. But the humane
forms are alterable: Such I account 1. The Preſidency and Moderator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and accidental Government of one Biſhop in a ſingle Church over the
other Presbyters, Deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. The accidental Government of a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan
as an Archbiſhop over theſe loweſt Biſhops and Churches. 3. And the
Superiority of Metropolitans and Patriarchs over them, ſo it be but in ſuch
<hi>Accidentals</hi> and within the ſame <hi>Empire,</hi> not impoſing a forreign Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Theſe <hi>tota ſpecie</hi> differ from the Divine Offices.</p>
                     <p>XIX. All theſe ſingle Church being parts of the Univerſal are leſs noble
than the whole, and are to do all that they do as members in Union with
the <hi>Whole,</hi> and to do all as Acts of Communion with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61069:15"/>
XX. The General precepts of doing all to Edification, Concord, Peace,
Order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> oblige all the Churches to hold ſuch correſpondencies as are
needful to theſe Ends: And Synods are one ſpecial means, which ſhould
be uſed as far and oft as the Ends require: And if National Metropolitans
and Patriarchs order ſuch Synods, I am not one that will diſobey them.
But if on theſe pretences any would make Synods more neceſſary than they
are, and uſe them as Governours, by Legiſlation and Judgement over the
Particular Biſhops by the uſe of the Church Keyes, and will affixe to them
or Metropolitans, beſides an <hi>Agreeing Power</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Government</hi> in Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals,
a proper Church Government by <hi>making and unmaking Miniſters</hi> or
<hi>Chriſtians, excommunicating</hi> and <hi>abſolving</hi> as Rulers by the ſaid Keyes, it may
be a duty to diſown ſuch uſurpations. As the King would diſown an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Princes any where met that would claim a Proper Government of him
and his Kingdom; Thô it were much to be wiſht that all Chriſtian Princes
would hold ſuch Aſſemblies for the Concord and Peace of Chriſtendom.</p>
                     <p>XXI. The Eſſentials of Faith, Hope and Loving Practice, eſſentiate the
Church objectively: And theſe are all ſummarily contained in the Baptiſmal
Covenant, explained in the Creed, Lords Prayer and Decalouge; and all
with much more, even Integrals and needful Accidentals in the Sacred
Scriptures, which taking in the Law of Nature, are Gods Univerſal Law.</p>
                     <p>XXII. There is no Church on Earth ſo ſound and Orthodox as to want
no Integral part of Chriſtian Religion: Proved: There is no man on Earth,
much leſs any multitude, ſo ſound as to want no Integral part: But all
Churches conſiſt only of Men; And therefore if all the Men be ſo far defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
all the Churches are ſo.</p>
                     <p>It is not their <hi>Objective Religion</hi> Generally and implicitely received that I
mean, but their <hi>Subjective Religion,</hi> and their explicite reception of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective.
The Scripture is our perfect Objective Religion in it ſelf, and as
an Object propoſed, and in general and implicitely we all receive it. But as
a man may ſay, I believe all that's in the Scripture, and yet be ignorant of the
very Eſſentials in it; ſo a man may explicitely know and believe all the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
and more, and yet be ignorant of many Integrals.</p>
                     <p>All things in Scripture propoſed to our Faith, Hope and Practice, are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrals
of our Religion: But no Chriſtian underſtandeth all theſe propoſals or
words of Scripture: Therefore no Chriſtian explicitely believeth them all, or
practiceth all. To hold the contrary, is to hold that ſome Church is perfect in
Underſtanding, Faith, Hope and Practice, without Ignorance, Errour or Sin:
that is, not to know what a man or a Chriſtian on Earth is.</p>
                     <p>XXIII. Much leſs do all Churches agree in unneceſſary indifferent acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
nor ever did, nor ever will or can do.</p>
                     <p>XXIV. The meaſuring out Churches by limits of Ground, Parochial or
Dioceſan, is a meer humane ordering of a mutable accident, and no Divine
Determination: And if all were taken for Church members-becauſe they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61069:16"/>
dwell in thoſe precincts, it were wicked: But if it be but all in thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts
that are qualified Conſenters, it is uſually a convenient meaſure:
But ſuch as in many Caſes muſt be broken.</p>
                     <p>XXV. If a Church with Faithful Paſtors be well ſetled in a place firſt
where there are not more than ſhould make up that one Church, it is not
meet for any there to gather a diſtinct Church (thô of the ſame Faith) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſuch weighty reaſon as will prove it neceſſary, or like to do more good
than hurt: 1. Becauſe Love inclineth to the greateſt Union; 2. Becauſe
a Great Church is more ſtrong and honourable than a ſmall, if the number
be not ſo great as to hinder the Ends. 3. And the Ancient Churches kept
this Union.</p>
                     <p>XXVI. If Magiſtrates make ſuch Laws about Church Accidents as tend to
further the Churches welfare, or are ſo <hi>pretended,</hi> and not <hi>againſt it,</hi> we
muſt obey them. But if they wiil either <hi>invade Chriſts Autherity</hi> or <hi>croſs it,</hi>
by making Laws <hi>againſt his,</hi> or ſuch as are <hi>proper to his Prerogative</hi> to make,
or invade the <hi>Paſtors Office,</hi> and the <hi>Churches proper right</hi> given by Chriſt, or
determine Accidents to the <hi>Deſtruction of the Subſtance</hi> (the Church, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Worſhip or Ends) theſe bind the Conſciences of none to Obedience;
but Chriſt muſt be obeyed, and we muſt patiently ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>XXVII. Self-intereſt, Self-Government and Family-Government are all
antecedent to Publick Government, which Ruleth them for the Common
good, but hath no Authority to deſtroy them: No King or Prelate can bind
a man to do that which would damn his Soul, nor to omit that which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to his Salvation: All power is for Edification: They are Gods Miniſters
for God.</p>
                     <p>XXVIII. As it belongs to ſelf-government to chooſe our own Dyet, and
Cloaths, and Wives, and Phyſicians, (thô we may be reſtrained from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
publick hurt on ſuch pretences;) And it belong to Family Government
to educate our own Children, and chooſe their Tutors, Callings, Wives,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo it more nearly belongs to ſelf-government to chooſe the moſt ſafe
and profitable means of our own Salvation, which no man may forbid us;
and to avoid that which is pernicious or hurtful; and to Family-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to do the like for our Children.</p>
                     <p>XXIX. It is falſe Doctrine of thoſe late Writers who tell us, that only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
ſanctifie or give right to Salvation: The whole Tenor of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
tells us that men are brought to Faith and Repentance, and to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and Godly men, and by Faith to be juſtified, by the Preaching of the
Goſpel: and that Gods word is his appointed means of Salvation, which his
Miniſters muſt preach skilfully, inſtantly, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, to
that End: And if the Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt.</p>
                     <p>XXX. The Goſpel ſaveth not like a Charm, by the bare ſound or ſaying
of the words; nor the Sacrament like an Amulet; But as a Moral means
(ſpecially bleſt by him that inſtituted it) to work on man as Man, by infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61069:16"/>
his Mind, perſwading his Will and exciting his Affections, as Men are
wrought on in other Caſes; (which methinks thoſe called Arminians ſhould
leaſt deny, who are ſaid to lay more of the Spirits operation on Moral ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
than their Adverſaries; yea and thoſe that account it Fanaticiſm to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any other gift of Prayer from the Spirit but what is given morally by
uſe.) And the contrary Doctrine feigneth God to Work even conſtantly by
Miracle: And as the Papiſts make every Maſs-Prieſt a Miracle Worker in
Tranſubſtantiation, ſo do they that make the bare ſaying over the Words and
doing the outward Acts in the Sacrament, to ſave us <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and
the Paſtoral teaching and overſight of an ignorant drunken Lad or Reader
to be (near)as great a help to Salvation, as the Miniſtry of a wiſe skilful, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and exemplary Paſtor, and the clear affectionate Preaching of Gods word:
And that tell us (as Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>) how ſufficient a man is to adminiſter the
Sacramental Covenant that underſtands what a Covenant is in matters of
Common Converſation.</p>
                     <p>XXXI. If a Wiſe: and Skilful and Conſcionable Miniſtry be as needleſs to
Edification and Salvation as ſome Men pretend, it is as needleſs that they
ſhould ſtudy to be ſuch, and vain to Glory that they are ſuch, and that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> hath ſuch a Miniſtry, and vain to expect that men ſhould
pay them any more reſpect than I owed my Maſter that never preacht but
once, and that drunken; (and divers very like him.) Or that they ſhould
uſe this as an argument to draw men to hear them.</p>
                     <p>XXXII. If the King or Law ſhould ſettle a Phyſician of his (or a Patrons)
choice in every Pariſh, it were well done if it be but to have help at hand
for Volunteers: Bui: if he command all to uſe them and to uſe no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them or againſt them, where unskilful or untruſty men are placed, no
man is bound to obey this command: No mens Law can diſſolve the Law
of Nature, nor diſoblige a man from a due care of his Life, nor bind him to
caſt it away upon Obedience to ignorant or bad and treacherous Men. And
a mans Soul is more precious than his Health or Life; and he is bound to
greater care of it; and is no more to truſt it on the will of his Superiours
How vaſt is the difference between an ignorant raſh Phyſician or Paſtor, and
one that is wiſe, experienced and truſty? They that ſcorn Men for going
for <hi>greater edification</hi> from one to another, do not ſo if a man prefer a skilful
Phyſician to one that kills more than he cures; or a skilful and careful Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for his Son, yea or a Farrier for his Horſe.</p>
                     <p>XXXIII. If one Preacher be not for Edification to be greatly preferred
before another, then <hi>One Book</hi> is not: And ſo it's no matter what Book they
read or value; and what a Student will this make? And what a Trade for
the Bookſellers? And why then ſhould their own Books be ſo valued? And
why then do they ſilence hundreds or thouſands and forbid them to preach
on pain of ruine, (thô no falſe Doctrine be proved againſt them) if they
think not that the difference is very great.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61069:17"/>
XXXIV. When Councils hereticated and condemned Thouſands or Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of Prieſts and Biſhops, whom Chriſtian Emperours and Princes owned
as Orthodox, they did not then think every Patron, Prince or Prelate a
competent Judge with what Paſtor Men ſhould truſt the conduct of their
Souls: Nor did they think ſo that forbad men hearing fornicators: Nor
<hi>Cyprian</hi> that required the People to forſake <hi>Baſilides</hi> and <hi>Martial (&amp; Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorem
Praepoſitum.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>XXXV. So full was the proof given in the Book called, <hi>The firſt Plea</hi> for
<hi>Peace,</hi> that the Church from the beginning denyed Princes and Magiſtrates
to be entruſted with the choice of Biſhops, or Paſtors to whom the Churches
were bound to truſt the conduct of their Souls, that he who denyeth it, is
not worthy to be, therein diſputed with. And yet we doubt not but they
may force Infidel Subjects and Catechumens to hear ſound and ſetled Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Catechiſts; And may diſpoſe of the Tythes, Temples and many
other Accidents of the Church; and may drive on Paſtors and People to their
Duty.</p>
                     <p>XXXVI. It is falſe Doctrine that <hi>two diſtinct Churches</hi> may not be in the
ſame Precincts or City; This being a meer Accident which abundance of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
make unneceſſary and unlawful: Which I ſhall prove.</p>
                     <p>That which is no where commanded by God, is no duty: But that
there ſhall be but one Church (or Biſhop) in the ſame Precincts, is not
commanded of God, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. (Divine of Gods making.)</p>
                     <p>They own the Major in the caſe of <hi>Indifferent</hi> thing. If they deny the
Minor let the affirmers prove any ſuch command. We grant a command of
Love and Concord, and a prohibition of all that is againſt them. But in
many inſtances, to have ſeveral Churches in the ſame precincts, is not againſt
them.</p>
                     <p>If they fly to the Canons of foreign Councils, the reaſon of them we ſhall
weigh and duely regard; But they were National, and had their Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Power only from their own Princes and their Counſelling Power only
from Chriſt: And we diſown all foreign Juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>XXXVII. In all theſe Caſes following (and more) two Churches may
be in the ſame precincts (yea and a City.)</p>
                     <p>1. In Caſe that ſeveral Biſhops are called juſtly to dwell in the ſame City,
or Dioceſs, and many of their Flock be with them, <hi>e. g.</hi> Many Biſhops of
<hi>England</hi> dwell long, yea moſtly in <hi>London</hi> or in <hi>London</hi> Dioceſs: <hi>e. g.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Eli</hi> dwells in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Andrews Holbourn: Qu.</hi> Whether
there he be a Subject to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> as his Paſtor, and bound to obey
him? or whether many out of his Dioceſs (thouſands) may not as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
dwell half the Year in <hi>London</hi> as he? And whether when he preacheth
to them, he do it not as their Biſhop (in <hi>London</hi> Dioceſs.) And ſo of many
other Biſhops that here reſide.</p>
                     <p>XXXVIII. 2. Either our Pariſh Churches are true Churches, or not. If
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61069:17"/>
not, the Separatiſts are ſo far in the right; And ſeparate not from true
Churches <hi>eo nomine</hi> becauſe they ſeparate from them. If yea, then many
Churches are in the ſame City and Dioceſs. (Of their agreement and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on the fame Biſhop I ſhall ſpeak anon.)</p>
                     <p>XXXIX. 3. In caſe that in one City, there be reſident Stranges, that are
ſent on Embaſſies, or live for Merchandize, or flee from Miſeries, and are
the Subject of other Princes, whoſe Laws and Cuſtoms they are under, <hi>e. g.</hi>
At <hi>Frankford, Hamburgh, Middleburgh, Dantzick, Conſtantinople,</hi> there have
been Engliſh diſtinct lawful Churches: And in <hi>London</hi> there are <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> Churches: And if the King allowed a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Church, a <hi>Daniſh</hi>
Church, a <hi>Saxon</hi> Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with their ſeveral Biſhops, who is ſo weak
as to need proof that this is lawful, and they true Churches?</p>
                     <p>XL. 4. In caſe men of different Language are not capable of mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
by perſonal communion or help: As <hi>Dutch, French, Italian, Greeks,
Germans,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (oft in <hi>Diſſert.</hi> and <hi>Annot.</hi>) do
maintain that <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> had a Church of <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> a Church of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi>
And that the like diſtribution of Churches of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there
was at <hi>Antioch, Alexandria</hi> and other places: And by this they Salve the
Contradictions in Church Hiſtory about the Succeſſion of <hi>Linus, Cletus</hi> and
<hi>Clemens:</hi> And the Apoſtles ſetled not a ſinful Church way.</p>
                     <p>XLI. 5. Yea <hi>Grotius</hi> maintaineth that the Apoſtles ſetled the Churches at
firſt not like the Jewiſh Prieſthood, but in the order of their Synagogues;
<hi>(de Imper. ſum. Pateſt.</hi> and in <hi>Annot.</hi>) And that as there were divers Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
in a great City with their <hi>Archiſynagogus</hi> and Elders, ſo there were
divers Churches in a City with Biſhops and Presbyters.</p>
                     <p>XLII. 6. When there are a greater number of Perſons in one City or
precinct than can have any juſt perſonal Knowledge and Communion, and
more than any one Biſhop with his Presbytery can perform the needful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral
overſight to, it is lawful and a duty, to gather another Church in that
City or Precinct: But this is truly the Caſe of many great Cities, though
worldly Wiſdom have at <hi>Rome,</hi> and other places oft denyed notorious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and experience. He that will gather up all the duties that Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
ſaith were charged on the Biſhops (in his Annotations on all the Texts
that name Elders and Biſhops) if he can believe that any Biſhop can perform
the tenth part of them to all in the Dioceſs of <hi>London, York, Lincoln, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
&amp;c. I will not diſpute againſt him if he maintain a Biſhops Ubiquity,
or that at once he can be in twenty places. But if they ſay, that what then
was commanded them to do perſonally, they may do by others, I ſay, that
if they may change the <hi>Work,</hi> they may change the <hi>Power,</hi> that ſpecifieth
the Office; and ſo it is not the ſame Office in <hi>ſpecie</hi> inſtituted in Scripture:
And then Lay-men may have Power to preach and adminiſter Sacraments,
and do the Office of Prieſts, and yet be no Prieſt (as Civilians do of Biſhops)
which is a Contradiction. Certainly if there be more Scholars in the City
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61069:18"/>
than one Maſter can Teach and Rule, it is no Schiſm to ſet up more Schools
and Schoolmaſters, but a duty. And if the Lord Mayor on pretence of City
Government ſhould put down but as great a part of Family Government,
as thoſe Dioceſans do of Parochial Church Government, who allow none
under them to be truly <hi>Epiſcopi Gregis,</hi> and have the power of their Church
Keyes, I think that it were no Schiſm to reſtore Families ſo that the City
might have more than one (entirely.)</p>
                     <p>XLIII. 7. If the Soveraign Power upon Politick or Religious Reaſons
ſhould determine, that <hi>e. g.</hi> Dr. <hi>A,</hi> and Dr. <hi>B,</hi> and Dr. <hi>C.</hi> ſhall all be
Biſhops in <hi>London,</hi> to ſuch Volunteers of Clergy and Laity as ſhall chooſe
each of them to be their Biſhop, and this without altering their dwellings,
no man can prove it ſinful; And of his reaſons the King is judge.</p>
                     <p>XLIV. 8. If the Biſhop or Clergy of a City, Dioceſs or Nation, do agree
by Law or Canon to admit none to the Miniſtry or Communion that will
not commit a known ſin deliberately as the Condition of his Communion,
it is a duty to congregate under Other Paſtors in thoſe precincts. This is
confeſt: If they ſhould not only hold any errour, or practiſe ſin, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
men to ſubſcribe and approve it, and ſay it is no ſin, no man ought to
do this; nor yet to live like an Atheiſt:, and forſake all Worſhip becauſe
men forbid him, if it were but to ſubſcribe one untruth: But alas, this is no
rare Caſe: In one Emperours Reign all were Anathematized that ſubſcribed
not to the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and quickly after all that did, or that would
not renounce it: The ſame diviſion and changes were made by the Councils
againſt and for the Monothelites, <hi>de tribus Capitulis,</hi> Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when
all Men living have many Errours, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> diſclaimeth
her Infallibility, and yet will receive no Miniſter that will not ſubſcribe that
there is nothing in her Books contrary to the word of God, the Caſe is hard.
But when all the things mentioned in the <hi>Plea for Peace</hi> are proved lawful,
we ſhall be more yielding in this Caſe.</p>
                     <p>XLV. 9. If true and ſound Chriſtians miſtakingly think one or many things
to be heinous ſins, (as Perjury, Lying, Renouncing Obedience to God,
and Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which are things indifferent, but of ſo great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that moſt Learned and Godly and Willing Men cannot diſcern the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and agree, and yet are not neceſſary nor juſt conditions of Miniſtry
or Communion, and ſo it is the Impoſer that entangleth them by difficulty
in their diſſeut, it is not lawful for theſe men therefore to forbear all Church
Worſhip, but muſt uſe it as they can.</p>
                     <p>XLVI. 10. If any Church unjuſtly excommnnicate ſuch men; or others,
they muſt not forbear all Church order and worſhip becauſe men ſo excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
them. No man muſt Sin to eſcape Excommunication; and every
man in the World is a ſinner:, And therefore all the World muſt be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
if all Sinners muſt be ſo. As I before ſaid, the times oft were
when almoſt all the Biſhops in the Empire were excommunicated by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61069:18"/>
Councils and Popes have oft excommunicated ſome for trifles and ſome
for Truth and Duty. And ſuch muſt not therefore renounce all Church
Worſhip and Communion.</p>
                     <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> do by their ſtanding Law <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
all (as aforeſaid) that affirm any thing to be repugnant to Gods Word
or ſinful, in their whole Church Government, Articles, Liturgy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and ſo to ſtand till they Publickly revoke this as a wicked Errour.
Now many Lords and Commoners in Parliaments, have ſpoken againſt ſome
of theſe particulars; and ſome out of Parliament: Many Miniſters have
done the like when the King Commiſſioned them to treat for Alterations;
And many when the Accuſations or demands of others have called them to
give a Reaſon of their Actions. Some have maintained that it is repugnant
to Gods word that Lay Civilians ſhould have the decretive Power of the
Keyes, and that the Pariſh Miniſter muſt caſt out of Communnion all that the
Lay Doctors or Chancellors excommunicate, and all that dare not receive
kneeling, and that they ſhould deny Chriſtendom to all that ſcruple the
Engliſn ſort of God-Fathers Covenants, and the tranſient Symbolical Image
of the Croſs, with abundance ſuch things: Now all theſe are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate.
And thô they be not bound to avoid the Church till this be
applicatorily declared, yet <hi>actually excommunicate</hi> they are, and that by a
higher authority than the Biſhops; and they know the Churches decree; and
the Prieſts are ſworn to Canonical Obedience; And he that will not tempt
them to be forſworn, nor come into a Church that hath excommunicated him,
ſeems therein excuſeable: But muſt he therefore renounce the Church of God?</p>
                     <p>XLVII. 11. If the People are ſo ſet againſt one Biſhop for another, as that
half being for one and half for the other, and both Orthodox, they cannot be
perſwaded to unite in one. A Council at <hi>Rome</hi> determined in the Caſe of <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
and <hi>Flavian</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> that both of them ſhould hold their diſtinct Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and ſo live in love and peace. And though one or both parties in this
were miſtaken Sinners, ſo are all morral men, who yet muſt not live like Atheiſts.</p>
                     <p>XLVIII. 12. An undetermined accident muſt be ſo determined as moſt
ſerveth to do the greateſt good and avoid the greateſt Evil: But whether
divers Churches ſhall promiſcuouſly live in the ſame City or Dioceſs or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſn,
is an Accident not determined by God, and either way may be for the
greateſt good, as circumſtances vary. <hi>e.g.</hi> When in a Church half cannot
conſent to condemn the words of <hi>Theodoret, Theodore Mopſueſt,</hi> and <hi>Ibas,</hi>
and half will condemn them with the Council; if theſe can ſerve God quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Love and Peace in different Congregations, but cannot endure one
another in the ſame, it is moſt for the Churches Peace that they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to joyn with thoſe of their own Mind.</p>
                     <p>When one Pope declared that it's ſound Doctrine to ſay [<hi>One of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
was Crucified,</hi>] when another had declared that it is <hi>not ſound Doctrine,</hi>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61069:19"/>
they that held with one Pope, and they that held with the other might both
be true Churches in different Aſſemblies: When <hi>Juſtinian</hi> raiſed the bloody
controverſie between the <hi>Corrupticolae</hi> and the <hi>Phantaſiaſtae,</hi> wiſe men thought
both ſides were true Churches: Yea and ſo did many wiſe men think of the
Orthodox and <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and many <hi>Eutychians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>XLIX. 13. It's a common caſe under Turks and Heathens, that they give
liberty of Conſcience for Chriſtians of all parties: Now ſuppoſe that in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi>
in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> or elſewhere, there be (partly for Countrey ſake and
partly for Language, but moſt for different Judgments) one Church of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi>
one of <hi>Greeks,</hi> one of <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> &amp;c. what Law of God makes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one of theſe to be a true Church, and which is it?</p>
                     <p>L. 14. Suppoſe that the ſetled Church <hi>e. g.</hi> in <hi>Holland, Sweden, Saxony,</hi> is
for Presbytery, or for an Epiſcopacy that aroſe from Presbyters ordination,
or that had none or a ſhort Liturgy, and the Prince would tolerate Engliſh
men (as <hi>Frankford</hi> did) to ſet up a Church of the Engliſh Form and Liturgy,
I think few Prelatiſts would deny it to be lawful.</p>
                     <p>LI. I omit other inſtances, and come to the matter of <hi>Separation,</hi> which
word ſerveth this man and ſuch other in ſo general and undiſtinguiſhed a
ſence, as would make one think he were of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s mind, <hi>That words in
diſpute have but one ſignification, which all are bound to know that uſe them.</hi> Even a
Bell by the ſame ſound ſometime ſignifieth a call to Church, and ſometime a
Funeral, and ſometime Joy; but [<hi>Separate, Separate</hi>] is rung over and over
with theſe men, as if it ſignified but one thing.</p>
                     <p>1. He that heareth half the Sermon and Service, and goeth out of Church,
doth <hi>Separate</hi> at that time from the reſt.</p>
                     <p>When a Proteſtant Heretick was doing Penitence with his Faggot at St.
<hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Fryer was Preaching, a miſtaken Voice in the
ſtreet made them think the Hereticks had ſet the Church on fire, and they <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi>
from the Preacher, one Fryer ſtuck by the belly that was going out at
the window; the door being wedged with the crowd, a Boy that ſaw it open
above their heads, got up on their ſhoulders, and went on 'till he ſlipt into a
Monks Cowl, and there lay ſtill 'till the Monk was got out, and felt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on his back, and thinking it was an heretical Devil, began to conjure
him in the Name of Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, to tell him what he was,
and the Boy cryed, <hi>O good Maſter I am the Bakers boy,</hi> &amp;c. Quaere, Whether
this was <hi>Schiſmaticks ſeparation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At <hi>Walſall</hi> in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lapthorne</hi> (known to me in his Iuſty age)
who had been a Non-conformiſt, but thought it an honour to be converted
by a King, and gloried that King <hi>James</hi> in conference changed him; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as ruſtick a thunderer as Father <hi>Latimer</hi> and more, he was wont to let
fly without much fear; one Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> in the Pariſh accounted the greateſt
enemy to Puritans, when he heard what he liked not, would goe out of
Church; one day (in a path way where Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> had rode a little before)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61069:19"/>
pelting Crabs with a pole, the ground opened and ſwallowed him and his
pole, that they could never be found (being a Cole-mine long on fire;) ever
after that, when any one would goe out of Church at a bluſtering paſſage,
Mr. <hi>Lapthorne</hi> would call to him, <hi>Remember Martin;</hi> Quere, Whether all
theſe were ſeparating Schiſmaticks?</p>
                     <p>But this is too far off: In <hi>Dunſtans</hi> Weſt, where Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> Preacheth,
when I was licenſed: twenty, years ago, at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> as I was Preaching, ſome
Lime or Stone fell down in the Steeple with the crowd, the Church being
old and under ſuſpicion, they all thought it was falling, and moſt ran out
in tumult, and ſome caſt themſelves headlong from the Gallery for haſt;
when they were quieted and came in again, the Boyes in the Chancel broke
a Wainſcot Skreen with climbing on it, and the noiſe made them run out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
one old woman going out, cryed, It's juſt with God becauſe I took
not the firſt warning, Lord forgive me, and I'le never come again: Quere,
Whether theſe, or at leaſt this reſolving Woman was a Schiſmatick, and
ſeparated from the Catholick Church?</p>
                     <p>If not, there is ſome ſeparation that is not ſo bad as Murder; and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
the Doctor ſhould forgive it for the ſucceſs; for the Pariſh hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
reſolved to pull down the Church and build it new, a far better Fabrick
where the Dr. now Preacheth; and it drove me away that I preacht there
no more; Whether this new Church built where the old one had poſſeſſion
before, be not a Schiſmatical Separatiſt, I leave to him.</p>
                     <p>LII. 2. <hi>Local</hi> Separation without <hi>Mental</hi> can make no culpable Schiſm;
for <hi>Nil niſi Voluntarium eſt morale;</hi> if a man be impriſoned or be ſick and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come to the Church, it is innocent Separation; I have been at no Church
this half year, much againſt my will, O that God would heal me of this
Separation!</p>
                     <p>LIII. 3. If it muſt be <hi>mental Separation</hi> that muſt be culpable, then it is
diverſified according to the mental degree and kind; and no man ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
from the univerſal Church who ſeparateth not from ſomewhat <hi>eſſential
to</hi> it; to ſeparate from its <hi>Integrals</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> may be culpable, but it's no
<hi>Separation from the Church,</hi> no more than every breach of the Law is a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>LIV. 4. Some ſeparate as to place, locally and not mentally, ſome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
and not locally, and ſome both: He that daily obſerveth the outward
Communion of the Church, and yet taketh it for no Church, or denyeth its
Faith, Hope or eſſential Duty, ſeparateth indeed. All thoſe men that <hi>live</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believingly,
atheiſtically, wickedly, that in their converſe prate againſt the
Scripture and immortality of the Soul, and that hate and perſecute ſerious
Godlineſs, are damnably ſeparated from Chriſt, and therefore from, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, and are ſo to be eſteemed ſo far as this is known, thô when, it
is unknown, the Church can take no notice of it.</p>
                     <p>LV. 5. It being only <hi>Humane Laws</hi> and <hi>Circumſtantial Conveniences</hi> that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61069:20"/>
make it unmeet to have divers Churches Biſhops living promiſcuouſly in
the ſame Pariſhes, Cities, Dioceſes or Nations; where Laws and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
allow it, it is no unlawful ſeperation.</p>
                     <p>LVI. 6. He that liveth in forreign Lands (Chriſtian, Mahometan or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then)
where various Churches live promiſcuouſly (<hi>Greeks, Armenians, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
Papiſts,</hi> &amp;c.) is no Schiſmatick, if he chooſe which he thinks beſt,
and be abſent locally from the reſt, condemning them no further than they
deſerve.</p>
                     <p>LVII. 7. He that removeth into another Dioceſs or Pariſh for his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intereſt, ſeperateth without fault from the Church he was in.</p>
                     <p>LVIII. 8. It is a lawful ſeparation to remove ones dwelling, becauſe the
Miniſter is ignorant, unskilful, or otherwiſe bad, and this for the better
edification of his Soul, and the uſe and help of a more able faithful Miniſter,
even Law and Cuſtome and reaſon do allow it.</p>
                     <p>LIX. 9. Thô the Canon 57. and 28. forbid Miniſters oft to give the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Strangers that come out of other Pariſhes, even where no Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, yet thoſe many ſober People that uſe this in <hi>London,</hi> are not taken
to be Schiſmaticks, as bad as Murders: Many that are eſteemed the
moſt ſober religious Conformiſts do ordinarily goe from their own Pariſh
Churches, ſome (in <hi>Martins</hi> and St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Pariſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) for want of room,
and ſome for more Edification, to Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hornech</hi> and ſuch others, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with them; and thô theſe are called by the late Catholicks by the
Name of <hi>Dangerous Trimmers,</hi> I think even Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> will think it more
pardonable than <hi>Murder,</hi> if they come to <hi>him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>LX. 10. If the King and Law ſhould reſtore the antient order that every
City, that is, every great incorporate Town in <hi>England</hi> ſhould have a Biſhop,
(yea or every great Pariſh) and that the Dioceſans ſhould be their Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and our new Catholicks ſhould tell the King and Parliament that they
are hereby unchriſtened Schiſmaticks, as dangerous as Adulterers of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
for gathering Churches within a Church, I would not believe them.</p>
                     <p>LXI. 11. If (<hi>e.g.</hi> at <hi>Frankford, Zurick, Lubeck, Hamburgh,</hi> &amp;c.) a Church
is ſettled in the <hi>Lutheran</hi> way, and another in the <hi>Bochemian</hi> way, deſcribed
by <hi>Laſitius</hi> and <hi>Commenius,</hi> (which is a conjunction of Epiſcopacy, Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Independency) or a Church that had no Liturgy, or none but that
which the French Proteſtants and Dutch have, would it be damning Schiſm,
for ſuch as <hi>Cox</hi> and <hi>Horne</hi> at <hi>Frankford</hi> to ſet up an Epiſcopal Church in the
Engliſh mode, and with their Liturgy, and ſo far to ſeparate from the
reſt?</p>
                     <p>LXII. 12. If it be true that <hi>John Maior, Fordon,</hi> and others ſay that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
was the Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> before Epiſcopacy was
brought in, was the introduction of Epiſcopacy by <hi>Palladius</hi> a damning
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61069:20"/>
Schiſm by ſeparating from the former, or a Reformation; is juſt Reformation Schiſm?</p>
                     <p>LXIII. 13. When the Church firſt ſet up Patriarchs, Metropolitans,
General Councils, Monaſteries, Pariſh Churches diſtinct from Cathedrals,
Organs, New Liturgies, and multitudes of Ceremonies, this was a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or ſeparating from the contrary Church way which was there before,
was it therefore Schiſm?</p>
                     <p>LXIV. 14. When <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us of ſome Countreys that had Biſhops in
the Countrey Villages (like our Pariſhes) was it a damning Schiſm to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from this cuſtome, by decreeing that even ſmall Cities ſhould have
no Biſhops, <hi>Ne vileſcat nomen Epiſcopi?</hi> or when the <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> were put down, where they had been?</p>
                     <p>LXV. 15. If a man ſeparate not from any thing eſſential to the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> he ſeparateth not from that Church, though he refuſe that which
is its Accidents, or ſome Integral parts: We are charg'd with ſeparating
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as if it were a matter of fact beyond diſpute,
and ſcorn'd for denying it, even by them that will not tell us what they mean
by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or by <hi>Separation.</hi> By the Church of <hi>England</hi> we
mean the <hi>Chriſtian Kingdom</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or all the Chriſtians in <hi>England,</hi> as
living in one land, under One Chriſtian <hi>King who Governeth them by the Sword,</hi>
which includeth their Concord among themſelves in true Chriſtianity; we
are Chriſtians, we profeſs agreement in Chriſtianity with all Chriſtians
we are under the ſame King as they are, and profeſs ſubjection, and take;
the ſame Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; yea, we are not charged with
differing in any thing called Doctrinal from their Thirty Nine Articles; but
we diſown certain late Covenants and Oaths which are not Twenty three
Years old, and the Subſcription to one Canon about the Innocency of all in
their Liturgy; now either theſe new Oaths, Covenants and Canon, Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and Ceremonies are eſſential to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or not; If yea,
then, 1. It's a poor humane Church, made by them that made theſe Oaths,
Liturgy and Ceremonies. 2. And then it's a new upſtart Church, and no
man can anſwer the Papiſts where it was before <hi>Luther,</hi> or before <hi>Henry</hi> 8.
yea, if its eſſentials were made by this King and Parliament, 1662. then
the preſent Church is no older: But if theſe things be <hi>indifferent,</hi> or <hi>not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
to the Church, then to ſeparate only from theſe, is not to ſeparate from the Church.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid, <hi>That for the ſake of theſe we ſeparate from the Church it ſelf, and
therefore from its eſſence;</hi> we abhor the accuſation, and challenge them to prove it:
If we ſeparate from the Church eſſentially, it is either <hi>Locally</hi> or <hi>Mental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
not <hi>Locally,</hi> for we are yet in <hi>England,</hi> nor is <hi>Local diſtance only</hi> a ſin;
not <hi>Mentally,</hi> for we own it for a true Chriſtian Kingdom, called <hi>a National
Church,</hi> bound to ſerve Chriſt in Love and Concord to their Power: We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not the King to be the Governour, nor Chriſtians to be Chriſtians, no
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61069:21"/>
nor the particular Churches and Miniſters to be true (thô culpable) Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Miniſters, nor their Sacraments to be true Sacraments; we profeſs to
hold with them one Catholick Body, one Spirit, one God, one Chiriſt, one
Faith, one Baptiſm (in the eſſentials) and one Hope, and are ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to live in Concord with them in all other things, as far as will ſtand
with our Obedience to God; ſo that we ſeparate not from the Church of
<hi>England as ſuch,</hi> but from ſome of its <hi>Accidents,</hi> which we dare not be guilty
of.</p>
                     <p>LXVI. 16. The ſame I ſay of a <hi>Pariſh Church;</hi> he that locally removeth,
<hi>e. g.</hi> from a Church that hath <hi>Organs,</hi> to one that hath none, ſeparateth from
a pair of Organs, but not <hi>Mentally</hi> from the Church, unleſs the Organs be
its eſſence.</p>
                     <p>LXVII. 17. They that are for the true antient Epiſcopacy, (<hi>e. g.</hi> as much
as Arch-Biſhop <hi>Vſher</hi>'s Reduction which we offer'd did contain) but diſlike
the Lay Civilians power of the Keyes, and Officials, Surrogates, Arch-deacons
Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not ſeparate from the Church as Epiſcopal, but from
the humane Novelties which they diſown.</p>
                     <p>LXVIII. 18. If a Pariſhioner fall out with his Prieſt, and they goe to Law
about Tythes, Glebes, Words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Suit be long, and the man dare
not Communicate with him believing that he hateth him, thô the animoſity
ſhould be culpable, being but perſonal, his going from-him to another Church
is not ſeparating from Chriſt; (for I hope that even Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> himſelf will
not ſay that every Prieſt is Chriſt.)</p>
                     <p>LXIX. 19. <hi>Ex quovis ligno non fit Mercurius,</hi> ſurely there is ſome qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
eſſential to the Miniſtry; if a man want that qualification, it is a Duty
to ſeparate from him as no Miniſter, <hi>e. g.</hi> When I came to <hi>Kederminſter,</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my ſubjection to ſix or ſeven worſe) I found the Vicar, one reputed ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the Fundamentals, (he was brought in by Sir <hi>Henry Blunt</hi> a Papiſt)
who Preacht but once a quarter, which moſt thought he might better have
forborn, and his Curate Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> at <hi>Mitton</hi> Preacht once a day, whom I
found ignorant of the Catechiſm Principles by Conference, and he confeſt he
had but one Book, <hi>Muſculus common places in Engliſh,</hi> and he ſaid ſome of
that to the People, and they took it for a Sermon; he lived by unlawful
Marrying, infamous for Drinking and Quarrelling; he that had taken theſe
for no Miniſters, and ſeparated from them, had not thereby ſeperated from
Chriſt or his Church Catholick.</p>
                     <p>LXX. 20. If it prove as hard to know who is the true Paſtor in a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Pretenders, as it was to know which was the true Pope, when there
were two or three, (above twenty times) or whether, <hi>e. g. Optandus</hi> was
true Biſhop of <hi>Geneva</hi> that knew not Letters, or whether Duke <hi>Heriberts</hi> Son
conſecrated in Infancy was Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> or any other Infant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
be a Biſhop, (officiating <hi>per alios, Surrogates, Chancellours, Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi>
&amp;c.) it is not here a Separation from Chriſt to ſeparate from either of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61069:21"/>
the Pretenders: He that miſtaketh not, is not liable to the Charge, he that
miſtakes, doth not erre in an Article of Faith, but in a difficult point of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
title, and the qualification and right of a ſingle man; and my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, that if ſuch a title were tryed before our Judges or King, and they
ſhould miſtake and give Judgment againſt him that had right, this were no
ſeparating from Chriſt, nor proof that they are Infidels.</p>
                     <p>LXXI. 21 If the Caſe of two contending Biſhops or Presbyters come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a General or Provincial Council, and they miſtake and give it to the
wrong, and ſo ſeparate from the right, I do not think that thereby they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from Chriſt or the Church Catholick, <hi>e. g.</hi> The Conſtantinopolitan
Council firſt gave the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Nazianzene,</hi> and after judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him out as having no right; if by this they ſeparated from Chriſt, they
that take them for the Catholick Church repreſentative, muſt ſay that the
Catholick Church ſeparated from Chriſt and it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>When another Council wrongfully depoſed <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and ſeparated
from him, and <hi>Cyril Alexandr.</hi> perſwaded the continuance of it, did the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church ſeparate from it ſelf and Chriſt? If a General Council which
ſhould be wiſeſt, be excuſable from damning Schiſm, whenever it misjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and ſeparateth from a rightful Biſhop, ſure every Lay-man and woman that doth the ſame, doth not ſeparate from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>If it prove that a General Council depoſed <hi>Neſtorius</hi> as unjuſtly as <hi>David
Derodon</hi> thought, or <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> as unjuſtly as others thought, or <hi>Flavian</hi> as
unjuſtly as the Orthodox think, this proveth them Guilty of ſome Schiſm,
but not of ſeparating from the univerſal Church.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Menna</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the Pope excommunicated each other,
when a Synod in <hi>Italy</hi> renounced <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and all his Succeſſors were an
hundred years depoſed from their Primacy, and a Patriarch at <hi>Aquileia</hi> ſet
up in his ſtead for a great part of <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſubſcribed to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council, <hi>de tribus Capitulis,</hi> this was Schiſm (ſome where) but not
ſeparating from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>LXXII. 22. If a man in <hi>England</hi> ſhould think that all the old Councils
were obligatory, which decree that he ſhall be taken for no Biſhop that comes
in by the choice (yea or Mediation) of Courtiers, Princes or great men,
or any that have not the true Conſent of Clergy and People, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould conclude that Biſhops, Deans, Prebends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo choſen and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
are Lay-men and no true Biſhops and Paſtors, this were a ſeparating
from <hi>thoſe Perſons,</hi> but not from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Vniverſal Church,</hi> when as
Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> ſaith, that <hi>till the right</hi> of <hi>Electing</hi> Biſhops <hi>by the Clergy</hi> and
<hi>People be reſtored, we need look no further for the reaſon of the Contempt of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
here.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So if a man think that God never truſted every Ignorant Wicked man that
can but get Money and buy an Advowſon, to chooſe thoſe Paſtors to whoſe
conduct all the People are bound to truſt their Souls, (and the Biſhop to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61069:22"/>
them for fear of a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> if they have but a Certificate and can
ſpeak Latine) This is not damning Separation.</p>
                     <p>LXXIII. 23. If a Biſhop ſet up a ſeeming Convert, really a Papiſt (<hi>e. g.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> alias <hi>Berry,</hi> or one of them that lately Confeſſed themſelves
Papiſts,) the People that find by experience what the man is, are not damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Schiſmaticks for not taking him for their Paſtor, or for going from him.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Godfrey Goodman</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> was a Papiſt, did he ſeparate from
Chriſt that ſeparated from the Dioceſan Church of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> while he was
an Eſſential part? Or that did not implicitely truſt all the Prieſts that he
ordained?</p>
                     <p>LXXIV. 24. If in a Cathedral Church one withdraw from their Service,
becauſe of their difference in ſinging, Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the Pariſh
Churches, thô it be the Biſhops Church that he ſeparateth from, it is not
as a Church, nor from any thing eſſential to it, <hi>e. g. Miles Smyth</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Glouceſter</hi> (the famous <hi>Hebrician,</hi> and chief in our Bibles Tranſlation) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and performed it, that he would never come more to his Cathedral,
becauſe the Dean (in <hi>Lauds</hi> time) kept up the Altar. <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether he
ſeparated from himſelf or his Church? <hi>Vbi Epiſcopus ibi Eccleſia:</hi> Who were
the Separatiſts? They that followed the Biſhop, or they that ſeparated from
him and kept to the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>hedral? The ſame I ſay of <hi>Williams</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>
that wrote againſt Altars.</p>
                     <p>LXXV. 25. If faithful Paſtors and People are ſetled in concord, and the
higher Powers make a Law to depoſe and eject them without juſt cauſe (as
Multitudes were in many Emperours dayes, and Multitudes by the <hi>Interim</hi>
in <hi>Germany</hi> in <hi>Charles</hi> the fifths time; and Multitudes in the Palatinate by
<hi>Ludovicus,</hi> and in too many other Countreys) thoſe that leave the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Tythes to the Magiſtrate, but cleave to their old Paſtors in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
meetings (called Conventicles) ſuppoſing the Paſtoral Relation not
diſſolved (as the <hi>Joannites</hi> clave to <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) do not thereby ſeparate
from the Catholick Church: Had the Power been lawful that ſet up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, when Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi> kept up his Meetings at <hi>Exeter</hi> Houſe, it had
not been a Separation from Chriſt that he then made.</p>
                     <p>LXXVI. 26. If the Law command all to take one man for his Paſtor, and
a Parent command his Child, or a Husband his Wife to take another and
not that, and the Child or Wife know not which ſhould be obeyed, and
whether the choice belong more to the Domeſtick, or the Publick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is not a ſeparating from Chriſt, which way ever ſuch an one ſhall
go.</p>
                     <p>LXXVII. 27. Yea if I ſhould think that ſelf-Intereſt and ſelf-Government
bind me rather to chooſe a Paſtor for my ſelf, than to ſtand to ſuch a choice
by Prince, Patron or Prelate, which I think intolerable, as well as (againſt
their will) I may chooſe a Wife, or a Phyſician, or a Tutor, or a Book, or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61069:22"/>
my daily food, this is not ſeparating from the Univerſal Church.</p>
                     <p>LXXVIII. 28. If owning the ſame Dioceſan make them of one Church
who differ more than Nonconformiſts and Conformiſts do, then owning
the ſame Chriſt, Faith, Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> maketh them of one Catholick
Church who differ leſs. But, <hi>&amp;c. Jeſuites, Dominicans, Janſeniſts,</hi> and all
the Sects of Papiſts are taken for one Church, becauſe they own the Pope
and Councils. In <hi>England</hi> the Dioceſan Conformiſts are taken for one
Church, thô ſome of them are as much for a Foreign Juriſdiction, as Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<hi>Laud,</hi> Arch-biſhop <hi>Bromhall,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Gunnings</hi> Chaplain, Dr. <hi>Saywell,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and many more, have manifeſted in their
words and writings. And ſome that ſubſcribe the Articles of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
erring in Faith and againſt Heathens Salvation, and againſt free will,
and for Juſtification by Faith only, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do ſhew that they differ in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Religion, (unleſs the ſound or ſyllables be its
Religion)
while one and another take the words in contrary ſences. Some are for
Dioceſans being a diſtinct Order from Presbyters, ſome (as <hi>Vſher</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch) deny it: Some hold them to be of Divine Right, and ſome but of
humane; ſome think the King muſt chooſe them, ſome rather the Clergy and
People; ſome hold them Independent, others rather ſubject to the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Convocation; ſome think all that bear Office in their Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
are lawful, others think Lay-Civilians Government by the Keyes
unlawful (and ſo are <hi>ipſo facto excommunicate</hi> by their own Canons;) ſome
that promiſe Canonical Obedience to their Ordinary, take the Judges of
the Eccleſiaſtical Courts for their Ordinaries; and others only the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops;
ſome think they are ſworn to obey their Ordinaries, if they
rule according to the Canons (and ſo to pronounce all Excommunicate
that the Canon excommunicates, if commanded;) Others think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that they are judges themſelves whether the Canons command
<hi>licita &amp; honeſta;</hi> ſome take the Pope to be Antichriſt, and the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> no true Church; others think otherwiſe. Many more (Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
and other) ſuch differences there are, and yet all of one Church, both
Catholick, National, Dioceſan and Parochial (oft:) Much more are thoſe
Nonconformiſts that differ from the Church in nothing but what the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
call Indifferent.</p>
                     <p>LXXIX. 29. If one that prayeth in the Litany againſt falſe Doctrine and Schiſm,
and readeth the Conformiſts telling him of the danger of it, ſhould;
verily think that Dr. <hi>S.</hi> printeth and preacheth falſe Doctrine, and ſuch
as plainly tendeth to ſerve Satan againſt Chriſtian Love and Peace, and to
the moſt Schiſmatical dividing and damning of Chriſtians, ſhould hereupon
ſeparate from him for fear of Schiſm and falſe Doctrine, and go to a ſafer
Paſtor, I think it were not to ſeparate from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>LXXX. 30. If a Biſhop in any Dioceſs in <hi>London</hi> ſhould openly write or
plead for a Foreign Juriſdiction, and we are told that none are true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61069:23"/>
that depend not obediently on the Biſhop, he that for fear of the
Law, or of Perſonal or common perjury, ſhould ſeparate from that
Biſhop and his numerical Dioceſan Church, doth thereby neither ſeparate
from the Catholick Church, nor from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> As if the
Kings Army ſhould have a Colonel that declared himſelf an obliged Subject
to the King of <hi>France</hi> and bound to obey him, the Regiment may forſake
that Colonel. Yea if the General of the Kings Army ſhould give up himſelf
in ſubjection to the Enemy or a Foreign Power, and ſay, I <hi>will take a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from</hi> the <hi>Turk,</hi> and my <hi>Officers ſhall only obey me,</hi> and the <hi>Soldiers</hi> obey
them, were not this an Army of Traytors or Rebels, though none but the
General took a Commiſſion from the Enemy? So if the Biſhops ſhould all
take Commiſſions from the Pope, or declare themſelves Subjects to a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Juriſdiction, it were no ſeparating from Chriſt, to ſeparate from
them all, in Loyalty to Chriſt, and to avoid National perjury and
Schiſm.</p>
                     <p>LXXXI. 31. If a man think that he is bound to uſe all Chriſts inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
means of Salvation, and live in a Church that wilfully omitteth any
one of them, <hi>e. g.</hi> either Infant baptiſm, or ſinging Pſalms, or Praying,
or Preaching, or the Lords Supper, or all Perſonal care, and diſcipline to
exclude the groſly intolerable, to reſolve the doubting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that in
Obedience to Chriſt goeth to a Church and Paſtor (in the ſame Dioceſs or City)
that omitteth none of theſe, is no damned Schiſmatick.</p>
                     <p>LXXXII. 32. He that is unjuſtly caſt out of the Church, and by its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Laws excommunicated <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> is no damned or Sinful Schiſmatick for
Worſhipping God in a Church that will receive him: Nor any one that is
denyed Communion unleſs he will ſin; Much more if they ſhould prove
half as many and great Sins as the Nonconformiſts have ſaid they fear (in
the firſt Plea for Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>LXXXIII. 33. If a Foreigner that doth but half underſtand our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
withdraw to a Church and Paſtor whoſe tongue he underſtands,
obeying God and Nature is no damning Schiſm.</p>
                     <p>LXXXIV. 34. If one that is erroneouſly conceited of the obligation of
General Councils, ſhould think it a ſin to kneel at the Sacrament on any
Lords day in the year, or any Week day between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi>
becauſe Tradition and the twentieth Canon of the firſt Council, and that at
<hi>Trull, &amp;c.</hi> do forbid then to adore kneeling, this ſeparating on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to another Congregation is not damning.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Thorndike and others tell us that it is not neceſſary that
we do the ſame things which the Supream Catholick Power commanded, but that
we ſubject our ſelves to the ſame Power which may change their own Laws.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
1. The aſſerting of that Univerſal Soveraignty is the greateſt Crime
and Hereſie of all. 2. By this it ſeems that our Religion is very mutable,
and very uncertain, and a man hath need to take heed of obeying any old
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61069:23"/>
Canons, till he know the mind of the preſent Church; (and who thoſe be,
and how to know it.) 3. But what if the ſame man read Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> (of
Sab.) telling him that this cuſtome againſt <hi>Adoration-kneeling</hi> continued a
thouſand years, and was never revok't by any true General Council, but
changed by little and little by mens practice: And what if he queſtion who
thoſe Changers were, and whether their practice was Rebellion at firſt,
and whether they had power to repeal the Canons of the greateſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
without a Council. Sure they that are for ſuch Councils univerſal ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
when they have caſt men into theſe ſhares, ſhould ſcarce tell them
that they are damnable Schiſmaticks, for joyning with ſuch Churches as obey
theſe Councils, rather than with thoſe that mine men for not diſobeying
them.</p>
                     <p>LXXXIV. And now Reader if thou art one that thinkeſt of theſe things
with Chriſtian Sobriety and impartiality, I appeal to thee whether if
I ſhould be of the mind of Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> and ſuch ſelf-conceited <hi>Reſolvers,</hi>
I ſhould not write my own Condemnation, and be one of the groſſeſt
Schiſmaticks that any Hiſtory hath mentioned, unleſs ever there were any
man ſo mad as to hold himſelf to be all the Church: Yea, when he no more
diſtinguiſheth of Separation and Schiſm, but involves almoſt all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in his Condemnation, and tells us that Schiſm will damn us as ſoon
as Adultery and Murder, is it not obvious for all men to infer that we are
as <hi>odious</hi> as <hi>Adulterers</hi> and <hi>Murderers?</hi> and doth he not Preach Chriſtians
into the <hi>hatred</hi> of <hi>each</hi> other? and can any wonder if Rulers ſhould think
the Puniſhment of <hi>Murderers</hi> is not worſe than we deſerve? It is not <hi>New-gate</hi>
only, but <hi>Tyburn</hi> that theſe healing men do ſeem to aſſign us; it would
be too tedious to look over all theſe again, and ſhew you how great the
number is that theſe men damn, and how few on Earth in any Age they
excuſe from being ſo far like Murderers.</p>
                     <p>LXXXV. 1. It ſeems to me that he <hi>virtually</hi> damneth all Chriſtians on
Earth as ſuch Schiſmaticks; for it is moſt certain that all men have ſin,
and culpable imperfection in Knowledge, Will and Practice; and if any
ſay, <hi>That he hath no ſin, he is a Lyar,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John;</hi> and it is certain that
all two perſons on Earth have many errours, and many differences from
one another; it is certain that the Love and Duty of Chriſtians towards
each other is culpably defective in all men: It is certain that no man living
is ſo perfect in knowledge as to know all the <hi>indifferent</hi> things in the world,
which may be impoſed, to be <hi>Indifferent!</hi> And long and ſad experience
hath told the Church, that both groſs errours and ſins, and things called
Truths or indifferent, which few can be ſure of, may be impoſed. What
follows from all this, but that all men on Earth may eaſily fall under
the imputation of diſobedience to Prelates, and ſo be Excommunicate, and
then they have their choice (when no man is perfect, and they cannot
change their mindes) 1. Whether they will be damned as Excommunicate
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61069:24"/>
and practical Atheiſts that give over all Church Worſhip; 2. Or as damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Schiſmaticks, for worſhipping God in Churches when they are excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate;
3. Or as perſidious Lyars, that will make falſe Confeſſions, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
and promiſes, to get off an Excommunication. When Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi>
numbers thoſe with Schiſmaticks that [<hi>ſuffer themſelves to be excommunicate,</hi>]
if they have no other means in their Power to hinder it, it ſeems theſe great
Enemies to abſolute reprobation, do think all Chriſtians being unavoidably
born to imperfection of Knowledg, are as unavoidably born to damnation
whenever Prelates or Prieſts pleaſe thus to precipitate them.</p>
                     <p>LXXXVI. 2. Particularly, 1. The firſt and ſecond Canons <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
all that ſay [<hi>that any manner of Obedience and Subjection within
his Majeſties Realms and Dominions is due to any uſurped and
foreign Power:</hi>] By
this all Papiſts and all pretended Proteſtants (ſuch as Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> confuteth)
who hold any manner of Obedience and Subjection due to Pope or Foreign
Councils, are Excommunicate.</p>
                     <p>2. Thoſe that ſay that the <hi>Book of Common Prayer containeth any thing in it
repugnant to the Scriptures are,</hi> ipſo facto <hi>excommunicate.</hi> Which now by the
new Laws are interpreted of the preſent Books.</p>
                     <p>3. In this all are excommunicate who ſay, the <hi>Miſ-tranſlations</hi> (in Pſalms,
Epiſtles or Goſpels, of which many inſtances have been given) to be <hi>any thing
repugnant in the Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. And all that ſay, It is againſt the <hi>Scripture to deny Chriſtendom to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
that have not ſuch Vowers in their Names</hi> and for <hi>their Education</hi> as we call
<hi>Godfathers, and Godmothers,</hi> thô the Parent (who is forbidden it) offer his
Child by Sponſion.</p>
                     <p>5. And all that ſay <hi>it is againſt Scripture to deny Chriſtendom to all that refuſe
the Covenanting tranſient Images of a Croſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. And all that ſay that it is <hi>againſt Scripture</hi> for all Miniſters to profeſs
[<hi>that it's certain by Gods Word that baptized Infants</hi> (without exception) <hi>ſo
dying</hi> are <hi>undoubtedly ſaved</hi>] when no word of God is cited that ſaith it,
and adding to Gods word is dreadfully threatned, and when it's certain that
<hi>all Miniſters are not certain</hi> of any ſuch thing (and I think no one.)</p>
                     <p>7. All are <hi>ipſo facto excommunicate</hi> that ſay, It <hi>is againſt Gods Word to deny
Church Communion in the</hi> Sacrament <hi>to all that dare not take it kneeling,</hi> for fear
(thô miſtaken) of breaking the ſecond Commandment by Symbolizing
with Idolaters, that are ſeeking to reduce the Nation to their Sin, and that
live round about us.</p>
                     <p>8. All are excommunicate that ſay <hi>it is againſt Scripture</hi> to <hi>pronounce</hi> all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that are buryed, except the unbaptized, ſelf-murderers and the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
while thouſands of Sadducees, Hobbiſts, Infidels, Papiſts, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured,
Adulterers, Drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> dwell among us.</p>

                     <p>10. All are <hi>ipſo facto Excommunicate</hi> by the ſixth Canon, who affirm, that

or</hi> ſuch as (<hi>now commanded) men who are zealouſly and godly affected,

That is, all that thus miſtake <hi>kneeling</hi> at the Sacrament, on the reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named,
to be againſt the ſecond Commandment, or that judge ſo of the
Surplice, or that think the Groſs, as deſcribed by the Canon and Liturgy,
hath all the Eſſentials of a humane unlawful Sacrament of the Covenant of
Grace. And all that are againſt the Rites of Godfathers that never owned the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61069:25"/>
Child as theirs, to be the only Sponſors in its Name, and to Vow its Chriſtian
Education (when I never knew one living that ſo much as made the Parents
believe that he intended it:) And all that think the words of the Liturgy
(making <hi>Impoſition of hands an aſſuring ſign of Gods Gracious acceptance)</hi> make
<hi>Confirmation</hi> a humane unlawful <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and ſay ſo. All theſe are cut off.</p>
                     <p>11. By Canon ſeventh all are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicate that affirm, that
the <hi>Government of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>under his Majesty, by Arch-Biſhops,
Biſhops, Deans, Archdeacons,</hi> and THE REST THAT BEAR OFFICE in
the <hi>ſame, is repugnant to Gods word;</hi> that is, all Biſhops, Miniſters, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Gentlemen or People, that ſay that it is againſt Gods word for Lay
Civilians or Chancellours to govern by the Church Keyes, excommunicate
or abſolve: And all that think it unlawful for Surrogates that are not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
but Presbyters, either as a Cryer <hi>pro forma</hi> to pronounce all excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
or abſolved who are ſo decreed by the Lay Chancellor, or elſe for them
(or a Prieſt-Chancellour) to govern a Dioceſs by the Keyes of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
and Abſolution being no Biſhops; and all that think it ſinful for
Archdeacons, Commiſſaries, Officials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who are no Biſhops, to exerciſe
the ſame Government by the Keyes over ſo many Paſtors or Churches, or
for a Biſhop. to do his Office by others that are no Biſhops, any more than
a Prieſt by thoſe that are no Prieſts; or for a Dioceſan with his Lay Court,
to Govern many ſcore or hundred Churches under him, without any ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Biſhop in thoſe Churches, that is, to ſet up the Name and ſhew, and
make Chriſts Diſcipline impoſſible: Or for Lay Chancellors or Surrogates
to publiſh Excommunications in the Biſhops Name, which he never knew
of, nor tryed the cauſe: Or for ſuch Chancellours to oblige all Pariſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to publiſh all their Excommunications which are agreeable to theſe
Canons. What quality and number they are of that call any of this ſinful,
I pretend not to know: But they are all now excommunicate men.</p>
                     <p>12. The eight Canon <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicateth all that affirm that the
<hi>form and manner of making and conſecrating Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons hath any thing, repugnant to Gods Word,</hi> &amp;c:] That is, all thoſe that hold Biſhops
and Presbyters to be the ſame Order (contrary to the words of that Book.)
Which yet even the Church of <hi>England</hi> while Papiſts declared in King
<hi>Aelfriks</hi> Canons (ſee <hi>Spelman:</hi>) And all ſuch as <hi>Thorndike,</hi> who ſay the People and
Clergy ſhould chooſe their Biſhops; or that ſay the Peoples conſent is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the Paſtoral Relation to them, and that the old Canons for this
are in force.</p>
                     <p>13. The ninth Canon <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicateth the Separatiſts.</p>
                     <p>14. <hi>The tenth Canon excommunicateth all that</hi> affirm [that Miniſters that
refuſe to ſubſcribe to the Liturgy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their Adherents may truely take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Name of another Church, not eſtabliſhed, by Law and dare publiſh that
this their pretended Church hath long groaned under the burden <hi>of impoſed</hi> grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
by the Church of <hi>England, and the</hi> Orders and Conſtitutions therein by Law
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61069:26"/>
eſtabliſhed.] (Ipſo facto <hi>is not here.) This reacheth to all that confine not
Gods Church in</hi> England <hi>to the Party that ſubſcribe and their Adherents: If
any ſay, that if ſuch as</hi> Blondel, Rivet, Ameſius, <hi>or any other the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
holy, peaceable men that dare not ſubſcribe as aforeſaid, ſhould with any
Chriſtians worſhip God together, and that theſe are a true Church (though
he judge them faulty) and that theſe Canons are grievances, ſuch are to be
excommunicated: (Though it be groſs Schiſm in others to confine not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the</hi> Purity <hi>but the</hi> Verity <hi>of a Church to their own Party:) For ſuch to</hi>
feel <hi>and</hi> groan loud <hi>here is Excommunication.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. The eleventh Canon much to the ſame purpoſe requireth the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of all that affirm that any <hi>Subjects</hi> in <hi>England</hi> may rightly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the Name of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>lawful Churches</hi> beſides thoſe allowed by Law,
though the King ſhould Licenſe them.</p>
                     <p>16. The twelfth Canon <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicateth all, that <hi>make Rules
and Orders in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical without the Kings Authority, and ſubmit to them,</hi>
e. g. All that without the Kings authority agree to turn the Table Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
to require People to kneel at the Rails, or to bow toward the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Eaſt, or to ſet up Organs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe are now excommunicate
by an Authority above the Biſhops, which no Biſhop or Prieſt can diſpenſe
with (but only forbear to publiſh and execute it, but not nullifie it) no
nor abſolve any that publickly repent not of it as a wicked Errour.</p>
                     <p>16. By Canon fourteenth, if any Miniſter ſhall <hi>diminiſh</hi> any part of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Rites, Ceremonies,</hi> Prayers, <hi>&amp;c. inregard of Preaching or ANY</hi> OTHER
RESPECT, or ſhall <hi>adde any thing in matter or form,</hi> (e. g. If he let the
Parent <hi>expreſs</hi> the <hi>dedication</hi> of his <hi>Child to God,</hi> or lay any charge on any
Parent) he breaketh the Church Law, and ſo far ſeparateth from it.</p>
                     <p>17. By Canon fifteenth when twenty or thirty thouſand are commanded to
come to a Church that cannot receive ſix thouſand, and the Alleys and
Pewes are wedg'd ſo that they cannot all kneel, yet all that kneel not at
the Prayers, and all that ſay <hi>not audibly</hi> the <hi>Confeſſion, Lords Prayer, Creed</hi>
and <hi>Reſponſes,</hi> diſobey the Laws of the Church, and ſo far ſeparate from
it.</p>
                     <p>18. When twenty thouſand Perſons are commanded to come in more
than can, if ten thouſand of them (or any number) ſhould come to the
Church-yard or Porch, to ſhew that they are not preſentable, but would
get in if they could, the nineteenth Canon commands to drive them away.</p>
                     <p>19. The Liturgy and Canon 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bind all under the penalty of
the Law to receive the Sacrament thrice every year: If a ſecret Infidel,
Sadducee, Hobbiſt, Socinian, or any Heretick ſay, <hi>I am not able to change
my Judgment, which is inconſiſtent with the Sacrament,</hi> or if one whoſe Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tells him of the guilt of Adultery, and that he is not reſolved to confeſs
and forſake it yet; or one that by Melancholy cauſeleſsly feareth unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
receiving to damnation; I ſay, if any of theſe will avoid the charge of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61069:26"/>
Schiſm, they muſt run upon worſe, till grace recover them, which is not
at their command. And yet all notorious Offenders are prohibited it Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
26. and particularly the Perjured: And if the tenth part ſo many
be perjured in <hi>England</hi> in City and Countrey, as many fear, it's a very
great number that are uncapable of Comm-union with the Church.</p>
                     <p>20. By Canon twenty ſeventh on pain of Suſpenſion no <hi>Miniſter muſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
adminiſter the Communion to any but ſuch as Kneel, or to any that refuſe to be
preſent at publick Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. So that all that Kneel not in receiving are rejected,
and if they worſhip God elſewhere, muſt be taken for Schiſmaticks, as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
as adulterers or murderers.</p>
                     <p>21. The twenty eighth Canon forbids admitting ſtrangers to Communion,
and commands ſending them home to their Pariſh Churches: It's diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to violate this.</p>
                     <p>22. The twenty ninth Canon forbids <hi>urging Parents to be Preſent when their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are baptized, and admitting them to Anſwer as Godfathers for their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
and any Godfather to make any</hi> other Anſwer <hi>or ſpeech</hi> than the <hi>preſcribed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>23. The thirtieth Canon deſcribeth the Croſs as a Sacrament, as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to us.</p>
                     <p>34. By the thirty ſixth Canon no man muſt be a Miniſter that ſubſcribeth
not that the Book of <hi>Common Prayer and Ordination contains nothing in it contrary
to the Word of God,</hi> and that <hi>he himſelf will uſe no other form in publick, Prayer and
adminiſtration of the Sacraments:</hi> By which all that refuſe this, or that uſe the
forms made and impoſed by the Biſhops on occaſions of publick Faſts and
Thankſgivings, ſeem all to be under diſobedience to the Church.</p>
                     <p>35. By Canon fourty ninth no Perſon not Licenſed as a Preacher, may <hi>in his
Cure or elſewhere, expound any Scripture, or Matter or Doctrine,</hi> but onely ſhall
ſtudy to read plainly the Homilies: So that all Miniſters before Licence to
preach, all School-maſters, all Parents, or Maſters, that do expound to
their Schollars, Children or Servants, the meaning of Baptiſm, or of any
Article of the Creed, any Petition of the Lords Prayer, any one of the
Ten Commandments (to fit them for Confirmation, or Salvation) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than by plain reading the Homilies or Church Catechiſm, doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
the Law of the Church: And ſo do all Tutors in the Univerſities that
expound any Scripture, matter or Doctrine to their Pupils, before they
are examined or approved by the Biſhop; or any Judge on the Bench or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
that preſumeth to do it to the hearers, or any Friend or Neighbour in
diſcourſe: For it is <hi>[No Perſon whatſoever not examined and approved by the
Biſhop of the Dioceſs.]</hi> How few in <hi>England</hi> ſeparate not from the Church as
far as this diſobedience amounts to? If by [no <hi>Perſons</hi>] be meant only
<hi>[no Miniſters]</hi> it's hard enough, that Miniſters may not be allowed out of
the Church what Lay-men are allowed.</p>
                     <p>36. All thoſe that deny not the validity of Baptiſm or the Lords Supper
when they are done by an unpreaching Miniſter, but yet think that a man
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61069:27"/>
utterly unable to Teach otherwiſe than by Reading, may not lawfully be
encouraged in ſo high a function, (any more than a man in Phyſick or School-teaching
that hath not neceſſary skill, or is utterly illiterate,) and thinks
it a ſin to conſent to take ſuch an Ignorant fellow for the Paſtor of his Soul
if he can have better; If this man, I ſay, go to the next Pariſh Church for
Sacraments, he is to be ſuſpended firſt and next excommunicate: Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if he ſhould judge that Ignorant Reader, no true Miniſter for want of
neceſſary capacity.</p>
                     <p>37. Surplices, Hoods and Tippets are made the matter of Obedience, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
fifty eighth.</p>
                     <p>38. By Canon thirty eighth no Miniſter muſt <hi>refuſe or delay</hi> to Chriſten any
Child (without exception) <hi>according to the form</hi> of the <hi>Common Prayer, that's
brought to Church to him on Sundaies or Holy-daies,</hi> though the Parents be both
<hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> or Atheiſts or Sadducees: The Miniſter muſt be ſuſpended
that refuſeth it.</p>
                     <p>39. The ſeventy firſt Canon ſuſpendeth all <hi>Miniſters that Preach in any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
houſe</hi> (except to the ſick or impotenti n time of neceſſity.) By which had
<hi>Paul</hi> here preached publickly and from houſe to houſe, or <hi>Timothy in ſeaſon</hi>
and <hi>out of ſeaſon</hi> as dreadfully adjured, or Chriſt preacht as he oft did,
they muſt be ſuſpended: And every Miniſter that preacheth to his Family.
And no doubt, repeating his Sermon, is preaching the ſame again.</p>
                     <p>40. <hi>All Miniſters</hi> muſt be <hi>ſuſpended</hi> and then <hi>excommunicate,</hi> that <hi>without the
Biſhops Licence appoint or keep any ſolemn Faſts publickly or in private houſes, other
than by Law appointed, or be wittingly preſent at any:</hi> Though it were in time
of Plague, or when divers of his Neighbours are ſick or troubled in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or in preparation to a Sacrament, or on ſome great occaſion in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-mens
Houſes and Chappels: He is not to be truſted to faſt and pray with
his own Flock or Friends, or come among them, leſt being excommunicate
he be a damn'd Schiſmatick.</p>
                     <p>The ſame prohibition is for <hi>holding meetings for Sermons called Exerciſes:</hi>
Which Arch-Biſhop <hi>Grindall</hi> was zealous to ſet up, (Q. Was he then a
Schiſmatick? or is the damning dangerous Engine made ſince?)</p>
                     <p>41. By Canon ſeventy third <hi>if any Miniſters meet in any privat ehouſe</hi> (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
did by conſent in 1660. and 1661.) to <hi>do any thing that any way tends to
impeach the Common Prayer or any part of the Government and Diſcipline</hi> (e. g. to
Petition King or Parliament for the leaſt Reformation of it) he is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<hi>ipſo facto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>42. Canon ſeventy fourth brings all Miniſters apparel under Church Laws,
for the Shape.</p>
                     <p>43. Canon ſeventy ſixth Excommunicateth all that <hi>voluntarily relinquiſh
their Ministry,</hi> and uſe themſelves as a Lay-men. And man having free will,
that is done <hi>voluntarily,</hi> which is done in Obedience to mens command: And
yet we are ruined in the World, if we will not leave our Miniſtry, at their
Command.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61069:27"/>
44. It's tedious to go over all the reſt: I end at the end of them. Canon

Church of</hi> England <hi>by Repreſentation:</hi> that is, 1. All that take it for the
<hi>Church real</hi> and not <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> leſt they make the <hi>diffuſed Church (Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
and all) to be Chief <hi>Church-governours,</hi> while Convocations govern
but as <hi>their Repreſentatives.</hi> 2. All that ſay, that it is only the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and
not the Presbyters in Convocation that are the Governing Canon-making
Church. 3. All that ſay that the Clergy repreſent not King, Nobles, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
Laiety, and that theſe are <hi>true parts</hi> of the <hi>Church of</hi> England.
All theſe are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicate.</p>
                     <p>45. The 140. Canon Excommunicateth them that deny the Canons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of abſent Diſſenters, which yet even many Papiſts deny of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
Canons.</p>
                     <p>46. The laſt Canon Excommunicateth all that contemn theſe Canons, as
taking them to be <hi>the work of a Company of Perſons that conſpired againſt Religious
Godly men.</hi> All this huge Catalogue are here excommunicate.</p>
                     <p>47. If any part of all this be Schiſm, Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> ad this man ſeem to
teach Separation from the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Or if the late ſilencing,
hunting and ruining of two thouſand Miniſters were Schiſm, and as bad as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<hi>Taylor</hi> in <hi>Duct. Dubit.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton, Chillingworth,</hi> &amp;c. ſay of

a State as Adulterers and Murderers. Yea they make all damnable
Schiſmaticks that hold Communion with the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for that
is their Sentence on them that communicate with Schiſmaticks; <hi>viz.</hi> that
they are guilty of their Schiſm.</p>
                     <p>48. They unchurch and damn the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Laodicea,
Epheſus, Smyrna,</hi> &amp;c. in the Apoſtles dayes: For the Scripture tells us of
many guilty of Schiſm in all theſe, and yet the reſt communicated with
them; for the Scripture ſpeaks more of <hi>Schiſm in a Chruch,</hi> than of <hi>Schiſm
or Separation from a</hi> Church, <hi>Rom. 16. 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 10. &amp; 3. 3. &amp; 11. 18.
<hi>Mat. 12, 25. Luke 12. 52, 53. I Cor. 12. 25. Jam.</hi> 3. 15, 16. And yet no
one was commanded to ſeparate from thoſe Churches; no not from thoſe that
had Hereſies among them, ſuch as denyed the Reſurrection, and taught Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and eating things offered to Idols, that were drunk at the Sacrament or
Love-Feaſts, nor thoſe that had Jewiſh Schiſmaticks, who talkt like ours, <hi>Act.</hi>
15. <hi>Except ye be circumciſed and keep the Law of Moſes, ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> The
Churches were not all unchurcht and damn'd that communicated with ſuch.
Yea <hi>Peter</hi> was guilty of encouraging them in Schiſm, that would not eat with
the Chriſtian Gentiles, but he was not unchriſtened by this.</p>
                     <p>49. They ſeparate from or unchurch almoſt all the Ancient Churches
in the dayes of the moſt famous Emperours and Councils. For I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted

one another. It was Schiſm either in <hi>Victor</hi> to Excommunicate the <hi>Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

or diſowning ſeveral Councils, ſpecially that of <hi>Calcedon</hi> and that at <hi>Conſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
tribus Capitulis,</hi> &amp;c. was the Schiſm of almoſt all the Imperial Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
one part condemning the other. And if either were in the Right, it
ſalves not the Caſe with them: For moſt of the ſame men that went that
way call'd the Right in one Princes Reign, went contrary in the next, and
ſo condemned each other round; eſpecially about Images adoration.</p>
                     <p>50. Hereby they cut off that Succeſſion of that ſort of Ordination, which
they ſay muſt be uninterrupted, while it came down from Churches excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
by one another, or make the Proof of it impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>51. They ſeparate from all the <hi>Greek</hi> Church at this day, as guilty of
Schiſm, both in their Succeſſion from Schiſmaticall Biſhops, at <hi>Conſtant.
Alexand. Antioch, Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. and in their excommunicating not only
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for a wrong cauſe <hi>(the filioque,</hi> but other Churches,
and for divers Acts of Schiſm.</p>
                     <p>52. They muſt by their Principles Separate from the <hi>Abaſſines, Aegyptians,
Syrians,</hi> and all the Eaſtern and Southern Churches that are called <hi>Jacobites,</hi>
and <hi>Neſtorians:</hi> For Councils and other Churches condemn them: And they
condemn the Councils of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and all ſince: And they
muſt ſeparate from and condemn the Churches of <hi>Armenia, Georgia, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſia,</hi>
&amp;c. becauſe they ſeparate from others, and are ſeparated from.</p>
                     <p>53. Their Principles utterly unchurch the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> 1. Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe it is guilty of the greateſt Schiſm on earth, by ſetting up
a falſe Church form and head: 2. And becauſe they Schiſmatically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
and Unchurch three parts of the Church on earth, even all ſave their
Sect: 3. And for their many other Schiſmatical Doctrines and Practices:
4. And as being condemned by the <hi>Greek</hi> Proteſtants and moſt Churches,
and ſeparated from by the Church of <hi>England</hi> which they own.</p>
                     <p>54. They ſeparate in Principles from all or near all General Councils
(ſave the firſt) as having ſeparated from other Councils and condemned
them, and being again condemned by them.</p>
                     <p>55. Some of them condemn and ſeparate from all the Proteſtant Churches
that have Biſhops, in <hi>Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Tranſylvania,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe they
had not their Ordination Succeſſively from Biſhops but Presbyters at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
And becauſe they have been guilty of Schiſm againſt others.</p>
                     <p>56. The Principles of Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> and his Aſſociates condemn the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> as Schiſmatical, 1. Thoſe that claim Succeſſion from <hi>Rome,</hi>
whoſe own Succeſſion hath been oft and long interrupted, by incapacities
and Schiſms. 2. For holding Communion with thoſe Proteſtant Churches
which theſe men call Schiſmaticks.</p>
                     <p>57. They condemn and ſeparate from all the Churches called Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
in <hi>France, Holland, Geneva, Scotland</hi> formerly, and thoſe in <hi>Helvetia</hi>
that have no Biſhops; Tho ſome would threat kindneſs on them by ſaying
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61069:28"/>
that they would have them and cannot? And why cannot they?</p>
                     <p>58. Their Principles make the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford, Briſtol,</hi> &amp;c. Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:
For their Dioceſes are Churches taken out of Churches, being late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
parts of other Dioceſes.</p>
                     <p>59. And they condemn all the Pariſh Churches in <hi>England</hi> as Churches
diſtinct from Cathedrals: For they are all Churches gathered out of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:
At firſt the Cathedrals were the only ſingle Churches: Next Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were gathered; and next our Pariſh Churches. And the Pariſh Church
of <hi>Covent-garden,</hi> is a Church taken out of a Church.</p>
                     <p>60. Their Principles damn St. <hi>Martin</hi> that ſeparated to the death from
all the Biſhops Synods and them that were near him (ſave one Man) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they perſwaded <hi>Maximus</hi> to uſe the Sword againſt <hi>Priſcillian Gnoſticks,</hi>
and brought men of ſtrict Religion under Suſpicion of Priſcillianiſm: And
ſure the ruined perſecuted Proteſtants here, are more Orthodox than the
<hi>Priſcillians.</hi> And they damn <hi>Gildas</hi> that told the English Clergy, that
he was not <hi>eximius Chriſtianus that would call them Miniſters;</hi> (Do they not
diſgrace the many Churches dedicated to the Memory of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> if he
be a damned man?) I doubt they damn <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for local angry
ſeparating from each other: Whatever they do by <hi>Peter and Barnabas</hi> for
the Separation blamed <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>61. If all are Schiſmaticks that here conform not, all thoſe called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
are ſuch, that conform to the words in a falſe ſence.</p>
                     <p>62. They ſeparate from all that obey the twentieth Canon of the Nicene
Council: And from all that obey the Councils that forbid communicating
with a Fornicating Prieſt: And from all that obey the Councils which nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
the Epiſcopacy of ſuch as are obtruded by Magiſtrates, or not conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to by the Clergy and people. And many more ſuch.</p>
                     <p>Abundance more inſtances of their Separation, and Damnation, I might
adde: In a word, I think then Principles are, as I firſt ſaid, for damning
and ſeparating from all men living, for all men living are guilty of ſome
ſort and degree of Schiſm, that is, of Errours, Principles or Practices in
which they culpably Violate that Union and Concord that ſhould be among
Chriſtians and Churches: Every defect of Chriſtian Love, and every ſinful
Errour, is ſome degree of ſuch a violation. All Chriſtians differ in as great
matters as things indifferent: And no man living knoweth all things Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to be ſuch: And theſe men diſtinguiſh not of Schiſm, nor will take
notice of the neceſſary diſtinctions given (in the third Part of the Treatiſe

make us underſtand what ſort of Separation it is that they faſten on, but
talk of Separation in general, as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>LXXXVII. They ſeeme to be themſelves deceived by the Papiſts in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of <hi>Cyprians,</hi> words <hi>de Vnit. Eccleſ. Vnus eſt Epiſcopatus,</hi> &amp;c. But they
themſelves ſeem to ſeparate from <hi>Cyprian</hi> as a Schiſmatick, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61069:29"/>
from all the Church that hath profeſt Communion with him, and
with all the Councils and Churches that joyned with him: For <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
and his Council erred by going too far from the Schiſm and Hereſie of
others, nullifying all their Baptisms, Ordinations and Communions: And
for this errour they declared againſt the Judgment of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
and other Churches; and they were for it condemned as Schiſmaticks by
the ſaid Biſhop: And here is a far wider Separation than we can be charged
with. 2. And <hi>Cyprians</hi> words came from the Mind that was poſſeſt with
theſe opinions, and are expreſſive of his Inclination. 3. Yet they are
true and good, underſtood as he himſelf oft expounds them; the Biſhop of
<hi>Oxford</hi> citeth ſome inſtances, many more are obvious, in which he oppoſeth
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaying, that none of them pretendeth to be a Biſhop
of Biſhops; and limiting every man to his own Province, and ſaying that
they were to give account to none but God, with much the like.</p>
                     <p>But in what ſence is <hi>Epiſcopacie one?</hi> 1. Undoubtedly not as <hi>numerically</hi>
in the <hi>perſonal Subjectum Relationis:</hi> One Biſhop is not another; if you ſhould
ſay <hi>Paternity is One,</hi> none believe that one mans Relation of Paternity is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The <hi>Relation</hi> is an accident of its own Subject, as well as Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Quality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Nor doth any man believe that many Biſhops go to
make up one Biſhop in Naturals. 3. Nor did ever <hi>Cyprian</hi> hold or ſay
that all Biſhops go to make up one Politick Governing Ariſtocracie, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
go to make one Senate or Parliament, that hath a power of Legiſlation
and judgment by Vote as one <hi>Perſona politica.</hi> He never owned ſuch a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Soveraignty.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Epiſcopatus unus eſt, I. In ſpecie,</hi> all Biſhops have one Office; 2. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective:</hi>
As the Catholick Church is one, whoſe welfare all Biſhops ought
to ſeek: 3. And ſo <hi>finaliter</hi> as to the remote End; and are bound to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
Concord. 4. And as effects, all are from <hi>one efficient inſtitutor.</hi> As
it may be ſaid that all <hi>official Magiſtracy</hi> in <hi>England</hi> is one: 1. As from one
King or <hi>ſumma poteſtas:</hi> 2. As deſcribed by one Law, and as Juſtices of
one <hi>Species:</hi> 3. As all their Cities and Counties and Hundreds are but part
of one Kingdom, whoſe welfare all are for: 4. And as they are all bound
to keep as much common Concord as they can; if any mean more, they
ſhould ten us what; If any mean that all Biſhops make one numerical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Government, they are heinous Schiſmaticks, and the kingdom is Sworn
agaisſt their Judgment: And theſe Men damn them in damning Schiſmaticks.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, <hi>Cyprian de Unitate, Eccleſiae</hi> (leaving out the Papiſts additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
is a good Book and worthy, to be read of all; and take <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
Deſcription of the Epiſpcopacy of the Church which we muſt unite with, and
the nature of that Union, and we would rejoyce in ſuch. But if <hi>Cyprian</hi>

Soveraignty.</p>
                     <p>LXXXVIII. If we are damned Schiſmaticks, I can imagine no pretended
manner of Separation in which our Schiſm conſiſts, but firſt, either Local
as ſuch. 2. Or Mental, as ſuch. 3. Or Local, cauſed by Mental.</p>
                     <p>If Local, as ſuch be it: All Chriſtians are Schiſmaticks, for being lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
ſeparated from others, and abſent from all Churches; and places ſave
one.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Mental Separation</hi> be it, either all <hi>Mental Diviſion</hi> is ſuch, or but ſome
only; if <hi>all,</hi> then all mortal men are Schiſmaticks, as differing in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of things from others; If it be not all, what is it? is it all difference
in the <hi>Eſſentials of Chriſtianity?</hi> we grant it; and we are charg'd with no
ſuch thing. Is it all difference in the <hi>Integrals</hi> or <hi>Accidents?</hi> ſo do <hi>all differ</hi>
that are not perfect. Is it all <hi>want of Love,</hi> or all <hi>Vncharitableneſs</hi> to one
another? all on earth have ſome degree of it; and thoſe are likeſt to have
moſt, that do as the Biſhops did againſt the Priſcillianiſts, bring godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
under reproach, on pretence of oppoſing Hereſie; or that ſeek the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing,
Impriſonment, Baniſhment or Ruine of men as faithful as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
For our parts, we profeſs it our great Duty, to love all men as
men, all Chriſtians as Chriſtians, all godly men as godly, all Magiſtrates
as Magiſtrates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is it for our ſeparating <hi>in mind</hi> from any <hi>Principles in
ſpecie</hi> neceſſary to Communion in the Church Univerſal, or ſingle Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es?
let it be opened what thoſe Principles be: We own all <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
and all <hi>Miniſtry of Gods Inſtitution,</hi> and <hi>all his Church Ordinances:</hi> We own
<hi>Biſhops over their Flocks,</hi> let them be never ſo large, ſo they be capable of the
<hi>Work</hi> and <hi>End,</hi> and alter not the true <hi>ſpecies;</hi> and we ſubmit to any that
ſhall by the <hi>Word admoniſh Paſtors</hi> of many Churches of their <hi>Duty,</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> or
ſeek their good. Nor do we refuſe Obedience to any humane <hi>Officers</hi> ſet
up by Princes, to do nothing againſt Chriſts <hi>Laws,</hi> not nothing but what
is in <hi>Princes power</hi> in the <hi>Accidents circa Sacra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is it becauſe we diſown any <hi>Numerical Rulers?</hi> we own the King and his
Magiſtrates, we own all that we can underſtand to be true <hi>Paſtors;</hi> and if
we are in <hi>doubt</hi> of their <hi>Calling,</hi> we reſiſt them not, unleſs obeying Chriſt
before them be reſiſtance: But our Accuſers loudly profeſs, that Uſurpers
are not to be owned; and if they go on the ground, that he hath <hi>right that
the Prince is for,</hi> we would know, whether that hold in <hi>Turky,</hi> in <hi>Italy,
Spain, France,</hi> or only in <hi>England,</hi> or where? If it be where <hi>Princes are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi>
do they make all the People Judges of their Princes Orthodoxneſs?
And we would know, whether EVERY BISHOPS and PRIESTS right, as
a true <hi>Miniſter, called of God, and ſet over us,</hi> be <hi>neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or known by all the People? if it the, wo to us, that ever ſuch men were
ſet over us, whoſe right we cannot know: What abundance of things go to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61069:30"/>
make a Biſhops or Prieſts right known! 1. That he hath <hi>capable ſufficiency.</hi>
2. That he is a <hi>juſt Biſhop,</hi> that's <hi>choſen</hi> by the <hi>King, the Dean and Chapter obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
conſenting,</hi> &amp; that the Clergy's and Peoples conſent is unneceſſary. 3.That
the Dioceſan <hi>ſpecies</hi> (over multitudes of Churches without any ſubordinate
Biſhop) is of Chriſt, or lawful. 4. That their <hi>work,</hi> according to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
is lawful. 5. That all our <hi>Patrons</hi> have right to chuſe <hi>Paſtors for all
the People.</hi> 6. That they are true <hi>Paſtors</hi> over them that <hi>conſent not.</hi> 7. That
if they prove worſe far than <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Baſilides,</hi> and be owned by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
as they were, the people may not forſake them <hi>(plebs obſequens divinis
praeceptis,) which</hi> ſaith <hi>Cyprian have moſt power to chuſe or refuſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is every Chriſtian bound on pain of Damnation to <hi>know all theſe,</hi> and then
to examine and judge Biſhops and Prieſts accordingly? or if they miſtake
one or more mens Commiſſion, do they therefore ſeparate from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church? If ſo, what a caſe was the <hi>Eaſt</hi> in by the difference between
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and his Competitors? <hi>Photius</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> and hundreds others?
and <hi>France,</hi> about the Archbiſhops of<hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>hemes,</hi> when he was put out that depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Ludovicus</hi> 4. and when an Infant was put in, and oft beſides?</p>
                     <p>What if the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> when <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was baniſned by, <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
himſelf, were half for him, and half againſt him? Or <hi>Baſil</hi> at <hi>Caeſarea</hi> was

and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Zeno,</hi> and <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> and abundance more, ſet
up and pull'd down, and ſet up again againſt each other? What, I ſay, if
the People now miſtooke who had the beſt Title? Is this ſeparating from
the Catholick Church? When the <hi>Interim</hi> caſt out hundreds in <hi>Germany;</hi>
When <hi>Ludovicus</hi> caſt out Multitudes in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and half the People
ſtuck to the ejected, perſecuted Paſtor, and the reſt to the Magiſtrates
choice, which of them ſeparated from the Univerſal Church? Is every
Prieſt the <hi>Vniverſal Church,</hi> or an <hi>eſſential</hi> part of it? then it dyeth when
he dyeth, and Apoſtatizeth when he doth. How many Ages in above 23
Duplicates or Schiſms, was the World uncertain which was the true Pope?
ſuppoſe, <hi>e. g. Arthur Jackſon, Edmund Calamy,</hi> and many ſuch were placed
in their Incumbency, by the Biſhops, Patrons and Pariſh conſent, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Law of Chriſt and the Land, and by a mew Act of Uniformity
they be all turned out, the Flock not conſenting, nor any Biſhop accuſing,
trying or depoſing them (ſave in Legiſlation,) and ſome of the Pariſh
think this diſſolveth not their Relation to him, and they cleave to him
as before, without any change ſave of Place and Tythes, and others for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
ſuch a one, and follow the Magiſtrates choice, may not both theſe be
ſtill of the Catholick Church? If not, I know where the old Canons laid
the charge and danger. It's wonderful ſelfiſhneſs in thoſe men, that if they
can but get into the Seat, take it for granted, that all muſt own their right
on pain of Damnation.</p>
                     <p>And what if in any ſuch Land, the Prince change his mind, or the next

                        <hi>LXXXIX. Do you find that Mr.</hi> Dodwel, <hi>Dr.</hi> Saywel, <hi>Dr.</hi> Sherlock, <hi>or
any of theſe men, do, in Pulpit and Preſs, ingenuouſly tell the People the
truth of the Caſe, when they liken men as Schiſmaticks to Murderers for
danger? Did you ever hear them ſay,</hi> [The Canon, which is the Churches
Voice and Law, doth Excommunicate you all that do own your Opinions againſt
Conformity, and commandeth us not to admit you to the Sacrament, and yet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
your Excommunication for not taking it: We confeſs they have been holy and
Learned Men that have thought many things impoſed unlawful; and therefore we
wonder not if it be not in your power to change your judgment, no more than to be
perfect in knowledge; and we confeſs if you are unjuſtly Excommunicated, or any
of the things made neceſſary to Communion be againſt Gods Word, then it is the
Church that guilty of Schiſm, but becauſe this is not ſo, we accuſe you of Schiſm,
<hi>even of</hi> ſeparating from the Vniverſal Church, and from Salvation.</p>
                     <p>XC. I do admire, that never any one of them would be prevail'd with
to prove the Canons Excommunications <hi>ipſo facto</hi> lawful, when even Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
have ſcorn'd all ſuch doings; and when the learnedſt of all their own
admired men, that were for comprimiſing matters with <hi>Rome,</hi> even <hi>Mar.
Ant. de Dom. Spalatenſis de Rep. Eccl.</hi> hath ſo confidently, copiouſly and ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
damn'd it: Chriſt would have none Excommunicate, whatever
the Crime be, without Impenitency after due admonition for Repentance,
but theſe Canons <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Condemn and Excommunicate Godly men,
without ever admoniſhing them, or calling them to repent, or hearing
or ſeeing them: Nothing is neceſſary but the proof of the fact, and
then the Law is inſtead of a Judge; and to oblige the People to avoid
them, it muſt be publiſhed.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>E. g.</hi> A Congregation or Nation of men of eminent Sanctity and Order,
ſound Doctrine and Worſhip, may, by humane frailty take ſome one falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
or uncertain thing to be neceſſary to Miniſtry or Communion (as they
ſay ſome Churches unhappily of late reject all that own not the Antiquity of
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Points) I cannot have local Communion with that Church, for
they will not receive me, unleſs I ſubſcribe either a falſhood, (or that which
I judge falſe;) but yet I highly honour and love them, and have mental
Catholick Communion with them, when perhaps neceſſity may make me Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
join with a Church of far worſe men and Order, that will impoſe no
ſin on me. 10. And I would adviſe theſe men, did they not deſpiſe
my advice, for the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> ſake, and their own, to retract
their Errours, and not lay ſuch a Snare before the People. Should you ſay
in the Pulpit, <hi>[If the Church be guilty of any Schiſm by her Impoſitions,</hi> (oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named)
<hi>Excommunications and ſilencing of Chriſts Miniſters, and afflicting good

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, it's falſe: There are twenty caſes in which 1. One may be
guilty of Schiſm and not be a Schiſmatick, as denominated from what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominateth:
2. And as many in which he is not at all guilty that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth
with the guilty.</p>
                     <p>And let the world (that is ſober and awake) judge now whether theſe
men or we be the greater Schiſmaticks, and which more condemneth or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth
from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> We ſay that all Churches have ſome
degree of Schiſm, and ſo hath the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it hath imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Errour and Sin; but that it is not therefore <hi>no Church,</hi> nor is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to communicate with it; All Chriſtians and Churches muſt not be
ſeparated from that are guilty of ſome degree of Schiſm.</p>
                     <p>If any will turn theſe Serious matters into Jeſt, and ſay, as Dr. <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
that they will receive <hi>Greeks, Lutherans,</hi> &amp;c. that come to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
his Serious Readers will tell him, that ſo will moſt Sects receive
<pb facs="tcp:61069:31"/>
thoſe that approve of their Communion and come to them: Joyning with
you ſignifyeth that they are of your way therein; But will you go to <hi>their
Churches</hi> and <hi>Communicate</hi> with them? You will receive the damned Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
if they come to you, when yet you make it damnable to joyn in
their meetings with them. This quibbling beſeems not grave men in great
matters.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, Reader, God having allowed more Legiſlative Power to
men in things <hi>Secular</hi> than in Religion, I may ſay this caſe is like ours in
debate.</p>
                     <p>I. Some Judges and Lawyers ſay, that the Oath of Allegiance makes a
Subject in this Kingdom; that the <hi>Renouncing</hi> or Violating it by <hi>Treaſon,</hi>
or <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or <hi>deſerting the Kingdom,</hi> overthrows the Relation. But that
other particular faults or quarrels againſt Neighbours, Juſtices, Judges,
yea the King himſelf, are puniſhable according to the Laws, but are not all
Rebellion, nor diſſolve Subjection, nor oblige the Subjects to renounce ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
converſe with each other; though ſome contempt and obſtinacy may
outlaw them. Such is our Judgment of Church Relation and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which 1 need not rehearſe.</p>
                     <p>II. Suppoſe a ſect of Lawyers and Judges ariſe, that ſay, no men are
the Kings Subjects, but are Rebels, that break any of his Laws, that Shoot
not in long Bows, that Bury not their dead in Woollen, that ſwear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely,
that eat fleſh in <hi>Lent</hi> unlicenſed, that have any unjuſt Law-Suit,
that wrong any Neighbour, that oppreſs any Poor man, all theſe are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
yea all that plead oppoſite Cauſes at the Bar, and all Judges that
judge contrary to one another, and all that miſunderſtand any point of
Law and Practice accordingly, and all that beſides the Oath of Allegiance
do conſtitute Marriages, Families, Schools, Societyes by any other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of their own, and all that are of different Cities and Companies, parts
of the Kingdom, or all whoſe Juſtices, Mayors, Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> differ from
one another in any point of Law and practice: Or all that obey not every
Conſtable and Juſtice; or that go to divers Juſtices in the ſame Precincts,
or that go from one Juſtice to another to avoid unrighteous Judgment, or
that go from the Phyſician of the Place for Health, and from the Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Town for greater edification, or that Travel beyond Sea for
Knowledge, yea all that underſtand not every word in the Law, that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
them: If any ſay, none of theſe are the Kings Subjects, but Rebels, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to him and one another, and deſerve to be all hang'd as Murderers, and
ſo are all that have Communion with them; <hi>Quaere,</hi> 1. Whether theſe men
are for the Unity of <hi>England?</hi> 2. And are Friends to the King that deprive
him of all his Subjects; as much as thoſe that would have him have no
Subjects, that be not of the ſame Age, Stature, Complexion and Wit.
3. And whether they are Friends to Mankind? 4. And whether they.
<pb facs="tcp:61069:32"/>
condemn not themſelves if they live not as Anchorets, out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society. 5. And whether that Nation be not by infatuation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for Deſtruction that would believe them, and would hate, ſcorn
and ruine them that are of the firſt mentioned opinion, according to
the ſaying, <hi>Quos perdere vult Jupiter, hos dementat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the more dangerous Doctrine now threatning this Land, that
would ſubject <hi>England</hi> to a Foreign Juriſdiction, on pretence of a
Neceſſity of either an Univerſal Church Monarch, or Church-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Senate or Council, or of all the Church on Earth repreſented
by Patriarchs or Metropolitans, or that plead for <hi>Subjection to them,</hi>
under the Name of Communion, they require a diſtinct Anſwer. But
Dr. <hi>Iſ. Barrow,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Beverley's</hi> Catholick Catechiſm, have effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
done it.</p>

SECOND PART
AGAINST
SCHISM, &amp;c.
The Reaſons of Mr. <hi>Raphſon,</hi> and ſuch others,
againſt going to the Pariſh-Churches, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</head>
                  <p>THE Matter of his Book, as againſt Perſecution, is
very conſiderable; the Stile is very cloſe and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent:
His Doctrine againſt Communion with the
Churches that uſe the Liturgy, is that which I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of it is, 1. That kneeling at the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sacrament, and the uſe of the Liturgy, are unlawful.</p>
                  <p>2. That they are falſe Worſhip, and Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>3. That the places where they are uſed, are Idol-Temples.</p>
                  <p>4 That to joyn there in them, is to partake in Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>5. The proof of all this is by this Argument; <q>Worſhip not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute,
is not lawful; but kneeling in receipt of Bread and Wine,
is Worſhip not inſtituted by Chriſt: therefore not lawful; therefore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61069:35"/>
not pleaſing, <hi>p.</hi> 160, 161. To which, by way of Motive, he
addeth, <hi>p.</hi> 275. How many once in the ſeparation, are returned
back to the Vomit they once caſt up, and wallow in the mire of
a worldly worſhip? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is compliance in Idol-Temples, going
to <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> bowing to <hi>Baal,</hi> ſitting, or drinking with the
ſuperſtitious inacts of religious adoration, a witneſs for, or againſt
defection? Are you turned as ſilly ſheep (that once were called
ſhepherds), to bleat after other ſhepherds, that Chriſt never ſent,
nor bid you go after them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Looks it not like a declining of
the Camp of Chriſt, the work of the Goſpel, and ſetting your
face towards <hi>Babel,</hi> &amp;c.? Is ſcandal of no weight with you, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
How dare you venture your ſouls to ſit under Means that he ſays
ſhall not profit you; and which is worſe, lies under his curſe? <hi>Jer.</hi>
23. 32. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14. with more ſuch.</q> Either this Writer knoweth
how ill he dealeth with his Reader, or not: If he do, it's a double
fault: if not (which I think), it's a doleful caſe, that every well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
man, that can but be confident in his ignorance and error,
and father it on God, ſhould become ſuch a ſnare to them that
cannot ſee through his Pretences, and ſhould himſelf ſuffer for
ſinning, and call it the Cauſe of God, and condemn all that ſin
not as confidently as he; and hereby harden his afflicters, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them his weakneſs, and impenitently juſtifying his ſin.</p>
                  <p>If he would not have enſnared his Reader, he ſhould firſt have
opened the meaning of the words of his Queſtion, that they might
know how much of the Diſpute is <hi>material,</hi> and how much only
about words. 2. And then he ſhould have ſo proved his aſſertion
and accuſation, as might ſatisfie a good Conſcience in a matter
wherein God, the Church, and Souls, are ſo much concerned; and
not have poured out Accuſations by way of Motives, upon unproved
and falſe ſuppoſitions.</p>
                  <p>I find but one Argument, which I ſhall now anſwer plainly:</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Major</hi> is, <hi>[Worſhip not inſtituted, is not lawful]</hi> Anſ. 1. The
word <hi>[Worſhip]</hi> in general, ſignifieth, 1. <hi>Any thing done in honour to
another;</hi> and ſo all our obedience to God is Worſhip: It is to his
glory that we muſt do all. I ſuppoſe that this he meaneth not.
2. <hi>Any immediate act or expreſſion of the honour and reverence of the heart.</hi>
If this be not it that he meaneth by <hi>Worſhip,</hi> I know not what he
meaneth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61069:35"/>
This <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as <hi>within,</hi> is the ſecret act of the ſoul; as expreſt, it
is the act of the body.</p>
                  <p>Of ſuch Worſhip there are two ſorts: One ſort is made neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſtatedly, by God's commanding it in particular. To this no
man muſt add the like, or from it diminiſh any thing ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
either pretending God's authority, or his own. The
other ſort is but the ſubordinate <hi>ordering</hi> of the former, and is
but the <hi>manner</hi> of doing it. This God doth not inſtitute in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
but only give man a general Rule, how to chooſe it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
which is, That all be done in love, and to edification, decently
and in order.</p>
                  <p>Either this latter ſort is to be called <hi>Worſhip,</hi> or not: If it be,
then it falls under his oppoſition: If not, then, 1. He muſt give us
a definition of Worſhip, which ſhall exclude it; and ſo <hi>Worſhip</hi>
muſt be ſomewhat elſe than the <hi>direct</hi> or <hi>immediate acting</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
honour to God:</hi> And then who knows what he meaneth by
it? 2. And then when we plead for mens making none but this,
he ſhould to avoid deceit, confeſs that the Controverſie is only <hi>of
the Name</hi> (whether Modes and Circumſtances of God's inſtituted
Worſhip, may be <hi>called Worſhip</hi>), and not at all of the <hi>Thing</hi>
(whether it be lawful or not): This had been like a Chriſtian
Teacher.</p>
                  <p>Now I anſwer, 1. to his firſt Propoſition: 1. Worſhip which is
neither inſtituted particularly, nor in the general, appointing man
how to chooſe it, is unlawful, 2. And to invent worſhip without
God's allowance, contrary, or of the ſame kind, as if he had not
done his part, is unlawful. 3. But for man to chooſe and uſe
ſuch worſhip as is but the right ordering of God's Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is commanded by him, and a Duty; and therefore not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
                  <p>2. As to his <hi>Minor,</hi> or Second Propoſition, I anſwer, Kneeling
at the Sacrament, and communicating with Pariſh Churches that
have tollerable Miniſters, are not inſtituted of God in particular,
but the Genus of them is inſtituted, and we commanded to
chooſe our ſelves, according to God's general Rules, to the beſt
of our underſtanding: and ſo they are our Duty, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
                  <p>I give the Inſtances of theſe two ſorts of worſhip:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61069:36"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> God hath Inſtituted, that our Minds Worſhip him, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
and receiving all his Goſpel Revelations, and truſting them;
and in deſiring all things Petitioned in the Lords Prayer, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to all commanded in the Scriptures; and in Dedicating our
ſelves to him cordially in Baptiſm, and renewing it in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
in commemoration of Chriſt's Death, till he comes. He hath
Inſtituted the Corporal Expreſions of all theſe; That we confeſs
Chriſt in all the neceſſary Articles of Faith; That we ask the
Petitions of the Lords Prayer; That we perform the Commands
of the Decalogue towards God, and all others in the Scripture.
Theſe are the Inſtituted Worſhip which none muſt alter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Ordering</hi> which is the Second ſort (which
I leave every one to call <hi>Worſhip,</hi> or not, when they have defined
Worſhip) which man may, and muſt chuſe himſelf, without any
Particular Inſtitution of God, contain ſuch Acts as theſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Undetermined geſtures of Reverence and Honour in time of
Publick Worſhip. As to be uncovered, or put off the Hat at Prayer,
or the Lord's Supper. This we do directly in honour and reverence
to God, whom we there Worſhip; and therefore it is it ſelf a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
act of Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>So to ſtand, or kneel at Prayer, and not to ſit. Though in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we read of ſitting, ſtanding, kneeling, and proſtration: yet no
one of theſe is made neceſſary by Inſtitution: yet are they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Acts of Worſhip, expreſſing our inward Worſhip of
God: And the reaſon why being uncovered, or kneeling, are now
choſen, is not a particular Inſtitution, but becauſe the Cuſtom of the
Country hath made them the moſt congruous Expreſſion of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Worſhip: when as <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That then and there it was a
ſharne for a man to be covered: and the whole Church for many
hundred years forbad all kneeling, in Adoration, on the Lord's Days.
And more,</p>
                  <p>To theſe I add, the geſture of the Adult in Baptiſm, whether they
ſhall be Baptized kneeling, to ſignifie Humble Reception, or not, is
left to choice.</p>
                  <p>So is the Geſture in ſinging Pſalms: If any think, that ſpeaking
to God by prayer, praiſe, or thankſgiving in Pſalms, ſhould in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to God be done Standing, or Kneeling, rather than Sitting, it
is no addition to God's Inſtitution. And that we commonly uſe
ſitting in Pſalmody, and not when we Pray in Proſe, is meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Cuſtom maketh one more offenſive than the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61069:36"/>
The ſame I ſay of the Geſture of Preaching, which ſome do
ſitting with their Hats on, and others ſtand to avoid a ſeeming diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Gods Name and Service. Alſo, ſome holy Nonconformiſts
I have known, that would rarely name God but with their Hats put
off, or bowing their Heads; or with Hands and Eyes lift up towards
Heaven. (Old Mr. <hi>Atkins</hi> at <hi>Tipton</hi> near <hi>Dudley,</hi> did thus uſe to ſhew
ſuch Reverence, when he named God, that would ſtrike Reverence
into thoſe that ſaw and heard him: and hath oft Affected me more
than a Sermon.) This was External Worſhip, not Inſtituted in the
particulars, but in general of Reverence to God.</p>
                  <p>2. Another inſtance is in <hi>Vows to God,</hi> which are acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
But for the <hi>Matter</hi> of them, ſeveral things may be Vowed which
are not <hi>particularly</hi> commanded, but onely in the General. And for
the <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Words,</hi> I do not think that Mr. <hi>Raphſon</hi> can ſhew me
all that <hi>Vow</hi> called the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in any particular Inſtitution; and
yet I conjecture, that he taketh it not to be Idolatry, nor Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>3. Another Inſtance is, in things <hi>devoted</hi> and <hi>offered to God</hi>
The Scripture in general ſaith, <hi>Honour God with thy ſubſtance, and
with the firſt Fruits of thy increaſe.</hi> And that Chriſtians at firſt ſold
all, and laid at the Apoſtles Feet; which yet <hi>Peter</hi> tells <hi>Ananias</hi> he
might have choſen not to do. And for many hundred years after,
they brought their Weekly Donations for the Miniſters, Sacraments,
and Poor, to the Altar, and Offer'd it firſt to God: And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> would
have the <hi>Corinthians</hi> give their Collections as to God, for the Saints.
But no Inſtitution told them how much they ſhould give, but the
General Rule.</p>
                  <p>4. Another Inſtance is, the length or degree of outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
If I pray two hours rather than one, it is an act of Honour,
or Worſhip, not particularly commanded.</p>
                  <p>So whether men ſhall in Publick read one Chapter, or two; ſing
one Pſalm or two, or more, is undetermined by God</p>
                  <p>5. Another is about ſet Days and Hours for Worſhip; as to keep
a yearly Thankſgiving for Deliverance from the Powder Plot; the
Spaniſh Invaſion; for the Reformation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So alſo Faſts, and what
days Lectures ſhall be kept, and what hour: And what day and
hour the Lord's Supper ſhall be Adminiſtred; which are Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
Acts of Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>6. Another Inſtance is in the choice of Pſalms and Hymns: the
uſe of <hi>Davids</hi> are Lawful, and ſo are others: but no Inſtitution
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61069:37"/>
tyeth us to <hi>One,</hi> but leaveth us to chuſe.</p>
                  <p>7. Another Inſtance is in the <hi>Tunes</hi> and Metre of Pſalms, which
we uſe as Subordinate Acts of Worſhip. It is but lately that the
Churches uſed Metre and Melody of Tune; but <hi>Proſe</hi> read with a
loud Voice: yet I hope we are not Idolaters for our Metre and
Melody: which I may ſay alſo of Church Muſick, which <hi>David</hi>
uſed, and we may do, where it's Edifying; but it's no Inſtitution now.
Yea, when <hi>Paul</hi> directs the Church to uſe Pſalms, <hi>Hymns, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Songs;</hi> Which is for <hi>ſinging with grace in our hearts to the Lord,</hi>
and therefore it is Worſhip, which ſome men muſt indite and
make.</p>
                  <p>8. Another Inſtance is, in the verſions of the Pſalms of <hi>David;</hi>
where among many we may chuſe which ſeems beſt.</p>
                  <p>9. Another Inſtance is, in the publick and private Reading of the
Scriptures Tranſlated: where every word is the work of man:
God wrote it not in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek;</hi> but man
Tranſlates it, ſome well, and ſome defectively; yet I hope, an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Bible is not an Idol.</p>
                  <p>10. So alſo the dividing the Scriptures into Chapters, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which are the Works of man, is no Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>11. And another Inſtance is, the Method and Words of Sermons
and Prayers: whether a Miniſter ſhall Preach by way of Doctrine,
Reaſon, and Uſe; or otherwiſe: and Expound by way of Paraphraſe,
or otherwiſe; what words he ſhall uſe, God hath not inſtituted in
particular; but mens invention maketh theſe, ſome ſuddenly, and
ſome beforehand.</p>
                  <p>12. Another Inſtance is, the uſe of helps, or written Words;
Whether one ſhall uſe Notes in Preaching, and read them, or not?
Whether the words of a Prayer ſhall be written, and read, or not;
God hath not determined. And ſo Books of Catechiſm, Publick
Confeſſions: Prayers, Meditations as formed; are all the works of
man, and no Idolatry. And if Parents impoſe words of Prayer on
their Children, it is no Sin; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. and 11 ſhew.</p>
                  <p>13. Another Inſtance is in the form of Ordination, when the
Words and many Circumſtances are undetermined. Impoſition of
Hands is a Iawfu1 Sign: and ſo is doing it by a Writing, or by
meer Words, without that Impoſition; ſome receive it Kneeling, ſome
Standings; ſome by one Form of Words, ſome by another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome
from one Ordainer ſome from many, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And none of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61069:37"/>
14. The ſame is true of Diſcipline; The Form of Words for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
for Abſolution, for Excommunication, for the Penitents
Confeſſion and Requeſt, are left to Humane Wiſdom, ſo the matter
and manner be regulated by the general Law. And they that ſay,
that God hath Inſtituted, that the Church ſhall be Governed Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
by fixed Claſſes, with Appeals to National Synods, and that
here a <hi>Major</hi> Vote hath Governing Power over the leſſer part; yea,
and that theſe muſt be made up of Two ſorts of Elders, of which
one ſort are un-ordained, or are not Authoriſed to Adminiſter the
Word and Sacraments, do but add to the Word of God, if they
ſay theſe National Aſſemblies are the Supreame Church-Power;
what Law of God did ever Inſtitute, That a Miniſter, or Claſſis, <hi>e.g.</hi>
in <hi>Geneva, Breme, Scotland,</hi> is not as much ſubject to the Decrees of
a larger Council of many Nations; and that the Synod at <hi>Dort</hi> had
not as much Power as a leſſer at <hi>Hague:</hi> or a Synod of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as much as one in <hi>Scotland?</hi> But if (as by parity of Reaſon
they muſt) they ſay, that General or large Councils are the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of National Aſſemblies, as they are of Claſſis and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries:
then they bring us under a Foreign Juriſdiction, which the
Kingdom is ſworn againſt; and I think they are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but of the
<hi>French</hi> ſort, who make General Councils Superior Governours of the
Univerſal Church.</p>
                  <p>And if they determine the bounds of Church-Power, by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
Laws, and yet damn <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> they ſeem in ignorance
to deal too hardly with themſelves.</p>
                  <p>15. Another Inſtance is, in the Place of Publick Worſhip: God
hath not determined where the Aſſembly ſhall meet: where the
Pulpit, Font, Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall ſtand. And if great and lofty Structures,
called Temples, be Built, purely to ſhew how we honour God, and
Religion: as <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and others after him, did at <hi>Conſtantineple,
Alexandria, Jeruſalem,</hi> over the Grave of Chriſt, and all over the
<hi>Empire:</hi> this Actual Expreſſion of Honour to God, is <hi>Cultus modalis
&amp; ſecundarius,</hi> a ſubſervient ſort of Worſhip, and no Idolatry, but
Lawful.</p>
                  <p>16. The ſame I ſay of Church Utenſils: If for the Honour of
God and Religion, the Pulpits, and Tables have Ornaments of Silk,
Cups, and Trenchers, and Flaggons of Silver; the Font and Seats
have ſome ſpecial Neatneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is left to Man's Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without any particular Inſtitution, and is no Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>17. And if as Judges and Lawyers have diſtinguiſhing Habits, the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61069:38"/>
Miniſters have <hi>ſo,</hi> (officiating, and at other times) to no worſe end
(or manner) than the ſaid Utenſils are put; I know no Inſtitution
that is croſt by it, nor that forbids it.</p>
                  <p>18. Another Inſtance may be of Speaking in the Aſſembly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it ſhall be One Miniſter, or Two, or Three. Whether Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
may not be Interlocutors by Queſtions, yea, and ſometime
Preach and Pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God hath not particularly determined, but
left to Human Choice.</p>
                  <p>19. Many good Chriſtians knowing the Lord's Day to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
Day of Thankſgiving for the greateſt Mercies, do as an
Act of Honour wear their beſt Cloathes, and Feaſt themſelves and
the Poor accordingly that day: This is Lawful, by the General
Law; but not particularly Inſtituted by God.</p>
                  <p>20. Profeſſing Signs in our Covenantings with God, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
of our Religion, are left to be choſen onely by the General
Laws of Edification, and Order. When a Nation, or Church, or
Perſon renew their Covenant with God, and their Confeſſion of Faith,
it may be done (when the Ruler demandeth their conſent) either
by <hi>word</hi> or by <hi>ſubſcribing,</hi> or by <hi>lifting up the hand,</hi> or by <hi>ſtanding
up,</hi> or by <hi>bowing the Head;</hi> for theſe are all, or moſt found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
inſtances; yea, ſometimes they fell <hi>by Proſtration to the Ground:</hi>
yea, and <hi>ſo</hi> they oft did in receiving a Charge or Meſſage from God,
by his Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>I will add no more Inſtances; Theſe are enough. If yet it be
ſaid, That none of theſe be <hi>acts of Worſhip:</hi> I again Anſwer, 1. Then
do not by Slander call them <hi>ſo,</hi> and ſay ſtill, that Man's inventing
or uſing theſe, is uſing <hi>falſe Worſhip,</hi> If they be <hi>no Worſhip,</hi> they are
no <hi>falſe Worſhip.</hi> Confeſs then, that it's but a <hi>bare name</hi> that you
charged with Idolatry: for its onely ſuch things as theſe that we
would add. 2. But <hi>de nomine,</hi> If an Action done directly to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God be to be called <hi>Worſhip;</hi> ſome of theſe at leaſt may be
called <hi>Secondary ſubordinate Worſhip:</hi> But if you appropriate the
Name to Gods <hi>ſtated Ordinances,</hi> theſe muſt not be called <hi>Worſhip;</hi>
but the <hi>manner, order, circumſtances,</hi> or <hi>accidents</hi> of Worſhip. But
call them what you will, they are but what God alloweth, and the <hi>General</hi> of them he commandeth.</p>
                  <p>I need not ſay much to his Applicatory Words. 1. To return from
<hi>Separation,</hi> to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> is as fitly called, a <hi>Returning to their
Vomit,</hi> as returning from Drunkenneſs and Fornication, to Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and Chaſtity may be ſo called. Repentance is caſting up our Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61069:38"/>
2. The Names of <hi>bowing to Baal, Dan and Bethel, Babylon, Idols,</hi> &amp;c.
are as eaſily uſed by Quakers, Ranters, Familiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
againſt all God's Church and Worſhip: And they were worn ſo
thread-bare by the railing Separatiſts (then called <hi>Browniſts</hi>),
againſt the Old Learned Godly Nonconformiſts, that they turned
to the Speakers reproach. And I ſuppoſe he knoweth that the <hi>Scots</hi>
were called as bad, and worſe, by the Army that conquered them in
1650, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That <hi>ſitting or drinking with the ſuperſtitious in arts of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
adoration, is a ſign of defection.</hi> This would make all Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders
Who ſo <hi>ſit and drink with him,</hi> and ſuch as he, who is ſo
ſuperſtitious, as to turn ſin into duty, and duty into ſin, and
falſly father Laws on God: Yea, that is worſe than ſuperſtitious,
as is after manifeſted. 2. Superſtition is an offering ſomewhat as
pleaſing to God, which is not pleaſing to him. All Chriſtians
haveſome degree of this in <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Manner;</hi> for we know but in
part, and propheſie in part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo no Chriſtians muſt joyn
with others. But muſt they not give over all Religious Duty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſeeing their own defects more defile them than other mens?
3. Chriſt doth not diſown all imperfect worſhip that hath ſome Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition:
And we muſt receive one another as Chriſt receiveth
us. 4. It was Superſtitious perſons that <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to receive to Communion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. Thus he condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Apoſtles, and the Churches then, and the Scripture it ſelf.
6. It is dreadful revolting to chooſe rather forbearance of all
Church Communion, than to Communicate with our Pariſh
Churches, when better cannot be had, and men are not forced
to any ſin themſelves. And he that will communicate with none
that ſin in Preaching, Prayer, Sacraments, ſhall communicate
with none 7. It is a groſs Service of Satan and Popery, to fight
againſt Love and Unity, and bring all the Publick Aſſemblies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
diſgrace, as unlawful, that Popery may take poſſeſſion unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.</p>
                  <p>4. His words of [<hi>ſilly Sheep bleating after any Shepherd,</hi> &amp;c.]
are but a Net to catch ſilly Souls. It's the common Trap of
the Papiſts, to put ignorant people to prove the Calling of the
Miniſters, or forſake them. They that preach the Goſpel, and do
the Office (tho faultily), and are in poſſeſſion, have a Calling
ſufficient to juſtifie the. Hearers, when it may not be enough to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61069:39"/>
juſtifie themſelves: A better Call than the High Prieſts that Chriſt did
ſend men to.</p>
                  <p>5. As to the Argument of Scandal; It is of dreadful weight
to deter a tender Conſience (as from conforming to ſin,
ſo) from his groundleſs Separation, and war againſt Unity and
Love.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>That</hi> God ſaith <hi>ſuch Means ſhall not profit; yea, curſeth
it,</hi> is a ſlander againſt God and Scripture, and all the Church
on Earth that's known; by perverting and miſapplying the
Text.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now better prove the lawfulneſs of uſing ſuch things as
theſe, than he hath proved it unlawful.</p>
                  <p>1. That which no Low of God, or valid Law of Man, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids,
is not unlawful: but the uſe of the things forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
no Law of God, or valid Law of Man forbids: Therefore
the uſe of the things forementioned, is not unlawful.</p>
                  <p>He that will ſay that there is any ſuch Law, muſt ſhew that
Law, and prove his Affirmative: But let him take heed of adding
to God's law: A falſe Prophet that fathered a falſe Meſſage from
God, was an heinous ſinner. Is it not worſe falſly to father a <hi>Law</hi> on
him?</p>
                  <p>Perhaps they will ſay, that <hi>God forbids, adding or diminiſhing:</hi> I
anſwer, He doth ſo: Therefore let them take heed of it, who
ſay his Law forbids that which it never forbad, but in general
commandeth. If we muſt not add to the Laws of the Land,
yet the Bookbinder that covereth them, and the Lawyers and
Judges that expound them, do not add thereby to the Law.
When the Hearers bowed, and proſtrated themſelves in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to God, they did not by this add to the Law; nor yet
when they made a Vow uncommanded, or a Free-Will-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And I think it was no ſinful addition to the Law, for the
Publican to ſmite his Breaſt, and look downward; and when
<hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaid, <hi>No man ſmiteth on his thigh, and ſaith, what evil
have I done?</hi> The meaning is not, No man idolatrouſly giveth
God falſe worſhip. And I think, that they that rent their clothes
to expreſs their repentance, did not add to God's Word, nor yet
do it as neceſſary worſhip, tho <hi>Joel</hi> ſays, <hi>Rent your hearts, and not
your garments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61069:39"/>
Some Object, That <hi>Chriſt's ſitting at the Sacramental Supper,</hi>
is a Law to us, forbidding any other geſture. But this Author
profeſſeth, that all the actions of Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, are not
Laws binding us to do the like: If they be, we break many
ſuch Laws; as when we do not eat a full Meal before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
when we do it not without women, only to a Family,
or to Twelve, only to Teachers, in an upper Reom, in an Inn,
or Private Houſe, and that we do not lie along, leaning, as they
did; eſpecially when we take it not at Supper-time, and turn the
Lord's Supper to a Breakfaſt or Dinner. The Apoſtles brake no Law
when they differed from any of theſe, which were but occaſional
Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>It's ſaid by ſome, That Chriſt's Example binds us to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-geſture:
But 1. That may be <hi>convenient,</hi> and yet <hi>not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary:</hi>
The bare Example binds us not to it. 2. If it did, that
were but like the general Law; <hi>Let all be done to edification,
and in order;</hi> and binds to no one ſort of geſture at all: For
then when they eat ſtanding, it would bind us to ſtand; and if
they eat kneeling (as Labourers oft do at Harveſt-work in the
Fields), it would bind us to kneel; if they eat lying, as the
<hi>Jews</hi> did, it would bind us to that: and ſo this would but tie
us to the Cuſtom of the Countrey. But in feaſting with God,
we may ſometimes do it more lowly than in a common Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſture,
and break no Law. When <hi>Mary</hi> was, it's like, on her
knees, waſhing Chriſt's feet with her Tears, if he had offered
her Bread or Wine, it's like it had been no Idolatry ſo to
take it.</p>
                  <p>But the grand Objection is, that <hi>we worſhip Bread and Wine;</hi>
which can be no better than a ſlander, when the very Liturgy and
Doctrine of the Church, not only renounce Tranſubſtantiation, but
the very real <hi>Preſence</hi> of Chriſt's Body, which yet many thouſand
Proteſtants believe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you kneel before the Bread and Wine, and make it
a mediate Object of adoration, contrary to the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1. We neither make any Image, nor invent this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
nor yet ſymbolize with Idolaters, while we renounce
the very Object (Tranſubſtantiate Bread) which they adore,
and therefore break not the Second Commandment, no more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61069:40"/>
than we do in kneeling in lawful Prayer, becauſe they kneel in
praying before Images, or to Angels.</p>
                  <p>2. An Object of worſhip is either a meer <hi>motive exciting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
or elſe a <hi>terminative mediate worſhipped Object.</hi> The firſt is
<hi>more</hi> than <hi>lawful:</hi> For we ſhould be moved and ſtirred up by
the works of God, even by our Meat and Drink, by Sun and
Moon, and all that we ſee, to worſhip God: And this is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but the Object of our <hi>thoughts,</hi> and the <hi>motive</hi> of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
acts: And the Sacrament is no more. But if we did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
our worſhip <hi>terminatively</hi> to the <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> as a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Object,</hi> by which it ſhould paſs to God, this were to break the
Second Commandment, like Image-worſhip.</p>
                  <p>There are many Inſtances in Scripture, of people that have
bowed to God before the Prophet, moved by his word and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
who yet break not the Second Commandment, nor idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
the <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Prophets:</hi> So <hi>Joſhua</hi> fell down to the Angel,
<hi>Joſh.</hi> 4. We give thanks for the Meat that ſtands before us on
the Table, as a <hi>Motive-Object;</hi> and we may do it on our knees:
Is this an idolatrous worſhipping of our Meat? I have many a
time ſeen a miſerable Beggar, when one hath given him Money
or Meat, fall down on his knees, and take it, ſaying, <hi>I thank
God and you;</hi> Did this make the giver his Idol? How ſad is the
caſe of ignorant young Chriſtians, whoſe Conſciences muſt be rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or cheated by ſuch Sophiſtry, becauſe their wits be not ripe enough
to find out the deceit?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>II. Another Argument:</hi> That is not unlawful which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
us in general to chooſe and do, and ſo alloweth in the
Particulars: But ſuch are the Twenty Things before <hi>mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>God commandeth us to do all <hi>things in Love, and Concord,
and Order, to edification.</hi> This muſt needs reach to the undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
circumſtances. We cannot worſhip God publickly at all,
but it muſt be in <hi>ſome words,</hi> in ſome <hi>geſtures,</hi> in ſome <hi>time,</hi> in
ſome <hi>place;</hi> nor profeſs our Faith, and Covenant-conſent, but by
<hi>ſome ſign:</hi> and ſo of the reſt. If you chooſe <hi>no one,</hi> when God
hath tied us to none, but bid us <hi>chooſe to edification,</hi> we break
his General Law. If you can prove that we <hi>chooſe amiſs,</hi> the Fault will be, not that we chooſe, but that we chooſe not
better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61069:40"/>
III. That is not unlawful which Chriſt and his Apoſtles did
before us without blame, and belongeth alſo unto us. But
ſuch is the uſe of ſuch Modes and Circumſtances of God's
inſtituted worſhip, which are left variable, and free to occaſional
choice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Chriſt did, I ſhall ſpeak more anon. <hi>Paul</hi> hath his
[<hi>Not the Lord, but I</hi>]; ſignifying, that the thing was not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by a Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. He judgeth circumſtantial differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſuch as ſhould not break communion, when yet they that
kept days, or kept them not; and they that did eat, or not
eat, did it <hi>as to the Lord.</hi> And did he bid them not <hi>judg each
other for idolatry?</hi> or ſay, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17, 18. That Idolaters were
<hi>acceptable to God, or approved of men?</hi> or <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 15. or bid them <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Idolaters, as Chriſt received us?</hi> He regulateth their Church-Meetings,
<hi>How many</hi> ſhall ſpeak at a Meeting, and by what courſe
and order; and that women ſhall be vailed, and not men; and
that they ſalute each other with an holy Kiſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not by a <hi>Law</hi>
that ſetleth the <hi>Particulars,</hi> but by the General Law of doing all
in <hi>order, and to edification;</hi> and pleadeth not <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> but the
<hi>Cuſtom of the Churches,</hi> which is alterable, as the ſignification of
ſuch acts are. And St. <hi>James</hi> will have the <hi>Elders anoint the ſick
with Oyl for recovery,</hi> which yet bindeth not us. The Papiſts uſe
this as an <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> as they do <hi>impoſition of hands</hi> in Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
They ſay in <hi>Ordination, Receive the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>breathe</hi>
on the Perſon: They <hi>waſh the feet of one another</hi> in imitation of
Chriſt: And yet theſe men condemn them in this, as ſuperſtitious,
for imitating Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and Scripture-Examples, and
cry down Popery, and at the ſame time call us Idolaters, for going
beyond Scripture-inſtitution. The ſame I ſay of their <hi>keeping Lent,
in imitation</hi> of Chriſt's forty days faſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is it Idolatry both to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and not to follow Scripture-Examples?</p>
                  <p>To all the reſt I add one Inſtance more: <hi>Swearing</hi> by appeal to
God, is a moſt ſolemn act of worſhip: but the ſign of taking an
Oath, is left free to convenient choice. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant did it
by <hi>putting his hand under his thigh:</hi> Was this a common Law, or
Inſtitution? Others did it otherwiſe: We do it by laying our hand
<hi>on the Book,</hi> and <hi>kiſſing it.</hi> Theſe. are neither ſinful additions, or
Idolatry. The Memorial of God's Works, and Mens Covenants,
were kept, ſometime by pitching Stones, ſometime by Pillars, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
by ſet days (as the Feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi>) ſometime by laying up the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61069:41"/>
Enſigns (as <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And all theſe lawful, and no Ido:
latry.</p>
                  <p>IV. Laſtly, I will unveil theſe mens Doctrine of Separation, and
then judg whether it be the Doctrine of Chriſt, which is a Law of
Love, and Union, and Peace; or the Wiſdom from above, which is
firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. It is falſe, that all ſuch Secondary Modal Worſhip, is unlawful,
which is not inſtituted by a fixing Law.</p>
                  <p>2. It is deceit not to diſtinguiſh theſe different things.</p>
                  <p>3. The charge of [<hi>falſe Worſhip</hi>] unexplained, is meer deceit:
1. Worſhip is ſo far [<hi>falſe</hi>], as it is contrary to the Rule. Every
Sermon, Prayer or Sacrament which we adminiſter, hath faultineſs
and ſin, and is ſo far [<hi>falſe Worſhip</hi>]. 2. But Worſhip offered
God on pretence that he inſtituted it when he did not, or that
Man hath authority to command the like, is yet worſe <hi>falſe Worſhip.</hi>
3. And the worſhip of <hi>falſe Gods</hi> or <hi>Idols,</hi> is yet worſe than that, and
abhorred of God.</p>
                  <p>4. His making all <hi>faulty circumſtances,</hi> ſuch as he nameth, to be <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
becauſe <hi>falſe,</hi> as he calls it, is yet more ſinful, and of miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
importance.</p>
                  <p>5. So is it to make the Churches <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> where they do kneel
at the Sacrament, and uſe the Liturgy.</p>
                  <p>6. So is it to feign falſly, that God calleth men to come out
from ſuch, and be ſeparate, becauſe he calleth them out of <hi>Babylon;</hi>
falſly adding to the Laws of God.</p>
                  <p>7. By his Doctrine he maketh Chriſt an Idolater (which Imenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with horror): For he 1. uſed Circumſtances riot inſtituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or by himſelf: He preached on a Mountain, in a Ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
not commanded: He commended <hi>Mary</hi> for anointing him, waſhing
his Feet with Tears, wiping them with her Hair, not inſtituted in
particular: He commended the <hi>Publican</hi> for ſmitinig on his breaſt,
ſtanding far off, not looking to Heaven, without particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
His Cuſtom was to go to the Synagogue-worſhip: He from
his childhood performed Temple-Duties and Service: He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Lepers cleanſed to go to the Prieſts, and offer their due,
and his Diſciples to hear the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet 1. The High Prieſts were not of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s line, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Inſtitution. 2. They bought the Office of <hi>Heathen Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
3. They had it not for life, according to inſtitution. 4. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61069:41"/>
Worſhip, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> were heinouſly corrupted,
ſo that the Hearers were to beware of the Leaven of their Doctrine,
and not to imitate their lives. 4. They were bitter enemies of
Chriſt, and Perſecutors: yet Chriſt never bid his Diſciples to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from any thing but their errors; but ſaith, <hi>They ſhall caſt you out
of the ſynagogues.</hi> And doubtleſs Chriſt committed no ſin; nor can
we be ſo holy as he.</p>
                  <p>8. He condemneth <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church of
old, that uſed ſuch things that were not inſtituted in Worſhip, as
is before mentioned in ſwearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. He maketh the Apoſtles Idolatrous that uſed the like.</p>
                  <p>10. He maketh the Primitive Churches Idolatrous, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to approve it. For they uſed ſuch uninſtituted things: yea,
the <hi>Romans</hi> were guilty of differences in God's Service, and deſpiſing
and judging each other for them; The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were Carnal in
making Parties and Diviſions, they defrauded each other, and went
to Law before <hi>Heathens.</hi> They had Fornicators, Judaizing envious
Slanderers of <hi>Paul,</hi> Heretical deniers of the Reſurrection; ſuch as
eat in Idols Temples, or of their Sacrifices: Were drunk at, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sacrament. The <hi>Galatians</hi> are yet ſharplier charged:
Almoſt all the Seven Churches <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. and 3. had <hi>Nicholaitans,</hi> or
<hi>Jezabels</hi> Doctrine, which God hated: and no Chriſtian is called to
ſeparate from the Communion of any one of all theſe; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to amend, and live in Unity, without diviſon.</p>
                  <p>11. He condemneth as Idolaters all the Churches on Earth, for
Six Hundred, if not One Thouſand Years after the Apoſtles; not
One Church Chriſtian, or Heretick (as far as any Hiſtory tells us
that I have found) did ever deny ſuch things, as he calls Falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
or Idolatry. They all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent further than our Pariſh Churches
do. At Baptiſm they uſed the White Garment, taſting Milk and
Honey, Chriſme or anointing the Forehead, Croſſing; they ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onely Standing, and not Kneeling, every Lords Day, all as
ſignificant Ceremonies: No one Church or Perſon is ſaid to ſcruple
theſe; I think they did not well: but God rejected not their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>12. He maketh all, or near all the Churches on Earth, Idolaters,
at this day: All on Earth, ſave the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are far groſſer in
their Liturgies and Ceremonies than the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Of the <hi>Proteſants,
Sweden, Denmark, Saxony,</hi> and all the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> have Liturgies,
Croſſing, Ceremonies, Church-Images, Conſubſtantiation. The
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61069:42"/>
                     <hi>Helvetians</hi> are ſuch as are called <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> making the Magiſtrate,
the onely Ruler, and Sacraments common. <hi>Geneva,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
yea and <hi>Helland,</hi> have their Liturgies and ſome Rites.</p>
                  <p>13. He condemneth <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and
all Diſſenters that are here called <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> For they have al1
many of the foreſaid uninſtituted things: They put off the Hat in
Church at Prayer. They ſtand up at the Bleſſing; they uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded
geſtures at Sacrament; they uſe Pſalm-verſions, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres,
Tunes Scripture-Tranſlations, Diviſions into Chapter and
Verſe, never inſtituted particularly. The <hi>Scots</hi> uſed a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
by Claſſes, National Aſſemblies of various Elders,
ruling by Vote, inſtead of meer conſulting for Concord, uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                  <p>14. I humbly propoſe it to conſideration, Whether by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
(which he ſeeth not, nor owneth) do not deny Chriſt,
and all the Goſpel, and work of mans redemption: I challenge him to
name me one Church on Earth for many hundred years after the
Apoſtles, that had not that which he calls falſe Worſhip and Idolatry:
Suppoſe this were but in a few Ages, as the ſecond, third, or fourth
Century: Then a Temple of Idols, and Company of Idolaters, is no
true Church: And if at any time there was no Church there was no
Head of the Church: No Kingdom, no King: No Wife, no Husband,
that is no <hi>Chriſt.</hi> How much more, if he make all, or near all the
Church Idolaters to this day, and himſelf with the reſt?</p>
                  <p>15. If it be a heinious ſin to bear falſe Witneſs againſt a Neighbour,
or to ſlander one man, what is it to ſlander and back-bite all the Church
on Earth, and Chriſt himſelf?</p>
                  <p>16. Is it not a work of Satan to deſtroy Love, and to render al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all Chriſtians odious? And doth not he do ſo, that calleth them
Idolaters? Is not this Preaching men, into the hatred of each other?
Do we owe no Love to any Chriſtians, but ſuch as is due to Idolaters?
Is not the fruit of the Spirit otherwiſe deſcribed?</p>
                  <p>17. Doth he not deny that Communion of the Saints, which is an
Article of the Creed? and tempt weak Chriſtians into ſinful Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Diviſions, Slanders, Judgings, Murmurings, Envies, which
are the fruits of the fleſh?</p>
                  <p>18. Doth not this directly deſtroy the Church by Diſſolution? When
there is none to be owned or joyned with, that hath not ſomewhat
which he calleth falſe worſhip. And is not ſeparating the Materials,
deſtroying the houſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61069:42"/>
19. Doth he not directly ruſh into the Sin which, he condemneth
adding to God's Laws, and ſaying he forbids what he forbids not?
yea, fathering on him Laws more rigorous than the Jewiſh, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning
Chriſt's Church as Idolators and falſe Worſhippers?</p>
                  <p>20. I add, ſuch wofully harden men in that which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſuffer by, and which they call enmity and perſecution, and
make more Conformiſts while they deny it, than <hi>R. B.</hi> whom he fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volouſly
talketh of, ever did (except it be a Conformity to Truth and
Goodneſs.) For when men read and hear others confidently rage
againſt Truth and Duty,by raſh preſumptuous ignorance, they judge
of all our diſſent by this: And while many run into this Guilt, it
ſeems to juſtify their Afflicters: And it tempteth weak Perſons to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for ſinful ſeparation as evil doers, thinking it is for Truth. Oh
with what grief will underſtanding men ſee Chriſtians together, as
in a ſtate of enmity by miſtakes. To ſee ſome at once require from
others, things good and neceſſary, things Lawful but unneceſſary;
things neceſſary in their <hi>Genus,</hi> but not this more than that, and ſome
things ſinful, as if they were all almoſt alike. To ſee thoſe whoſe
Senſes are not exerciſed to diſcern things that differ, miſled by the
words and reverence of men, to ſwallow ſome Sins as excellent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and fly from things Lawful; yea, oft from great Duties, as
odious Sins, and ſuffer rejoyeingly for ſinning againſt God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
all that ſin not as they do; yea, even all, or almoſt all the
Churches on Earth; yea, and calling them Idolaters for being wiſer
and better than they, who alas, do in all things ſhew themſelves to
be ignorant Babes, and who ſpeak evil of that which they underſtand
not And then to ſee others revile, and hate, and ruin theſe miſtaking
Chriſtians by a far more dangerous miſtake; as if Religious fear of
Sin, were an unſufferable thing, and ſuch were intollerable Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
and Conſcience were a diſgraceful thing; and as if themſelves
and all Mankind were not liable to worſer Errors, than to take
ſome lawful things for Sin, when they ſee unlawful things ſtand near
them, or among them.</p>
                  <p>But of all this, I have oft ſpoken, and now only ſay again, That if
thoſe juſtly called Separatiſts, and who think Pariſh Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
honeſt Miniſters to be idolatry, or unlawful, will but without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
read what is written to prove it lawful by the old Godly, Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Non-Conformiſits, eſpecially <hi>John Ball</hi>'s Trial of Separation,
<hi>Mr. Hilderſham</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
Mr. <hi>John Paget,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rathband,</hi> &amp;c. they will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61069:43"/>
need no more to ſave them from this ſcandalous Schiſm: But if <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
withdraw or ſeparate from the Gentiles for fear of offending the
Jewiſh Chriſtians, and <hi>Barnabas</hi> be led away with the Diſſimulation,
<hi>Paul</hi> muſt oppoſe it to their Faces: And I that have ſeen what the
Spirit of Diviſion hath done, and read that God never bleſt unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
ſeparation, will imitate <hi>Paul.</hi> And if this World be uncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the Lord prepare me for that World where Love and Unity
have no Enemies.</p>
