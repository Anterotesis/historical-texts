            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REMARKS <hi>On the</hi> Quakers CASE, <hi>deliver'd to the</hi> PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>'TIS beyond a Diſpute, that Liberty of Conſcience, in Matters pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religious, is conſonant to the chriſtian Religion, and the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis as manifeſt that the <hi>Quarkers</hi> do conſcienciouſly ſcruple the taking an <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe Conſiderations the Legiſlature did very favourably and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently grant them, in <hi>England,</hi> an <hi>Affirmation</hi> inſtead of an <hi>Oath,</hi> under the ſame Penalties as Perjury.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> having no Proviſion made for them in this Caſe, and the Relief that is already granted the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> being <hi>in ſuch Words,</hi> that many of them in <hi>England,</hi> and all of them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> think it too much like an Oath; it ſeems but conſiſtent with the Tenderneſs the Legiſlature formerly expreſſed, to grant them an Affirmation that may extend to all <hi>Britain, in ſuch Terms,</hi> as they now deſire; ſince they offer to be made ſubject to all the Pains and Penalties of Perjury; yea, and ſuch farther Puniſhments beſides, as the Parliament ſhall think fit, in caſe they unjuſtly, or untruly make uſe of their Affirmation.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that Oaths are become burthenſome, and almoſt uſeleſs to the Nation, their Frequency having render'd them ſo familiar, that they ſeem leſs dreaded than the Penalty of Perjury; it would therefore be well if there was leſs Swearing, and greater Obligations to ſpeak Truth without it: What Reaſon is there then, that the <hi>Quarkers,</hi> who conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciouſly ſcruple the taking any Oath, ſhould nt be <hi>Reliev'd,</hi> when they willingly ſubmit to greater Penalties for not ſpeaking Truth, than others are ſubject to, for not ſwearing Truth?</p>
            <p>And beſides the Reaſonableneſs of this Requeſt of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> reſpecting <hi>themſelves,</hi> there ſeems an abſolute Neceſſity that it ſhould be granted them reſpecting <hi>others;</hi> for we are none of us ſafe our ſelves without it, ſince tho' to day we may have Writings ſealed, and the ſame well witneſſed, we have to Aſſurance, but a Month hence our Witneſſes may become <hi>Quarkers,</hi> and our Writings thereby be void, for want of Evidence: Or my Father, or ſome other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon makes a Will, and me Executor, but before it be proved the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Will may turn <hi>Quarkers,</hi> and the ſame becomes Null <hi>(to my great Prejudice)</hi> for want of their Evidence to prove it. Other Inſtnaces might be given of the Uſefulneſs thereof, as on account of Elections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſhew that is the Intereſt of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in general, to admit of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Affirmation <hi>in ſuch Words</hi> as they can comply with, under the Penalties and Securities they propoſe.</p>
