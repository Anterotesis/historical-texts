            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AESOP it ſeems is in faſhion, and becauſe it's a kind of Cuſtom to date him from ſome Waters, (like his Predeceſſors) I had as good make uſe of <hi>Iſlington,</hi> ſince it is not very far from thence to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is the end of his Journey. The Fables were written to pleaſe one of Judgment; and whether they
<pb facs="tcp:50976:3"/>
will pleaſe any Body elſe is more than the Author knows, and whom they will not pleaſe he cares not. There is a mode in Prefaces too, and jocond one to theſe looſe Papers in the Modern Tripping Stile, wou'd perhaps paſs them off better; but there are few in theſe days have reaſon to laugh, (except thoſe that win) unleſs it be after the rate of <hi>Mark Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the <hi>Oxford</hi> Madman, who in his deſcription of <hi>Bedlam</hi> ſaid they there made one Sing, and Laugh, till ones Heart akes.</p>
            <p>It may be another account of <hi>Aeſop</hi> than what we have had from <hi>Plaundes Camerarius,</hi> &amp;c. wou'd help to piece out a Leaf; and becauſe one may be given of him, that the leſs ſtudious part of the Town is not well acquainted with, there ſhall be a hint of him, which is, that he is not the man we take him to be, but in ſtead of the <hi>Samian</hi> Slave, we muſt ſeek him in the <hi>Arabian</hi> or <hi>Indian Lohkman,</hi> which is of an Ancienter Date than any <hi>Greek</hi> Imitator of him. For it is no news to the Learned World, that thoſe <hi>Grecians</hi> we ſo much admire, (for what reaſons let Schoolmaſters tell you, for I can't) were but wretched Filchers, and worſe diſguiſers of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Wiſdom, and patch'd up their <hi>Aeſop</hi> from an <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Sage as they did their Fabulous <hi>Theban Hercules,</hi> from the Nobler and much older diſcovering <hi>Tyrian</hi> Merchant, as the name <hi>[Herakol]</hi> implies, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Accounts than theirs inform us. This might be illuſtrated and explain'd, by ſome curious, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Quotations; which no
<pb facs="tcp:50976:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doubt would be call'd Scrawls, and Pothooks; and therefore <hi>Aeſop</hi> or Sad-coloured Monſieur <hi>Lohkman,</hi> with the Princes he was Councellor to, and the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his Fables for the preſent is omitted; it may ſuffice in general to know, that Fables and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables were much more in uſe among the Beaux Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prits of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> than they are with ours (tho' it be a Fabling Age) and were the proper means among them, of conveying Truths to thoſe, who had a Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and Bowſtring (without the help of Speech-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Evidences) at the Service of Wiſer and Honeſter Men than themſelves; who aim'd at Mercy, Truth, Honour, and the Publick Good. This may ſerve for an Excuſe for this digreſſion, and for the deſign of the Fables too; and if they are ſtop'd or enquir'd after, it may ſerve alſo for as good a Juſtification of our boaſting <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties, by way of a Trifle, as the ſuſpenſions of the <hi>Hab— Corp—</hi> Act were in good earneſt.—</p>

            <head>FABLE VIII. Of the Man and his Idols.</head>
            <l>A Superſtitious Man had damn'd ill Fortune,</l>
            <l>Loſſes come daily on, Revenues ſhorten;</l>
            <l>As daily he, that every thing might hap well,</l>
            <l>Ador'd ſome guilded Idols in his Chappel:</l>
            <l>Much time he loſt, much Incence ſmoak'd in vain</l>
            <l>And nothing from the ſenſleſs Things cou'd gain</l>
            <l>Him did a Friend, pitying his want of ſenſe,</l>
            <l>And want of Mony, labour to convince:</l>
            <l>So Reaſon fooliſh Zeal did once o're come,</l>
            <l>When back'd with Rage, and Poverty at home.</l>
            <l>Half-witted Men run often to extreams,</l>
            <l>To Atheiſm from Superſtitious Dreams.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:50976:15"/>Which made him knock his gilded Pagods down;</l>
            <l>The Family ran gladly to his aid,</l>
            <l>Hoping the bigot ſtarving Trade was done,</l>
            <l>And they no more ſhou'd famiſh while he pray'd,</l>
            <l>When from their broken Trunks vaſt Treaſures flew,</l>
            <l>Enough to make him eaſy while he liv'd,</l>
            <l>This heap of Pelf, of which he nothing Knew,</l>
            <l>Was by ſome wealthy Anceſtor contriv'd:</l>
            <l>Who for his wiſe Poſterity did hoard,</l>
            <l>And thought Religious Dread, the Sureſt Guard.</l>
            <l>O'rejoy'd he crys, let others Pray and Bow,</l>
            <l>I've turn'd you to the fitteſt purpoſe now.</l>
