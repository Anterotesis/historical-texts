            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and the cause thereof, woulde be to some pleasing, to
some it would be displeasing. For what one truth can
please mindes so diuersly diuided? would God it could

            <p>I Cannot maruell ynough whereof it commeth
that all of vs are more mooued by iniuries then
by benefites: and that we take the one so much
too hearte imprinting them in our remembraunce,
and forget the other so suddaynely. Truely wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
denie, but that among so many other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
wherewith wee are vnhappily defiled, wee
haue also taken this, of the greate corruption and
maymednesse of our earthly and transitorie humane
nature, wherein there cannot be imagined any thing
more vnconuenient nor more hurtefull, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochefull
vnthankfulnesse, whiche a man might
rightly terme the welspring of all Vices. For by it our
myndes are so drawne away and peruerted, that the
more wee bee besette rounde aboute, and loden with
the benefites of GOD our Soueraigne Father, so
muche the more become wee blockishe, and as it were
distraught and out of our wits, running after our own
lusts and vanities, wherthrough (as though wee had
drunke of the Riuer <hi>Lethe,</hi>) we forget our selues, and
misspende our whole time, busying our heades like li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Children that goe seeking of pinnes in the Sande,
whereaboute they are so wholly occupied, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a man call them, they heare him not, or at
leastwise make as though they hearde him not: from

whence if wee did nowe and then lifte vp our eyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
Heauen, and inforce our selues too remember the
greate benefite that wee daily receiue of his right fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
goodnesse and mercy: it were not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but we shoulde be more inclined to loue him, and
too obey his holy will, than wee be: whereas (which
worse is) we be not onely carelesse to yeeld due thanks
vnto him, but also at al times cease not to offend him:
so deepely is the vice of vnthankfulnesse rooted in vs.
Rightly may he be blamed for vnthankefulnesse, which
acknowledgeth not the good that hath been doone to
him, at leastwise by saying Gramereie: Vnthankfull is
he that forgetteth it: but tootoo vnthankful is he that
rendereth euill for good. Wherefore wee can finde no

Let vs by true faith runne betweene the armes of his

(whosoeuer he was) was wholly mynded to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
all thinges vnto them, without seeking or affecting
any finenesse of speech, or great darknesse of sentences.

entred into the world, &amp; death by sinne: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
so death went ouer al men, forasmuch
as al men haue sinned. For vntil the law,
sinne was in the worlde: but sinne was
not regarded as long as there was no law.
Neuer the latter death reigned from Adam
<pb facs="tcp:26143:11"/>
vnto <hi>Moyses,</hi> euen ouer them also that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
not after the like manner of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of Adam, who was a figure of him
that was to come. But yet the gift is not so
as is the offence: for if through the offence
of one, many be dead: much more the grace
of God, and the gift by grace which is by
one man Iesus Christe, hath abounded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many. Neither is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gift so as that which
entred in by one that sinned. For the fault
came of one offence vnto condemnation,
but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gift is of many offences to iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For if by the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of one, death reigned
through one: much more shall they which
receiue the abundance of grace and of the
gift of righteousnesse, reigne in life through
one, that is, Iesus Christ. Likewise then,
as by the offence of one, that fault came on
al men to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, so by the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of one, the benefite abounded toward
all men to the iustification of life. For as
by one mans disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce many were made
sinners: so by the obedience of one shal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
also bée made righteous. Moreouer the
lawe entred thereupon, that the offence
should abound: neuerthelesse where sinne
abounded, there grace abounded muche
more, that as sin hath reigned vnto death,
<pb facs="tcp:26143:12"/>
so might grace also reigne by righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
vntoo eternall life through Iesus
Christe our Lord. By these wordes of S.
Paul, wée manifestly perceiue the thing
to be true, which we haue said héereto fore:
that is to wit, that the law was geuen too
make sinne knowne: which sinne wée doe
also knowe, not to be of greater force than
Christes righteousnesse, wherethrough we
be iustified before God. For euen as Iesus
Christ is stronger than Adam was: so is
his righteonsnesse more mightie than the
sinne of Adam. And if the sinne of Adam
was sufficient enough to make al men sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and children of wrath without any
misdéedes of our owne: muche more shall
Christes righteousnesse be of greater force

for somuch as they make vs too swarue

euery man ought to impute his saluation,

inforce this sentence the more, he addeth
further, that he estéemeth all things but as

God geueth by sayth to all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue

that al those which beleue in Iesus

and to shrowd our selues vnder the diuine

be receiued for righteous afore God. And
certainely this is true. For if wée appeare

But contrariwise, yf GOD sée vs

that hée maketh himselfe righteous before
<pb facs="tcp:26143:27"/>
God by doeing some workes which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable

all the works which procéed out of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane

and filthie, and consequently cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
vnto God, nor haue any power to
make the partie righteous. Therefore wée
must first of all cleanse the hearte, if wee
minde that our workes should please God.
The cleansing of the hearte proceedeth
of faith, as the holy Ghost affirmeth by the
mouth of S. Peter.<note place="margin">Acts. 15.</note> Then must wee not
say that the vnrighteous person and the

to be become righteous by the merits
and righteousnesse of Christe, (which hee

&amp; doeth good woorkes, alonely for the

did wonderful thinges, healing the sicke,
giuing sight to the blind, walking vpon the
water, and raysing vp the dead vnto life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
&amp; yet these merueilous works were
not the cause that he was God. For before
he did any of those things, he was God and
the lawful and only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sonne of God,
and he néed not to worke those miracles to
make himself God by them, but forasmuch
as he was God, therfore he did them. And
so, the miracles that Christ wrought, made
him not to be God, but shewed openly that
he was God. In likewise, true fayth is as
it were a Godhead in the Soule of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
which doeth wonderous works, &amp; is
neuer weary of well doyng, and yet those
<pb facs="tcp:26143:32"/>
works are not the cause that a Christian is
a christian, that is to wit, that he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
good, holy, and acceptable vntoo God,
neither néedeth he to woorke all those good
workes to become such a one. But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he is a christian by fayth, lyke as
Iesus Christ being a man was also God
by his Godhead; hee dooth all those good
woorkes, which make not the christian too
be righteous and good, but shewe him to be
good, righteous and holy. So then, like as
Christes Godhead was the cause that hée
wrought miracles: euen so faith working
through loue, is the cause of the good works
that a christen man doeth. And like as a
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may say of Iesus Christ, that hee hath
done this miracle or that, &amp; that those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
besids that they glorified God, were
also a great honor vnto Iesus Christ as he
was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who for his obedience euen vnto
death, was reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penced at Gods ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in his
resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; had geuen vnto him al power

as in respect of his manhood, but deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it by the vnion w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is betwixt the worde
of God and the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hood of Christ: So doeth
faith in a Christian, which faith by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
the vnion that it hath with the soule, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth
that thing too the one in is proper
<pb facs="tcp:26143:33"/>
to the other: whervpon it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, that the
holy scripture promiseth the christian euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life for his good woorks, because good
works are the fruites and testimonies of
liuely faith, and procéed of it as light procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a flame of fire, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rding as I haue
said hertofore. And by this holy faith which
imbraceth Iesu Christ, it commeth to passe
that our soule is ioyned with Christ, and is
so vnited and knit to him, that whatsoeuer
Christ hath merited &amp; deserued, the same is
imputed vnto the soule, as though it had
merited and deserued it. And therefore S.
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that God crowneth his
owne giftes in vs. Of this vnion of the
soule with Iesus Christ, Christ himselfe
beareth good recorde, where hee prayeth so
his father for his Apostles and for such as
should beléeue in him by their preaching:<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> I
pray not (saith he) for them onely, but also
for al those that shal beléeue in me through

thou hast sent me, and that I haue geuen
them the glory which thou hast geuen me,
so as they should be one selfsame thing like
<pb facs="tcp:26143:33"/>
as thou and I are one. Whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
euidently, that if we beléeue the word
of the Apostles (who preached that Iesus
Christ died for our sinnes,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> and rose againe
for our iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) we become al one thing
with him: and forasmuch as he is all one

By this present discourse a man may
plainly perceiue the difference y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is betwixt
vs &amp; them that defend the iustification by

with them, that we stablish workes, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

be without good works, &amp; that those which
are become righteous are they that doe the
good woorks that may rightly be called good
works. But we differ from them in this,
that we say,<note place="margin">1. Pet-2.</note> that faith maketh men righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
without the help of woorke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And the
reason is ready: namely, because that by
faith we put on Christe, and make his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and righteousnesse to be ours. And
séeing the case so standeth, that Christes
righteousnesse is geuen vs by fayeth:<note place="margin">

blood of Oxen and Goates and the Ashes of
a Cow sprinckled, cleanseth the vncleane,
as touching the cleansing of the flesh: how
much more shal that blood of Iesus Christ,
who by the euerlasting spirite offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
vndefiled vnto God, to cleanse our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
from dead workes to serue the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God? I pray thée now, thou good and
deuout christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, consider wel which of these
two opinions is the truest, holiest, and wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thiest
to be preached: Ours, which aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the benefit of Iesus Christ, &amp; pulleth
downe the pride of man which would exalt
his owne woorkes against Christes glory,
or the other, which by affirming that faith
of it selfe iustifieth not, defaceth the glory
and benefite of Iesus Christe, and puffeth
vp the pride of man, who cannot abide to
bée iustified fréely by our Lord Iesus Christ
without some merit of his owne. But (say
they) it is a greate quickening vp to good
woorkes to say that a man maketh himself
righteous before God by meanes of them.
I answeare, that we also confesse that good
<pb facs="tcp:26143:34"/>
workes are acceptable to God, &amp; that he of
his méere grace and frée liberalitie recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penceth
them in paradise. But we say more
ouer, that no woorkes are good, sauing
those that (S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) are done by
those that are become righteous through
faith, because, that if the tree be not good, it
cannot yeelde good fruit. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urthermore
we say, that such as are become righteous
through fayth, forasmuch as they knowe
themselues to be righteous through Gods
righteousnesse purchased by Christ, make
no bargayning with God for their works,
as though they woulde buy their maner of
iustification such as it is with them: but
béeing inflamed with the loue of God, and
desirous to glorifie Iesus Christ who hath
made them righteous by geuing them his
merites and riches, they bestow all theyr
whole studie and labour to doe Gods will,
fighting manfully agaynst the loue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and agaynst the world and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.
And when they fal through frailty of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
flesh, they recouer themselues by and by, &amp;
are so much the more desirous to do good, &amp;
so much the more in loue with their God,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering that he layeth not their sins to
their charge, bicause they be ingrafted into
<pb facs="tcp:26143:35"/>
Iesus Christ, who hath made ful amendes
for all his members, vppon the trée of his
trosse, and maketh continuall intercession
for them to the eternall father, who for the
loue of his onely begotten sonne beholdeth
them alwaies with a gentle countenance,
gouerning and defending them as his most
deare children, and in the end geuing them
the heritage of the world, making thé like
fashioned to the glorious image of Christ.
These louing motions are y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> spurres that
pricke forward the true Christians to doe
good woorks: who considering that they are
become the children of God through faith, &amp;
made partakers of his diuine nature, are

               </gap> laboureth
to aray himselfe in some faire and rostely

And therfore to be clothed with Iesus

so is he in very déede, if we beléeue so, and

vs to doe, but to glorifie God by following
the life of Iesus Christe, and to doe to our
brethren as Christe hath doone to vs: and
specially forasmuch as wee bee warranted
by his word, that whatsoeuer we do to his
brethren &amp; ours, he accepteth it as a benefit
doone to himselfe. And doubtles séeing that
the true Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are members of Christ,
we cannot do either good or euil to the true
Christians, but wee doe it likewise vntoo
Christ, insomche that he reioyceth or suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in his members. Therfore like as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christe is our clothing by faith, so also
must we through loue become the clothing
of our brethren, &amp; haue as good care of them
as of our owne bodies: for they be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers
of our body, wherof Christ is the head. And
this is the holy godly loue &amp; charity which
springeth and procéedeth of the true vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> which GOD hath breathed into
his elect: which faith (as saieth S. Paul)
worketh by loue. Howbeit forasmuche as
the life of our Lorde Iesus Christe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
we must be clothed,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.

if we wil fashion our selues like

crosse, as he himself saith: If any man wil
come after me, let him forsake himselfe, &amp;
take vp his crosse and follow me.<note place="margin">Luke. 9.</note> But the
chief cause of this crosse is, for that our god
purposeth to mortifie the affections of our
mind and the lustes of our flesh by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise:
to the end we may conceaue in our
selues the great perfection wherein we bee
comprised by our Lorde Iesus Christe, by
being grafted into him. Also his wil is, that

Moreouer his intent is, that we by our

which the world in despite of it, beholdeth
in vs, inasmuch as our frailtie becommeth
strong by troubles and persecutions, &amp; the
more that it was beaten downe and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
so much the more it is strong &amp; stedfast.
Whereof the Apostle S. Paul saieth,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 2. Cor. 4.</note> wee

the Lorde imputeth not sinne. But it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

that vpon these wordes he take no liberty

suche as honor themselues with the name

But it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth the true Christians, who

And therefore when wée bée prouoked too

Then did Iesus Christe make his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherin he promiseth forgiuenesse of

that the saide Testament shoulde be of ful
force, he hath confirmed it with his owne
precious blood and with his owne death.
By reason whereof, Saint Paul sayeth,<note place="margin">Heb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And furthermore, forasmuche as I sée

that thou must assure thy selfe, that al
these are but temptations of the diuel, who
by al meanes seeketh to rob vs of that faith
and confidence that springeth of faith, &amp; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth

He laboureth to strip our soule out of this

a true Christian, except he beléeue Gods
woorde, which promiseth forgeuenesse of
all sinnes, and peace too all them, which
accept the grace of the Gospel. Uerily I say
that he which vpon these promises of God,
<pb facs="tcp:26143:50"/>
perswadeth not himselfe assuredly, that
God is a mercifull and louing father vnto
him, nor with stedfast confidence looketh to
receiue the inheritance of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
at his hand: is not faithful in déed, &amp;
maketh himselfe vtterly vnwoorthy of
Gods grace. In respect whereof,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note> S. Paule
saith, that we be the temple of God, so far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
as we firmely mainteine the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and glory of our hope, vnto the ende.
And in another place he exhorteth vs that
we shoulde not geue ouer our trust,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> which
hath great reward of recompence. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
my brethren, let vs geue our whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to doe the will of God, as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
good children, and beware that wee
sinne not, as neere as wee can. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee fall oftentimes intoo sinne
through our owne frailtie, yet let vs not by
&amp; by surmise, that we be vessels of wrath,
or that we be vtterly forsaken of the holy
Ghost: for we haue our Aduocate Iesus
Christ before God the father, and he is the
attonement maker for our sinnes. Let vs
bethinke vs of the opinion of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
who saith that none of the Saints is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and without sinne: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that, he ceaseth not to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and holy, so farfoorth as he retaine his

holinesse with affection. And therfore if we
haue afflictions and tribulations,<note place="margin">Afflictions are no signes of reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</note> let vs not

The Lord (saith Salomon) chastiseth
him whome hee loueth, and scourgeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

our spirite recorde, that we be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God. Now then, if we be children,
we be also heires. And we must mark wel,
that in these two places, the Apostle Saint
Paule speaketh plainly, not of any speciall
reuelation, but of a certayne record which
the holy Ghost doeth commonly yéelde too
all such as receiue the grace of the Gospel.
Then if the holy Ghost assure vs that wee
bée Gods children and heires: why shoulde

And moreouer we say with Sainte

not the spirite of this worlde,<note place="margin">1. Eor. 2.</note> but the spirit

some which say, that no man ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume

as if the Christian should glory of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hauing

without w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> glorying, there cannot be any
Christianity at al. But Iesus Cherist (who
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ly) saith, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> his spirit is vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

world,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> and that they onely doe know him,
within whom he dwelleth. Then let them
begin to become god Christians, and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Iewish mindes, and imbrace the
grace of the holy Gospel in good earnest: &amp;
then shal they know that the good and true
Christians both haue the holy Ghost, &amp; also
acknowledg ethe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to haue him. But
some one may say to me, that the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
cannot by any meanes know that he is in
Gods fauour, without some speciall reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
and so consequently, that he cannot
know whether he be predestinated or no.
And he may specially alledge these wordes
of Solomon,<note place="margin">Eccle. 6.</note> A man knoweth not whether
he be worthy of hatred or of loue: and also
these wordes of the Apostle<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> S. Paul to the

yet is there not any man so dull,
<pb facs="tcp:26143:53"/>
who in reading Solomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s whole discourse,
may not plainely perceiue, that by saying

the selfesame chaunces which light vppon
the righteous: light also vpon the vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
vpon him that sacrifizeth, aswell as
vpon him that sacrifizeth not: and as soone
vppon the good man as vppon the sinner.
Whereof it may be gathered, that GOD
doeth not alwayes shew his loue towards those
whome hée indueth with outwarde
prosperities: and contrariwise, that hée
sheweth not his displeasure towards those
whome hée punisheth. Then my ryght
deare brethren in Christe Iesus our Lorde
doe you thinke it reason to conclude, that a
man cannot bee sure of Gods fauour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the same surenesse cannot bée percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the sundry chaunces, that happen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
day in these transitory and temporall
thinges? A little afore, Solomon saith
that a man cannot discerne any difference
betwéene the soule of man, and the life of
a Beast: for it is séene that both man and
Beast dye after one manner. Shall wée
then conclude by this outwarde accident,
<pb facs="tcp:26143:54"/>
that the perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we haue concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the immortality of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> soule, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
but only vpon coniecture: so surely:
and it were a great folly to stande vppon a
thing so notably knowne. And as for S.
Paules wordes, I say, that forasmuche as
he was speaking of the administration of
the Gospell, hee ment that his hearte mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giues
him not of any misdealing therein,
and yet for all that, that hée is not sure hee
hath doone his whole dutie to the full, and
therein obteined the prayse of righteousnes
to Godward, as if he had done all that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
and was conuenient to be done by
a faithful Steward: and therefore in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his office, like a iust and discrete
person, he durst not iustifie himselfe, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uow
that he had discharged his dutie to the
uttermost, and satisfied his Lords wil, but
referred all thinges to the only iudgement
of his Lord. And verily, whosoeuer readeth
these wordes of the Apostle S. Paul, and
considereth the wordes going afore them
with some iudgement, and likewise the
wordes that folow: wil not doubt, but this
is the true sense of them. I know well that
some men in expounding these woordes of
the Apostle S. Paul, say, that although hée
knew himselfe to be without sinne, yet hée
<pb facs="tcp:26143:54"/>
knew not whether hee were righteous to
Godward or no, according as Dauid affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that no man can perfectly know his
owne sinnes.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 5.</note> But these men perceiued not
that S. Paul groundeth not righteousnes
vppon woorkes but vppon faith, and that
he vtterly refuseth his owne righteousnes
to imbrace onely the righteousnesse which
God hath geuen vs, through our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ.<note place="margin">Phillip. 3.</note> Also they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider not, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he was
most certaine to be accepted for righteous,
in mainteining the soundnesse &amp; purenes
of the Christian faith, and that hee knewe
well how the crowne of that righteousnes
was laide vp for him in heauen: and also,
that he was fully assured,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.</note> that no creature
in heauen, earth, nor hel, was able to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
him from the loue of God, and that he
longed to die because he knew for a trueth,
that after his death,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> he should bée with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. All which things should be false
if he had not béen well assured that he was

these two authorities of Solomon and S.

declare them all particularly, I shoulde be

feare of punishment was proper to the old
Testament, and childly loue too the newe

witnesseth, when hée saith to the Romans,
yée haue not receiued the spirite of bondage

of adoption, whereby wée crie, father, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  </gap>. Tim. 1</note> And likewise vnto Timothie he saith,
that GOD hath not geuen vs the spirite
of fearefullnes, but rather of power and
loue: which spirite Iesus Christe hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs according too the promise made by
the mouth of the Holy Prophetes, and
brought to passe, that wèe being deliuered
out of our enimies handes, may serue him
without feare before his holy presence, in
all holynesse &amp; righteousnesse all the dayes
of our life. By these and many other places
of the holy Scripture, a man may playnly
gather, that the paineful and slauish feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
<pb facs="tcp:26143:55"/>
agréeth not with a Christian: and
this is already confirmed by this, that such
manner of fearefulnesse is vtterly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the spirituall chéerefulnesse and ioy,
which is peculiar to the Christian, as the
Apostle Saint Paul sheweth openly to the
Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> saying that the kingdome of
God is righteousnesse, and peace, and ioy
in the holy Ghost: that is to say, that euery
man which entereth into the kingdome of
the grace of the Gospell, is become righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
through faith: and afterwarde addeth
peace of conscience, which consequently
bréedeth such a spirituall and holy rest and
gladnes,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6. Phillip. 4.</note> in respect wherof, the same Saint
Paul doth oftentimes incourage the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to liue meryly. And Saint Peter
sayth,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.</note> that all they which beléeue in Iesus
Christe, doe continually reioyce with an
unspeakeable and glorious ioy, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that they be afflicted with diuerse

Scripture threatneth and frayeth the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
they must vnderstande, that it spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to such as are so licencious, that for so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
as they kéepe not the thankfulnesse
&amp; honesty that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ng to Gods children, they
must be handled as seruantes, and hilde in
awe, vntill they come to taste and féele
<pb facs="tcp:26143:56"/>
how swéete and pleasant the Lord is, and
untill such time as faith worke his affectes
in them, and that they haue so much child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loue, as may suffice to kéepe and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
them in honestie of Christian conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and in folowing the example of our
Lorde Iesus Christe. And when the selfe
same scripture exhorteth Christians to the
true feare: it meaneth not that they should
feare the iudgement and wrath of God, as
though it were presently ready to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for as I haue saide already) by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
which the holy Ghost geueth to theyr
spirite, they knowe that God hath chosen
them and called them, of his owne méere
mercy, and not for their deserts. By reason
whereof, they doubt not at all, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by the

them in the happy state wherein hee

scripture exhorteth them,<note place="margin">The effects of childly feare.</note> not to slauish
feare but to childishe, that is to wit, that
like good children they shoulde bee loath too
offend against the Christian religion,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.</note> or to
commit any thing against the duty and ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nestie
of Gods true children, and likewise
too gréeue the holy Ghost that dwelleth in
them: to the ende that knowing the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptednesse
of our nature, wée shoulde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb facs="tcp:26143:56"/>
be héedefull and diligent, and neuer

enimies of the soule, lay a thousande
snares and baytes for vs, incessantly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

wherevnto the whole Scripture exhorteth
the Christiaes that haue once tasted howe
swèete the Lorde is, and which bestowe all
their indeuour in following Christes foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steppes,
who cast not from them this holy
feare, because they labour to put of the old
man. And the good Christians must neuer
bereaue themselues quite &amp; cleane of this
childly feare, which is the singular friende
of Christian charitie, like as the slauishe
feare is such an enemie vnto it, as they can
by no meanes dwell togeather. And by the
the foresaide thinges,<note place="margin">The Christian may war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant himself the forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his sinnes.</note> a man may plainely
perceiue, that the good Christian ought
neuer too doubt of the forgiuenesse of his
sinnes, nor of Gods fauour. Neuerthelesse,
for the better satisfiyng of the Reader, I
purpose too set downe héere vnder, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
authorities of the holy. Doctours,
which comfirme this foresaid trueth. Saint
<hi>Hyllary</hi> in his fifth Canon vpon Matthew
<pb facs="tcp:26143:57"/>
sayth, it is Gods wyll, that we should hope
without any doubting of his vnknowne
wil. For if the beliefe bée doubtfull, there
can bée no righteousnesse obteined by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeuing.
And thus wée sée, that according to
S. <hi>Hyllary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Hillary.</note> a man obteineth not forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his sinnes at Gods hande, except
hèe belèeue vndoubtedly to obteine it. And
good right it is that it shoulde bée so.<note place="margin">Iames. 1.</note> For
he that doubteth, is like a waue of the sea,
which is tossed and turmoyled with the
winde. And therefore let not such a one
thinke to obteine any thing at Gods hand.
But let vs heare Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> who
in his Manuell counselleth vs too driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the saide foolish imagination,<note place="margin">S. Augu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

intendeth to dispossesse vs of the foresaide
good and sage assurednesse. Let such foolish
imagination (sayth hee) murmure as much
as it lifteth, saying, who art thou? Hows
great is that glory? By what desertes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
thou too obteine it? I answere assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly:
I knowe in whome I haue beléeued
and I know that hée (of his great loue)
hath made mée his sonne: I knowe hée is
true of his promise, and able too perfourme
his worde: For hée can doe what hée will.
And when I thinke vpon the Lords death,
the multitude of my sinnes cannot dismay
<pb facs="tcp:26143:57"/>
mée, for in his death doe I put all my
trust. His death is my whole desert, it is
my refuge, it is my saluation, my life and
resurrection, and the mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of the Lorde is
my desert, I am not poore of desert, so long
as the Lord of mercy sayleth me not. And
sith the mercies of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord are many: many
also are my deseruinges. The more y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hée is
of power to saue, the more am I sure to bée
saued. The same S. <hi>Augustin</hi> talking with
GOD in another place, sayth that hée
had despayred by reason of his great sinnes
and infinite negligences, if the woorde of
GOD had not become flesh. And a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one
after, hée sayth these wordes: All my hops
all the assurance of my trust is setled in his
precious blood, which was shed for vs and
for our saluation. In him my poore heart
taketh breath: and putting my whole
trust in him, I long to come vnto thée O
Father, not hauing mine owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but that righteousnesse of thy sonne
Iusus Christe. In these two places Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth plainely, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
must not be afraide, but assure him
selfe of righteousnesse, by grounding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
not vpon his owne workes, but vpon
the precious blood of Iesus Christe, which
<pb facs="tcp:26143:58"/>
cleanseth vs from all our sinnes, and
maketh our peace with GOD. Saint
<hi>Bernarde</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Bernard</note> in his first Sermon vppon the
Annunciation saueth moste euidently,
that it is enough to beléeue that a man can
haue forgiuenesse of our sinnes, but by
Gods mercy: nor any one good desire or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
too doe so muche as one good worke,
except GOD geue it him: no nor that
a man cannot deserue eternall life by his
workes, but if GOD geue him the gifte
so to beléeue: But besides all these things
(sayth Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) which ought rather
too bée counted a certaine entraunce and
foundation of our faith,) it is néedeful that
thou beléeue also, that thy sinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen
thée for the loue of Iesus Christe.<note place="margin">Eche one must beleue particularly his sinnes are released &amp; forgeuen him freely.</note>
Sée howe this holy man confesseth that it
is not enough too beléeue generally the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenesse
of sinnes: but hée must also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue
particularly that his owne sinnes are
forgeuen him by Iesus Christe, and the
reason is ready at hande: namely, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuche
as GOD hath promised thée to
accept thée for righteous through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
of Iesus Christe, if thou beléeue not
that thou art become righteous through
him, thou makest GOD a lyer, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb facs="tcp:26143:58"/>
thou makest thy selfe vnworthie
of thy grace and liberality. But thou wilt
say to me, and I beléeue wel the forgeuenesse of
sinnes, and I knowe that GOD is true:
but I am afraide that I am not worthie to
haue so great a gift. I answere, that the
forgiuenes of thy sinnes shall not be a gift
of free grace, but a wages, if God woulde
geue it thée for the worthinesse of thy
workes. But I reply vpon thée, that God
accepteth thée for righteous, and laieth not
thy sinne to thy charge, because of Christs
merits, which are geuen vnto thée, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thine by faith. Therefore, following
the Counsell of Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> beléeue
thou not onely the forgeuenesse of sinnes
in generall, but also apply the same beliefe
to thine owne particular person, by belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
without any doubt, that all thy mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doinges
are pardoned thée through Iesus
Christ. And in so doing thou shalt geue the
glory vnto GOD, by confessing hym too
bée mercifull and true, and shalt become
righteous and holy before GOD, forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
as by the same confession, the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
&amp; righteousnesse of Iesus Christ, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bée
communicated vntoo thée. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to our purpose of Predestination: I
<pb facs="tcp:26143:59"/>
say, that by the thinges aboue mencioned,
a man may euidently perceiue, that the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of Predestination doeth the hurt,
but rather greatly profite the true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
And I thinke not that it can hurt the
false Christians and reprobates. For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
that such manner of folke woulde beare
themselues in hande, and pretende too the
worldewarde too bée of the number of the
predestmate: yet can they neuer perswade
theyr owne consciences, which will euer
bée gnawing and crying out to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But yet it séemeth greatly, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Predestination may hurt them.
For they bée woonts to say: If I bée of the
number of the reprobates, what shall it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
mée too doe good workes? And if I bée
of the number of the predestinate, I shal be
saued without any labouring of mine too
doe good workes. I answere thée at few<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
wordes, that by suche diuelishe arguments
they increase Gods wrath against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
who hath disclosed the knowledge
of Predestination too the Christians, too
make them whot, and not colde in the loue
of God: and to set them forwarde and not
backeward vnto good workes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the true Christian, on the one side hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb facs="tcp:26143:59"/>
himselfe assuredly predestinated vnto
euerlasting lyfe, and to be saued, not at all
by his owne merits, but by Gods election,
who hath predestinated vs not for our
owne works sakes, but to shew the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his mercie: And on the other side
endeuoureth himselfe to doe good woorkes
after the example of Iesus Christ asmuch
as if his saluation depended vpon his own
pollicy and paines taking. As for him that
ceasseth to do good because of the doctrine of
Predestination, saying: If I be predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I shall be saued without strayning of
my selfe to doe good woorkes: he sheweth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently,
that his trauelling is not for the
loue of God, but for the loue of himselfe.
By reason whereof, the woorkes that he
doeth, may perhaps be good and holy too
the sight of men, but they bee wicked and
abhominable before the Lorde God, who
hath an eye to the intent. And herevppon it
may be gathered, that the doctrine of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
worketh rather good than harm
to the false Christians. For it discouereth
their hypocris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, which cannot cure it selfe
so long as it lieth hidden vnder the mantle
of outward workes. But I woulde hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them that say, I will not streine my selfe
<pb facs="tcp:26143:60"/>
to doe wel, for if I be predestinated: I shal
be saued without tiring of my self so much:
I say, I woulde haue them tell me, howe
it happeneth, that when they be diseased,
they say not also I will haue neither Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
nor phisicke: for looke what God had
determined vpon me, cannot but come too
passe? why eate they? why drinke they?
why till they the ground? why plant they
Uines? &amp; why be they so diligent in doing
all thinges conuenient for to sustaine y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die?
why say they not also, that all these
turmoylings, pollicies, &amp; trauailes of ours
are superfluous, forasmuch as it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
but that whatsoeuer God hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séene
and determined concerning our life &amp;
death, must néeds come to passe? And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and idle in thinges pertayning to the
bodie: why should it make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and negligent in that which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the Christian perfection, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all comparison is farre nobler then the
body? But forasmuche as we sée that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iesus Christ, nor Saynte Paule, for
any doubt of offending the reprobats haue
forborne to preache the trueth, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the edifying of the chosen, for the
<pb facs="tcp:26143:60"/>
loue of whom the euerlasting sonne of God
became man, and was put to death vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
Crosse: we also in likewise ought not to
forbeare the preaching of Predestination
to the true Christians, forasmuche as wee
haue séene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it importeth greate edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Now are we come to the end of our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
wherein our thiefe intent hath béene
(according to our small power) to magnify
the wonderful benefit which the Christen
man hath receiued by Iesus Christ crusifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
&amp; to shewe that faith of her selfe alone
iustifieth, that is to wit, that God receiueth
&amp; holdeth them for righteous, which beleue
stedfastly, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Christ hath made full amends
for their sinnes: howbeit, that as light can
not be separated from fire, which of it selfe
burneth and deuoureth al thinges: euen so
good woorkes cannot bee separated from
saith, which alone by it selfe iustifieth.</p>
            <p>And this holy doctrine (which exalteth
Iesus Christ, and represseth &amp; abateth the
pride of man) hath and alwayes shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected,
and fought agaynst, by such Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
as haue Iewish myndes. But happie
is hée, who following the example of Saint
Paule, spoyleth himselfe of his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<pb facs="tcp:26143:61"/>
and would haue none other righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
than that which is of Iesus
Christ, wherewith if he be clothed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareled,
he may most assuredly appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and shal receiue his blessing and
the heritage of heauen and earth, with his
