         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Third Letter to <hi>F. Lewis Sabran,</hi> Jeſuit: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Defence of his Challenge, concerning <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints,</hi> is Examined and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO you are reſolved to break off our Controverſial Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
by Letters, yet I am for keeping to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
method, and for directing this Anſwer to you, ſince
you are ſo much concerned in it; and it is wholly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to convince you of your further miſtakes, and thoſe groſs Errors
you have been guilty of, in your pretended <hi>Defence</hi> of your <hi>Challenge</hi>
about <hi>Invocation of Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You begin the Defence with two heavy Complaints, one of
which is, That my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to your <hi>Challenge</hi> was ſo tedious in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out: The other is, That I have abuſed you in it.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Complaints is a very pleaſant one; In my laſt
Letter to you, I told you that I would undertake the buſin<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi>
as ſoon as the Controverſy about St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> was either end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or dropt, and not ſooner. Upon this I expected when I ſhould
hear from you about it, but to no purpoſe; for it ſeems there was
nothing further to be ſaid, and you had had enough of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy:
So that after I had waited Six Weeks for your Anſwer,
but heard of none, I had reaſon to conclude That Controverſy was
ended; and therefore in my Anſwer to the Vindication of the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes
Teſtium,</hi> reſolved to give an <hi>Anſwer</hi> alſo to your Challenge.</p>
            <p>This is the true ſtate of that buſineſs; and yet with an Air of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
becoming your ſelf, the World muſt be told of a tedious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of my Anſwer, which had worn out Three Months;
whereas the Anſwer to your <hi>Challenge</hi> ſhould not have been waited
for three days, could I but have gueſſed that my ſecond Letter had
done your buſineſs ſo effectually as I ſince find it hath: But to paſs
this impertinent Preface; you next charge me with abuſing you, and
ſlandering you in my Anſwer. I am not able to find where this
Abuſe and Slanders are; nor can I gueſs what it is there, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
this imputation, unleſs it be, that to prove a Jeſuit to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
is to ſlander him: If this be the thing (as it muſt be; for I
can find nothing elſe to fix it upon) I do plead guilty; and ſince
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65736:3"/>
you have again compell'd me to animadvert upon you, I am reſolv'd
to be very free with you, and to ſpeak my mind plainly, tho I find I
ſhall quickly fall into the very ſame ſlandering humour; for you have
made me a large Proviſion for that purpoſe, and I will not let any
piece of it eſcape me.</p>
            <p>Well, now we are come to the buſineſs of <hi>Invocation</hi> it ſelf, and
you have m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de ſuch Tragical Work about it, as if Invocation of
Saints, and Chriſtianity, were to ſtand and fall together; as if we
that oppoſe Invocation of Saints, were enemies to the Saints in Glory,
had denied the Chriſtians common Creed, were contrary to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Militant Church; and, which is worſt of all, had called God's
Veracity into queſtion. This is terrible ſtuff, and I queſtion not but
that it takes mightily among the Women of your Party; but I am
afraid is quite loſt upon our people, who will certainly laugh at ſuch
wretched ſtuff, as knowing very well, that the true Church of God did
never practice Invocation of Saints; and that the Creed did no more
teach it, than the Worſhipping of Idols, or Tranſubſtantiation; but
you are one of thoſe, that ſo you may but gain your end of frighting
people to continue with, or come over to you, never boggle at the
moſt unjuſt, and the moſt abſurd means of doing it.</p>
            <p>I do not in the leaſt wonder at your talking at this extravagant
rate; I cannot but remember that you appeared with the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
bluſtering in the defence of the forged <hi>35th</hi> Sermon of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin;</hi>
that you made as much noiſe, and talked to the Proteſtant Peer
with as much aſſurance, as if it had been the certaineſt thing in
the World, that the Sermon was St. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> and that I was an
impudent ignorant fellow for offering to deny it: But after all that
ſtorm, the World remembers, and I hope that Lord was ſatisfied too,
That it was the moſt Impudent Controverſy that ever was attempted
by any Man, to defend that Sermon; and that it was defended with
Arguments and Authorities that every Scholar would have been
aſhamed of. What ado had we with S. <hi>Hierom, H<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phonſus, Mallion</hi>'s
Sermon, with <hi>Neceph<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rus</hi>'s <hi>Juvenal,</hi> every one of which were the moſt
wretched Forgeries that could have been pickt up. What a paſs
were things brought to in the <hi>Reply,</hi> when you were for denying your
own words about S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> for eating up thoſe about the <hi>Aſſumption
ſignifying the day of the Saints Death;</hi> and for aſſerting that the <hi>Louvain
Divines</hi> had not left the <hi>18th</hi> Sermon <hi>de Sancth,</hi> as <hi>doubtful.</hi> Never was
Cauſe managed with more Impudence and more Forgeries, and yet
after all your confidence at firſt, and bluſtering throughout, it was
dropt as quietly as if no ſuch thing had ever been, and in your new
Defence not a ſyllable of it, or in Anſwer to my Second Letter,
which it ſeems now muſt never have one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65736:3"/>
I muſt tell you, Sir, that the Management of that Controverſie
about St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Sermon, hath prepared me to expect juſt ſuch ſtuff at
your hands whenſoever you ſhould ſet up for Writer again; and you
have not deceived my expectation, for you begin this Controverſie
about Invocation, with the very ſame aſſurance that you did the other,
and you manage it with downright Forgeries altogether as bad as
the other were; as I will quickly ſhew you.</p>
            <p>It was ſo trifling a Concern to anſwer your Cavilling demands in
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our Letter to the <hi>Proteſtant Peer</hi> about Invocation, that had I not
had the opportunity of tacking it to my Defence of the Anſwer to the
<hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> I ſhould never have troubled the world or my ſelf
with it. And when I had perſwaded my ſelf to anſwer that Challenge,
it was my next care to mak<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it as uſeful to the Reader as the thing
was capable of. To this purpoſe, as well as to have ſtopt your Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for the future, I did enlarge my deſign, and ſhewed through
the firſt Centuries down to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that the Doctrine as well as
the Practice of the Primitive Fathers were directly againſt your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;
after this I anſwered all your Objections, and then aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Differences betwixt what is now practiſed and taught in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and what was beginning to be practiſed in the
end of the Fourth Century as to Invocation to the Saints.</p>
            <p>It was but reaſonable for me who had particularly anſwered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of your Authorities and Objections, to have expected the ſame
favour at your hands; but this is a kindneſs which you and your
Party are too cunning to uſe us to. When I had firſt anſwered thoſe
Objections as they lay in the <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> I did expect you would
have given them an Anſwer; but as if nothing had been ever ſaid
to them, you only gave them us over again: Such uſage was very
provoking; however I prevailed with my ſelf to give them a ſecond
and fuller anſwer; and what muſt I expect in requital to this? why,
we are here preſented with 'em a third time, as if you had never
ſeen my two Anſwers to them.</p>
            <p>And is this ingenuous dealing? what muſt we call trifling, if this
be not it in the higheſt degree? for ſhame, Sir, leave off ſuch pitiful
dealing; if you be not able to defend or to anſwer for them be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with to have ſo much modeſty as to let them lye ſtill; I am very
well ſatisfied that you are not, and therefore for the Reader's and the
world's ſake let us have no more of ſuch <hi>Crambe;</hi> but if you cannot
go o<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>e'ne leave off.</p>
            <p>And this, Sir, is certainly the true reaſon, why you let my Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Account againſt Invocation paſs without one ſyll<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble of Anſwer
to it, or to my Confutation of your Objections. You tell the Reader
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65736:4"/>
you will only conſider 13 Pages of it at preſent; but Sir, count a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and you will find that you muſt take 12 out of your 13, for
it is but one ſingle Page that you have ventured upon, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
your brag at the beginning; and that is the 78 Page, which
aſſigns the three Differences betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the End of the Fourth and Fifth Centuries. The firſt of
which was, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth uſe a direct Invocation, or
formal Prayer to the Saints and Angels; whereas the Fathers who
began the Cuſtom near St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time [the time in Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us] uſed meerly ſuch addreſſes and requeſts as are made from
one Friend to another; which I proved from their own words.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, you ſay, <hi>The Fathers of the Fifth and Fourth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
and</hi> UPWARDS, <hi>offered with as formal an Invocation, as humble, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
and devout prayer to the Saints in Heaven, as any that are in preſent
uſe amongſt Catholicks.</hi> This, Sir, I will own to be very home againſt
me; and the proving of this, as well as the ſaying of it ſhould end this
part of the Controverſie; but can you do as well as ſay theſe things?
Yes ſure, or you would not have bid us in the next words to take a
<hi>few inſtances of matter of fact in lieu of an</hi> INFINITY <hi>that could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, Sir, for a Promiſer, and for an Undertaker, I never did meet,
nor ever ſhall again with your match. This is down-right Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montadoing,
and the man that could but do half as much as you can
promiſe, would be the greateſt man the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ever had.
But are things to be carried at this rate at this time of the day? I am
aſhamed that any man that pretends to have lookt into Books, ſhould
talk at ſuch an extravagant and ſo abſurd a rate, and ſhould aſſert
things ſo wretchedly falſe, without the leaſt ſign of bluſhing at it.</p>
            <p>But ſince you ſay you can do it, I come now to try thoſe you offer,
and will not ſtand with you for the fifth Century; but deſire, as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and challenged you to ſhew from the <hi>Fourth Century upwards,</hi>
ſome proofs of this extravagant promiſe, from the firſt, ſecond or
third Century.</p>
            <p>You begin with St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> but I pray which of the three Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies
did he live in? You undertake for the Fourth Century and
Upwards, but forgetting your ſelf within ſix lines of it, your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Fourth Century and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pwards,</hi> proves to be the <hi>Fourth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
and Downwards;</hi> for St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> who lived in the middle of
the <hi>Fourth Century,</hi> is the firſt and the moſt ancient of all the Fathers
you offer us; and is not this very fine? this comes of talking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Book, and bluſtring, as if confidence would do the buſineſs it
ſelf. But after all, is St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> himſelf for you? You quote him
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65736:4"/>
here out of his Tract <hi>de Incarnatione Verbi.</hi> Alas, Sir, it was always
ominous to ſtumble at the firſt; and this is your fate, tho you, I dare
ſay for you, are far from knowing it; for this Tract is own'd by
your lateſt Critick<note n="*" place="margin">Du Pin Nouvelle Biblioth. Tom 2. pa. 117.</note> not to be St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s; ſo that your firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is a Forgery.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing this Tract to be his, let us next ſee whether he vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
for what you bring him; you quote him firſt laying this ground
for his practice: <hi>If you worſhip the man Chriſt, becauſe the Word of God
dwells there, at the ſame time worſhip alſo the Saints on Gods account, who
hath his dwelling in them;</hi> and then offering a large <hi>Prayer to the Virgin
Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt own my ſelf to have been ſurprized at this account of Saint
<hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and therefore I can aſſure you I went ſtraight to <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s
Works, and quickly found your words here to be one of the moſt
Scandalous abuſes of an Authors words that I ever read; the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
is directly againſt what you produced it for. The <hi>Tract</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
againſt <hi>Samoſatenus</hi>'s Diſciples, who would allow our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to be only a meer man, and denied the Union of the Divinity
to the Humanity; they would allow that God deſcending from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
dwelt in him; but this the Author of the Tract rejects, becauſe
this would make (ſays he) <hi>no difference betwixt Chriſt and the reſt of
Chriſtians,</hi> concerning whom the Scripture brings in God ſaying, <hi>that
he would dwell in them;</hi> and that he might further ſhew the Abſurdity of
that Hereſie, he brings in the very paſſage you quote, and concludes
it thus, <hi>Wherefore if you worſhip the Man Chriſt together with God, becauſe
God dwells in him, worſhip alſo the Saints together with God, for he dwells
in them alſo:</hi> AND IS NOT THIS ABSURD?</p>
            <p>With what face then, Sir, could you bring this paſſage to teach the
Worſhip of Saints, when the Author deſigned to ridicule the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, had he been a <hi>meer man;</hi> and had ſpoke his ſenſe
plain enough to be directly againſt any Worſhip of the Saints, when
he concluded the paſſage with an AND IS NOT THIS ABSURD?
which paſſage your <hi>Paris Edition</hi> of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> hath left out in the
Tranſlation.</p>
            <p>All the Defence you can make here, will be to tell me, that tho
you miſtook the ſenſe of that paſſage, yet that the Prayer to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary,</hi> ſo full and ſo direct, will make amends for all, and that there
is no danger of miſtaking the ſenſe of it. This Plea I would have
admitted, had but the Prayer it ſelf been there, but the greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
is, that there is not one Syllable of the Prayer in the whole
Tract, nor any thing either near or like to it: And are not you, Sir,
then a pleaſant Man, that can venture upon theſe things, with ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65736:5"/>
much Ignorance and Confidence together? if you know nothing of
theſe things, why do you meddle with them? Why do you not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
your ſelf about ſomething that you are fitter for? Theſe things
lye, I perceive, quite out of your way; and you have quite miſtaken
the buſineſs, if you think to bear us down with dint of Confidence in
theſe things.</p>
            <p>I cannot forgive you this horrid blunder, and this vile abuſe of
<hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s words, ſince I might have expected to have prevented
this, by what I had ſhewed you from St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> himſelf ſo lately;
who affirmed ſo plainly that <hi>one would not pray to receive any thing from
the Father and the</hi> ANGEL, <hi>or from</hi> ANY OF THE OTHER CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURES
<note n="b" place="margin">Prim. Fathers no Papiſts, <hi>p.</hi> 56.</note>: but it ſeems nothing can either cure or prevent ſome
mens affected Stupidity.</p>
            <p>You next quote St. <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Prayer to the Virgin <hi>Mary in his own
name, and of the</hi> WHOLE <hi>General Council of</hi> Epheſus: I would fain
know, Sir, where you pick up ſuch ſtuff; do you invent them your ſelf,
or is there ſome Office among you for ſuch purpoſes? That Sermon
was no more made, nor the Prayer in the Name of the WHOLE General
Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> than it was in the name of the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi>
The Title of it not only in <hi>Labbe</hi>'s Edition of the Councils, but in
St. <hi>Cyril</hi>'s works themſelves, is a <hi>Sermon preached at</hi> Epheſus <hi>againſt</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius,
<hi>when</hi> SEVEN <hi>[Biſhops] went down to St.</hi> Maries <hi>Church there.</hi>
In their names it was, and not as you falſly aſſert, in the names of the
whole Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that <hi>Cyril</hi> in the Homily in his Allegorical
way doth ſalute (not pray, as you again as falſly aſſert) the <hi>Virgin
Mary.</hi> The Salutation it ſelf can do you no ſervice, without the
helping-hand of a falſe Tranſlation, nor with it neither, ſo unhappy
is your choice of places to prove <hi>Invocation;</hi> for tho I ſhould let paſs
your making <hi>Cyril</hi> ſay, <hi>Hail Virgin, by whoſe Mediation the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is glorified and honoured through the whole world; in whom Heaven
exults;</hi> all that this could prove, is that <hi>Cyril</hi> held that the Virgin
interceded for them; but all this is foul dealing, there is not a Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of <hi>Mediation</hi> here, for all the expreſſions here do plainly refer
to the <hi>Virgins holy Womb,</hi> as will appear by a <hi>juſt Tranſlation</hi> of the
words, <hi>Hail thou that didſt bear him that is incomprehenſible in thy Holy
Virgin-Womb;</hi>

               <hi>by reaſon of which</hi> (not <hi>in whom</hi>
as you falſly) <hi>heaven rejoices.</hi> This is enough to ſhew to how falſe
a purpoſe this place was produced, when the very falſe Tranſlation
it ſelf could not ſerve your turn.</p>
            <p>Your next Author is <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> but this I have anſwered twice
already, and will not dance after you any more. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65736:5"/>
but to little purpoſe; for every Body is ſatsified, but ſuch as you
that know nothing of him, but by a borrowed Quotation, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges
himſelf in a Rhetorical way ſometimes of talking to Churches
and Cities, and ſtone Walls, as well as to Saints; but no Body takes
this for invocating of Churches; and for the other we know whence
he borrowed it, even from the Heathen Orators; however for all
his familiar talk in ſome of his Orations (for in them only it is) to
the Saints, he did not believe that they could hear him; this is
plain from his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and other Paſſages in him.</p>
            <p>And now we are got downwards inſtead of upwards, and are got
quite paſt S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time, to which I refer'd you, and about which our
Contention was; ſo that I need trouble my ſelf about no Anſwer to your
<hi>Maximus</hi>'s Sermon upon S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> which is made up of a great deal of
the ſame Stuff, and with ſome that is worſe than that <hi>90th</hi> Sermon in
S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> upon the ſame Saint, which is owned by all Learned Men
to be groſly ſpurious and very fulſome. Nor need I anſwer your
next Example from <hi>Hilary</hi> of <hi>Arles</hi>'s Life of <hi>Honoratus</hi> (whom you
call <hi>Honorius)</hi> whom he does not pray to, but deſire as he was their
Patron, to continue ſo; which ſpeaks no more than that Interceſſion
which was then believed.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Nectarius</hi> upon <hi>Theodore,</hi> and Prayer to him, is certainly ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and tho I have not been able to get a ſight of the Book, yet I am
able to prove it a forgery from the very Quotation it ſelf, which you
produce, wherein <hi>Nectarius</hi> is brought in praying to <hi>Theodore,</hi> That
<hi>he would defend them from the Aſſaults of</hi> Julian, <hi>the Enemy of Mankind.</hi>
Now had you known any thing of Chronology, you might have ſeen
this your ſelf, <hi>Julian</hi> was made Emperor 361. and was kill'd in his
Wars within two years; this was 19 years before <hi>Nectarius</hi> was a
Chriſtian, who was while a Catechumen, call'd to be Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
381. and therefore no ſuch Oration againſt <hi>Julian</hi> could be
made by him, ſince <hi>Julian</hi> was in his Grave ſo many years before.</p>
            <p>You next boaſting tell us you could have given us the <hi>ſervent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to the Virgin</hi> Mary, of <hi>S.</hi> Methodius, Ephrem Syrus, Athanaſius <hi>and</hi>
Leo: I wiſh you had, that ſo we might have had all your forged ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Authors together, for ſuch theſe are, as to thoſe peices you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
to. But however, to keep your hand in, you are for letting us have
one, and you cannot omit <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi>'s Prayer to the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
out of his Poetry. It is pity that this Poetry is none of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s
own; but if it were, do you think we will be content with your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Invocation of Saints to be lawful, out of Poetry, where no Poet
can be in the mode without calling upon his Muſe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65736:6"/>You are reſolved next to diſpatch me throughly, and therefore you'l
prove that the Ancients uſed the term Invocation it ſelf, to the Saints.
This is very terrible, and you begin as luckily with <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi>'s
Oration upon <hi>Theodore;</hi> but with your good leave, <hi>Sir,</hi> you were too
haſty here, for <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> hath no ſuch Oration upon that Saint;
and therefore, you muſt look again. You next play S. <hi>Baſil</hi> upon me,
who you ſay had precendency in Death of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen;</hi> but where
muſt I find what you quote? You neither cite Book nor Volume;
muſt I then go turn over three large Folio's, to find out one ſimple
Line, that you pretend to quote from him? This is too much ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd,
and too hard; and makes me highly ſuſpect that this ſilly Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
is no more in S. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Works, than the former in <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>A third, I muſt have, however to make up the matter from S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi>
who upon <hi>Jacob</hi>'s words, that his Name ſhould be named on the
Lads, had obſerved that the word <hi>Invocation,</hi> as well as <hi>Exaudition,</hi> is
uſed in reference to Men, as well as God; but to what purpoſe is all
this? Is not the ſenſe plain enough, that all he means is, that the word
Invocation is uſed in a civil Reſpect to Men, as well as in a religious
reſpect to God? and hath not this very Father fully ſecur'd us from
taking it as to men in a religious Senſe, when in his Book, <hi>De Civit.
Dei</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Aug. de Civ. d. l. 22. c. 10.</note> he tells us, That the Martyrs names indeed were recited during
the Divine Service, but that they were not INVOCATED by the
Prieſt who did officiate.</p>
            <p>But notwithanding the Vanity of your Attempt here, you prefac't
it with a luſty Bravado, That <hi>you could cite me all the</hi> HOLY FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERS
ALPHABETICALLY <hi>practicing and recommending In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
of Saints, in the very term.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And are not you a pleaſant Man, <hi>Sir?</hi> does not your own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tell you, That this is the moſt extravagant, and moſt impoſſible
Attempt that ever man undertook? if it do not, I will then aſſure you,
and prove it when you pleaſe, that-this abſurd Brag did proceed from
an Ignorance ſo great, that it can be matched with nothing but the
Confidence with which you have ſo vainly undertaken an impoſſible
thing. But ſince you have ſuch an Aſſurance, and dare venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch promiſes of an Alphabetical Catalogue of all the Fathers,
practiſing and recommending it in the very term; I challenge you
to produce that Catalogue in the next Sheet you threaten; I Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
you to ſhew me but one of that Catalogue that is genuine for
the three firſt Ages; ſo certain I am, that you have undertaken a
thing that you know nothing of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65736:6"/>
You are next for anſwering St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Authority againſt Invocation
of Saints, <hi>How ſhall they invocate or call upon him, in whom they have not
believed?</hi> And tell us, you are <hi>aſhamed to ſuggeſt an Anſwer to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of your Readers. Aſhamed,</hi> do you ſay? This I am mighty glad to
meet with, and cannot but congratulate the very hopes of Modeſty in
you. Well, but you ſay, <hi>Tho no one can invocate God as God, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
not in him; yet is every one that is invocated, believed to be God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> No,
God forbid; but this we ſay, That no one ought to be invocated, but he
that is believed to be God, and that is not only S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Senſe here, but
was the Senſe of all the Fathers againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Arians,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
inſiſted upon it, as a certain Argument of Chriſt's being God, in
that <hi>he was invocated,</hi> which no Creature was capable of. This I have
abundantly ſhewn in my Anſwer to your Challenge from <hi>Origen,</hi> who
makes <hi>Invocation</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> the ſame, from S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
and others, that Chriſt could not have been invocated, except he
were God; but all this it ſeems, is loſt upon you, as much as thoſe
Arguments of the Fathers would have been then, had Saints been
invocated as well as Chriſt. But to paſs ſuch trifling arguing, and your
parallel betwixt the Love of God, and this Invocation; I will now
paſs with you to the <hi>ſecond Difference</hi> aſſigned, which was, That <hi>thoſe
Requeſts were made at the Memories of thoſe Martyrs to whom they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and who were believed to be preſent, tho inviſible at the ſame time; but
the Invocations of Saints in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in every place, to a particular
Saint in ten thouſand diſtant places at the ſame time.</hi> Which I then ſaid, and
ſay here again, is to aſcribe to the Saints an <hi>Omnipreſence,</hi> an Attribute
that none of them is capable of.</p>
            <p>The practice of your own Church herein, you dare not deny, that
they are thus ſeperſtitiouſly guilty of praying to any Saint in ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
places at the ſame time; your care is to make the Fathers of the
end of the <hi>4th</hi> and <hi>5th</hi> Century as guilty, by diſproving what I had laid
down of their putting up thoſe Requeſts at the Memories of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;
but, how I pray? In proving <hi>it unanſwerably moſt falſe,</hi> what I
there aſſert? this is great, and like your ſelf. And you began with S.
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> who having in the <hi>15th</hi> Chapter of the Book you quote, aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>That the Dead know nothing of what is done below on Earth,</hi> was put
to it, how to ſolve the Objection of the Martyrs helping thoſe that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
to them at their Memories; and concludes it paſt his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to ſolve it, how they could do it; whether or no they be
preſent in ſo different places at once. If it was paſt his underſtanding
to ſolve it, it had certainly been his beſt way not to have medled with a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65736:7"/>
thing which had no certainty, and which no finite Nature was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of.</p>
            <p>You quote next <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> in his Sermon before Fifty Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops:
It was before 150 Biſhops; and tho' I have not time to read
over that long Sermon, yet I have good reaſon, by the caſting of my
eye upon it, to believe that your quotation is not there; but ſuppoſe
it is, How is it againſt me, when it only ſays, That where the <hi>Martyrs
Bodies only are, the ſame effect is had as from their Souls?</hi> This is directly
for me, but your ignorance is too great to let you ſee it.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is next quoted in <hi>Natali S. Naz. &amp; Celſi;</hi> but there is no
ſuch thing in his Works, in the Edition of <hi>Froben,</hi> which I uſe; nor
does <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> in his <hi>de Scriptoribus,</hi> mention any ſuch Tract; ſo that
I have great reaſon to give you thanks for the great civility of making
me turn over Five Tomes, to look for a wretched Forgery, which
could find no place there.</p>
            <p>To finiſh your doughty proofs unanſwerably, you laſt bring
<hi>Gregory</hi>'s Dialogues; but he is too far off to be concerned here, and was
Two hundred years after S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here, as tho conſcious that theſe unanſwerable proofs would be
found trifles, you begin again, and will prove it further againſt me
from <hi>Gregory Naz. Jambic. de Veritat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You accuſe me here of citing Fathers I never ſaw; but I believe I
ſhall quickly find that ſomebody elſe does it, tho I do not; for I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
went to <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Works, and do here tell you, that the piece
you quote here is not in his Works. And is not this very becoming
you? I do not know what name to give ſuch behaviour, when a Man
ſhall have the face to accuſe another, and falſly too, of that very thing
which he himſelf is guilty of in this very place: But I begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of doing any good upon you, and look upon you in the ſtate of
thoſe who can be guilty of the worſt things, without the expence of
one bluſh.</p>
            <p>You are after this, for giving me again a piece of <hi>Theodoret;</hi> but this
I have anſwered twice already, and therefore will paſs it; and S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>'s
Story about S. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Reliques, of which, had I room, I would
give the Reader a very diverting account about their being found;
but neither it, nor the paſſage it ſelf is to our purpoſe: And the next
from <hi>Bede</hi> is far leſs, about S. <hi>German</hi>'s carrying ſome Reliques about
him; ſo that I muſt take leave of your unanſwerable Arguments,
which were able to prove juſt nothing, but the extravagant Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Ignorance of him that brought them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:65736:7"/>
The Third Difference I offered was, That thoſe Requeſts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpellations
to the Martyrs, begun at the end of the fourth Century,
were neither commanded by the Primitive Church, authorized by
her Councils, nor uſed in her Publick Offices; but that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the Prayers to Saints in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are injoined by
that Church, are authorized by her Council of <hi>Trent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and uſed in
her publick Offices, and in the moſt ſolemn part of them.</p>
            <p>Here you are grown very angry, and de<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e me to ſhew any
Canon of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or of any other, that commands
Prayers to Saints as an obligation of Catholick Faith: But why all
this Anger, and all this Shi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting? Is there then any danger or hurt in
thoſe Invocations of Saints, that you ſhould be ſo ſhy of its being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that your Church commands them? Ay; But, ſay you, where
does it command them as an obligation of Catholick Faith? This it
is to be afraid of ones own ſhadow, and to be ſo cautious as to run
into Nonſenſe; who elſe would talk of a matter of Practice's being
commanded as an obligation of Catholick Faith? Cannot your
Church enjoyn the Bleſſing of Bells, without making it an obligation
of Catholick Faith? But to paſs this frightful Nonſen<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>? Does not your
Church enjoyn the uſe of the Breviaries and Offices? Upon whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
are they uſed among you? Did not the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
authoriſe them, when it appointed the Reforming of the
Breviaries? You will not ſay that was to ſtrike out the Prayers to
Saints; you cannot be ſo ridiculous; and you needed not have been
ſo over-cautious about nothing. No one can be married in our Church
without the uſe of the Ring, and yet no body looks for, or demands
a Canon of our Church for the uſe of it.</p>
            <p>But we have next a very great rarity, and it ſeems my Aſſertion is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
falſe, That no Councils in the Primitive Church did authoriſe Praying
to Saints; you could have given us many Proofs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but are ſtraitned it
ſeems, and ſo can give us but two or Three: I hope theſe choice
ones will prove of the beſt ſort, and be very convincing. You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the General Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which was not held till
after St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had been twenty years in his Grave. This Council,
you tell us, authoriſed Invocation of Saints by practiſing it: And
did it ſo? Why then how comes it to paſs, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
does not authoriſe Invocation of Saints, by practiſing it? How comes
the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> not to authoriſe the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Breviary, which
was certainly uſed by them a Thouſand times during their Seſſions?
But ſome men are ſo fierce, and ſo forgetful, that they cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
their own Method of Arguing, for ten lines together: Well,
but did that great Council practiſe it? You tell us <hi>that theſe were their

words, and the general voice of all thoſe holy Biſhops there aſſembled, Behold
the Truth, Flavianus lives after Death, that the Martyr pray for us.</hi> I was
paſt wondring at you, or elſe I ſhould admire ſo much Fraud and
Falſhood crouded together in ſo little room: It is falſe that thoſe
words were the voice of all the Council, or that they did Invocate
the Martyr that uſed them; and it is as falſe, that theſe ſet down are
the words uſed. The true account of the buſineſs is this; <hi>Baſſianus,</hi>
who had been ejected out of his <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> put in his
appeal to the <hi>Council</hi> againſt <hi>Stephen</hi> then Biſhop of that See; the
matter was heard, and whatever both could ſay for themſelves; it
was urged for <hi>Baſſianus</hi> among other things, that <hi>Flavianus</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
had communicated with him; upon this the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and
<hi>Clergy</hi> that belonged to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> roſe up, and cried out, <hi>This is
the Truth, we all ſay the ſame, the Memory of</hi> Flavian <hi>is eternal, behold
the Truth,</hi> Flavian <hi>lives after Death; the Martyr ſhall entreat you for us,</hi>
Flavian <hi>is here,</hi> Flavian <hi>judges with us.</hi> From all which it is plain,
that the words ſo much inſiſted on, plainly refer to <hi>Flavian</hi> as judging
for <hi>Baſſian,</hi> and <hi>entreating the Council</hi> with the <hi>reſt</hi> on <hi>Baſſian</hi>'s <hi>ſide;</hi> not
a ſyllable here of Invocation to him; and yet this is the place your
ſide have ſo often urged, and hath been ſo often anſwered.</p>
            <p>The Council of <hi>Gangrae</hi> you next produce, but quite miſtake the
deſign of it, to make your Ignorance more and more notorious.
All Learned Men own the <hi>Council</hi> was called againſt the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of
<hi>Euſtathius,</hi> who were guilty of that groſs Error, mentioned by
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>forbidding to marry;</hi> and were ſo ſet againſt it, that they
would not Communicate with Married people, would not receive
the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> at the hands of a Married Prieſt; but deſpiſed not only
them, but the <hi>Chriſtian Aſſemblies,</hi> the <hi>Memories</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and
the <hi>Faſts</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and appear to be a people, who made it their
buſineſs to be directly contrary to the reſt of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Council</hi> was called to condemn this Hereſie, and in their <hi>20th</hi>
Canon which you quote, they <hi>condemn any one that through Pride, and
deteſting them, ſhould accuſe the Aſſemblies where the Martyrs lye, or the
Divine Offices which are performed there, or the Memories of the Martyrs.</hi>
And what is all this to <hi>Invocation of Saints?</hi> Is it commanded here,
or is it mentioned here, or any thing like it? You were forced to
help the place a little, by adding your wiſe Note to the beginning of
it; when having tranſlated it, <hi>if any one through Pride, as believing
himſelf perfect,</hi> you add, <hi>that is, not needing the Interceſſion of Saints:</hi>
But there is no need to expoſe the folly of this addition, the very
reading of it is ſufficient to ſhew the miſerable ſhifts you are put to,
when you meddle with theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65736:8"/>
The Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi>'s <hi>6th</hi> and <hi>34th</hi> Canon are urged next by
you, but they are certainly urged by one that never read them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in <hi>Caranza</hi> or <hi>Coccius,</hi> or ſome ſuch Writers: The <hi>6th</hi> Canon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that <hi>Hereticks ſhall not be permitted to go to God's Houſe, as long as
they continue in their Hereſie:</hi> And is this a <hi>Canon,</hi> Sir, for <hi>Invocation
of Saints?</hi> it would have ſerved fully as well to prove that the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
of <hi>Trent</hi> was held in the <hi>laſt Century;</hi> and that <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> is
now <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>34th.</hi> forbids <hi>any Chriſtian to leave the true Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
of Chriſt, and to make Aſſemblies at the Memories of falſe or Heretical
Martyrs.</hi> Here is no more mention of, or command for <hi>Invocation</hi> of
<hi>Saints,</hi> than there is in the <hi>firſt Chapter</hi> of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> and yet this Council
muſt be drag'd in for the proof, and for the Authorizing of <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Saints,</hi> which in the <hi>very next Canon</hi> does condemn the INVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATION
OF ANGELS [and conſequently of <hi>Saints</hi> for the reaſon
of the <hi>Canon</hi> holds <hi>equally</hi> againſt <hi>both</hi>] as IDOLATRY, and a FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAKING
OF CHRIST. This is a very bold attempt; and this ſhews
that you dare venture upon any the moſt abſurd of things; and I am
not able to make any other Apology for you, than that this Council
was quoted for <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> by you out of the abundance of
your ignorance. But I muſt recant this excuſe, ſince if you read my
Book againſt you, that <hi>Canon</hi> could not eſcape you. I know not what
to ſay for you: I look upon you to be the moſt daring, and yet the
unhappieſt man that ever put Pen to Paper. You have ſtill one other
<hi>Council</hi> for us, the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which has not one word to your
purpoſe any more than the reſt. All it orders is, that <hi>Chriſtians ſhould
not aſſemble at any Church where there were not ſome Martyrs Reliques.</hi> But
ſuch proofs as theſe, tho nothing to the purpoſe, we muſt be content
with, when a man undertakes a thing for which there is no colour.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s expreſs Teſtimony that the <hi>Martyrs were not Invocated,</hi>
we have had already, ſo that we need not trouble our ſelves about
him; and now you have brought us to your laſt undertaking, to ſhew
that the <hi>Fathers in the Liturgies had as formal Prayers to Saints, as your
Church hath.</hi> You do well to wave the <hi>Liturgies of St. Peter, James</hi> and
<hi>Mark,</hi> &amp;c. ſince they are confeſſed Forgeries; but upon the ſame
reaſon you ſhould not have troubled us with St. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s, or St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi>'s,
ſince they are not <hi>genuine,</hi> but have been <hi>interpolated.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
what you bring from them, proves only that they believed that
<hi>the Virgin Mother interceded for them;</hi> which is nothing to the purpoſe
of proving that in the <hi>Ancient Liturgies ſolemn Prayers were put up to the
Saints,</hi> ſuch as now are uſed by <hi>your Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The paſſage from St. <hi>Cyril</hi> (allowing that Catechiſm to be his)
proves not one jot further, than the belief of the <hi>Saints Interceſſion</hi> for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65736:9"/>
thoſe on Earth. And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s does but the very ſame; ſo that after
all this Confidence, and bold Undertaking, you have not been able
to produce <hi>one Canon</hi> of <hi>any Council</hi> for <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> nor <hi>one line</hi>
of a <hi>Prayer</hi> to the <hi>Saints,</hi> out of any <hi>ancient, genuine,</hi> no nor <hi>Interpolated
Liturgies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have but another Proof to offer from <hi>Pelagius</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> but
he comes two hundred years too late; and yet all he ſpeaks for, or
<hi>Leo</hi> alludes to, is that they believed the Saints Interceſſion for thoſe
on earth; and is there no difference between the Saints interceding
for us, and our praying to them? You have been often enough told
there is: Have you neither Memory nor Judgment, that theſe things
muſt be always confounded? And when you ſhould prove the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints,</hi> you fall to proving that the <hi>Saints intercede for you.</hi>
I heartily pity you, that nothing can do good upon you; I pity you
the more, that you ſeem in the end of your Paper to believe, that you
<hi>have ſatisfied all unprepoſſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſed and unbiaſſed Readers with ſuch Arguments</hi>
as had not one grain of reaſon in them: But I pity you moſt of all,
for being employed about ſuch things, and yet to be no better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
by thoſe who ſet you on work, but to be left ſo lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to the mercy of him that anſwers you; to be ſuffered to quote
nothing but <hi>Forgeries</hi> right, and the <hi>genuine works</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> quite
wrong, was a very cruel task; and I am almoſt tempted to believe
that it was a Penance impoſed upon you, to help to mortifie ſome
proud ſtubborn humour. Alas, Sir, now I am pitying you, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but give you a little good advice, Not to be put upon theſe things
by them, to be made a laughing-ſtock to the world, in obedience to
them: you have done enough already; if ſuch things muſt be done,
why muſt the whole burden lye upon you?</p>
            <p>But if all this will not cure you, but that I muſt loſe ſuch good
Counſel upon you; and that you will obſtinately continue in your
own way, let me beg this at laſt from you, That you will look into
the Fathers themſelves, which you quote, and give us <hi>Edition</hi> as well
as <hi>Book;</hi> if you will not, this I promiſe you, That I will never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
you, but that if you trouble the world with ſuch another
Paper as this I now have under my hands, you ſhall e'en anſwer it
your ſelf, for I know how to employ to better purpoſes, your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Friend.</p>
