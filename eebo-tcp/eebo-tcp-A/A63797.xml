            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

pure Vertue or Essential Principal, which the Lord in the Creation
endued every thing with, (which is the true Life thereof,) will
not endure any violent motion or harsh Fire to touch them; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if the circulation of the Air be wanting, as it is in all such
Distillations, for these Spirits are so pure and subtle, that when
any Injury is offered to them, they either evaporate or become
suffocated; for this Essential Powder or pure Life, is the moderator

which doth mix and Qualify the harsh Fiery <hi>dark Principal,</hi> and

by their Likenesses; if there be not a Sympathetical agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of Nature are immediately broken, whence proceeds various Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases

               <p>This every one ought to understand, or else they may unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly

are generated through surplusage of Nourishment. For unto weak

stronger heats will admit of stronger Foods and greater quantity,

by the frequent eating and drinking of those things that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
in themselves, as <hi>Brandy, Rumm</hi> and other Spirituous Drinks
and high prepared Foods, they would not so eagerly desire them.
Do not all or most that do accustome themselves to such things
quickly spoil their Healths? Nature is Simple and Innocent, and
the Simplicity thereof cannot be continued, but by Sobriety and
Temperance in Meats and Drinks that are Simple and harmless,
which will not only gratify Nature, but contribute both due and
moyst Nourishment, far beyond all lushions Fat, compounded
Dishes of the Richest Food, and Spirituous Drinks, as it appears
by many hundreds of Poor People who are constrained by pure
necessity, not by Wisdome, to Live for the most part on Simple
Food and mean Drinks, their Labour hard, Cloathing thin, open
Air, cold Houses, small Fires, hard Beds, standing on Earthen
Floors; by all which means, they are not only preserv'd in better
Health, but also enabled to endure Labour with more ease and
pleasure, then the Intemperately Superfluous can lye a Bed or sit
by the Fire. O then how excellent are the ways of Temperance
and Sobriety! they free the Body from pain, and the mind from
perturbations, sweetning all Gods Blessings, and giving the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of time, which being well Imployed, affords many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
both to the Body and Mind; for what advantage is it if a
Man possess the whole World, if his Body be full of pain through
Intemperance, which for the most part no less affecteth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposeth
the Mind.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Brandy, Rumm</hi> and all strong <hi>Spirituous</hi> Drinks are far more

and do sooner there destroy the Health, tho they be bad in both,
except taken in a Physical way; I know this is contrary to the
Vulgar <hi>Notion,</hi> but it is agreeable to Truth, Experience and reason;
for in hot Climates the Natural Heat is not so strong by reason
of the forcible Influences of the Sun, which do powerfully exhale
the Radical moisture, open the pores, and too violently evaporate
the Spirits by continual Sweatings, which dulls the edge of the
Appetite, weakening the Digestive Faculty of the Stomach, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

only Prey on the Natural Spirits, but also too violently do evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them. The very same Opperation have all strong Drinks, as
Wine and the like, if Temperance be wanting, but not so violently
as the former. Therefore in hot Climates there ought to be double
the Care and Temperance in Meats, Drinks and Exercises, as in
Cold; of which the Natives of most hot Countrys might be our
Examples; for they do for the most part Live very Temperately,
their Drink being generally Water, or Wine allay'd with Water,
their Food mean, or more Simple then ours, whereby they are
better preserv'd in Health; for the Constitutions of all People in
hot Climates are weaker, or at leastwise not so able to endure great
Meals of Food, and Superfluous Drinking of strong Drinks, as they
are in cold. For cold Countries make Men hardy, strong, and
able to endure Intemperance, for which cause it is observed that

and Eating, and in Hott, they are the contrary. And therefore
our <hi>English</hi> are much Distemper'd and many Dye when they Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel

the frequent Drinking of the forementioned Fiery Spiritual Drinks

destructive to the Generation of Mankind; It makes them Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line

other Indecencies, which are no less pernicious then shameful in a
Woman. It also Distempers them by causing Fumes and Vapours
to Fly into the Head, generating Wind in abundance. Therefore
the Wise Antients did account it a Crime for Women to Drink
strong Drink or Wine, tho their Countrys did afford Wine in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance;
and good reason they had, for the whole preservation
of Mankind resides chiefly in the Temperance and Government of
the Women; if they are Intemperate, the Radix of Men is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;

               <p>The Nature of Women will not bear Excess in Meats and Drinks,
as Mens will, without mannifest danger to their Healths, and also
to the Health of their Children; most Windy Diseases both in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

quantity and quallity. They overcharging their Nature with Food
containing too much Nourishment, and Drinks that are too strong.
This is chiefly observable amongst wanton Citizens and the Richer
sort of People, who pay dearly for the Lickerishness of their Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,

Subject to variety of Diseases; and therefore they are afflicted
with divers Distempers, which Women in other Countrys know

or of compounded Dishes of 20 sorts of things, most of them of
disagreeing Natures: No, their Food was simple and natural, easie
to be procured without oppression to themselves or to any of Gods
Creatures, as Herbs, Fruits and Grains, and pure water for drink,
which things are endued with a most simple nature and operation,

the eating of Herbs, Fruits and Grains, but on the contrary,
made Laws against the common eating of Flesh without distinction,

and that he should have Dominion over all things or Creatures,
not that he should eat all things, or hurt himself by devouring

and to be Lord over all, yet nevetheless he having a Simile with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35353:9"/>
the Nature of all things, is thereby rendered capable to be wrought
on by every inferior thing he shall suffer his desires to enter into,
and by degrees he is liable to become captivated unto that thing,
be it either Good or Evil; for every like (as I told you before)
works on and awakens its likeness; This was the reason why <hi>Moses</hi>
commanded that unclean Beasts should not be eaten, that the
human Nature might not mix or incorporate in its self the Beastial
qualities; for every individual Man has essentially in him the true
Natures and Essences of all the Beasts of the Field, and Fishes of
the Sea, as also of all Herbs and Fruits, Stones and Minerals, and
whatsoever else can be thought of; for if this were not so, then Man
would not be subject to be wrought on by all, neither would the
various sorts of Food agree with him or nourish him.</p>
               <p>The wise Antients understanding this, and that every thing had
power to attract unto it self such matter out of all things, as is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to nourish its own Body, therefore in those days the eating
of Flesh was not in such Reputation as of late years it hath been;
especially as it is in <hi>England,</hi> who do make it their chief Food,
All Vegetables and Fruits being in themselves of a clean Simple
Nature and Opperation, which being well prepared and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
eaten, have onely power to waken their Similes in the Body
and Senses as aforesaid. But on the contrary, all Beasts, especially
unclean Beasts, are endued with all kind of Beastial Passions, as
Anger, Revenge, Covetuousness, Love and Hate, which dispositions
and Passions of the Flesh, but especially the Blood, doth retain after
such Animals are Killed; and for that reason it was, that the
Blood of all sorts of Beasts was so strictly forbidden, for the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Spirits dwell in the Blood, and in the Blood and Spirits lye
hid all the dispositions and Inclinations the Creature was endued
withal, and therefore all sorts of Flesh that were permitted to be
eaten were to be well Purged from the Blood. And also this same
Blood was either to be consumed by Fire, or an hole made in the
Earth and the Blood cast into it and covered, that the wrathful
Spirits and Vapours thereof might not defile the Air, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
Breathed into our Bodies; for when any Creature is Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the great pain and Agony they endure does so powerfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
the Center of the wrathful Fire, and also the Internal
Poysons which are the Root of every Life, that the said Fierce
Poysonous Spirits seize the Blood on their right Fountain of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rvation,
so that the Blood does not only contain all the natural
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ispositions, passions and Inclinations, but also the awakened Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35353:10"/>
and irritated Spirits which were violently stirred up by
Deaths stroke. For when the natural Life is in danger (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of which is so sweet unto all Creatures, and they do so
unwillingly part with it, especially when the Creature is in perfect
Health and Strength) what a strange fear and dread must needs
attend the Creature in this condition? and how strongly and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
are all the Centers and Powers of nature stirred up? and
then are awakened the revengeful Spirits, which do contain the
Blood, for that is their Habitation, which in this Agonous condition
does often spread it self through the whole Body, and makes the
Flesh look red, but this is generally drawn back again by the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of the Blood where the wound is made. Now if this
Blood be exposed to the open Air, these fiery dark wrathful Spirits
do by degrees evaporate, and incorporate themselves with the Air,
and so de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>les it, and renders it pernicious.</p>
               <p>The very same is to be understood in all other Uncleannesses, and
these are the chief Reasons why the Prophet <hi>Moses</hi> commanded the
Blood either to be <hi>Burnt on the Altar,</hi> or <hi>Buried in the Earth,</hi> tho
there doth remain somewhat more to be said why he commanded
the Blood to be consumed on the Altar by Fire, which I shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
and speak of it in its proper place; for those fiery wrathful
Spirits that do evaporate themselves into the Air, being continually
breathed into the body by such people as do communicate near
such places, as Slaughter-houses, and the like, and more especially
those that are of killing Imployments, those awakened wratchful
Spirits do enter them, and powerfully incorporate themselves with
their Similes; for this cause all Butchers and others, that do use
such Trades, are more fierce and cruel, sooner moved to wrath
than others; killing is as easie and familiar to them as Plowing the
Land is to the Husbandman; and in a word, they are far more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to violence than men of other Imployments are.</p>
               <p>The same is to be understood in all other Trades, and also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

from this Ground it is that weak Inclinations, that a Man in him

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35353:10"/>
be made strong, which is one Reason why Mens Inclinations
and their Love and Hate alters and changes, according to time,
place, business, and communication, as some Men have declared,
that they did not fear being overcome with Drink, Women, or th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
like Evils, because at that time they found no Inclinations to such
things, nevertheless, time, opportunity, communications, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
circumstances concurring, many of them have been overcome
by those Vices they so little stood in fear of, though also Astrologick
Configurations and Influences have a share in altering and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mens inclinations, and more especially when other causes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur:
For this cause the most prudent in all Ages have advised all
Men to avoid evil occasions, and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>That Evil
Communication corrupts good Manners,</hi> the truth of which no Man
will or can deny. Now if Imployments, Communications, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
Words, and all kind of outward business, have so great
power of changing and altering Dispositions and Inclinations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
them, and the contrary, how can we imagine but Mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
and Drinks received into the Body, will have the same or
greater power and operation, as those that feed much on unclean
Flesh, as on <hi>Swine,</hi> and that have their conversation amongst Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
are not many of them much like those Creatures, of so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ish,
dull, heavy, sordid dispositions, yet subtle and cunning in a Beastial
way? And on the contrary, those that drink Wine, and feed on the
highest food, have not they Spirits accordingly? also those whose
Conversation is amongst Men, as Citizens and Merchants; have
they not higher and greater Spirits, being more tractable and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
fair and ingenious in all their dealings and conversations:
For all things have a sympathetical operation, whether it be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
Meats, Drinks, or Communications, every thing does
secretly awaken its like property, which do often captivate the
spirit of a Man before he is sensible of it, being ignorant of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and sympathetical operation all things have with his own
Nature. 'Tis true, most Men believe that evil Company corrupts
manners, and will acknowledge that some sorts of Imployments
do by degrees dispose people to Inhumanity, Violence and Cruelty;
but if you tell them there is the same possibility and greater in
Meats, to vary not onely Mens bodies, but also their Inclinations
and Minds, they shall Laugh at it as a ridiculous Dream, though
in truth it is a most certain Truth, and daily experience (if we
would but hear her Voice) bears witness unto it. Why did <hi>Moses</hi>
prohibit his people the eating of Swines flesh, seeing Swine are not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35353:11"/>
serviceable unto mankind any other way, but by being killed and
eaten; and besides, a Swine is a Creature, that being well ordered,
becomes as wholesome Nourishment, as some other Animals that
are counted clean, though there is somewhat to be said against
the grossness of that sort of Flesh; But the cheif thing the Spirit of
God in that great Prophet reguarded, was, no doubt, the Spirit of
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reature whose original and predominant quality stands in the
dark wrath of Nature, which is manifested by their shapes, cries,
and tones, which Spirit the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>man nature ought not to joyn it self
unto, lest it partake of its Nature. Every thing having power to
joyn it self with its likeness, and to strengthen its own property.
Doth not Wine and strong drink precipitate men into Fury and
Madness by simile; that is, the Spirits in Wine do incorporate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the natural Spirits, and violently awaken them, making
them burn too fierce, which sets nature into a Rage, awakening
the central Spirits till all parts of the body burn like fire till the
Oyl be consumed, and nature begins to languish, becoming dull,
heavy, and stupid. The very same operation have all food in the
Body, and on the Spirits and Senses, but more slowly and hidden;
for great Meals of Food makes dull when first eaten, for all the
time Nature is a digesting, and making seperation, (which is 4, 5,
or 6 hours a doing) and then Nature begins to be brisk and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
for what the Stomach and natural heat do perform, as to
Fermentation and Seperation with the Food, is done to Natures
hand by Art in all sorts of strong drinks, therefore all such fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
strong drinks have a present operation, but let drink be ever so
strong, if it have not passed through Fermentation and Seperation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
it will lie heavy on the Stomach, and send dark and dulling fumes
into the Head if a quantity be drunk: Therefore great Meals of
strong rich food do endanger the Health more than proportionable
drinking of strong drinks, especially in hot Countries, and in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
time in colder Climates. That dispositions and inolinations
are chang'd and altered by Food, may further appear in all or
most unclean creatures, are they not made much fiercer if raw
Flesh and Blood be given them, their wrathful unclean Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby enraged and made stronger? And is not the very flesh
of those Creatures men feed on, altered either for the better or
worse, according to the nature of their Food; what a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
shall there be as to the goodness or badness, wholsomness or
unwholsomness of the Milk of the very same Cow, when she feeds
upon fresh delicate Grass, Herbs, and Flowers, and when she is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35353:11"/>
kept on course Brewers grains or the like? The Elements of Mans
body and natural spirits are compounded of the same matter as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Creatures are, and in respects subject to the same or like al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations;
only the Holy Light and Grace of God, which enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
every man that cometh into the World, if obeyed, is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to subdue most natural Inclinations, and to keep them within
the bounds of Temperance; indeed this gift is the only power by
which a man may overcome the Evil and deny himself.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Flesh</hi> is not so clean a Food as Herbs, Seeds and Fruits, for
all sorts of Animals are Subject to various Passions, but on the
contrary all or most Vegetables have a more Simple and Innocent
Original, therefore their Opperation on the Body and Senses is as
Simple having no power to awaken any property in the Body
but what is like themselves. Furthermore we see that no
Creatures that are clean will eat Flesh, except they be
taught it, and brought to it by degrees; on the other side, all
such Animals as naturally will eat Flesh, are by all means coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unclean, as Dogs, Cats, Bears, Wolves, Foxes and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
both in the Sea and Land, and most Men will avoid the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng
of such Creatures, as being unclean in the Root of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Therefore they desire such Food as hath affinity with them,
for every Creature rejoyceth in its likeness. The Prophet <hi>Moses</hi>
well understood this when he commanded that unclean Creatures
and Blood should not be eaten, because the Blood (as is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before) doth not only contain the Spirits, but the very Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
Dispositions and Inclinations of the Creature, therefore it
was to be Killed and dressed after such a manner by which the
Blood and Superfluous matter was extinguished, and if Flesh should
now be prepared after their way, we should not account it to
have half the Vertue as it hath in our way of preparation. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the way of Killing and preparing of Flesh and Fish, that the
Law-giver prescribed to his People, was to cleanse the Flesh from
all Blood in which stand the Spirits, and all the dispositions and
Inclinations of the Creature lye hid. By this means the Uniting
of the Bestial Nature with the humane was in a great measure
prevented; and for no other reason all unclean Beasts, Fouls and
Fishes were so severely forbidden. All Created things have but
only Ground and Original. Every particular Creature contains
the true Nature and properties of the whole, only the Qualities
are in several degrees, one having one Quality strong, and another
the Center. For in every Creature one of the forms or properties
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35353:12"/>
do carry the upward Dominion, and the other Quallities lye as
it were hid, but some times do manifest themselves, but that
property which is weakest may be awakened and made strong
by its <hi>Simile,</hi> as often comes to pass.</p>
               <p>From this very Ground proceeds all Sympathy and Antipathy,
concord and discord in this World. For all those whose predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
qualities stand nearest and have affinity each to other, such
are Friendly one to another, but those whose predominate Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have Antipathy each to other, such slight one another, and
if the Grace and Holy Light of God do not restrain them, they
are very apt to Speak Evil and Backbite one another. The same
is to be understood in the Divine Principal of Gods Love, those
that through the Blessing and Favour of the Lord, have obtained
the holy Gifts of the Spirit, be it more or less, all such People have
affinity and bear good will each to other; except the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Opinion gets in amongst them, which is a Ravening Woolf?
every thing rejoyceth in its likeness, and the contrary in its Death,
therefore it is highly convenient, for every Man to consider the
variety and the possibility of his own Nature, and that in himself
is contained the true Nature of every thing in the Visible and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
World, and that he bears a Simile with all things, and is
both capable and liable to be drawn either to Vice or Vertue by
every thing he joyns himself to, whether Meats, Drinks, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
or whatever else a Man suffers his will or desires to
run out after or enter into, the same thing hath power to awaken
its likeness, and for this cause all the Wisemen and Prophets have
advised to cleanness and sobriety, and to the reading of good Mens
Books, which do stirr up the good Faculties in the Soul, for all
Books do bear the Image and Spirits of him that Wrote them, and
so by simile do awaken the like Spirit and desire; and so on the
contrary, if young or old give themselves to the reading of Plays
or Books of Romances, they will powerfully awaken by simile the
vain wanton Nature, which before lay as it were hid, Therefore it
was said in the Revelations, <hi>Come out from amongst them, and be ye
seperated, lest you partake of their Evils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Reason why most people love and so much desire Flesh
more than either Herbs, Fruits, or Grains, is not because it doth
afford either better Nourishment, or is pleasanter to the Pallate or
Stomach, but it chiefly is because Man is departed in his Mind and
desires from the Innocent ways of God and Nature, and through
his Free-will hath awakened the dark wrathful powers in himself,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35353:12"/>
which have more Affinity with the Bestial Nature, than with Herbs
or Fruits: For the Beasts are endued with the very same Passions in
all respects as Men, if it had not been so, the Commandment had
not been so strict against eating of Flesh, for the Radix of Beasts
and Men have a greater Affinity, and the more ignorant and sottish
people are, the more they desire to eat Flesh, and the more Flesh
they eat, the more Sottish, Ignorant, and Bruitish they become.
Also, the more the dark poysonous wrath of God and Nature is
stirred up, and the more it does predominate in Man, the more doth
Man desire Food that hath a proportionable Nature. From this
very ground it is that some sorts of Creatures esteem'd Unclean,
(whose predominent quality stands in the wrath of Nature) do so
much desire unclean Food, because it hath unity with their Natures;
the very same is to be understood of those Creatures which we call
clean, they do as much on the contrary desire clean Food, <hi>viz.</hi>
Fruits and Herbs, because such things have the nearest Affinity
with their Natures; and if Men had not departed from the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
ways of God and Nature, and suffer their Wills to enter into the Wrath and Beastial Nature, they would not so much desire
Flesh; for Flesh cannot be eaten without violence done to Nature,
for the Lives of all Beasts are as sweet to them, and they as much
desire to continue them as Men do, and as unwillingly part with
them. And the Groanings of these Creatures that suffer Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Pain, do awaken the Wrath in them that do it, which is a
certain Retaliation or Reward; for all kind of Cruelty does stir up
and awaken the Wrath of God in Nature. And so on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
all Love and Concord does powerfully beget its likeness.</p>
               <p>Doth not every evil word, which does proceed and is formed
from the <hi>Principal of Wrath</hi> and Passion, carry the Power of its
principal with it, and awaken its Simile in those to whom such
words are directed? on the contrary, do not soft and pleasant words
pacifie wrath by awakening their Simile? every principal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
in Nature must have its own Food, or else it looseth its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Strength. Mens coveting to eat so much Flesh is too plain
a Sign, that they are departed from that Innocent and Simple Life
for which they were made, and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red into the contrary; for if
the wrath of God in Nature were not awakened beyond its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
degree, and did not predominate over the Simple Innocent
Life, then People would no more desire Flesh then our holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
in the first Ages of the World. It is a token we are in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
when we hanker so much after the Flesh-pots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As long as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35353:13"/>
men were partakers of and followers of the true knowledge of
Gods works, and lived in the Simple path of Nature, which led
to Health and long Life, Herbs and Fruits were in as great esteem
as Flesh is now; It was a shame in former Ages for a Man to be
seen to buy Flesh, or to have carried it openly in the Streets of
Cities, but now the best Citizens count it the contrary, and make
nothing to go openly to the Elesh-Markets in their Plush Coats,
and load a Porter two or three times a Week, with the Spoils of
their Slaughtered Fellow-Creatures; and if a Man comes to their
Honses after Dinner, there he may behold a very unpleasant sight,
<hi>viz.</hi> Greasy-Platters, Bloody-Bones, and pieces of Fat Flesh lye
up and down the Kitchin, thereby rendered next door to a slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
House. And this Trade is drove every day in the Week, but
more especially on the day they call their Sabbath, tho in truth
they do not make it so, but rather a day of Feasting, a day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they Bury the dead Bodies of Slaughtered Beasts, and a day on
which our <hi>English</hi> Belly-Slaves and Gluttons make their Servants
do more work then any other day of the Week, as to dressing of
Food. A day likewise whereon most People Cloath themselves
in all their bravery, and the Women go to Church to take notice
who has the Finest Cloaths and the newest Fashions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but why
do I blame the Women, the Men have been the occasion of all
this and much more.</p>
               <p>If those of each Sex did hearken to the Voice of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they would forsake such sinful Vanities, and not thus seek
<hi>Death in the Error of their Lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I have drawn the Curtain, and
given them a brief view of Natures <hi>School,</hi> wherein the <hi>Sons of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Wisdom</hi> learn to obey her Dictates, and by their prudent Conduct

delivered, is the very Doctrine of Nature, approved by Religion,
justified by Reason, and confirmed by Experience; Those that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
slight so many Monitors, will scarce deserve Pity in their
Misery.</p>
