         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Who is not abashed to follow a painted shadowe? and who takes not great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to waite where some substance is looked for? though the wise for their wisedome are enuied of the foolish, yet the fond for their folly are derided and pointed at by all kinde of people, wisdome is honoured in his meanest attire, and fondnes is but scorned in his brauest garments, the bare presentation of the honorable, brings gladnes to the beholders, and the proud pomp of the vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are both irckesome and disdained, golde is more made off for his goodnes then his cullour, and men look more into the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of things then to the outward apparance, this book though it be printed in common paper, yet was it not penned in ordinarye discourses, it spreadeth it self like a tree that hath many braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereon some bowe is greater then another, and yet the <pb facs="tcp:22631:3"/> fruit of them all are alike in taste, because no soure crabbes were graffed where sweet Apples should growe, nor no bitter Oranges can be gathered where sweet Powngarnets are planted, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this fruit, must be sencibly felt and tasted with a well seasoned minde and iudgement, and the delicatenes therof must be chewed and chawed with a chosen and speciall spirite of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, not greedily mumbled vp and eaten as a wanton eates Peares that neuer were pared.

            <head>¶ <hi>Francisco Sansouino</hi> to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Rodolph</hi> the second.</head>
            <p>MOst happie and fortunate Emperour, there is nothing more necessary for a Prince in this world the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Histories, for so much as being the mirrours &amp; maisters of our life: they shew and teach vs what the gouernment of a cittie and Prouince ought to be, what lawes we ought to institute &amp; cause our subiects to obserue, in what manner to increase &amp; maintain diuine worships, in what sort to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise morall vertues, and how to reape benefit of counsell in our affaires of importance: heerof it came to passe, that histories were called of wise men most noble, for their antiquitie, for so much as by them we receiue the creation of this huge worlde, and the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of mans generation. For their perpetuitie: because they haue endured with the world, and shall continually endure, alwaies wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp humaine Actions, for the benefit of our posteritie. For their dignitie: in respect they befit to be read and known, as the proper art and science of Emperours, of Kings, of common weales, and of great Lords and captaines, for their generalities: considering that in histories we finde written, in euery tung, in euerie Prouince, and in euerie age, those things that haue falne out either well or euil. For their iustice: because they do honour and dishonour, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doth merite &amp; deserue the same: giuing due praise to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of vertue &amp; valour, and dispraise to the vile filth of vice and idlenes. For their subiect: for that they do entreate of great things, the acts of great men which they haue accomplished to the intent to enlarge, to preserue, and to sway rule. For their end: because the same is no other, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to sacrifice trueth to eternitie. For their profit: for the making vs to beholde thinges past, we may prudentlye by their meanes foresee that which is to come, and therfore it came to passe in former &amp; auncient time, many excellent Princes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours not content with the glory they had gotten through their wise and valiant acts: did greatlye desire also to ioyne vnto their name this other glory, that is: eloquently to haue written histories, as did <hi>Augustus,</hi> after him <hi>Adrianus,</hi> and finally <hi>Gordianus</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours of your Maiestie. To this therfore hauing applied my studie, not to obserue onely what the cuntries, the mountaines, and <pb facs="tcp:22631:5"/> the riuers and flouds of this world are, or to haue knowledge, how embassages were sent, of Parlaments, of the managing and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of affaires, or to vnderstand the voyages of armies, their order in ranging battailes, their encamping, their Stratagems, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seegings, their expugnations &amp; their victories, but rather to drawe and suck out of all these particular things, the sap, the sweete and marrow, reducing them into precepts, for the commoditie of great persons, that being otherwise busied, neither haue they time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they well, continually apply the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in reading of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which was the onely motiue that made me take in hand this book, wherinto if any prince or gouernour will looke, he may (as though it were in a bright christal glasse) incontinently beholde the substance that fully is contained, in the volumes of the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable auncient and moderne writers. And for so much as so worthie and noble food appertaines vnto Princes, and for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Princes, your Emperiall Maiestie is of highest degree and dignitie: therfore comming toward your Maiestie with no lesse affection of minde, then that wherwithall I was enflamed, when I applyed my selfe about this profitable enterprise: I present the same most humbly at the feete of your Maiestie, to the intent, that with your sacred name, due &amp; perfect honor may be giuen to this worke, since it shalbe vnder the protection of your Emperiall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, who carying in his noble person, the greatnes and felicity of so many famous Emperours and Heroes, of that worthie house of <hi>Austridge,</hi> which through a long course of worlds, haue gouerned and shall gouern heerafter the sacred Empire, who being no lesse benigne and affable, then high in blood and honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I assure my self, that he will not disdaine to look vpon the same, for although it be little in quantity, yet notwithstanding it is very great in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, since it containes in it self a Quintesence of those thinges that haue been written for the profit and commoditie of men, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Princes.

            <p>I Could imparte vnto you many thinges touching this my present trauaile, excusing my selfe, for that I haue not called the same rather experiments, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisements, maximies, axiomies, precepts or sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits: And therin to haue entermixt some morall and priuat matters, if I had not been assured that I should not preuaile. For I know very wel, that it is almost a general rule (by that I haue obserued in things past) that euery writer what good intent soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath moued him, or what trauail soeuer he hath endured for the vniuersall profit of all, yet is he euer taxed of criticall persons: forsomuch as our tunges being moued and stirred through enuie or hate, or through a certaine corruption which is brought in amongst vs, not to haue any taste but onely in our own proper matters we are much more easie drawne to speak euill, then the wisedome of him that is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, is prompt and readie to doo well. Therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring all my excuses to your vpright iudgement (when it is not driuen forward with any passion) I will onely say this that I holde for a certain, that this worke howsoeuer it be, will be of great helpe and aide to those that be studious, for that I imagine, it will enriche the priuat discourses, and the publicke actions of those that shall chaunce at any time to vse and handle these conceits in humain actions, which almost haue been euer the selfe-same in all times and amongst all men: and for that in the working and negotiating of affaires, as wel in publick as in priuat, they will minister vnto them many conditions and partes, the which conceites although they be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what generall, yet neuerthelesse they will giue no <pb facs="tcp:22631:6"/> small light partitie: how to knowe the partes and conditions of greatest aduauntage in particular things, as well of publicke actions, as of priuate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. And although these accidents, which doo at vnawares chaunce vnto men in their affaires, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the deed dooing, are so many and so vnknowen, that they cannot be comprehended within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of precepts: therefore some vulgare persons do reprehend the studie of them: neuerthelesse, for that I presuppose I shal helpe and yeeld aide to men of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, as my intent was, when I tooke this matter first in hand, drawing the substance (the finall end of this studie) foorth of histories, therby to take away from others, the length, tediousnes of reading and toyling themselues: I perswade my selfe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all accidents cannot be brought vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, yet that man that hath any meane assistance of diligence, &amp; that in working &amp; perfourming of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he be not moued nor altered more then is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (either by his nature, or by any other newe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents) to dispose otherwise then well and aptly these actions which he meanes to bring to an end; he by great reason may receiue many benefits and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, by hauing his minde fullye replenished with these aduertisements and conditions, which he in any parte hath exercised in other operations, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther studiously read in some good and chosen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and stirred vp in his memory, only in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this hath been somewhat noisome vnto me: that I could not finde any full or perfect meanes (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the varietie of the subiect) to put them vnder firme and infallible titles for your commodities: and although I haue oftentimes conferred this difficultie <pb facs="tcp:22631:6"/> with those excellent Gentlemen, Maister George Gradenigo and Maister Alui di Michele, as of great learning, who did enter into the same, and did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vpon it with great prudence, of Histreogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, and in matter of state, and of whom I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued great counsell in this enterprise, neuertheles they could not resolue me according to my desire. And although the foresaid gentlemen put me in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, that it would do well if I did place them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der six titles, vnder which are accustomed to light the consultations which are made in the counsels of common weales, and are drawn therinto by the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuers, and wherof Aristotle writ in his Rethorick: although they did not immediatlye come vnto the same, but as it were in consequence: at any time when the vnderstander therof would apply the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to their places, neuertheles I did dispose my selfe to make the table heereunto annexed, as a thing more perfect, and perchaunce more easie and short: The which although vnto some it seemes not able to serue the turne, to finde out sufficiently the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of those conceites that are fit for him, or wherin he hath need about his affaires: neuertheles, it will shewe you a way how to attain to your intent, if not in all things, yet at the least in some parte. Receiue therfore with a beneuolent minde this my good wil, to the intent, that perceiuing your ametie, I may with a feruent desire, bring ende to the second and third book of conceits, which I still am about to gather.</p>

            <p>IT would no doubt very much haue preuailed to those that are studious, that I should haue placed the names of the Authors at the foote of euery conceite, but for that it was not my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when I first begun this worke, to publish the same, I did not remember in that my studie to vse the foresaide diligence. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any one will serue his turne with these conceites, he maye saye: to giue force to his reason, by alleadging some of these or such like woords, as wise men say, as antiquitie haue written, as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men declare, and such other manner of speaches, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, I assure ye, that when I returne againe to read ouer the same Authors, perchaunce in the second impression they shall be added according to your desires.
