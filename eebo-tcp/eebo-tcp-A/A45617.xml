            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>the bond of peace, since other foundation can no man lay,</hi>
it being a sinne, so much as to doubt, much more to
defend, that the fundamentalls of our Religion, some
of which are mentioned by the Author to the<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
and received by the Church in all ages, are not

destroyed, what shall?</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 11. 3.</note> Nay, <hi>what can the righteous
doe?</hi> Wherefore my humble suit unto our master
Builders is, to keepe the Foundation unmoveable, not
permitting a resurrection to ancient heretiques before
their time,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12.</note> that so <hi>whatsoever men build thereon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be gold or stubble,</hi> may be brought to the Test, in
this Fiery triall.</p>
            <p>Stand fast therefore Brethren in that libertie, wherein
Christ hath made us free,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1. &amp; 13.</note> 
               <hi>not making your libertie a
cloake for malitiousnesse,</hi> not for an occasion to the Flesh,
but by love serve one another, judging thus of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that he that loves his Brother, abides in the light, but
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 9. 1.</note> he that hates his Brother (<hi>whatsoever he may boast
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53067:4"/>
of new discoveries,</hi>) walkes in darknesse, and knowes not
whither he goes, <hi>because</hi> that darknesse hath blinded his
eyes, <hi>and that</hi> whosoever seemes to be religious, and yet
bridles not his tongue, he deceives his owne heart, and his
Religion is vain.<note n="*" place="margin">Jam. 1. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But that I may not only perswade, but offer my
Mite, I shall in all humilitie propose a medium,
which if found agreeable to the word of God, may
through the blessing of the Almighty make up the
Breach, and reconcile your greatest difference.</p>
            <p>I conceive you both agree in these particulars.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 34. 1 Tim. 2. 11. 1 Cor. 5. 11. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 17.</note> That
all that shall be Members, and have right to Vote in
your Churches, (from which Votes Women are
excepted) shall not only be free from just scandall, that
is Prophannesse, and the impenitent practise of any
knowne sinne, but be indued with a sufficiencie of
knowledge, to which end (since you accord in the
Principles of Religion) I hope there will speedily be
set forth, and establisht one short Catechisme for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and examination. Next in condiscention
to the Independants, I heare it is mutually resolved,
that the government of their respective Members,
reconciling of Inferiour differences, and ordering their
conversations, even as farre as Ordination, and the
censure of Excommunication, (respect being had in
Appeals to the advice and results of the Classes and
Provinciall Synods, and saving to the Presbyterians
their right) be ordered by their paricular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Thus farre we are knit together in one spirituall
building and temple of God.<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 21.</note> The great difference if I
understand it, is in the Tegument and covering, which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53067:4"/>
is indeed, the ornament, coupling, and strength of the
whole Aedifice: As where shall rest (as to us) under
the same Scepter, the determinative and concluding
power, the end of Appeals, the regulation of that unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
Plea, and over-much extended libertie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 21.</note>
that so we may be one, as Christ and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are one; this, some of you fixe in a generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie,
others, limit to a particular Congregation;
The first pleads not only Scripture analogically, but
prudence for preserving union, and preventing of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
as also Antiquitie, from the paralell in generall
Counsells and Parliaments, affirming that the other
way, hath no grounds in Scripture: since Churches
were necessarily Independant, no State being then
Christian that this way (by reason that our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature hath no check) is destructive to the unitie
of Religion. Since according to the number of the
Congregations will be their opinions, as also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious
to Common-wealths; their being no <hi>feuds</hi> so
bloody and irreconciliable, as those that breake out
about points of Faith, instance, in the wars betweene
the Turke and Persian, Papists and Protestants, in the
Lutheran contestations, and Arian persecutions.
Lastly, they conclude an inconsistencie in this way,
with relations and callings, disaffection and departure
from Bed, Board, Families, and Imployments, being
experimentall consequences of Religious differences.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the contradicting partie affirme,
that a generall Assembly differs but in name from a
Conclave of Cardinals, or Prelaticall Synod, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
member of the Church is free, and ought not in
matters of Faith, to conclude himselfe by Proxie, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53067:5"/>
no Church hath power over another, or Brethren (since
the Apostles,) have Dominion over the Consciences
of their Brethren, that their Platforme of Church
Government ought to be, and is <hi>jure divino,</hi> that the
Eavngelicall Scripture sets foorth theirs, and no
other.</p>
            <p>Now deare Brethren, give me your pardon and
leave with <hi>Moses,</hi> to step in betwixt your Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
with his and <hi>Abrahams</hi> words,<note place="margin">Exod. 2. 13. Gen. 13. 8.</note> 
               <hi>why doe ye contend
being ye are Brethren,</hi> it may be God giving a blessing,
and each of you in his hand, I shall in my Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be a medium to unite you, (only dispise not my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,)
since <hi>the Lord hides many things from the

            <p>But to proceed, I observe neither of you arrogate
to your selves an infallability but piously seeke, an
Orthodox and Prudentiall way of Government, for
the attaining and preserving, Gods truth; blessed are
your indeavours, yea they shalbe blessed. Wherefore
I aske the Presbiterians why doe ye extoll and lift up
a generall assemblie, above the rest of the flocke of
Christ: To the Independants I say why doe ye
preferre the judgement of one particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
before the ioynt votes of all the refined Christian
Churches of the Kingdome, surely the first will yeild
to me, that where most of Gods People are in their
judgement, there is the greatest measure of his spirit,
and to such Assemblies principally, and to their
votes, are made all those gratious promises (I neede
not coate the places) concerning Christs spirit and
presence I mean to such a Multitude not of Men only,
but of purged and visible believers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53067:5"/>
The other I presume both from grounds of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and reason, will grant, that could the votes of
all the reputed and received Members of Christ, of
their severall Churches, be joyntly taken and in one
place, they must be accepted, and are but as the vote
of one great Congregation, which though it have an
increase of Ministers and Elders, yet according to a
true difinition for essence is a Church, and that more
eminently, though not more truely then the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Congregations of whom it consists, even as an
Assembly made up of many Families, called by the
<note n="*" place="margin">Colos: 4. 15. Rom. 16. 5.</note> Apostle Churches of God, is more excellent, then
its subdivisions.</p>
            <p>But that I may make good by Scripture, this incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating
of Churches, conjuncture and union of
votes, I shall remember you of those three chiefe
proofes, and lights of Church Governmrnt, both for
Doctrine and manners. The first shewes the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Apostolique way, of ending controversies in
Doctrine, by the summoning of that great Assembly,
of the members of the Churches of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
of which Churches, read. <hi>Acts.</hi> 11. 1. and <hi>Galat:</hi> 1.
22. Therefore called a Multitude. <hi>Acts.</hi> 15. 12. in
which the Apostles, (although indued with an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
spirit,) and the Elders of the Churches did not
alone vote, and decree matters (though that in many
cases, wherein the People consents, such votes, may be
and are necessary expedient &amp; lawfull) but the whole
Church. <hi>verse</hi> 22. which compar'd with. <hi>Acts. 2. verse</hi>
41. Wherein three thousand are said to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and with <hi>Acts. 4. verse</hi> 4. Wherein five thousand,
were by one Sermon converted, clearely demonstrates,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53067:6"/>
that this Assembly was composed of many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
as further appeares from the Apostles tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and preaching in every house. <hi>Acts.</hi> 5. 42. How
else could eight thousand Men, besides Women and
Children, be taught and edified.</p>
            <p>The like is proved, from the election and choise of
the seaven Deacons by the vote of the Multitude.
<hi>Acts.</hi> 6. 5. Where the Apostles, and Elders also were
present, yea those whom the holy Ghost. <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 47.
Calls a Church in a Nationall respect, he calls Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
<hi>Acts.</hi> 9. 31. In a Congregationall considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
And lastly in <hi>Corinth</hi> there more then probably
appears to be many<note n="*" place="margin">Compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 16. with the postscript of that Epistle.</note> Congregations, else whence or
where, were these discentions, and divisions some
saying, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul: <hi>others I am of</hi> Apollo, <hi>of</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,

commanded to meete in one Assembly for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication

Where note they were to meete, to whom the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
was directed, &amp; who are admonished to mourn:
But the Epistle and exhortation was directed to the
whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and not to the Elders only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>ergo</hi> the whole Congregation, when they shall desire it,
have a right to vote, and censure.</p>
            <p>Having thus fully proved by Scripture, that in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Provinces, and consequently in Kingdoms, the
Members of particular Congregations may and were
by command to meete for the deciding of any great
difference, yea the Apostles though of an infallible spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
did not contradict, but give both approbation
and institution to that liberty.<note place="margin">Acts 1. 15. 23. Act. 21. 22.</note>. I shall with humblest
submission, offer this following Proposition, as a right
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53067:6"/>
and fit <hi>medium</hi> of reconciliation. That in all great
scisms and heresies, over spreading whole Churches,
if the breach cannot be made up by advice, argument,
and subordinate discipline either Congregationall or
Presbiteriall; an appeale be made to a Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
who after the stating, disputing and voting, such
points in difference together with the merrit of the
offence (the recusant Church or Churches, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
continuing unsatisfied) that then the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
adjourne that sessions for three moneths, in
which time, the Assembly, members of each Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
to be ordered after fasting and prayer, to state
the Question and declare the Arguments and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the generall Assembly to their particular
Churches, and so accordingly at that meeting receive,
and bring up each Churches vote and sentence with
the number (because of the disproportion of Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes)
sum'd up of those that affirme, and those that
discent, that so at the next Session the Question may
be decided and concluded, by the Major vote, both of
Churches and Members which Scripture way will
not only by a religious Policy from time to time
discover the temper, pulse, &amp; inclination of the whole
Kingdome, and consequently administer a great help
and direction to Government, but will give full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to all, (unlesse to obstinate heritickes) as
being the judgement and vote (even by the Poale) of
all the visible and individuall Christians of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
politically united, as in one Congregation, yea
the disobedient wilbe left without excuse, and justly
liable to their sentence of excommunication.</p>
            <p>But put the Question a considerable number of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53067:7"/>
Churches in the Kingdome, give in their vote with
a new opinion, hazarding a rent and division in the
Nation.</p>
            <p>I answer, that upon so sad an occasion our Church
(in imitation of the ancient callings of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Counsels, upon the over flowing of heresie,)
ought to desire the judgement and assistance, and that
by additionall votes (if it may be) of all the reformed
Churches in the world, which comes neerest to the
judgement of the holy Catholicke Church, the body
of Christ, to which he hath promised his presence,
and spirit of truth to the end,<note place="margin">Math. 28. 20</note> and therefore must as to
each particular State or Church, though not infallib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet prudentially, end and conclude by obedience
either active or passive the discenting Churches,
whom the civill Magistrate after the Churches ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
is to order by banishment or lesser
punishment, according as their doctrines, shalbe
more or lesse prejudiciall to the State, wherein they
live.<note place="margin">2. Chro. 15. verse 12. 13. 14.</note> Which since they suffer as evill doers, is (as to
that Common-wealth) a civill and necessary act of
preservative Justice, not an inforcing of Conscience
or persecution.<note place="margin">Matthew. 18 verse. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus fervently beseeching the blessing of the all-wise
God, upon my poore and weake indeavours,
trusting that in the bowells of love, and charity, I
have in sincerity and plainnesse declared unto you the
mind of Christ, in all humility I conclude.</p>
