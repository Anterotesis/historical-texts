            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received your Letter of Thanks for the laſt Specifick I communicated to you, and that hath proved ſo ſucceſsful, that I find you very importunate with me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with what I have found moſt effectual againſt Malignant Spotted Feavors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44440:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>I am ſorry to hear that <hi>London</hi> Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are ſo often diſappointed in the uſe of vulgar Medicines. The great Dr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> in his Diſcourſe of Feavors, tells the World his Art is defective in that Diſtemper; and that if any Man can be found who can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a better Method, or Communicate a good Specifick, for the more effectual Cure of that Diſtemper which carryeth ſo many thouſand to their Graves, he will prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a good Citizen.</p>
            <p>For my own part I declare, I knew no better Remedy than the <hi>Indian Serpent Stones,</hi> for it powerfully expels Poyſons of all ſorts, both externally and internally applyed, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts Putrefaction, promotes inſenſible tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, raiſeth the Vital Spirits, comforts the Heart, and gives a new Fermentation to the Blood, and helps Nature to caſt off all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity. I have found it more ſerviceable than any ſort of Alexipharmics.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> in his Diſcourſe of Specifick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44440:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gives very ſtrange Accounts of the Extraordinary Virtues of theſe Stoney Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, ſaid to be found in the Heads of <hi>Indian</hi> Serpents, and particularly of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment he made himſelf upon a Cat bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by an enraged Viper, which cauſed its Tongue and Head to ſwell, and made the Cat raving mad, yet upon giving it a little of the Powder of this Stone inwardly, it had recovered, had not the rude People killed it by Violence. He confeſſeth that there are many of them Counterfeits, and ſuch were thoſe that Mounſieur <hi>Redi</hi> made Experiments upon. He alſo tells us, that an Eminent Phyſitian of the Colledge performed a very great Cure by the External Application of one of the Stones.</p>
            <p>I was ſent for unto a young Man who had a very dangerous Feavor, and all the Symptoms of Malignity very well known to Phyſitians; I gave the uſual Remedies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in that Caſe; his Diſtemper threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd every Day more and more, and all Friends deſpaired of Recovery; at length I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44440:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gave him a Tincture drawn out of theſe Stones, with the Powder in ſubſtance, and it powerfully expels all the Malignity by gentle breathing Sweats, and the Patient ſpeedily recovered, and gained his Strength beyond Humane Expectation.</p>
            <p>An Ancient Gentlewoman who had a high Malignant Feavor, being firſt ſurprized with a Rigor, and ſhivering Coldneſs in her Back, and afterwards a hot burning Fit, which laſted many Hours without any intermiſſion, a low weak Pulſe, cold, clammy, faint Sweats, Purple Spots in the Skin, little or no Thirſt, a pale thin Urine, and very delirous, but no Complaint of any Pains in the Head, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts; a Hitch-cough, frequent Sighing and Dozeing; I finding all Remedies fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, gave this Specifick, and found a ſpeedy Recovery attend it.</p>
            <p>I could tell you of ſeveral Familes in our Countrey that have been ſeized with theſe Malignant Feavors, that have been ſecured from the Dangers, by the Uſe of this Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44440:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Remedy: But I find People generally diſpleaſed when Phyſitians mention their Names in print, if it be in <hi>Engliſh</hi>; they are prone to ſuſpect the World never thinks them ſound afterwards, and therefore I omit Names.</p>
            <p>I knew one Man about Fifty, who was ſeized as if he had been infected with the Plague, had Swellings under his Arms, and all other Peſtilential ſymptoms upon him; and only giving him a few Drops of a Mixture made with the Powder of this Stone, he was reſtoared to Health in a miraculous manner.</p>
            <p>I could Name one Patient who was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Death, when two in the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily dyed of the Spotted Feaver, after they had taken large Quantities of <hi>Bezoar</hi> and <hi>Goa Stones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can truly ſay with Dr. <hi>Sidenham,</hi> in his Diſcourſe of Peſtilential Feavors, that I have delivered faithfully all things relating to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and never propoſed any thing but what I had often and ſufficiently tryed; and when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44440:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I come to Dye, I hope I ſhall have a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſs within my own Breaſt I have done my Duty.</p>
