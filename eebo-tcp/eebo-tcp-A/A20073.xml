            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE OWLES EPISTLE to the Rauen.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Rother <hi>Rauen,</hi> I did euer enuy the happines of other Birds, when I saw them freely enioying Woods, Fields, Parks, Forrests, Cities, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and all that the mouing canopy of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen can couer, as their proper cages to sing in all the day, drawing thereby, audience to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching-musicke-Lectures; when poore I (hauing more knowledge (except in song) than the proudest of them) durst neuer, or seldome gad abroad in the light. But when I heard, and beheld your selfe a student in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and by iumbling together a hotch-potch of Calculations, to be counted an <hi>Astronomer,</hi> and to paste vp your name on euery poste in the title of a Booke, called, <hi>The Rauens Almanacke,</hi> I did then more vex than euer before.</p>
            <p>I confesse you are a Bird of a larger wing than I am, goodlir is your proportion, piercing are your eyes, your colour so ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that Women take a pride to haue haire, blacke as a <hi>Rauens,</hi> dreadfull is your voice, bloudy your beake, and your tallons full of terror: but let your bosome be open, and then (as in some great States-men, who carry an outward glorious show) nothing is to be found but vglines, treachery, and rapacitie. But if it shall be no dishonour for me to stand on the tiptoes of mine owne commendations, I would then against your ominous croaking thus farre preferre my wakefull hooting, that I haue euer beene held a praedooming Bird; but (besides that) an Embleme of Wisdome, and so sacred among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they carried the reuerence of my picture stamped vpon their money.</p>
            <p>Now (brother <hi>Rauen)</hi> as in this point I spitefully make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25827:5"/>
with you, as prouing my selfe, not one, to whom you may cry, Haile fellow well met: So will I, in these my Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maicall praedictions, discouer to the world such wonders from the planatary-Regions, that not onely thou, but all other Birds (daring to pry into the priuy-chamber of Heauen) shall plucke in their heads (as I doe vntill twilight) with shame, and neuer offer more to pester <hi>Pauls Church-yard,</hi> with their triuiall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnostications. I haue beene this yeere in progresse with the Moone, riding on the Dogge which the man in the Moone leads, whose bush of Thornes he lent me, in steed of a fanne to keep off the winde, whilst he himselfe ranne along by me as my footman. Much skill learnt I of the Moone, for shee is a great light to <hi>Almanack-makers,</hi> albeit in shew, shee seeme but a cold friend to them: and much mad talke had I with that lunaticall fellow (the squire of her body.) The 12 houses of the Sunne, lay higher vp into the countrey, so that by reason my sight hath euer beene bad, I had no great stomach to mount vp thither, because I know the Sunne (who neuer could endure me) would haue spied both a Moate in mine eye, and a Beame too. Here I caught starres, faster than a Cat will kill flies; of which store I shot some downe to helpe those that write <hi>Almanacks</hi> for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Some of the 12 Signes (which like cast garments, being worne to peeces, were throwne by into an odd corner) I clapt close vnder my wings, and now they are to be seene hanging in the middle of Cheapeside; for there's the Ram, the Bull, the Crab, Capricorne, &amp;c. Onely the young wench (called Virgo) would by no meanes sit in any shop in that streete, because so many Gallants lye ouer the stalls, courting euery hansom wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man there, that the maide was afraid to haue lost her head, in the company. Thus with weary winge traueld I, but being now come backe from the Court of the Moone, (who is not much vnlike me, hauing a great broad platter face as mine is) listen to the wonders which I bring with me: So hooting and whooping a silence to your Rauenship, I prognosticate my selfe, yours for a strange <hi>Almanacke</hi> for a whole yeere,</p>

            <p>A Fare on the Bankside when the play-houses haue two penny tenants dwelling in them.</p>
            <p>A Fare at Blacke Friers, when any Gentleman comming to that place, desires to be a landed man.</p>

            <p>The way betweene Yorke and London, is iust so many miles as betweene London and Yorke: It hath diuers times bin rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in a day: so that by my Geometricall dimensions I finde it but a dayes iourney: Yet the Post-masters of the North sweare tis a great deale more.</p>
            <p>The way betweene Charing Crosse, and not a crosse to bee found scarse in 20 purses, for one that passes by, is to be tried by many a Gallants pocket, with yellow band, fether Pendant-Reguardant, and cloake lined with veluet, and therefore here I spare to speake of so poore a thing.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:25827:33"/>
            <p>The way betweene the two Counters in London may bee trauelld in as short a time, as one of the Varlets there ventures his soule for money, &amp; thats much about a quarter of an houre, or halfe at most.</p>
            <p>The way to proue the taking of any purse, (be it neuer so full) and to stand in that quarrell euen to the death, is to go first to Newgate, and then to Tiburne.</p>
            <p>The way to be an arrant Asse, is to bee a meere Vniuersitie Scholler.</p>
            <p>The high way to Bedlam, is first to set forth at Westminster Hall, and there to be vndone in 4 or 5 Termes by corrupted Lawyers.</p>
            <p>Betweene starke drunke, and reasonably sober, is much about 4 houres sleeping: but some that haue trauelled those ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Countries, say tis sometimes more.</p>
            <p>The way to heauen is to walke with a good conscience; hee that rides without it goes vily out of the way, and ten to one if euer he gets thither.</p>
            <p>The way to Hell, is cleane the contrary way to Heauen; the one turnes a the right hand, tother on the left.</p>
