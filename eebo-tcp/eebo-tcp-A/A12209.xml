            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

estate, by our bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; hee speaketh here of heavenly things after an earthly manner, and in a comfortable mystery. As in other places the Holy Ghost sets out the joyes of Heaven by a sweet Ban quet: so here hee sets out the union that wee have with Christ, by the union of the Husband with the wife. And that wee might the better understand what this union is, hee conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends to our weake capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, that wee might see that in a glasse of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance which wee (through our corruptions) cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne in the owne nature. This booke therefore is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a shadowed demonstration and setting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15231:5"/>
forth of the love of Christ to his Church, and of the love of the Church to Christ under certaine earthly similitudes so fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly and naturally, that the Iewes tooke, and doe take great scandall at it, and therefore would not have any to reade it, till they should come (at least) to the age of thirty yeares; and this, least they thereby should be tempted to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse and foule inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency; where in they should seeme wiser then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and teach the holy Ghost to speake. But the Holy Ghost is pleased thus by corporall, to set out spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, which are of a higher straine, that by some deeper thoughts, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15231:6"/>
more then a taste of the one, they might bee made to transpose their affections (which in your youthfull age are most strong) from the heate of naturall love to a flame of spirituall desires, and to the things of God. All therefore who are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded, (for whom chiefly the Scriptures, and this holy booke of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were written) must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour out of this shell, to take out the sweete kernell of our blessed Communion with Christ, howsoever others (otherwise minded) take offence hereat; for here, the union betweene Christ and his Spouse is so familiarly and to the life pensilled out by that union which is betweene the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15231:6"/>
and the Wife, that though ungodly men may stumble here, as at some stone of offence, yet the godly may by a better hand receive instruction and much bettering from the same.</p>
            <p>To come to the words themselves, they are the words of the Spouse to Christ, containing in them two particulars.</p>
            <p>First, an earnest desire in <note place="margin">1.</note> these words, <hi>Let him kisse mee with the kisses of his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which note 3. things further; as,</p>
            <p>First the person desiring, the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the person de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the thing desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15231:7"/>
A familiar kisse of his mouth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ground of the desire, fetelit from the excellency of the thing desired, in these words, <hi>For thy love is sweeter then wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the whole in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; observe a spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract <note place="margin">Doct. Generall.</note> betweene Christ and his Church. There is a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill contract betweene man and wife; answerable to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the spirituall betweene Christ and his Chuch holds fit resemblance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this civill contract may hold; both parties must consent. So it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and his Spouse; hee was so in love with mankind that he hath taken our nature upon him, and this his incarnation is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15231:7"/>
the ground of all this union of ours with him. For first, his incarnation is the cause or ground of our union with him in grace here: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, our union in grace is the ground of our union with him in glory. And now that we may be a Spouse to him, he gives us his Spirit to testifie his love to us, that we might give our consent in love to him againe; and that wee might be made a fit Spouse for him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Likewise in marriage there is a communicating of all good things; and so it is here. Christ here in this spirituall contract gives himselfe, and with himselfe all good things unto us. The Spirit therefore is the Churches; his happinesse
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15231:8"/>
the Churches, his graces are the Churches, his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse the Churches; In a word, all his priviledges and prerogatives are the Churches; as saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, all things are Christs, and Christ is yours; and the reason is given for all are Christs, and all that are <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 21.</note> Christs are yours by this spirituall symbolizing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. This excellency is spoken of by the Prophet <hi>Hosea;</hi> where speaking of <note place="margin">Hos 2. 19. &amp;c.</note> this spirituall contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and his Church he saith;</p>
            <p>In that day when he shall marry her unto himselfe in faithfulnesse, he will make a covenant for her with all creatures; with the beasts of the field, the foules of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15231:8"/>
heaven, and all that cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth upon the earth: so that upon this contract commeth in a traine of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie, or league of close union between the Church and all the creatures. All that he hath done, all that hee hath suffered, by this contract is made ours, and we have the benefit of all, by being his members, and of his body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But what have wee to bestow upon him againe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Nothing at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther portion nor proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; neither beauty nor ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; but a miserable and base condition that he took upon him. For use:</p>
            <p>This is a welspring of much comfort, &amp; a ground <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Twofold.</note>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:15231:9"/>
of many duties. For our comfort.</p>
            <p>Christ condescended so <note place="margin">First of comfort.</note> farre unto us, and into such a neare aquaintance tooke us as to make us his Spouse, he who did so hath al things at his command: and then what can wee want at the fountaine? Wee can want no protection; for that is the covering of this Well: we can want no good thing, for all goodnesse is in this Well of life; we have free accesse unto Christ as the wife hath to her hus band, for who should have free accesse to the husband but the wife; or who so free as shee? So, who hath free accesse to Christ, but the Spouse, or so as shee hath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:15231:9"/>
Yea, but we have infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <note place="margin">Object.</note> and are by them a wife too farre unfit for such a husband?</p>
            <p>True indeede: but shall <note place="margin">Sol.</note> man beare with his wife, because shee is the weaker vessell, and will not Christ much more with his Spouse? But this union of man with wife is but for a short time; death cuts that wife, but here (which is our chiefest comfort) this contract is not for a time but for ever. I have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thee unto my selfe for ever saith the Lord. And therefore wee shall never want potection or directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or good thing while we are his; and his wee shall hee ever. And thus stands the case betweene Christ and us</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:15231:10"/>
Now for the duty on our part it is to love him againe with a mutuall and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent love, to honour him as <hi>Sarah</hi> did <hi>Abraham,</hi> when <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 6.</note> shee called him Lord; and to manifest it by doing what hee would have us to doe, and by suffering what he would have us to beare for his sake.</p>
            <p>But to come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>First, we have the person desiring, <hi>Let him kisse me;</hi> Secondly the person desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>let Him;</hi> Thirdly, the things, <hi>the kisses of his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first; <hi>Me,</hi> it is here the speech of the whole Church, and so of every particular member, every of which is the Spouse of

Christ. The point from hence is:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All Christian savours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
               <hi>to all Christians alike;</hi> wee (all alike) have one Faith, one Baptisme, one Spirit, and every Christian may say <hi>mee:</hi> so saith the whole Church; and every Christian as well as it may so say: for all Christian priviledges belong to all alike.</p>
            <p>Herein take comfort then, <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> that who soever belongs to the Church in generall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to thee as a particular of the whole. I name but this.</p>
            <p>Now secondly, this tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> us by steps of reason to ascend from one spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all priviledge to another, as thus; <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15231:11"/>
and it was counted to him for righteousnesse; and therefore if I beleeve, I shall be counted righteous. <hi>David</hi> sinned; and <hi>David</hi> sinning repented and found mercy, and therefore if I repent I shall finde mercy. And thus all priviledges belong alike to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Every Christian soule is the Spouse of Christ as well as the whole Church. Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thus propoun's himselfe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all that would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>God had mercy on me.</hi> Where therefore hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth all to come unto Christ, by his owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, <hi>videlicet,</hi> that hee will have mercy on thee, as he had on him. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15231:11"/>
then is promised to the whole Church, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to thy owne soule in particular; and whatsoever is required of the whole Church, that know to bee required of thee in thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular by Christ, if thou be a member of his body, and beest in his service. But though in spirituall favours all have alike portion and proportion; yet it is not so in outward things. For here some are rich, some poore, some honorable, and some base, and all with some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: but in the best pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and best gifts there is an equall extension to all; to the poore Christian as much and as soone as to the rich: to him that is base in the eye of the world, as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15231:12"/>
well and (perhaps) sooner then to him that is hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>And now secondly, for the person desired; <hi>Let him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many make love to this Spouse; the divell, the world and the flesh. The divell and carnall persons make love to the soule to draw her away from Christ, but shee will not turne aside, but lookes to Christ still, <hi>Let him kisse me.</hi> Shee goes not (as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists doe) to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> or any Saint; but to Christ, and to him onely. Saith shee, he is my welbeloved <note place="margin">Cant. 2 16.</note> and I am his, hee is my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure, and I am his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar; none have I in heaven but him, and there is none that I desire in comparison
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15231:12"/>
of him. Hee hath singled out me, and I him; <hi>Let Him kisse me,</hi> saith the Spouse, and I will kisse none but him.</p>
            <p>For the third thing, the thing desired; <hi>Let Him kisse me, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The thing desired here, is a kisse. There are divers sorts of kisses spoken of in Scripture: there is a kisse of superiours to inferiours, and of inferiours to superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. Also there is an holy <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 16. 16.</note> kisse, and an hypocriticall kisse, as <note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 20 10.</note> 
               <hi>Ioabs</hi> was to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> and as <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 26. 49.</note> 
               <hi>Iudas</hi> kisse to <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 20, &amp;c.</note> Christ. There are kisses of love, so <note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 20 41.</note> 
               <hi>Ionathan</hi> kissed <hi>David;</hi> there are kisses of subjection; and here what is sayd, may well bee taken in sence as there, <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>kisse
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15231:13"/>
yee the Sonne, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this kisse is of a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to an inferiour; <hi>Let Him kisse me with the kisses of His mouth:</hi> that is, let him shew me a further testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his love by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; and let mee enjoy a further communion with him: or let him further as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure me of his love. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Churches meaning here: the Church, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shee had good interest in this spirituall joynture at the marriage making; yet shee, (according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of time) had different degrees of desires to bee further and further assured. From <hi>Solomons</hi> time, and before, even from the beginning, there was ever a desire in the Church
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15231:13"/>
to these kisses of Christs mouth; which is, that hee would come in our nature; and that he would manifest by little and little, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and clearer, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the flesh; which accordingly he did by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and with open coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance at last. As first in Paradise; <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>The seede of the woman shall breake the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head;</hi> then to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 12. 3</note> 
               <hi>In thy seede shall all the families of the earth be blessed;</hi> afte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r that, to one Tribe, the Tribe of <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 49. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Iuda;</hi> then to one Family of that Tribe, the house of <hi>David;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 14. Rom. 5. 5.</note> and sweetly to his Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Esa. 7. 14.</note> 
               <hi>A Virgin shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;</hi> and after with the finger of the Baptist, <hi>Iohn</hi> pointing to Christ; <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Behold
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15231:14"/>
the Lambe of God that takes away the sinnes of the world;</hi> and so you see how Christ did reveale himselfe often, and by degrees unto his Church; answerable to which were the desires of the Church for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ; as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> where hee <note place="margin">Esa. 64. 1.</note> saith, Oh that thou wouldst breake the heavens and come downe. Where hee prophesied of those that should waite for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of <hi>Israel:</hi> And thus before Christ came in the flesh; the Church had a great longing after his incarnation; as here: <hi>Let him kisse me with the kisses of his mouth.</hi> But this is not all, and shee was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that this could not bee
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15231:14"/>
till the last time of dayes; therefore she desireth some further meanes of aquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Christ, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him; desiring that hee would manifest himselfe more and more by his word, by his graces, and by his Spirit. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then the desire of the Church was for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, so now that which Christians should desire and long after, is not that Christ might come to them, but that they might goe to him, and that they might bee with him in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. They love his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; but because this cannot be yet; (though the Church be still in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) therefore he desireth to heare his words, or that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15231:15"/>
hee would kisse her with his mouth in his Word. And yet that is not all nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but that shee might finde his Spirit now wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with her here; and further that he would kisse her with his mouth, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing his good graces in her, and by manifesting his love unto her: this is the desire of her soule. This is the whole suit of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, and of every Christian soule: namely that Christ would thus kisse her, and that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale himselfe every day more and more unto her, in his Word, in his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by his Spirit, and by increase of graces with a plentifull addition. This I say, is the desire of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15231:15"/>
Church; and it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire also of every Christian faithfull soule, even that Christ would thus breath upon her with the holy kisses of his lippes.</p>
            <p>And now wee come to the ground of this desire taken from the excellency of the love of Christ, which is here sayd by an experience of the whole of Christianitie, and by the particular of every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an soule, <hi>to bee sweeter then wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence wee note two things.</p>
            <p>First, that every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> soule and the Spouse in generall hath a sweete taste of the love of Christ, even in this life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That after this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:15231:16"/>
and taste of this love, shee hath ever springing up in her a further desire of the encrease and manifestation thereof.</p>
            <p>For the first; As after the <note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> contract there is a more and more evident manifestation of love then was before; yet not so full as after the marriage: so Christ, though hee doe give his Spouse a taste of his love here, and sends certaine love tokens unto her from heaven, some graces whereby his love is made more manifest then before it was, (as <hi>Isaack</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 24.</note> sent to <hi>Rebecka</hi> some Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Bracelets to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest his love to her:) yet his love is not fully manifested in this life, but is kept close untill the day of the great
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15231:16"/>
solemnitie. But because Christ cannot delight in his Spouse, unlesse she be deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with some of his graces here; therefore here hee gives hee some hand sells of them, which are not onely a taste of his favours but the fruite of his love.</p>
            <p>The reasons are divers.</p>
            <p>The first reason is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Rea. 1.</note> hee would minister to her some solace after the long time of her absence from him, and that shee might not faint, but having some sweet taste of his love here, might stay her sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke upon that, somewhat in hand, till the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord Christ will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifest his love unto her. The Lord seeth that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15231:17"/>
his children are apt to bee opprest with heavinesse here; and therefore he gives them a taste as the earnest of the bargaine, till the whole come; that is, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to comfort them till that come that will wipe away all teares, and shut out sorrow; when there shall be no woe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Lord gives his children a sweet taste of <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> his love here, that by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and frailty they might not fall away and so lose their first love (but if they should slip) that then they might recover their first grounds, and say with the Church; wee will goe and returne to our first husband; for it was better with us then, then now, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 7. so
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15231:17"/>
strong was that love, and so sweet that wee had from him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> the manifestation of this his love doth wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully strengthen a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, causing him to goe lightly through the heaviest affliction: for when Christ assures a Christian of his love, then no affliction will seeme grievous, but hee'l through all, hee'l suffer whatsoever shall be fall him for Christs sake with joy.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Christ gives his <note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> Church, and so every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian a taste of his love in this life, because he knowes we have many temptations in this world which are ready to steale away our affections, and, to rob God
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15231:18"/>
of his part in us; as carnall pleasures, riches, honours, and the like. Now that these might not draw away our affections; he gives us a taste of his love, which is better then all these, and all things else; sweeter then the sweetest wine, or best thing that can bee desired. I say God gives us the first fruits of his love here; and it is that our affections might be preserved chast to him, and wee kept from wandering in the love of a stranger. And so hee gives us a sweet taste of his love in this life; that neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, on our left hand, might too much presse us downe or discomfort us; nor the pleasures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of this life on our
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15231:18"/>
right steale us from God.</p>
            <p>The use is to teach us to admire at the goodnesse of <note place="margin">Use.</note> God in this, that he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so to provide for us, that is, so sufficiently as to keepe us from being too much overcome with heavinesse, through the multitude of temptations and afflictions, which in this life wee are subject unto, and to expell the bitternesse there of with the sweetnesse of his love, as with Sugar in the cup; and all to have us fast unto himselfe, and our affections proper unto him.</p>
            <p>And so wee come to the second Doctrine, which is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Church (and so</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> 
               <hi>every Christian) after this contract and first taste of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15231:19"/>
Christs love, and evermore springing up in him, an insa. tiable desire after a further taste and deeper pledge of that love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reasons why are two.</p>
            <p>The first may bee taken from the nature of true <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> love, which is never satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And hence it is that though Christ give his Spouse a taste of his love in his word, by sending his Embassadours, his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters with his love-letters, unto her in the Gospell, giving her therein a large volume of his love; as also in the seale of his Spirit, and Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nts (those love-tokens) and in many other worthy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; yet all this cannot satisfie her thirsty and more
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15231:19"/>
desiring soule; but Christ, having thus manifested his love unto her, in the first fruits, shee must have more of the same, and still longs to have a further assurance.</p>
            <p>The second reason may bee drawne from Christs <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> infinite riches, who (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) is so infinite in his gifts and glory, in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in his bountie, in his pleasures, joyes, and the like, that we know no end thereof. He hath all things, <hi>All power is given him in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 18</note> 
               <hi>heaven and in earth;</hi> every way infinite in himselfe and in his bounties infinitely magnificent, and how (then) can the Spouse but have an infinite desire to a further and still further taste of his love, and of a nearer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15231:20"/>
with him? And so whether we regard the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of love, which is never satisfied; or whether wee consider Christs infinite ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches manifest in his truth; there must be an in satiable mind of desire in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, to bee further filled with, and more fully assured of the love of Christ. Where grace is, there is a further desire of growing in grace; and it is an higher degree of love to desire an enjoying of the presence of Christ, then to desire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy heaven it selfe, which cannot be yet.</p>
            <p>Therefore here let us try <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> our love by our labouring, for that sight of Christ w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we may have of him in this life below; and here lot us
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15231:20"/>
desire often and much to see him in his ordinances, where hee manifests him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in a speciall manner. Therefore I say, art thou sicke and in prison, or so lame of thy limbes that thon canst not come to the assembly? and is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy greatest trouble, and the great greefe of thy soule that thou art thus shut out from the presence of Christ and the Angells in his ordinances, and from the congregation of the Saints, where he by fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>kisses</hi> useth to manifest his love to thee and to them? and if so, it is well. But here I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how some persons dare to take upon them the name of Christianitie; and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15231:21"/>
yet thinke the men too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the course too strict that lookes that way. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such want the true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a right Christian, which is to have a further and further desire of the manifestation of Christs love. Many of these neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ordinances of God, or if they come where they may bee had, never desire by them a further increase, as it were the <hi>inward kisses</hi> of Christs mouth: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves with the <hi>outward;</hi> even the barke of those ordinances.</p>
            <p>When the Spirit should witnesse and seale up this love, the love of Christ to their soules by an <hi>inward kisse,</hi> they content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the <hi>outward,</hi> the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15231:21"/>
bare hearing of the word: But mark what I say; where this further desire of famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aritie with Christ is not, there is but a barren soile and soule of a Christian: there is no true taste of Christs love; for if there were, there would be a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desire of growth in that affection. There are some that make a faire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession like unto many that marry to cloake their adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; for so, such professe Christ to cover their strong covetousnesse and other strong faults, that they may have more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to commit sin. But Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, truly religious must not content themselves with outwardnesse in these kisses, but give, as the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15231:22"/>
man,</hi> so the sacrifice of the <hi>inwaid</hi> (the soule) unto God. Let those that finde (after such tryall) these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires springing up in them; comfort themselves in this, that they are Christs, and that Christ will manifest his love more and more unto them. For he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to grant the desires <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 4.</note> of the righteous. Hast thou then a longing desire to have a further taste of the love of Christ? Vse the meanes conscionably, and then be sure that Christ this <hi>Ioseph</hi> will open himselfe further and further unto thee, and thy soule shall know it. This for one use;</p>
            <p>Another is for exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and spirituall direction, <note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as how wee shall come to a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15231:22"/>
further assurance, signe, and fruit of this love of Christ. My beloved if we desire it; wee must labour to have; first, <hi>chast judgements,</hi> and secondly, <hi>chast affections.</hi> A chast judgement from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, heresie, and schisme; and affections chast from the world, from pleasures and the like: for Christ is wonderfull jealous both of our judgements, and of our love. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to present the <hi>Corinths</hi> a pure Virgin unto Christ. <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note> And further as we must af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>goodnesse,</hi> so wee must professe <hi>truth;</hi> wee must have chast judgements, as well as chast affections: the Spouse of Christ as shee is pure in affections, so shee is is pure in judgement; shee
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15231:23"/>
heares his voyce and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes him. Whatsoever comes not from the Word she receives not but rejects it. And as her judgement is right set, so her affections are pure and holy.</p>
            <p>Now therefore labour for these; that is, for <hi>chast affections.</hi> Christ will not have us to divide our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; some for him, and some for the world; or part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for pleasures, and partly for him; no, hee will not have it so: for, a fire divided hath lesse heat. Hee will have the whole heart and the whole of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or he will have neither heart nor affection. If wee give our hearts to the world or to the pleasures of the world, (the love of which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15231:23"/>
is enmity with God) then <note place="margin">Iam. 4. 4.</note> have wee an adulterous heart: which to doe is a double sinne, as it is for a wife to commit whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for in her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome there is a breach of chastitie, and breach of the marriage band. And indeed to embrace the world after we are contracted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, what is it lesse then whoredome, and a breach of covenant in our spirituall contract with Christ? therefore, beware of worldly-mindednesse, which as glew will tie all thy affections so fast to the earth, that thou shalt not be able to lift any to Christ. Take heede of the pleasures of the world, least they drowne thy soule in perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15231:24"/>
and destruction, as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. for many soules hath this Sea covered, even of those that have professed with the best, and have gone for good Christians.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, if wee will <note place="margin">3.</note> grow in the assurance of the love of Christ, and have more familiar kisses of his mouth; then labour we to get an humble heart, by searching out our owne great unworthinesse, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of what wee are, or were by nature. Indeed, we may disparage our credits by abasing our selves in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of men, but never can wee be too much humbled to our Saviour, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our selves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all that wee have.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15231:24"/>
There is no danger in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing our selves to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; nay 'tis for our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour with God: for, those that thus honour him, hee will honour and grace with his blessings, who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth grace to the humble. In such a Spirit he delights to dwell as a man at home, <hi>Esay</hi> 66. 3. Let us with all humilitie (then) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all to bee from his free grace; and with <hi>Iacob,</hi> that we our selves are lesse <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10.</note> then the least of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>Againe fourthly, if wee <note place="margin">4.</note> will grow in the assurance of the love of Christ; let us give Christ no peace, nor take any nay of him till hee hath given us the sweet <hi>kisses</hi> of his love. Many
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15231:25"/>
times he delayes the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing of his love; but what though? yet waite thou his pleasure; he hath waited long upon thee. We see <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> what a doe shee made when shee could not finde Christ; at last he manifested himselfe unto her, and called her by <note place="margin">Luk. 7. 47.</note> her name, demanding for what shee wept, and whom she sought; but it was some time first. Doe thou as she, give him no rest, take no deniall of him, nor give off till he answer thee: for, hee will doe it first or last. What did the woman of <hi>Canaan?</hi> shee gave Christ <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 22.</note> no rest till hee did encline unto her. So <hi>Iacob</hi> wrestled <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 24</note> with God, &amp; would not let him goe till he had assured
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15231:25"/>
him of his love and favour; he I say, who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to grant the desires of <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 4.</note> the righteous. O then hath he given thee any the like strong desire after him? continue constant, importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him by earnest and fervent prayer, and not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off, till he incline unto thee. Hee cannot stand out with thee long, hee cannot deny thee though he differ for some time and cause best knowne to himselfe; the assurance will come, and though it tarry, doe thou waite, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, and againe, take every thing for thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and improve thy former experience as what former love, and favour, &amp; power and fidelitie and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15231:26"/>
thou hast had, and make thy benefit of them all to thy best helpe, and till hee answer thee as hee will at last, and as hee did the woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> plead hard for thy selfe (as shee) till then. Christ accounts her a <hi>Dog, Matth.</hi> 15. 26. I am indeed so, saith shee; but, meane time, takes good advantage of his words, and thereby pleades strongly for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: no otherwise then the servants of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> who watched the words of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and drew comfort from them, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 33. So here, make thou thy plea strong by thine owne experience, and take all advantages. God hath beene thus and thus good
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15231:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unto thee for many yeares; these and these meanes hee hath given thee, and thus and thus they have wrought for thy good; therefore say then: I will for this follow him still, and untill hee assure mee of his love in a further degree, and further doe for me.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, but see thou bee <note place="margin">6.</note> modest in thy desires of this kind. Desire no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the first, that is, not so full an assurance of this love of Christ, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of thy desires, but with observation and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance fitting. And here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the degrees of these kisses, and manifestation of this love. The theefe on <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 42.</note> the Crosse desired but to bee remembred of Christ
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15231:27"/>
when hee came into his Kingdome no more but to bee remembred, and so no great matter. So doe thou; doe but desire a taste of his love, though never so little. For so the deare children of God have done. They have first desired the pardon of their sinnes; which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, they have procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to more, as humbly to beg such and such graces of the Spirit as seales to assure them further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to seale up his love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them with his nearer communion.</p>
            <p>But this communion is <note place="margin">Object.</note> not alway felt.</p>
            <p>I answer, if Christ be <note place="margin">Sol.</note> strange to us, the fault is our owne not his; for he is all love. And so it is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1.</note>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:15231:27"/>
because our loose hearts runne after some carnall contents; and what marvell then that Christ should shew himself strange unto us who runne from him? and that wee should goe mourning all the day long without any sense of his love? Or else it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">2.</note> we will not seeke for these his kisses; that is, for a further taste of his love as wee should in his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or because we doe not exercise those graces that wee have as is required by our attending upon them, and by resting by Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods promise for a blessing: Or because wee <note place="margin">3.</note> are negligent to stir up those graces of God in us by private duties: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15231:28"/>
wee trust our selves to bad companies, and to persons led about with evill desires, or possessed with an evill Spirit: Or because God would exercise and try our Faith, and so let us see our selves; that is in our owne naturall state of weakenesse. For thus hee left <hi>Peter.</hi> Otherwise it is Christs nature to manifest himselfe and his love unto his by the familiar kisses of his mouth. Now search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hearts, and you shall finde that these or such like as these are the causes why Christ is strange unto you, and why you are so sencelesse of your commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him.</p>
            <p>Consider yet againe <note place="margin">7.</note> when it is, and at what time
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15231:28"/>
that we have Christs swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test kisses, and are most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed with his loving countenance. It is not when wee lay our strength (all of it) upon good meanes? and so when wee strive with God in prayer, and labour in all humility, rightly, and profitably to use all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinances? Marke these well, as the meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and encrease the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Christs love in you.</p>
            <p>And further consider by what meanes and how you may fall into this deadnesse of heart, and what were the causes of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, observe how you may come to have most communion with Christ, and at what time,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15231:29"/>
and after what performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: as to be able to say, I was thus and thus dead and sencelesse of Christs love; but now I am thus and thus comforted and refreshed with it, I was strong for my pleasures; now I am strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent to please God, and my selfe no way with his dishonour; I was all for my selfe, now I am the least part of my selfe, so God may have all: I denyed my selfe nothing, now I pull in all things, and resigne up my selfe and all to Gods will. If thus wee deny our selves in every thing and serve God in all, and this because wee will breake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from all impediments in heavenly courses, God will be sure to recompence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15231:29"/>
us in spirituall things abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, yea and in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall also, so farre as he shall see them to be good for us.</p>
            <p>Adde yet this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more, that when thou wast afflicted and hadst none to comfort thee, that then, and even then the Lord was most sweet unto thee, that then he refreshed thy soule with the balsome of his love. Consider this and thou canst not but know what mouth hath kissed thee.</p>
            <p>These may helpe us much in getting a further assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Christs love; <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e stirred up therefore to a desire to be where Christ is, and to have the kisses of his love in his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, so often as wee have a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15231:30"/>
tender of them: So shall we get more store, and further testimonie of his favour, and so shall wee more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in grace, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ. So shall wee never want good assurance for a good estate in heaven, or comfort in any other estate. For cast such a man into a Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee hath a Paradise there. And why there? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ comes to him. Further, if wee have this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with Christ, then though we are compassed about with death, death <note place="margin">Psal. 23 4.</note> shall not affright us, because the great God is with us. Doe with such a man what you will; cast him into hell if it were possible; hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a sweet communion
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15231:30"/>
with Christ would be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full even in that prison of the damned. And take this with you: the more sence you have of the love of Christ, the lesse you will regard the pleasures, the riches or contempts of the world. And indeed what joy can bee compared with this, that the soule hath communion with Christ? All the world is nothing to this.</p>
            <p>And now seeing you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not require this love of <note place="margin">Use. 3.</note> Christ, yet shew your love to him as you may, and as you may manifest your love to his members, and kisse them with the kisses of your love. Doe good to the poore; especially to those poore that have the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15231:31"/>
Church of God in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. As the woman powred her oyle on the head of Christ; so doe you powre some of yours upon the feete of Christ. That which yee would doe to him if hee were here, that doe to his members, in whom he is after a sort pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with you. Thereby you may further your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, and make him your debter; then, as one saith well: hee can be no loser, that makes God his debter.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Verse hath dependance on the second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Coherence.</note> before, the twelve and thirteen Verses of that Chapter; where the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15231:32"/>
Apostle tells the <hi>Colossians,</hi> that they were risen with Christ from the dead by Faith, and quickned by the Spirit that raised him: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followes this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; If therefore yee be risen with Christ, shew it by seeking after those things which are in heaven, or are heavenly.</p>
            <p>The Apostle had much adoe to roote out those dangerous seedes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which false teachers had sowen upon these <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians,</hi> touching some le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ceremonies; as touch not, taste not, handle not; he tells them that these dead things have no life of use now, and that therefore, if they be risen with Christ they must fall to other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15231:32"/>
seeking those things that are above. These ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were indeede appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God at the first, but now being ended and brought to their grave, they must be buried, there never to rise againe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more to be revived as being not dead onely, <note place="margin">Non solum mortuae sed mortifera.</note> but deadly.</p>
            <p>As I sayd, the Apostle finding their hearts tainted with this false doctrine, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first sought by purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to drive it out of their hearts and liking; he now begins to season them with that truth which is after godlinesse, that is, with heavenly and other truths and doctrines, not of men, such as were those of these false Apostles, but of God,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15231:33"/>
where hee begins with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall instructions, and then proceeds to particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; as of husbands and wives, of parents and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, of children and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van's. Now because the well managing of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular duties of these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular callings depends on a good principle; that is, that they bee sound in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which is the generall: Therefore hee begins first to season their hearts with that grace of their generall callings; knowing that it is so much the easier to bee good in their particular callings, when they are first good in the generall. But if not good in the generall, then never good in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. If a good man, then a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15231:33"/>
good husband, a good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a good master, fit for any good service; but if not a good man, then good for nothing. So a woman, if a good woman, then a good wife, and good in any cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. So for children and servants, if good in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, <note place="margin">Divis. 2. Parts.</note> then good in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular also.</p>
            <p>But to come to the order of these words: they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine first a ground, and then an inference upon that ground. <hi>If you be risen with</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct From the first part.</note> 
               <hi>Christ,</hi> there is the ground: <hi>then seeke the things that are above,</hi> there is the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. <note place="margin">1.</note> From the ground <note place="margin">2.</note> observe two things; First, that Christ is risen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; <note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> Secondly, that wee therefore shall rise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:15231:34"/>
For the first, It is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Faith, and the Holy Ghost hath taken a <note place="margin">F id<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ia Christiana,</note> great deale of paines to prove it. It is the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Christians; it is the maine, or free hold that <note place="margin">Tertullian deresurrect. cap. 1.</note> wee have; for wee hold all by the resurrection of Christ, as of fee; and wee have sixteene apparitions of him to prove this. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it was impossible that hee should bee held of the bonds of death. Impossible I say, being invested with these three offices of King, Priest and Prophet. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible as hee was King; for how then could hee have triumphed over his enemies here and in hell? Impossible as hee was Priest; for, if hee had not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15231:34"/>
risen, how could hee have made daily intercession for us as he doth? And lastly, impossible as he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, for else how could he have instructed his people in doctrines of salvation?</p>
            <p>But when rose hee? wee say with the Scriptures and <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> our Creede, the third day. Now as Christ rose, and rose the third day, (mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing thereby that he was dead) and this after so great basenesse, for his greater glory. So it is to teach us, that as it was with him; so it is with all his members: never nearer helpe then when at the worst; nor more glorious then when basest for Christ, for then it appeares to bee Gods owne worke, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15231:35"/>
will raise them to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he may be glorified in and by them.</p>
            <p>When therefore wee are in any distresse, voyd of the helpe of man, then God will come in and raise us up, whether in our credit, estate or persons, &amp;c. onely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us have patience for a while and waite his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
            <p>But <hi>as Christ is risen so</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> 
               <hi>we shall rise.</hi> Hee is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cause of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; hee hath deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that wee should rise. Also he is the worker of it; and by that same power whereby he rose againe; by the same will he raise up us at the last day. He is every way the cause of our rising, (and hereupon) we are risen
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15231:35"/>
with him: As hee was a publick person in his death; and as upon the Crosse hee stood in the place of all the elect; so as all their sinnes (committed, or foreseene to be committed) were layd upon him, and hee bare the iniquitie of us all: so after and now he freed himselfe and us by his Resurrection. First, he freed himselfe of his suretiship, our bond was taken up, and our debt payd; where justice lost not a penny by us. So wee were freed in him, and for him, and therefore he rising wee are to rise with him. for what should hold us in the grave, now that deaths bands are loosed, or shal the head be above water, and the members perish in it?
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:15231:36"/>
But further to speake of the Resurrection. This Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; spirituall and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: spirituall, when wee take life from Christ; and, (being quickned by him) begin to rise with him; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall when our bodies shall bee raised at the last day. When wee beleeve that Christ is dead for our sinnes; our sinnes are then in their grave, and Christ is then crucified to us: and when wee beleeve that hee (that was dead) is now ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from death, and dies no more: we beleeve that our graves also shall be opened, and that we shall rise (as he rose) to immortalitie of life.</p>
            <p>Hence every true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:15231:36"/>
may draw water of life to comfort him in all his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses. For Christ hath conquered all his spirituall enemies; and the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ is an evidence of his most certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of them all. For if he had not so conquered, hee could not have risen: and therefore when he rose the third day, hee bad his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples not to feare, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 10. as much as to say; feare not death, for I have overcome death with the power of my resurrection from death. Feare not sin, for I have satisfied for sin; nor the divell, for I by my resurrection have layd him flat upon his backe, bruised his head, and led him in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph openly. Feare not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15231:37"/>
this evill world; for I have overcome it. And what shall I say more? I have trod upon the neckes of all your spirituall enemies, I have conquered them all. So then, what cause of feare? therefore, feare not; for if you bee risen with Christ, you are begotten to a lively hope; where spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Resurrection is, there is hope of life, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth soundly reason, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. A ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of precious comfort to every true Christian.</p>
            <p>Now in that wee are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the same power to a <note place="margin">Use 2.</note> spirituall life, whereby Christ rose from the grave; it teacheth us how wee should conceive of the work of the new birth; also of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15231:37"/>
Image of God in us; and of the new creature. The worke of grace in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, is not a slight worke (a word and away, as many thinke) but it is a powerfull worke; as appeares in that there are so many hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances to keepe a man (dead in sinne) from rising out of it: many more then there were to keepe Christ from rising out of the grave of the earth. Yet in his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection did the power of God mightily appeare, as <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. 19, 20. Now as Christ was killed and had a stone rolled over his Tombe: So he, that is dead in sinne, hath the stone of long custome rolled upon his heart; which to remove requireth as great a worke
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15231:38"/>
of Gods power as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to raise Christ. Wherefore let those that finde a change in their hearts (the stone removed) breake forth into the praise of God for an inestimable favour such as this is, which is the powerfull worke of God, more powerfull then the making of the world of nothing; for there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny adversaries.</p>
            <p>For another use: Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this rightly, eyther to <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> provoke unto thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse if you have beene wrought upon; or to prayer if not; seeking unto God for this in the use of the meanes, who onely is able to work this change in you, and will in his good time.</p>
            <p>But to cut off many things
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15231:38"/>
that might here be spoken of; wee will (to bee short) now speak of the inference; <hi>If you be risen,</hi> and risen <hi>with Christ</hi> by his power, <hi>then seeke those things which are above.</hi> The inference or reason is thus much: they that are thus risen have a new life, (for every resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection notes a new kind of being) if spirituall then a spirituall being, if bodily <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> then a glorious life. This life is sutable to our Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; as if the Apostle had sayd, you are risen with Christ from the death of sinne, therefore manifest your Resurrection by the life of righteousnesse: more specially by actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable and cohaerent with your new estate. This
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15231:39"/>
is the meaning, from whence wee note this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That every life and state of life requireth answerable</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct. Generall.</note> 
               <hi>actions; If you be risen with Christ,</hi> and so have a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life as you professe to have, then carry your selves answerably, <hi>and seeke those things that are above;</hi> that is, such things as may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and are sutable to that life of yours. This is the Apostles manner of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this place. And this is so in nature, yea and so in corrupt nature; it is so in grace, and shall bee so in glory.</p>
            <p>For the first, it appeareth plainely; for even those creatures that are in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, delight in it, because it is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:15231:39"/>
their proper element, and they cannot live without it. Secondly, it is so in corrupt nature, he that is covetous, the very conceit that hee hath of his riches doth as it were feede him, he cannot live without them. So he that lives a carnall life here, dies if hee be taken from it; then hee is as a Fish upon dry ground. Take a Fish out <note place="margin">Tanquam picis in arido,</note> of his element, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live: So for this man, take his wealth and take his life; it is so in grace, and shall bee so in glory, when the body is risen glorious. There is a forsaking of all communion with sinfull men, and there wee shall have communion with God and Christ, and Christ shall be all in all unto us. Then <note place="margin">Col. 3. 11.</note>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:15231:40"/>
that which all creatures supply to us here, Christ will there. Then our songs will be holy, and our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons holy, fitting such a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious condition. And this heaven is begun here, or it will never be. Grace is therefore called heaven, because heaven is begunne where grace enters: and because glory, that is, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven cannot begin but where grace is.</p>
            <p>So then a Christian that is risen with Christ, must <note place="margin">Use 1.</note> have nothing to doe with carnall men; nothing I say further then he is thrust upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, or that he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them. They must not familiarly company with men of a contrary spirit; they must seeke by all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:15231:40"/>
meanes to act godlinesse in their conversation. And thus should the life of a Christian bee set, sutable to his new estate and holy calling.</p>
            <p>But if wee should try all <note place="margin">Use. 2.</note> by this rule: how few would be sound to be risen with Christ? for how few would delight in heavenly company, or in heavenly actions; as to praise God, or to commune with God in prayer? This is a death to most men, and to be so, is to bee out of the world; also to have such company, and to bee so exercised is a dead life in their fleshly opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>And now againe to the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Expl.</hi> 1. What is meant by seeking.</note> Apostle; the Apostle saith here, <hi>Wee must seeke those
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15231:41"/>
things which are above with Christ.</hi> Seeking implyeth first a want; a man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seeke for that which (he knowes) he hath. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <note place="margin">2.</note> it implyeth a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation and esteeme of the excellency of that thing which we seeke. Thirdly, it implyeth hope to get <note place="margin">3.</note> it; else who would seeke it, but leave it rather as a thing desperate? Fourthly, it <note place="margin">4.</note> doth imply meanes, and the use of meanes to attaine to that wee seeke through want or other wayes, with hope of finding it. Lastly, <note place="margin">5.</note> he that wants a thing which he doth highly esteeme, and may attaine unto in the use of the meanes; will by all meanes avoyd all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that may disappoint his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15231:41"/>
hope of speeding.</p>
            <p>And here consider what <note place="margin">2. What we must seeke.</note> this thing is that wee must seek for. Briefly &amp; in short, it is Christ Iesus the joy of all hearts; in whom are hid all the treasures of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wisedome. Him we seeke <hi>in capite,</hi> and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him all those things which are above, and whatsoever tends to true blessednesse. And indeede all the excellency which wee have, or can hope to have is from above. Our full happinesse and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inheritance is kept for us in the Heavens. All our priviledges are from above; our kingdome is in heaven; and qualification for this happy estate spoken of there. Our holinesse and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15231:42"/>
heavenly mindednesse is from above; fulnesse of grace is from thence, and all graces that lead to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection are there. Power to enable us to any holy duty is from above, yea the meanes are from above; as the ordinances, the word and Sacraments. To summe up all; thus much the words import, seeke for a nearer communion with Christ; for a further assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of heaven; for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther qualification for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and so as you may bee more and more in heaven while you are below on the earth, by enjoying through faith, your heavenly privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, prerogatives and excellencies: seeke for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increase of holinesse,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:15231:42"/>
for a greater measure of grace; and for grace to bring you to the fruition of whatsoever is from above. And here attend upon the Word of God, upon the Sacraments, upon holy conferences where Christ is present in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and by holy actions seeke for glory in the use of the meanes. Reach not too high, nor above your pitch, which is arrogancy, pride and high mindednesse; but seeke for heavenly things by heavenly meanes, and in humble manner.</p>
            <p>Againe, where wee must seeke the things above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee are risen with Christ, (the Resurrection of Christ being an article and ground of Religion;)
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15231:43"/>
wee learne, <hi>That heavenly duties have their spring from the articles and grounds of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason is; The ground of our faith is the cause of holy duties; and therefore corrupt in faith, corrupt in obedience in that degree. Evill opinions breed an evill life; and a sound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding an holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</p>
            <p>The use is to admonish us to labour to understand the <note place="margin">Vse.</note> maine grounds of Religion, with like labour, to digest them: So as to see the truth of them in the regularitie of our lives. And here labour with God by prayer to write them in your hearts with the pen of his holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:15231:43"/>
Againe, in that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle willeth them to seeke heavenly graces, and that because they are risen with Christ; note further this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That as a Christian ought</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> 
               <hi>to be heavenly minded,</hi> that is, minded to seeke heaven ly graces; so hee must doe it for this reason, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee is in an estate fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for it.</p>
            <p>Therefore let none say, <note place="margin">Vse</note> he cannot for outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or businesse; unlesse he will deny himselfe to be a Christian, by denying to have any leasure for holy businesse. He that will bee a Christian must pretend to no impossibilities this way. For, art thou risen with Christ? then thou must finde
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15231:44"/>
time to seeke those things that are above, and to bee heavenly minded. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian that is risen with Christ will; God here doth not as <hi>Pharoah;</hi> bid us to doe our worke, and to gather the straw our selves: but he bids us doe upon a power given us, and by quickning us with his Spirit, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling us to doe what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to be done. He fits us for such actions as hee taskes us unto, and gives us the power of doeing them.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>so farre as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> 
               <hi>is raised by Christ, so farre hee cannot but seeke those things that are above.</hi> Wee neede not teach a bird to fly, for shee is taught of her nature so to doe; flight
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15231:44"/>
is naturall to her. So a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian cannot but doe the things answerable to his Christian nature. Hee is of a new nature, and therefore cannot but bee heavenly minded; hee cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Lords day, hee cannot sweare, hee cannot lye, hee cannot blaspheme, he cannot delight in carnall courses, he cannot doe these things, so farre as hee is a Christian. And it is in this sense that the Apostle saith, <hi>He that is borne of God sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 9.</note> 
               <hi>not,</hi> that is, so farre as he is borne againe.</p>
            <p>Againe, as hee is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hee may doe it, and ought to doe it, and cannot but doe it.</p>
            <p>But I adde further, and for a further point, <hi>Hee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:15231:45"/>
in it.</hi> To bee heavenly minded, and exercised in spirituall duties, is his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, and his joy. Hee is never so well, never so much himselfe, as when he is most possessed of a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mindednesse, &amp; most frequent, or not often exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in spirituall duties: so farre forth as hee is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and enlarged by the Spirit of Christ, so far forth he glories in holy actions &amp; in heavenly mindednesse.</p>
            <p>Is this in all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if such? what then may <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> we thinke of the most part of the world, that professe religion but from the teeth outward? Surely they are still in the grave of old na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are not risen with Christ. Such is the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:15231:45"/>
man, the covetous man, the voluptuous man, for they savour not the things that are above, the truth is, they have no new nature in them: for if they had, it would lead them higher then these under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot things, or things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. They that live in the defilements of the flesh, shew too well that they have none of this new mould in them; for if they had, they would get strength against them; at least they would have a continuall conflict, and wrastling in themselves to overcome them.</p>
            <p>Another use may bee for tryall of thy estate; and here see what power there is of the Spirit of God in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15231:46"/>
thee to make thee heavenly minded, to joy in things hat are above, more then in all the world againe. If thou finde this power in thee, then thou art a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian indeede; thou canst then speake by experience, what is the worke of the Spirit, and thou knowest well what is the vertue of the Resurrection of Christ. Then thou canst say with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that thou art still striving to finde the vertue of Christ more and more in <note place="margin">Psal. 3. 9. 10.</note> thee, to make thy selfe more fully assured of thy part in Christ, and to finde the power of his Spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering the power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in thee in an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent degree. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour for this power;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15231:46"/>
for this is to <hi>seeke the things that are above;</hi> and here let us labour to finde the want of it, and to greeve that wee have not so much of it as we have neede of. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let us labour to know the excellency of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, esteeming more of it then of any power else, and better then of all powers of darkenesse in this flattering world, for when all other things leave us; the things above will comfort us, and (for our comfort) goe with us. Let us therefore labour to see some hope of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them. Thou hast a promise (using the meanes) to attaine unto them; for the same Spirit is set over by assurance unto thee that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up Christ from the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15231:47"/>
dead: use therefore all san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified meanes for the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of these spirituall good things, use heavenly wayes for thy way to heavenly things: attend upon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God: labour with him in prayer to make thee such a one as hee may delight in, and fit thee for that estate that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for thee. Labour to encrease in vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fly all contrary courses; as worldly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dednesse, and the pleasures of this present world. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that none of these draw away thy heart, and with it, thy selfe from an earnest seeking of heavenly things, (so) as thou shouldst. We are all seekers, wee are a generation of seekers, as
<pb facs="tcp:15231:47"/>
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith; We seeke <note place="margin">Psal. 2 4.</note> while wee are here, our possession is hereafter.</p>
            <p>Labour therefore to see the want of heavenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to esteeme of them aright, and to see hope to attaine them, and hope to attaine them, and use the meanes, and avoid all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courses. Doing thus you shall finde the vertue of Christs Resurrection rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing you up more and more to seeke after heaven and heavenly things, even <hi>those things that are above.</hi>
