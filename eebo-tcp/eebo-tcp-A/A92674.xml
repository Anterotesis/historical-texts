         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt the throng of perſons that crowd to tell their Grievances, and to beg your relief, as an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> I cannot be unconcern'd, nor you in Juſtice refuſe to hear me: I do not intend to trouble you with a long ſeries of the unhappy War, your own Experience in that is able to inform you; but onely to give you ſome little accompt faithfully of what hath happen'd ſince <hi>Lambert</hi>'s laſt Interrupting that which ſo daringly aſſumes the Name of a PARLIAMENT, with more Impudence than Juſtice, with more Madneſs than Merit: When <hi>Lambert</hi> had by violence forc'd the Members from ſitting in the Houſe, and as indiſcreetly left them at liberty, you were then the onely perſon who might viſibly reſtore them, then they look'd upon you as their Redeemer, which you really were. Having now once more by your favour gras'pd a power which they believ'd they ſhould not out-live, to ſecure themſelves as well from you as others, they commanded you up, and under a pretence of taking you into an Adminiſtration of Affairs with them, in ſtead of a <hi>General</hi> which you were in the <hi>North,</hi> and his <hi>Excellency,</hi> they made you a ſingle <hi>Commiſſioner,</hi> the laſt of foure; and leſt that number, whereof three were a <hi>Quorum,</hi> ſhould not ballance you, they added another; ſo that you muſt be over-awed in Vote, and ſubmit to thoſe who never yet durſt openly make you their Enemy, and are unfit to be your Friends. When they ſaw (with Eyes full of Malice and Jealouſie) how your whole March was but one entire Triumph, and that all perſons, of all Conditions, Ages, and Sexes, met you, either to unboſome themſelves and tell their Miſeries, and pray your Help; or, give you the Acclamations due to a Blood-leſs Victory; they now thought you too great and too good to live, and were preparing your Herſe and Cypreſs, while you brought them the Olive-branch of Peace: Firſt, to try you, they offered you an Oath, which I think no ſober conſcientious perſon will take, it being in effect but to bind up the Hand of Providence, and to ſet ones Face againſt that Power, which (for ought we know) may intend us for our good, or puniſhment, what we ſo much fear; and to either we ought quietly to ſubmit. This not taking, they endevoured, firſt to render you odious, that they might more eaſily deſtroy you, and ſend you unpityed to your grave and ſcorn'd, robbing you firſt of that which ſhould have ſweetly preſerv'd your name to Poſterity, your Honour: To effect this, they commanded you to go with your Army into the City, and there to Impriſon their Members, Break down their Gates, Port-culliſes, Chains and Poſts, and whatſoever look'd like a Fence for that Freedome hath ſo long been theirs; what an angry and ſad Face you ſaw the City wear for that action, you know: Nor would their Malice to your Fame have ended here, for you were to aſſiſt at the horrid murthering of ſome Citizens and Common-council Men, whom they intended to hang at their own dores, in terror to the reſt; when this was done, you were to diſarm them, and to level their Walls to the ground, and to have found in their Ruines your own: For, when by theſe accurſed actions they had fix'd an Odium upon you, then were you to fall a ſacrifice to their Ambition, whom nothing can ſatisfie but the Tyranny over three Nations at once, and from a Deliverer become a Victim: Your prudence wiſely foreſaw this, and finding how odious they endevoured to make you, and how cloſely they had contriv'd your ruine, you put a ſtop to their horrid Deſignes, and by countenancing the City in their Equitable Deſires, have rais'd in all ſuch an admiration, and for your ſelf ſo great a ſtock of glory, as you cannot, but by ſome ſtrange act of Indiſcretion, forfeit or loſe; you cannot but take notice to what a ſtrange height of Joy that good action rais'd every ſober perſon, and if you wanted Inclinations in your own Soul to do us good, you might be lighted to them by thoſe Fires which were kindled for your Triumph that Night, and would (had you gone on) in all probability, have prov'd your Funeral Pile, few days after. You have fairly began our Deliverance, leave it not here, for your Safety and our Good are ſo link'd together and alli'd, that neither can fall ſingly: You have by an act of Honour and Juſtice exaſperated a Party againſt you, whoſe Principles are damnable, whoſe Spirits are implacable; by the one they pretend and believe, by a ſtrange kind of Saintſhip, a Title to all our Lives and Fortunes, and that they were by Grace born our Heirs; by the other they have in them ſo great a thirſt after Revenge, like <hi>Italians,</hi> they kill with a ſmile; and however they may for Safety ſeem Friends, are never to be atton'd; How hardly they forget and pardon Injuries, the late <hi>Northern</hi> Expedition will manifeſt; for when the Officers of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army by an early defection and ſubmiſſion thought to preſerve their places, though the firſt did their buſineſs without a blow ſtrook, yet not one of forty was continued in his Command; and if they urge their Mercy to <hi>Lambert,</hi> 'tis not their Clemency but Neceſſity, hoping by his Intereſt among the <hi>Fanatiques,</hi> to ballance, or countermand and check your Power: Nor is there any thing ſo Sacred that can bind them, they having violated all Covenants and Oaths, and it is to be beleiv'd, preſs others to do the like, that they may make others as hateful and abominable as themſelves; in this imitating their Maſter the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is watchful and induſtrious for our damnation, for envy and company: Beſides, <hi>my Lord,</hi> you have provok'd them, by fixing upon them a Character in your <hi>Speech,</hi> which the whole Body of our Language cannot equal, and they can never forgive or forget, for it will live as long as the name of <hi>RUMP,</hi> that ſpawn'd them. Having thus deſervedly made them your Enemies, it is too late to make them your Friends, nor can they expect it; and unleſs you will be ſo imprudent as to caſt off the love and protection of all ſober perſons, and betake your ſelf to a villanous, accurſed, hated, deformed Monſter of Confuſion, which your ſelf have condemned and branded with an eternal mark of Infamy, you cannot own or act with them, or for them: You gave them a fair time to perform your juſt Deſires, which they have ſlighted, and forfeited your protection; if you ſtand by them any longer, you put your hand to your owne deſtruction, to farther it; and your Delay, which is all they ask, is but the <hi>Baſis</hi> of your ruine; you may ſee by their favourable cenſure of <hi>Lambert</hi> what they intend; and you know who were laſt Week in conſultation, and what Party he was to head: Your Ignorance cannot, your Courage will not, Let not your Irreſolution deſtroy you and the three Nations; on you depends their hopes, fruſtrate them not, leſt you fall with them, and ſuffer not this Inſulting Dragons Taile of Tyranny to oppreſs us longer; you have a glorious opportunity put by Providence into your hands to make your ſelf Great and Safe, Beloved of Good men, and Terrible to the Bad, loſe it not by Delaying; that (when your Name is read in the number of thoſe Deliverers whom Fame and Truth have faithfully committed to Poſterity) you may be remembred with Joy and Honour in after Generations: But, if on the contrary, your patient but dangerous expecting from theſe Tyrants a Settlement, make you loſe the Glory of ſo brave an Action, you will aſſuredly fall with our Hopes, unpityed, accurſed, and with your own, conclude the three Nations Tragoedy.</p>
