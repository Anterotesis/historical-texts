            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But now that you your selves have taken the paines to write, this is out of all cry. Why it passes to thinke what loving and carefull Brethren I have, who although I cannot be gotten, to tell them where I am, because I love not the ayre of the Clinke or Gatehouse in this cold time of Winter, and by reason of my businesse in Pistle-making, will not. withstanding make it known vnto the world, that they have a moneths mind towards me, now truly brethren. I find you kind, why ye doe not know what a pleasure you have done me. My worships bookes were vnknowne to many, before you allowed <hi>T. C.</hi> to admonish the people of <hi>England</hi> to take heed, that if they loved you, they would make much of their <hi>Prelates,</hi> and the chiefe of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. Now many seeke after my bookes, more then ever they did. Againe, some knew not that our brother <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Fulham,</hi> was so good vnto the porter of his gate, as to make the poore blind honest soule, to be a dum Minister. Many did not know, either that Amen, is as much as by my faith, and so that our Saviour Christ ever sware by his faith, or that bowling and eating of the Sabboth, are

            <p>The <hi>Puritans</hi> indeed hold it vnlawfull for a Minister to have such temporall revenewes, as whereby 10 mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters might be well maintained, vnlesse the said revenews come vnto him by inheritance.</p>
            <p>They hold it also vnlawfull, for any state to bestowe the livings of many ministers vpon one alone, especially when there is such want of Ministers livings.</p>
            <p>They hold it vnlawfull for any minister to be Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his brethren, and they hold it vnlawfull for any state to tolerate such vnder their government, because it is vnlawfull for states, to tolerate men in those places whereinto the word hath forbidden them to enter.</p>
            <p>They affirme that our Saviour Christ hath forbidden all ministers to be Lords, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Peter,</hi> sheweth them to be none of Gods Ministers, which are Lords over Gods heritage, as you Bishops are, and would be accounted. These things <hi>T.

            <p>A true man bringeth vnanswerable witnesses against a robber by the high way side, and desireth the Judge, that the law may proceed against him, Oh no my Lord saith the thiefe, in any case let not me be dealt with. For these mine accusers have given out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you are a drunkard or they have committed Treason against the state, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you beleeve my slander against them, that they may be executed, so when I come to my tryall, I shall be sure to have no accusers. A very pretty way to escape, if a man could tell how to bring the matter about. Now brethren Bishops, your manner of dealing is even the very same. The puritans say truly, that all Lord Bishops are petty Antichrists, and therefore that the Magistrates ought to thrust you out of the common-wealth. Now of all loves say the Bishops, let not our places bee called in question, but rather credit our slanders against the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, whereby, if men would beleeve vs when wee lye,
<pb facs="tcp:63993:6"/>
we would beare the world in hand, that these our accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers are Malecontents and sottish men, holding it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for the Magistrate to allot any lands for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters portion, and unlawfull for the Minister to provide for his family. And therefore you must not give eare to the accusations of any such men against us. And so wee shall be sure to be acquitted. But brethren doe you thinke to be thus cleared?

indeed my masters. And I tould you <hi>T. C.</hi> that you should be thumped for defending Bishops. Take heed of me while you live. The minor of my last syllogisme, that whosoever doth abolish the Office of any lawfull Church Officer out of the church, he either maimeth or deformeth the church, I can prove with a wet finger. <hi>Because every lawfull Church Officer, even by reason of his Office, is a member of the body of Christ Iesus, which is the church, and being a member of the body,</hi> if the Magistrate doth displace him by abolishing his Office, and leaveth the place thereof voide, then the Magistrate maimeth the body, if hee put another Office vnto an Officer in stead thereof, he deformeth the same. <hi>Because the Magistrate hath neither the skill nor the commission, to make the members of the body of Christ. Because hee cannot tell to what vse, the members of his making may serve in the Church.</hi> Doe you thinke <hi>T. C.</hi> that the Magistrate may make an eye for the visible body of the Church? (For you must vnderstand, that we all this while speake of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible body) can he make a foot or a hand for that body? <hi>I pray you in what place of the body would you have them placed? If our Saviour Christ hath left behind him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect body: surely he hath left therein no place, or no vse for members of the Magistrates making and invention: if an vnperfect and maimed body.</hi> I am well assured that the magistrate is not able to perfect that which he left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finished. But I hope <hi>T. C.</hi> that thou wilt not be so mad, and wicked, as to say, that our Saviour Christ, left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him heere on earth an vnperfect and maimed body. If not, then where shall these offices, namely these mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers invented by the Magistrate be placed therein.?</p>
               <p>Would you have the naturall eyes put out (as your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the bishops have done in the church of <hi>England,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer since <hi>Iohn</hi> of Canterbury vrged his wretched sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription) and vnnaturall squint gogled eyes put in their

What say you <hi>T. C.</hi> may the Magistrate cut off the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall legges, and hands of the body of Christ, under a pretence to put woodden in their stead? I hope you will not say that he may. How then commeth it to passe <hi>T.

                     </gap>elmes</hi> to be true and naturall members of the body, that is true officers of the Church, and yet hold it lawfull for his Majesty to displace them out of the church. J cannot tell brother what you hold in this point. Me think J have disturbed your sences. Doe you thinke that the magistrate may displace the true members of the body of Christ, and place woodden in their stead. Why this is to hold it lawfull for the Magistrate to massacre the body. Doe you thinke he may not? Then may not his Maiesty displace <hi>Iohn</hi> of Canterburies office out of our church: if hee may not displace his office, then either he by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his office, is a lawfull Pope aboue all civill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, or else the Church government is so prescribed in the word, as it is not lawfull for the magistrate to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same. But <hi>Iohn</hi> of Canterbury, as the Puritans themselves confesse, is no Pope. Then either the church government is so prescribed in the word as it may not be altred, or else the maiestrate may abolish a lawfull church government, and place another in stead thereof. If the Church government be so prescribed in the word, as it cannot be altered then either our government is the same. which was therein prescribed, or our Church government is a false Church government. If ours be the same which is mentioned in the word: Then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were either no true Church governours, or else <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and the rest of Church governours in their time were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63993:10"/>
Lords, for all our Church governours are Lords. But <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. were no Lords, and yet true church governours. Therefore our church government is not that which is prescribed in the word, and therefore a false and vnlawfull church government. If you thinke that the Magistrate may displace the lawfull Offices of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then as I said before, you hold it lawfull for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate to maime or deforme the body. <hi>Because what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hee putteth in the roome of the true and right mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, must needs be a deformitie, and what place soever he leaveth vnfurnished of a member, must needes bee a maime.</hi> And this is the onely and sole office of Christ onely, to place and displace the members of his body: to wit, the Officers of his Church, he may lawfully doe it, so cannot man. And therefore the sots (of which number you <hi>T. C.</hi> and you <hi>Iohn Whitgift,</hi> and you <hi>Deane Iohn,</hi> and you <hi>D, Coosins,</hi> and you <hi>D. Copcot</hi> with the rest of the ignorant and wretched defenders of our corrupt Church government are to be accounted) which thinke that the Offices of Pastors, Doctors, Elders and Deacons, or the most of them, may be aswell now wanting in the Church, as the Offices of Apostles, Prophets and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists: doe notably bewray their vile ignorance, but the cause they doe not hurt. For the beasts doe not consider that the Offices of Apostles, Evangelists and Prophets, were removed out of the church, not by man, but by the Lord, because he in his wisdome did not see any vse of<note place="margin">The Apostles chose men in stead of Iames being beheaded as they did in stead of Iudas, Act. 1. which they would have done if the Apo stolicall calling had beene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.</note> such members in his body, after the time of the first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Church. I say they were removed by the Lord himselfe and not by man: because, partly the gifts wherewith they were endued, partly the largenesse of their commission, with certaine other essentiall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to them belonging, were by him abrogated and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, which no man could doe, againe, the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, Evangelicall and Propheticall callings, were either
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63993:11"/>
lawfully or vnlawfully abolished out of the Church, if lawfully, then they were abolished by the Lord: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are neither to be called backe vntill he sheweth it to be his pleasure that it should be so, neither can the church be truly said to be maimed for want of them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he which could best tell, what members were fit for his Church did abolish them. If vnlawfully, then those callings may bee lawfully called backe againe into the Church, and the Church without them is maimed, that is, wanteth some members. For if their callings were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously abrogated, they are as iniuriously kept out of the Church, and being members of the church, the church is maimed without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnlesse the Lord hath shewed, that the time of their service in the body is expired. But they are not injuriously kept out (for so his Maiestie should be said to injury the Church, vnlesse hee would see Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, prophets and Evangelists planted therein) neither can the church be said to bee maimed for want of them, because the Lord by taking them away hath declared, that now there can be no vse of them in the body; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord abrogated them. <hi>Therefore also they may be wanting, and the Church neither maimed nor deformed thereby.</hi> Whereas the keeping out of either of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer offices of Pastors, Doctors, elders and Deacons, is a maiming of the Church, the placing of others in their stead, a deforming. Now reverend <hi>T. C.</hi> I beseech you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat mistresse <hi>Cooper,</hi> to write to <hi>M, D. Day,</hi> sometimes of <hi>Magdalins,</hi> that he may procure <hi>D.

The most part of men could not be gotten to read any thing, written in the defence of the one, and against the other, I bethought me therefore of a way whereby men might be drawne to doe both, perceiving the humours of men in these times (especially of those that are in any place) to be given to mirth, I tooke that course, I might lawfully doe it, I, For jesting is lawfull by circumstances, even in the greatest matters. The circumstances of time, place and persons vrged me therevnto, I never profaned the word in any jest.

The <hi>love of a Christian Church, Prince and State, shall I trust, worke more in me, then the love of a Heathen Empire and State should doe.</hi> Now judge good Reader, who is more tolerable in a Common-wealth, <hi>Martin</hi> that would have the enemies of his Majesty removed thence, or our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops which would have his life, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes prosperity hazarded, rather then a few <hi>Civilians</hi> should want maintenance. But I pray thee tell me <hi>T. C;</hi> why should the government of Christ impoverish <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians?</hi> Because (saith he) page 77. the Canon law by which they live, must be altered, if that were admitted. Yea but <hi>Civilians live by the Court of Amralty, and other courts as well as by the Arches, viz.</hi> Also the Probats of Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the controversies of Tythes, Matrimony, and many
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63993:18"/>
other causes, which you Bishops Mar-state, do usurpingly take from the Civill Magistrate, would be a meanes of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians</hi> maintenance. But are not you ashamed to professe your whole government, to be a government ruled by the Popes Canon Lawes, which are banished by statute out of this Kingdome? <hi>This notably sheweth that pou are Mar-prince and Mar-state.</hi> For how dare you retaine these Lawes, unlesse by vertue of them, you meane either to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the supremacy of the Prince to goe again to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to come to <hi>Lambeth.</hi> It is treason by statute, fot any subject in this Land to proceed Doctor of the Canon law, and dare you professe your Church government to bee ruled by that law. As though one statute might not referre all matters of the Canon law, unto the temporall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of this Realme: and is this all you can say <hi>T. C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Yes saith he, the government of Christ would bring in the judiciall law of <hi>Moses.</hi> As much as is morall of that law, or of the equity of it would be brought in. And doe you again say it. But you sodden headed Asse you, the most part of that law is abrogated. Some part thereof is in force among us, as the punishment of a Murtherer by death, and presumptuous obstinate Theft by death, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. His Majesties prerogative in Ecclesiasticall causes, should not be a whit diminished; but rather greatly strengthened by Christs government. And no law should be altered, but such as were contrary to the Law of God, and against the profit of the Common wealth: and therefore there can be no danger in altering these.</p>
               <p>4 The Ministers maintenance by Tythe, <hi>no Puritane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth to be vnlawfull.</hi> For <hi>Martin</hi> (good Mr. <hi>Parson</hi> you must understand) doth account no <hi>Brownist</hi> to be a <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> nor yet a sottish Cooperist.</p>
               <p>5. The inconvenience which you shew of the government which is, that men would not be ruled by it, is answered afore. And I pray you, why should not they be better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient

unto Gods Law, if the same also were established by the law of the Land, then to the Popes Law and his Canons. You thinke that all men are like your selves: that is like Bishops, such as cannot choose but break the Lawes and good orders of God and his Majesty.</p>
               <p>7 The lawes of <hi>England</hi> have beene made, when there was never a Bishop in the Parliament, as in the first yeare of Qeen <hi>Eliz.</hi> And this reason as all thu rest, may serve to maintaine Popery, as well as the hierarchy of Bishops.</p>
               <p>8 The government of the Church of Christ, is no popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar government, but it is Monarchicall, in regard of our head Christ, Aristocraticall in the Eldership, and Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall in the people. Such is the civill government of our Kingdome: Monarchicall in his Majesties person: Aristocraticall in the higher house of Parliament, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Counsell Table: Democraticall in the body of the Commons of the Lower house of Parliament. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore profane <hi>T. C.</hi> this government seeketh no popularity to be brought into the Church, much lesse intendeth the alteration of the Civill state, that is but your slander, of vvhich you make an occupation, And I will surely pay you for it. I must be briefe now, but more worke for <hi>Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per shall examine your standers.</hi> They are nothing else but proofes, that as, by your owne Confessions, you are Bishops of the Divell, so you are enemies unto the state. <hi>For by these slanders, you goe about to blind our State, that they may never see a perfect Regiment of the Church in our dayes.</hi> I say that by your owne Confession, you are Bishops of the Divell. I will prove it thus: You confesse that your Lordly government, were not lawfull and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this Common vvealth, if his Majesty and the state of the Land did disclaime the same. Tell me, doe you not confesse this, deny it if you dare. For will you say, that you ought lawfully to be here in our Common wealth, whither his Majesty and the Counsell will or no. Is this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63993:19"/>
the thankes that his Majesty shall have, for tolerating you in his Kingdome all this while, that now you will say, <hi>that you and your places stand not in this Kingdome by his courtesie, but you have as good right vnto your places, as he hath vnto his Kingdome.</hi> And by this meanes your Offices stand not by his good liking, and the good liking of the state<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as doe the Offices of our Lord <hi>high Chancellor, high Treasurer, and high Steward of England.</hi> But your Offices ought to stand and to bee in force in spight of his Majesty, the Parliament, Counsell, and every man else, unlesse they would doe you injury. So that I know, J, you dare not deny but that your Offices were unlawfull in our Common-wealth, if his Majesty, the Parliament, and the Counsell would have them abolished. If you grant this, then you doe not hold your Offices as from God, but as from man. His Majesty hee holdeth his Office, and his Kingdome, as from GOD, and is beholding for the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto no Prince not State under Heaven. Your case is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, for you hold your Offices as from his Majesty, and not from God. For otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you needed not to bee any more beholding unto his Majesty for the same in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of right, then hee is bound to bee beholding unto other states in regard of his right: <hi>and so you in regard of your Lordly superiority, are not the Bishops of God, but as Ierom saith, the Bishops of man.</hi> And this the most of you confesse to be true, and you see how dangerous it would be for you, to affirme the contrary, namely, that you hold your Offices as from God. Well Sir, if you say that you are the Bishops of man. Then tell mee whether you like of <hi>Deane Iohn</hi> his Booke.</p>
