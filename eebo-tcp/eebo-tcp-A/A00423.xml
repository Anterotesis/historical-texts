            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the time of the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the firſt, there was in his countrey a Couent of Friers, highly renowned <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apo. Ste. Fol.</hi> 337.</note> for the opinion that euery one had in their holy profeſſion. Néere vnto which Abbey there dwelled a Gentleman of great worſhip and credite, who fauoured theſe Friers, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h a ſeruent zeale of deuotion, and was a ſpeciall benefactor vnto them Among which companie, he choſe to himſelfe a confeſſor, to whom he gaue full power and authoritie ouer his houſe and houſholde. This lecherous lubber became ſo enamored on the Gentlewoman, as (reſolued to put his luſt in execution,) comming to hir houſe, and finding not hir huſbande at home, he demaunded of hir whether hir huſbande was gone, ſhée anſweared, to a Farme that hée had, where he ment to make his abode for thrée or foure dayes, but if hée had anye ſpeciall matter to doe wyth hym, ſhée woulde preſently ſende a Meſſenger for hym:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1877:13"/>
wherevpon he taking occaſion to performe his damnable pretence, walked vp and downe about the houſe, as one y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> had ſome matter of importance, or ſome greate miſchiefe hammering in his head. The gentlewoman perceyuing it (for that his countenance argued, he was not content) ſhe ſent one of hir maydes to know, if any of hyr houſe had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, or that he lacked his deſire in any thing. This mayde doyng hir miſtreſſe meſſage, the Fatherly Frier, or rather Helliſh fiende, toke hir (in ſigne of curteſie) by the hande, and leading hir aſide into a corner of the Court, he cut hir throate. In the meane while there arriued a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt of the gentlemans that brought him rent, who hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſaluted the Frier, &amp; he embraſing him (with the ſame knife he had murdered the mayde, which was ſkant cold of hir bloude) he likewiſe cut his throate, and after cloſed the Caſtel gate vnto him.

Then when he ſaw himſelfe alone in the houſe, he came to the gentlewoman, and deliuered hir the effect of his diuelliſh deſire: ſhewing how long he had earneſtly loued hir, &amp; that now the houre was come, that ſhe muſte néedes yéelde vnto his will. She that neuer had any euil opinion in him, and leaſt loked for any ſuch ſalutation, anſwered, my good Father, I beléeue if you knew me to be ſo euil diſpoſed, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you thought I had ſo bad a conceite in me, you would be the firſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reclaime me, or diſcouer my ſhame for it. The Frier (to cut of al circumſtaunces, and to preuent that might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) flatly perſwaded hir, there was no remedie: willyng hir to go into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court, where ſhe ſhoulde ſée the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hys pretence. When the gentlewoman beheld hir two maids and hir tenaunt lying in that pitiful caſe, ſhe was ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed and ouerſet with feare, as ſhe remayned ſpéechleſſe. This villaine (who made no account to enioy hir compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1877:14"/>
for one time, but to haue the abuſe of hir body for euer) woulde not force hir, and therfore ſayde: Miſtreſſe be ruled by me, and doubt of no daunger, for you are in the handes of him, that loues you aboue al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men in the world: and ſo taking forth the gowne of a Nouice (which he had brought with him for the ſame purpoſe vnder his lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g robe) he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hir to put it on, otherwiſe ſhe ſhold paſſe the ſame paine thoſe had done, which lay before hir eyes. The gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſéeing hir owne peril (as well to ſaue hir life, as to gaine time, in hope that hir huſbande woulde come to hyr reſcue) ſhe fayned willingly to obey him: and at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Frier, vntyred hir heade, wherein ſhe vſed as much delay as ſhe might. But in the end, when ſhe was in hir haire, the Frier (not regarding the beauty of it) did haſtily cut it off, and further cauſed hir to ſtrip hir ſelfe to hir ſmocke, and to put on the little frock he brought with him: whych done he made al the haſte away that he could, carrying wyth hym his heauye and ſorrowfull Nouice, whoſe companye he had (in beaſtlye luſt) ſo long deſired. But it pleaſed God, that hyr huſbande, (who had diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched hys buſineſſe ſooner than he ſuppoſed he ſhoulde before his going) returned home by the ſame waye, that hys diſtreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherevnto the Gentleman agréed, and ſtayed to heare what newes his man would bring him. The Fryer looking back, and hearing hym call <hi>Frater Iohn,</hi> doubted leaſte he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered hys Miſtreſſe: and therefore with a long armed batte (a common weapon for thoſe mates to martch wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h) hée ſo reached at the fellowe, as he felled him off his horſe, and ſtraighte leaping vppon hym cutte hys throte: hys maiſter, who ſawe a farre off hys man ouerthrowne, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed hée hadde fallen by ſome miſchaunce, and therfore haſted to helpe him vppe againe. But when he came nere to thys deſperate and ſturdie Frier, with the ſame bleſſing that he vnhorſed the man, he vnhorſed the maiſter, and caſt himſelfe vpon him, with al the violence he might: and if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had not bin both bolde &amp; ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Frier had there ended the Tragedie. But by his ſtrength, he helde him ſo harde in hys armes, as he coulde doe him no more hurte:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1877:15"/>
And withall forced him to forgo the knife wherewith hée had performed all this miſchiefe, which his wife ſéeing it fall from him, toke it vp, and put it into the hande of hyr huſbande. The caſe béeing altered, the gentlewomans courage encreaſed: for in the moſte furious manner that ſhe myghte, ſhe beſtyrred hyr to plague hym, that hadde ſo muche puniſhed hyr: And in the meane tyme the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo ſtabbed in the Frier, as he was fayne to yéelde, &amp; confeſſed the trueth of hys faulte.

            <p>Was it not a pitiful condition, that the pore members of Chriſte dwelled in, when they were as faine (and with as muche feare) to hide themſelues in caues, corners, and other deſolate places, for reading of the Bible and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Teſtament: as thoſe that carryed counterfaite money, or committed a worſer crime.

Alleadging this example, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Eneas Siluius</hi> ſometime Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 2. whiche hée tooke out of the Legend of <hi>Saint Benet,</hi> and the hiſtorie is thus: <hi>Saint Benet</hi> trauailed to a Couent of Monkes,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1877:34"/>
where he founde a heape of vncleane Spirites com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batting with the holy Fathers of that place: and all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue them from theyr good workes. Sainte <hi>Benet</hi> at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time returning to the Abbey, found an euil ſpirite ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting idlely wagging his legges, and beating his héeles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyther with cold: whom he coniured to ſhew him the cauſe of hys idleneſſe: he aunſweared, we are to make wars wyth Cloyſtermen and ſuch as be the ſeruauntes of God, and not againſt thoſe whoſe dreames, trumperies, and blaſphemies do already ſerue the Diuel.</p>
            <p>This was well applyed, if Sainte <hi>Benet</hi> had bene by to haue paraphraſed further vppon it: for none wil deny but that the ſuttletie of the Diuil is ſuche, as he ſéeketh to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe hys kyngdome by all the meanes he may: and howe can hys glorie be greater, than to kéepe that carefully which he hath gotten cunningly: And alſo it is a general rule, that a conqueror doth triumph in nothyng more than in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in due obedience, thoſe that are become his vaſſals, which muſt be by the preſence of him ſelfe, or by his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt miniſters. And ſeing the Diuel wanteth no experience, hauing as much foreſight as ſo proude a Spirite may haue if we be ſo aſſuredly hys owne as that Papiſt would make vs, he woulde not be from vs in perſon as a friend to fauor vs, or in power as a iealious foe to loſe vs, conſidering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy league (ſo termed) by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of ſo mightie Papiſts, haue promiſed to make vs reuolt (if it be as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> petie Papiſt ſayeth) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. But, as it is only natural reaſon that thoſe groſſe creatures of the Popes deſire to be ſatiſfied by, ſo in reaſon they know it is as much wiſedome &amp; policie to kéep, as it is prayſe &amp; glorie to get, whiche in my opinion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> féend would foreſée as a principle, if he held vs ſo dear, as this his darling (winning y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gole, in his own conceyt, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one ſtroke) alleageth he doth: &amp; therfore it is to be beléeued, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diuel wil not dwel but where he hath ſome intereſt, and may be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is moſt true, the Pope his beſt beloued, as he cannot forbear him, ſo he dare not ſpare him ſo far of,

ſéeing Gods warriours are comming with a rolling crench towards him. And as in al martial marches, there are euer ſome ſtraglers, who care neither for Country, Captain, nor cauſe, but follow only to pray vpon the ſpoyle of others: ſo the Papiſtes of preſent time, that ſéeme to muſter vnder the banner of true Chriſtians (vexed with the frenſie of theſe forlorne ſpirites in the image of Engliſhmen) come rogyng and ſtragling among vs, (as a newe founde <hi>Ieſuite</hi> of late did) who couet nothing more than the ruine of theyr Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that they mighte (with the Diuell theyr Maiſter) haue a part in the bloudye bootie.

We reade likewiſe of many other Saints that had a ſpeciall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie to be conuerſant &amp; to deuiſe with beaſtes, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that the fraternitie and felowſhip of Wolues, was onely peculiar to <hi>Saint Frauncis.</hi> Is it not a mockerie to reade, that <hi>Saint Macaire</hi> did 7. yeres penance among thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; bryars, for killing of a flea?

            <p>When <hi>Nicodemus</hi> tooke our ſauiour Chriſte from the Croſſe, he ſaued ſo muche of hys bloude as filled one of the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fol.</hi> 612.</note> fingers of his gloue: with the whyche hée wrote ſundrye myracles. By reaſon whereof, being hardly perſecuted by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> he was compelled in the end to conuey it awaye by a maruellous meanes. For he didde write in a péece of parchment, al the myracles he had done, with the whole circumſtance how the miſterie ſhoulde be vſed, and cloſed the bloud with the parchment in the bill of a bigge water fowle (for my Author maketh no mention of his name) and hauing bounde it and trimmed it in the beſte manner he myght, he caſte it into the Sea, and commended it to God. Whoſe bleſſed wil was, that after this <hi>Saint Bill</hi> (by the time and terme of 1000. or 1200. yeares) had ſayled through al the Weaſterne and Eaſterne ſeas, it ſhoulde in the ende arriue in <hi>Normandie,</hi> where at this day doth ſtande the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey of <hi>Bill:</hi> And beyng by the boyſterous billowes caſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoare among other baggage, on a heape of buſhes, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a good Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> (one that was a founder to ſuch follies in thoſe daies) to be hunting of a Hart in thoſe quarters, where ſodainely he hadde loſte bothe Déere and Dogges, til at laſt he ſpyed them before thys buſhe all on their knées, the Hart firſt, and the houndes harde behinde him: and as ſome write, they were at theyr prayers. This ſight moued the Duke to greate deuotion, who reuerentlye
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1877:38"/>
ſought the place, where he founde thys pretious Bill with the contents thereof: whych cauſed him to build an Abbey in the honor of it, naming it the Abbey of <hi>Saint Bill,</hi> where this beautifull myracle is yet to be ſéene, adorned wyth ſuch ſundrye riches, as this Bill doth now féede a number of bellies.</p>
            <p>Here is to be noted, howe euidentlye and impudentlye they didde mocke the pore Idiots in that age: For, when they did ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhop of their ſhameleſſe relikes, how bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would they brag of their rotten merchandize? As behold here in this viole the bloud of our ſauiour Chriſt gathered togither vnder the Croſſe by the virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> And in thys other viole, is the teares of our Redéemer, that hée dydde ſhedde on the Croſſe, when he behelde his pitifull mother: Here is the milke of our Ladies breaſtes, the haire of hir head, and the ſooadling bandes wherewith ſhe firſte rolled Chriſte at his byrth: And in this bottle (whyche may not in any wiſe be opened) is the very breath of Ieſus Chryſte curiouſly kepte by his mother euer ſince hée was a lyttle one.</p>
            <p>As a Prieſt at <hi>Gene,</hi> returning from <hi>Iewrie,</hi> affyrmed he brought wyth him of the ſame breath, and from <hi>Mount Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi> the hornes of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Theſe ſhameleſſe ſhewes of theyr trumperie, if anye did finde faulte or ſpeake againſt them, be was condemned for an heretike: For it was (they wold ſay) allowed and confirmed by the Popes Holineſſe, to be moſt true, and therefore damnable to thinke the contrary. I leaue to recite their infinite ſtore of traſh, which by their runnagate Pardoners were made as vendible as theſe.</p>
            <p>As one that carried about the relikes of <hi>Saint Hubart</hi> (to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fo.</hi> 555.</note> iuſtifie the vertue of them) baſhed not with moſte blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to affyrme, that if the holy Ghoſt were bitten with a mad dog, he would come to <hi>Saint Hubart</hi> to be healed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong this rabblement of Relickes, I muſt néedes intrude <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fol.</hi> 559.</note> one myracle performed in the perſon of a <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> who, to obſerue the ſtraight lawes of their religion, had his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1877:39"/>
cloſe in his bed to help him ſay his Mattins at mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>night: And his boy or Nouice comming vp in the morning (by chance they both aſléepe) he ſaw foure naked féete hang out of the bed, whereat he was ſo amazed, as he ſodainely put his head out at the windowe, and mainely cryed: ho, come ſée a myracle, for my Mayſter hathe foure legges.</p>
            <p>And further, to ſhewe their aucthoritie for the proofe of their Images, which they honored with reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce due on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, it will euery way appéere to be as bad &amp; as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt. For a Legate of the Popes to the orientall Churches, didde alleadge for Saintes, the texte of <hi>Moſes:</hi> God created Man to his owne Image: and therefore hée affirmed, we ought to haue Images. An other to proue that Images muſte be vppon the Aultare: brought in the 5. of Mathewe for a witneſſe: where Chriſte ſayeth, that none lighteth a Candle, and couereth it with a buſhell, but ſetteth it vppon a candle ſticke, to light al the houſe with. An other alleadging, that the ſight of Images was profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, bringeth the 4. Pſalme for proofe: The light of thy countenaunce, O Lorde, is marked vpon vs. And <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> brought in this ſuttletie, It is written, that God is maruellous in his Saintes: And therfore he would haue vs to contemplate his glory in Images: And one affirmed this ſimilitude, that as the Patriarkes vſed the ſacrifice of the Infidels, ſo Chriſtians ought to haue Images, in lieu of their Idols. Here you may ſée their faire allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, approued by ſome of their generall counſels and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in their common ſermons: by which places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they abuſed ſundrie of good capacitie and iudgement: And yet the ſimpleſt might ſée how farre they erred from the true meaning of the Text.</p>

               <hi>A Sorbonist</hi> Doctor named <hi>Demochares</hi> (of late yeares at the Conuention of <hi>Poiſſi</hi> in <hi>Fraunce)</hi> pleading in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Images, agaynſte a miniſter of Gods worde, when he was ſette agrounde and ſawe hys owne ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe, he ſhamed not to take holde on this allegation:
