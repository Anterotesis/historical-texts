            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A Table ſeruing for the more exact, and ſpeedy meaſuring of Boord, Glaſſe,
Stone, and ſuch like, both Plaines and Solids, by the Foot, then euer heretofore

Inuented, and firſt publiſhed in the yeere 1612, by Wilhelm Bedwell, Parſon

               <head>Of the vſe of the Trigon in meaſuring of Plaines by the foot.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>TO meaſure by this Table, is, by two numbers knowne, to finde the third vnknowne.</hi> Things here to be meaſured, are magnitudes. And
magnitudes or bigneſſes, are quantities which haue either one or more dimenſions, to wit, length, breadth, or thickneſſe. Theſe
dimenſions are here repreſented by numbers. <hi>Of the two numbers aſſigned, the one muſt be ſought amongſt thoſe on the out ſide of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon:
The other amongſt thoſe vnderneath the baſe of the ſame.</hi> The numbers, as you ſee, doe ſtand againſt the ſpaces encloſed betweene
two parallell lines. Hauing found your numbers giuen, let your eye direct you through the oppoſite ſpaces againſt which they ſtand,
from the one aſcending; from the other ſidewaies, or contrarily, vntill you obſerue both the ſpaces to meet, or fall into one. The
number there found, is the dimenſion ſought. <hi>Plaines are magnitudes long and broad:</hi> Or, Surfaces are magnitudes of two dimenſions,
namely, length and breadth. <hi>Here the two numbers giuen, are that of the breadth, and the number of</hi> 12; 1 A Board of 18 inches broad,
and 24 foot long, is to be meaſured. Here the breadth 18 taken amongſt thoſe vnder the baſe, and 12 amongſt thoſe on the ſide,
doe in the quadrate where their ſpaces meet, giue 8 inches for the length deſired. Now becauſe 8 inches is contained in 84 foot
36 times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore the board giuen, doth containe 36 foot of plaine meaſure. 2 A pane of Glaſſe is 8 inches broad. Here 8 taken
amongſt thoſe on the ſide; and 12 vnderneath the baſe, doe ſet vs out 18 inches for the length. <hi>If the breadth bee greater then</hi> 24,
<hi>that is, then any number encloſing the Trigon, then take the halfe, one third part, one quarter, &amp;c. and the number found ſhall be two, three, or
foure foot, &amp;c of plaine meaſure.</hi> 3 A Table of one yard and a quarter (or 45 inches) broad is to be meaſured. Here 45 inches is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then any number about the Trigon; therefore I take 15 the third part of the breadth, and 15 and 12 I finde to point to 9 and 3/5
for the length deſired. Therefore I auerre, that euery 9 inches, and 3/5 parts of an inch in length of that table, ſhall conteine 3 foot of
plaine meaſure. 4 A roome of 16 foot broad, and 48 foot long is to be floored; I would know how many foot of Board it will
aske to couer it. Here 16 foot, that is, 196 inches is greater then any about the Trigon; therefore I take 16 the 12 part thereof:
and 16 and 12 doe allow 9 inches for the length. Now becauſe 9 inches are conteined in 48 foot 64 times; and 64 times 12 are 768.
Therefore I ſay, the floore will require 768 foot of board to couer it.</p>
