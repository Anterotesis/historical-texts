            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>COrk</hi> being happily ſurrended, and brought under his Majeſty's Obedience, by the ſucceſsful Hand of Providence, and the great diligence and conduct of the Earl of <hi>Malborough,</hi> whoſe next Care was to reduce <hi>Kinſale</hi>: And accordingly on <hi>Monday</hi> the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1690. he detached Brigadier <hi>Villers</hi> and Brigadier <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> with 500 Horſe and Dragoons, to <hi>Kinſale,</hi> to ſummon the Place. They arrived about 2 in the Afternoon within halt a Mile of the Town, and ſent a Trumpeter to them, offering them to be Priſoners of War, if they would immediately ſurrender; otherwiſe to aſſure the Governour, he ſhould certainly be hanged, for reſiſting a Victorious Army, in caſe he ſtaid till Cannon were brought before the Walls. The Governour anſwered very haughtily, and threatned to hang up the Trumpeter, for daring to offer him ſuch mean Conditions. But as ſoon as our Horſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, he preſently gave Order to his Men to ſet Fire to the Faggots he had prepared in all parts of the Town, in order to burn it on the firſt Appearance of the enemy: Which as ſoon as done, they all run out of the Town to the <hi>Old Fort.</hi> But our Men, eſpying that, preſently got in, and quenched it before it had burnt one Houſe, and only met 7 or 8 of the enemy, who ſtayed behind to plunder, whom they preſently cut in pieces. As for the two Forts, which are at the Harbour's Mouth, the <hi>Old Fort,</hi> being the neareſt to the Town, was ſent to to ſurrender; but <hi>O Sullivan More,</hi> who was in it, refuſed, and ſaid he would hold it out to the laſt Man, firing his Cannon, and hung out a bloody Flag. The like did Sir <hi>Edward Scot,</hi> who commanded in the other Fort, over againſt the <hi>Old Fort.</hi> Upon which the Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers immediately ſent away to the Eearl of <hi>Malborough</hi> to acquaint him with the ſtate of things, and to deſire him to ſend 2 or 3 pieces of Cannon and three Regiments, to the <hi>New Fort</hi>: And for the <hi>Old one,</hi> if they had 300. Men, they had Cannon enough in the Town. My Lord <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> did upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 30<hi>th</hi> ſend what was deſired, but, the March being long, they came but within 4 Miles of the Town that Day. The 1<hi>ſt</hi> inſtant, thoſe that went to the <hi>New Fort</hi> ſtruck off at <hi>Brown's Mill,</hi> and thoſe that came to the Town arrived there about 4 in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. The 3<hi>d.</hi> early in the Morning, the Brigadiers having got Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a readineſs, and having fitted 3 pieces of Cannon, which were ready mounted in the Town, they drew <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem up to the top of <hi>Compaſs Hill,</hi> which commanded the <hi>Old Fort,</hi> and began to play upon it: After 4 hours firing the enemy were forced to ceaſe, for this Hill commanded them ſo, that not a Man could ſtir but either the Cannon or ſome of our Muſquets hit them. In the Night our Men marched gently down the Hill; which the enemy eſpying, fearing ſome Aſſault deſigned, bear a parlee, and ſurrendred on the Terms offered them. There were 90 Men in it, who were conveyed to the Town, and a Guard ſet over them; and 200 of our Men preſently marched into it. This was of great Advantage to us, for beſides that it commanded part of the <hi>New Fort</hi>; it alſo hindred 3 rich Ships, who were about to ſteal out.</p>
            <p>On the 4<hi>th,</hi> about 8 in the Morning, 12 of our Frigots appeared in the Bay of the <hi>Old Head,</hi> and after drawing themſelves into a Line, they all ſaluted the <hi>New Fort</hi> with full Broad-ſides; and at the ſame time by a Signal concerted between them, the Land Forces fell down the Hill, whilſt our Cannon played to cover them: Alſo 500 Seamen were put on Shoar at <hi>Oyſter Haven,</hi> and brought with them ſome Scaling Ladders and Grapling Irons. About 4 in the Afternoon all things being ready, the Scaling Ladders were raiſed up againſt the Walls, and our Men run up with that Vigour, and repeated Huzzas, that the Enemy had no time to think of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but were put into ſuch a Confuſion, that they retired into the Fortreſs in great Diſorder, except 40, who were not nimble enough, and were put to the Sword. Never was ſo warm an Attack known, for the Land Forces on one Side, the Seamen on the other, and the Ships to the Water, thundred forth ſuch Peals of Cannon, that there was no poſſible reſiſting. Our Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus poſſeſſed of the Platform, the Enemy hung out a White Flag, and were accepted of as Priſoners of War. Thus we became Maſters of one of the moſt conſiderable Fortreſſes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of the beſt Port and Harbour in the whoſe World. In the Fort there was found great ſtore of Ammunition and Arms. The Iriſh were 300 at firſt, but 80 were killed in the taking of it. We had on our ſide about 30 killed and wounded. At Night the Men of War came into the Harbour with the Tide of Flood, and after caſting Anchor, they fired a round for this joyful Succeſs, and all other demonſtrations of Joy imaginable. There were 5 Prizes in the Harbour, whereof one a French Privateer of 11. Guns. Now his Majeſty has entirely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all this Weſtern Part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by the Situation of this Port, his Majeſty's Men of War will be able to intercept any Supply which the French can ſend to thoſe Rebels that ſtand out in <hi>Connaught</hi>; ſo that by <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> they muſt of neceſſity periſh, if they continue obſtinate in their Rebellion, except his Majeſty will extend his great Mercy towards them, and vouchſafe to receive them into Protection, upon their Submiſſion to him.</p>
