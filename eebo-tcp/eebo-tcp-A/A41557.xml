            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THE publication of this little piece (at this juncture) was not the Effect of my forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but of that deference I owe to ſeveral good Men, and Well-wiſhers of the preſent Government, by whoſe importunity I was induced to take this Task upon me, without prejudice to the Rights of more Abler Men, to whoſe elaborate Works on the ſame Subject, as ('tis here limited) this Eſſay has the Honour to lead the way. Thoſe Gentlemen my good Friends had very good reaſon to be moved, when they heard the good Meaſures of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment miſrepreſented to Strangers by the Artifices of Deſigning Men, having no leſs in their Aim than to divide the common Intereſt of Proteſtants. They unanimouſly concurred in their judgments that it was expedient to put a ſtop to the ſpreading of this Contagion, and urged me with Motives that were too weighty for me to reſiſt, having all the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:102857:3"/>
imaginable to ſhew my Zeal for Our Religion and Liberties within my Sphere. Herein is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a true (tho a general) Account of the Matter of Fact to undeceive Strangers of their Miſtakes, whoſe different Opinions as to Church Government, and other Circumſtances, ought not to remove their Chriſtian Charity towards one another, but (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerned in one bottom) to promote the Common Intereſt and Salvation of Mankind, (laying aſide all Prejudice, Animoſity and Rancour,) tho it ſhould tend to the removal of any Earthly thing moſt dear to them, that proves a ſtumbling-block or occaſion of offence to either ſtrong or weak Brethren, imitating the Apoſtles Precept, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. concerning the difference of the Circumciſion. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s reſolution in the like caſe, <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap. 14. &amp; 15. And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. laſt Verſe, <hi>If meat make my Brother to offend, I will not eat Fleſh while the World ſtandeth, leſt I make my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offend.</hi> Which no doubt is preceptive to the Chriſtian World, who pretend not to Infallibility.

<pb facs="tcp:102857:3"/>
alſo ever ſince were great Promoters of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Reformed Religion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of its Miniſters and Profeſſors, and your Charity upon that account to Suffering Miniſters and Profeſſors, having been very conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That without any Flattery, I dare ſay, (and all thoſe who have the Honour to know your Ladiſhip, will confirm my Aſſertion) that none underſtands the Matter in hand better than your ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That your Honourable Husband, your Self, Eldeſt Son, and moſt of all your Relations, were chiefly concerned in the laſt Efforts, and great Enterprize made, and the ſignal Deliverance wrought of late for theſe oppreſſed Nations, of which God was pleaſed to make our preſent Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King his Glorious Inſtrument: (and for which your Endeavours, I hope your Family will meet with its due Reward.) Your Ladiſhip muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a fine ſtile of Language, it being ſufficient that the Matter of Fact is true, tho Deſign ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and the Language intelligible.</p>
                  <p>Madam, I might have been more plain, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and <hi>ad homines,</hi> but declin'd that Method, deſigning to give offence to no good Chriſtian, be his Profeſſion what it will, if his Principles be

            <head>A Moderate general Review of the <hi>Scots</hi> Prelatical Clergy's Proceedings in the later Reigns:</head>
            <head type="sub">With a Vindication of the preſent Proceedings in Church Affairs there.</head>
            <p>IT being too much ſpread abroad (whether out of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Matter of Fact, or Deſign of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing Party to divide the Intereſt of Proteſtants, I will not divine) That the preſent procedure in <hi>Scotland</hi> tends to the Oppreſſion or Perſecution of the Epiſcopal Miniſtry there: But whatever be an evil Parties deſign in it, ſure I am, theſe Surmiſes tend to load the good and unanimous Deſigns of the preſent Government with unjuſtifiable things: And to remove theſe Miſtakes which might give Encouragement to an evil deſigning Party, (who are always like the Salamander in the Fire, and love to fiſh in muddy Waters, acting both in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Elements for the ſame Ends) or Diſcouragement to the good Party, whoſe different Opinions about Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102857:6"/>
ought not to divide them in the main. I ſhall firſt ſtate it as my Hypotheſis (as many Learned moderate Divines under both Governments do) that Church Government, whether it be this, or that, is a Matter indifferent; There being no Platform of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment left in the Church, either by Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or their Diſciples, further than appointing Biſhops in every Church (which word in the common accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Originals and Tranſlations, by both Parties is underſtood to be Overſeers, without mentioning any Preheminence to them over their Brethren) theſe being Presbyters, and their Deacons and Elders; So that Church Government in this caſe would ſeem to be left indifferent; and every Nation or People link'd together in one Body or Society, in their own Civil Government (whether Monarchical, Democratical, Ariſtocratal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) have it left in their Option (being free from Engagements either to the one or the other) to ſettle that Church Government, which the major part of that People or Society judges moſt ſuitable to the Word of God, and the general Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Genius of the People.</p>
            <p>This being granted in the general; In the next place let us conſider, That when that Nation in particular, as generally all <hi>Europe</hi> were enſlaved to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, there was no other, and could no other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be, but Prelacy ſuitable to that of their Univerſal Biſhops, whoſe Vaſſals they, as well as all other Prelats were (as they called them) who aſſume to themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Title of Head of the Church, and Chriſt's Vicars upon Earth, which all thoſe of the reformed Proteſtant Religion, Epiſcopal or Presbyterial, look upon as Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous; And therefore the Pope is called by them all Antichriſt, and no doubt he is. But when that Peoples
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102857:6"/>
Eyes came to be opened to ſee clearly, the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Errors which that Church maintained for ſeveral Ages, and the many Cheats, Villanies, and Wickedneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by that Clergy in general, They began to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their Lives and Manners, by the indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pains and labour of ſome few Presbyters, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſeveral kinds of Martyrdoms and other Cruelties therefore, by the Popiſh Clergy: And the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergies barbarous Cruelties in thoſe times towards thoſe valiant Champions in Chriſt's Cauſe, did at laſt animate the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to proſecute a General Reformation in that Nation, and their Reformation being by Presbyters, It ſeems gave the riſe there, to that denomination of <hi>Presbyterian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergies Cheatry, and wickedneſs in their Lives and Converſation, and Cruelty towards thoſe Reformers, and thoſe of the Reformed Religion, occaſioned the Peoples general hatred at the very Order of Biſhops: And beſides, that the bulk of the <hi>Scots</hi> Clergies Opinion, being, <hi>That a well Conſtitute Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Government is both more agreeable to the Word of God, and general Inclination and Genius of the People, than any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though Superintendants were appointed there at the beginning of the Reformation (the generality of the People not being as yet well Reformed) the Reformers that they might prevail the more readily in moderation with the generality of the People; eſpecially conſidering the nearer they came to the laſt Settlement (being Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in Civil Matters by a Popiſh King Regent and Queen) in the Infancy of their Reformation, the eaſier the work appeared to be; yet the Presbyterian was the firſt Eſtabliſhed Government, being fully ſettled in the Year 1592. by a general Meeting of the Eſtates, and

Confirmed by Parliament, and continued ſo till the Year 1606. after that King <hi>James</hi> came to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> when he endeavoured to make an Union between the two Nations, ſetled an Epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, (though contrary to the Inclinations of the People and Clergy in general) Expecting thereby to Unite them as well in Trade as in Church Government; And the hopes of an Union in Trade, and other things beneficial to <hi>Scotland,</hi> moved many of thoſe who were Presbyterially inclined, to go beyond their Inclinations, and Opinion, alongſt with that Settlement for preſent. But that Settlement by Biſhops in <hi>Scotland</hi> being all (it ſeems) that the then <hi>English</hi> Clergy and others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned (and in which Settlement many Eminent Men of that Kingdom were too precipitant, to their regret afterwards when they could not help it) that being done the Union was blown up, though I am of opinion, as are many Eminent Men of both Nations, and Well-wiſhers to the preſent Government, That neither <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> can ever be truly Happy, till there be an Union in Parliaments, as well as in Trade: For though <hi>England</hi> be more opulent and powerful by Sea and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, (by reaſon of their Trade) yet when <hi>England</hi> has a Powerful Enemy in the Front, <hi>Scotland</hi> might prove as dangerous, if not a fatal Back-door to <hi>England</hi>; and it's not to be doubted if there were an Union, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Export of <hi>Scotland</hi> to other Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries at preſent might be of equal Gain to <hi>England</hi> to what <hi>Scotland</hi> might expect by an Union in Trade from <hi>England</hi>; which could be made appear to a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this not being <hi>hujus loci,</hi> I hope to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for this Digreſſion from the thing propoſed, there being ſome ſympathy between the one and others Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;

and to come to the point in hand, when there is any Revolution in the State of that Kingdom, as of late, and they are ſo happy as to have a King and Governours that deſign nothing more than the Tranquillity and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the People, the People eagerly in their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation deſire to Eſtabliſh that Church Government which their Clergy and People in general are of Opinion is moſt conſonant to the Word of God, and their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. And to make it clear that the firſt Reformers were not at all for eſtabliſhing the Order of Biſhops, Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> being in Exile in <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of the Clergies great Perſecution in King <hi>James</hi> the Fifth's time in <hi>Scotland,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, having a great eſteem for Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> he proffer'd him a Biſhoprick in <hi>England</hi>; but he thanked that good King heartily, and refuſed it. And a long time after that Kingdom was turned to the Chriſtian Faith, they had no Biſhops, nor does any of our own or Foreign Hiſtorians aſſert that there was any that had the title of Biſhop in that Church before <hi>Paladius</hi> in the fifth Century; nor was this <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> either a Dioceſian or Provincial Biſhop, <hi>Adrian</hi> in the ninth Century, being the firſt Dioceſian, nor was there any Archbiſhop, Primate or Metropolitan to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate Dioceſian Biſhops till the Year 1436.

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:102857:8"/>
and <hi>England,</hi> are not the ſame thing, and in their dependance have not the equivalent Power or Influence in their Publick and Private managements in relation to the State; for in <hi>England,</hi> the Laws there ſeem to ſecure Biſhops ſo in their Offices and Benefices (when Ordained and Conſecrated) that though they ſhould not go along with the Court in diſagreeable things, without a new Law, or ranverſing the old in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary way, they cannot be put from their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, though they ſhould be ſuſpended from their Offices. But in <hi>Scotland</hi> that Order depended ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon Court Favour; that the Governours could, and actually have, without any Supervenient Law or Statute turned out Biſhops, <hi>Tam ab officio quàm à bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio,</hi> of which there could be many Inſtances given, but the Matter of Fact being ſo well known, we need not trouble the Reader with them here.</p>
            <p>But certain it is, That the difference of theſe two Conſtitutions is an encouragement to the one to own what is good, and is a bait to the other to maintain even more dangerous things than the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance it ſelf if required: And to make a Parallel between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Biſhops in many things, but particularly in their Practices; would be but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to our Nation, to render in Publick, were it not that it clearly appears in Matters of Fact, whether it be the fault in the Conſtitution of <hi>Scots</hi> Biſhops, or the Biſhops own natural temper. That the old <hi>Scots</hi> Proverb holds true, <hi>That Lordſhips changes Manners</hi>; For be they habit and repute never ſo good and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Men when only in the ſtate of Miniſters, yet when once Biſhops or Prelats, for the moſt part they become like that Emperor who was very good till he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102857:9"/>
became Emperor, and had Power to do Evil, whoſe Anſwer upon a Queſtion of the alteration of his diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent temper and practices is well known to all verſant in Hiſtory, and there was one of the Popes who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be of the ſame temper alſo.</p>
            <p>But now to come to give an account of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular practices of their late Biſhops in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the laſt two Reigns, which generally created an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable hatred in mens Minds to the Order it ſelf (though Church Government were a Matter indifferent to Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen and Laicks;) and the firſt ſtep was, That when the General Aſſembly of Divines in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who were not only very active to Crown King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second at <hi>Scoon</hi> in 1650. but alſo, great Inſtruments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to the Imperial Crown in the Year 1660. and that the Presbyterian Government was confirmed <hi>Act</hi> 16. <hi>Par.</hi> 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> They looking upon Mr. <hi>James Sharp</hi> as one of the moſt violent Presbyterians in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> time, of great Credit with the Presbyterian Clergy, and of no leſs fame for his almoſt violent Zeal that way, which all the Presbyterian party there, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Swearing to ſtand by the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it was then Eſtabliſhed in a Presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was intruſted by them in the Year 1661. as their Commiſſioner to the King, to have that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment continued: But the Promiſe and fair Proſpect of an Archbiſhoprick prevailed with his Judgment, and gave him a new light, for which he was tainted with that Epithet of the Betrayer of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and his Brethren, who being a politick Man, fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to contrive, and (with other Politicians in the State, and Laxer Clergy who looked for Benefices) to concert the new Eſtabliſhment of the Order of Biſhops
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102857:9"/>
in its full extent, after the Form almoſt of the old Popiſh Order, and aboliſhing the Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Year 1662. It was no doubt a failure in ſome of the Presbyterian Miniſters, then (many of which were great Eminent and Loyal Men, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing Benefices from the late King) to deſert their Churches and Vocations in the Publick Aſſemblies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they had been forced from them (as no doubt they would have been without Compliance.) But certain it is, That when ſome of them left their Charges, and others were forced to quit the ſame immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by impoſing new Engagements to that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contrary to their former Solemn Oaths, and Vows (though it be much my opinion, that no Oaths ought to be impoſed in point of Government, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of Allegiance to the King in his Political Government of the Church, as well as in the Civil State; Becauſe good Men need not to be loaded with Oaths, and evil Men will never keep Oaths when they find opportunity to break them to any earthly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage), which others Imbraced for love of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, and the Miniſters that either quit or were put from their Charges, were not only reſtrained from Preaching and Praying in any Publick Meetings to their Congregations, or privately in their Houſes, (though they expected nothing for their Labours) by Impoſition of Arbitrary Penalties, and contriving Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Sanguinary Laws, equivalent to that which was made againſt Papiſts, Seminary Prieſts, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits <hi>ad terrorem,</hi> 2 <hi>Act.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102857:10"/>
thoſe Laws were once put in Execution againſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Prieſts, Jeſuits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet how violently were they put in Execution againſt thoſe poor Miniſters, their Flocks and Families, for the one's Preaching, and the other's Hearing of the Word of God, without mixture or the leaſt grains of Schiſm or diſloyalty? Which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion (meerly for the difference of Opinion) tended to ſo great a Perſecution (which verified that old Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That Oppreſſion makes a wiſe man Mad</hi>) that it put the People in ſuch a terrible conſternation, that this Perſecution or Oppreſſion (call it what you will) forced the People in the Year 1666. to gather together and riſe in Arms in defence of their Preacher's, Religion and Liberty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe perſecuting Clergymen; who not only contrived, but forced the Stateſmen and the King's Privy-Council to ſtretch theſe Penal and Sanguinary Laws, againſt both their Religion and Liberty in which they were Educated: and what Devaſtation, Forfaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Cruelties and Bloodſhed followed thereupon in that poor Kingdom for ſeveral Years is ſo generally known, that it's needleſs to relate it here, and the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> who had nothing of violence in his Nature, conſidering the common Evil their Diviſions occaſioned, (with the concurrence, and by a repreſentation of ſome Honeſt Men then in the Civil Government) did give a little reſpite by a Toleration to ſome Miniſters to Preach in ſeveral Congregations, but the regular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy were ſo exaſperated againſt this Indulgence, that they themſelves made terrible Clamours and Complaints to the King and Clergy of <hi>England</hi> (who were not ſo immoderate, nor ſo immoral in their Actions againſt Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor ſo vitious and ſcandalous in their Lives and Converſations) and to the Officers of State, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102857:10"/>
the Privy Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> not only againſt thoſe poor People, but alſo againſt any that favour'd or pitied them, alledging it was a Schiſm in the Church, that the Miniſters Preached Rebellion, which the Council found frequently upon Tryal to be falſe, and that thoſe that gave any diſſent to their violence againſt theſe People were diſloyal. And many that were vitious and the moſt ſcandalous of their inferior Clergy, not agreeing with the abſtemious lives and the ſingular Examples of thoſe godly Miniſters, made it their buſineſs to harraſs and malign them and the People, to the Government; till they got their point wrought ſo far as to remove this Liberty which the King graciouſly granted, and procured an Army of Wild Highlanders to be ſent to thoſe Countries in <hi>Anno</hi> 1677. Which Army commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the greateſt Barbarities and Unnatural things that ever was heard tell of in a Chriſtian Nation, by their Oppreſſions, Robberies, Plunders, Rapines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no diſtinction of Perſons or Sexes. This being with great difficulty repreſented again to the King, he out of his wonted Clemency, cauſed Remove his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and thoſe poor People, though left in a manner deſolate, having got the leaſt Reſpite (their Religion and Profeſſion being dearer to them than their Lives) they frequenting thoſe Meetings again without Tumult or Uproar, where they thought they had the Word of God truly and more purely Preached to them: The Epiſcopal Clergy (being again allarm'd) made the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt clamour that could be, and made their Intereſt at Court to ſend Arms again (as they alledged, to ſuppreſs them) upon which violent Perſons did get Commiſſions, when other moderate Men that had Commiſſions laid them down; and others refuſed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102857:11"/>
them upon ſuch cruel Expeditions) and raiſed Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Foot, Horſe, and Dragoons, and many of them, who having neither Principles of Religion nor Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, were ſent thither with thoſe Troops, and treated the People in a moſt barbarous manner, which forc'd thoſe poor oppreſſed People to Guard their Meetings with Armed men, till they fell in Blood with thoſe cruel mercenary Souldiers in the Year 1679. Which Cruelty and Perſecution increaſed their Number the more; which verifies that old Saying, <hi>Cinis &amp; Sanguis Martyrum ſemen Eccleſiae,</hi> for the more they were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and persecuted, the more their Number increaſed. And were there not then ſome of the greateſt Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in that Kingdom in diſgrace with the King by the inſtigation of that Clergy, and ſome other Miniſters of State, not only for their Diſſents to their violent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt Proteſtants; but alſo for complaining of ſome other miſmanagements in State? But God has at this time been pleaſed to honour them, ſo as to put them in Capacity to be moſt Inſtrumental in ſetling the preſent Government, I hope upon ſure and laſting Foundations. But not to make a greater Digreſſion, then was the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſent Generaliſſimo to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to Suppreſs thoſe Proteſtants; yet he was to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the Clergy, and the King's Council; who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of his limited Commiſſion did, and for his favour ſhewn to thoſe poor People (who he knew ſuffered meerly upon the account of their Religion and ſtricter Lives) was by the Clergy and the violent Party, their Adherents, put in diſgrace with the King, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Perſons were, and how many Families of all Ranks and Degrees were then and ſince deſtroyed by this Oppreſſion and Clergy's perſecution? how many
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102857:11"/>
were tortured without Mercy? how many were Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, Drown'd, Beheaded, Shot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many of them without the Liberty of once calling upon God before their Death, is incredible; but all <hi>Europe</hi> knows it, and it cannot be denied. And who knowing, or in the leaſt underſtanding the Affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi> in thoſe times, will deny but that theſe cruel Proceedings againſt the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Miniſters and their Hearers, (by Baniſhments, Impriſonments, Forfaultures, Intercommonings, or Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawries, Deaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) were the very things that forc'd many of the vulgar ſort of Profeſſors to fly to the Hills and Mountains, where (though no doubt they had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to hear ſome good Miniſters Preach) yet Popiſh Emiſſaries, Trafficking Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being never idle, and never neglecting occaſions by the Diviſions of thoſe of the Reformed Religion, to propagate their helliſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, were not wanting to be there as Wolves in Sheeps clothing, or Devils in Angels ſhapes, to ſeduce thoſe of meaner Capacities to imbibe ſome dregs of the Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Principles, which brought many of thoſe poor Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents to end their days in Miſery.</p>
            <p>But that, when the late King <hi>James</hi> was dealt with (for Reaſons beſt known to his Cabin Councellors) to grant a general Toleration, doubtleſs out of no reſpect to the Presbyterian Party; They did, it's true, take hold of that opportunity and freedom to Preach the Goſpel, and no further, (when in the mean time the Epiſcopal Clergy did give their thanks to the late King, for his Liberty and Toleration to Papiſts, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and all other Sects) of which they were hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred before by the Epiſcopal Clergy, their procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and they no doubt had reaſon to thank the late King, or any, for the Liberty it ſelf (having by it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102857:12"/>
received a glimps of the Goſpel by their freedom to Preach it) though they deſponded of its long continuance, but expected a greater Perſecution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, which they Preached to their Hearers, and no doubt their Prophetick Sentences had been fulfilled, had not God in his Mercy prevented it, by preparing a fit and glorious Inſtrument to preſerve his People from the deſigned overflowing deluge of Popery and Slavery.</p>
            <p>And what good Proteſtant would not thank a Turk or Pagan, nay, the Pope himſelf for Life, Liberty, and Freedom of the Reformed Religion; much more a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Prince, eſpecially conſidering what is before rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about a 26 Years Oppreſſion or Perſecution from thoſe called the Regular Clergy then, and by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation; for from that Clergy they could expect no good Tidings: for ſome of them had the Impudence to ſay in Pulpit, <hi>That</hi> Rome <hi>should have it e're</hi> Jack Presbyter <hi>ſhould have it</hi>; this is a Matter of Fact, for who would not rather receive a favour (in the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance innocent) from a profeſſed Enemy, than be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or cruelly uſed by a counterfeit falſe Friend or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Relation, judge ye? And whether theſe Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt thoſe poor Proteſtants, does not too much imitate the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy and Miſſionaries impoſition on Magiſtrates and Governors to be their Executioners, let any indifferent man judge: So that any impartial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed perſon indued with common Senſe and Reaſon (conſidering what is ſaid (which is but a Specimen of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem that could be written on this unpleaſant Subject to any good Proteſtant, were it not to vindicate the generality of the Nation, unjuſtly aſperſed of purpoſe to make the Government unfavourable to Strangers, who know no better) may conclude that this perſecuted People, as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102857:12"/>
well as the generality of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, have reaſon not to continue the Order of Biſhops there; for if the practices of particular Biſhops in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were rendred publick, none would tax or reproach that Kingdom with violence, inhumanity, perſecution, or raſhneſs in their preſent management of Church Affairs; eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how great Inſtruments moſt of the Epiſcopal Clergy have been of late, by their connivance, forwardneſs, or contrivance to encourage the Miniſters of the late Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to encroach ſo much upon the Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Properties of the Proteſtant Subjects, we ſhall only inſtance two; So <hi>ex ungue Leonem.</hi> The firſt is, of their Behaviour in the Parliament 1686. when there was no lesſ Deſign than to reſcind the Penal Laws, fram'd and enacted againſt Papiſts, Seminary Prieſts and Jeſuits, Hearers and Sayers of Maſs <hi>ad terrorem,</hi> to hinder the Growth of Popery in that Nation, which was the only legal Bulwark and Security of the Proteſtant Religion, theſe all the Biſhops (excepting three) concurred to remove; by removing of which Laws, all perſons lax in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or Evil-deſigning Men would be left looſe, and at their full liberty to act in the Matters of Religion as they pleaſed, and in which caſe a prevailing Party might eaſily impoſe whatever they pleaſed, the Power being in their hand, and the Prerogatives ſcrewed up above the higheſt Note in the Scale of Muſick: But God who did not deſign to deſtroy that Nation (meerly by his Providence as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his Eternal Decrees) wonderfully prevented all thoſe Helliſh Deſigns beyond Humane Expectation, and diſappointed the Actors.</p>
            <p>The next was that when all rational foreſeeing Men had a jealouſie of a Popiſh Contrivance, to impoſe a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to deprive the lawful Heirs of their rightful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102857:13"/>
and Men having ſearched more narrowly into the Affair, they were fully convinc'd in their Minds of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh impoſture, the whole Biſhops of <hi>Scotland</hi> (when in the mean time they could ſee no leſs than the Perſecution of their honeſt Brethren in <hi>England</hi> for Religious Matters) they (ſome of them no doubt, for worldly Intereſt, whither that would drive them, God knows, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Compliance, for fear of Suſpenſion from, or loſs of their Offices and Benefices) did make the moſt ſolemn, though the moſt unreaſonable, unchriſtian Addreſs, and diſagreeable to the pretended Character that ever was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Birth of a ſuppoſed Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>; and what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are in that Addreſs (ſo generally known) cannot but be nauſeous to any good Proteſtant to rehearſe, in which they called that Prince, <hi>The Darling of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. But to come in the next place to the late Procedure of the Convention, their Committees during their Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Parliament now ſitting, in relation to Church Affairs, I ſhall give an impartial Account of the particulars, ſo much as is needful.</p>
            <p>And firſt, When the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> that were here in <hi>January</hi> laſt 1689. did give their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the then Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (now our Gracious King) what Methods to take in relation to the Settlement of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation then in great Confuſion, having no Government, by reaſon of the late King's deſertion of the Government; The King did follow their Advice; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that ſome alledged a general Proclamation, to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in ordinary times and accuſtomary places, for calling the enſuing general Meeting of the Eſtates, would be the beſt Method to call them together, for Reaſons neither fit nor neceſſary to be inſerted here; yet His Majeſty, to a general Satisfaction, did take very knowing Mens Advice

to diſpatch his Circular Letters, which he did by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Truſt they repoſed in Him, and the Advice gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Gentry and Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſuch as had right to repreſent the Nation in a general Meeting, not omitting the then Biſhops, their Order being as then Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by a ſtanding Law, which His Majeſty would not Tranſgreſs. And when thoſe Repreſentatives of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did meet freely, frequently, and fully in a general Meeting, by virtue of our now Gracious King's Warrant before explained, had the Bisſhops then behaved themſelves as became perſons of their Profeſſion, pretended Honour &amp; Character, if they thought not the Call ſufficiently war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, they ought either not to preſent themſelves at that general Meeting, or when they did appear by vertue of that general Warrant, they might have Proteſted and deſerted the Meeting, as in their Opinion not legal, before it were conſtituted ſo by the general Meeting it self: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to have complyed fully upon their Meeting, and not only to have acknowledged their Faults, Errors, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managements in the late Government, but alſo to have gone on honeſtly, and vigorouſly with the other Eſtates, in Proſecution of the good Deſigns of their meeting.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By concurring to heal the Breaches made in the Hedges of Religion, and removing the Encroachments made upon its Laws.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By reſtoring the wholſom Laws, Liberties &amp; Properties of the Eſtates &amp; their Fellow-Subjects, ſo much encroached upon by Popiſh Emiſſaries, and any other wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly deſigning Party in any of the later Reigns, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this, being it ſeems conſcious to themſelves of ſome guilt, they did all bandy together, not only with thoſe that were too active to carry on the Miſchief in the later Governments, but alſo with a new deſigning Party

            <p>I will not be too opinionative to aſſert, That the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of people in that Nation, or the major part of this Great and Wiſe Council of the Nation did incline to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Eſtabliſhment of that Hierarchy, they finding it in a manner very improbable, if not altogether impoſſible, (considering all that is ſaid, and much more might be ſaid) to reconcile the Ignorance, Debauchery and perſecuting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the moſt part of the Prelatical Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the ſingular, exemplary ſtrict, and orderly lives and converſations of the Presbyterian Clergy, and moſt of their Adherents: But ſure I am, that Clergy's former and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Behaviour were the Reaſons that induc'd that great and wiſe meeting of the Eſtates ſo ſuddenly to tender that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Biſhops as a Grievance of the Nation to His Majeſty, in their Preliminaries, in order to be aboliſhed in the next Parliament, now Sitting, and to vindicate that Nation, the general meeting of the Eſtates, and the preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from all Aſperſions which are induſtriouſly ſpread abroad, loading them with a Perſecution of the Epiſcopal Miniſtry there.</p>
            <p>Take this for truth, of which no intelligent Man in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> can be ignorant.</p>
            <p>That the firſt Act the Eſtates made, was to ſecure their own Sitting.</p>
            <p>The ſecond material to our purpoſe was their declaring themſelves a free Eſtate, and a legal Meeting, and declaring that they would not ſeparate, but continue to ſit by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102857:15"/>
meetings, till they had reſtored and ſecured their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Laws, Liberties, and Properties; as well as that of their fellow Subjects ſo much encroached upon, and till they had Eſtablished the Government of the Church and State. Both which Acts the Biſhops Voted in and approved of.</p>
            <p>And this being done with ſeveral other things, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Legality of the Meeting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> too tedious to rehearſe here, being intended but an Abbreviat; Who would think that the Reverend Proteſtant Fathers of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would have ſtood in the way of any propoſition that might tend to the Security of the Proteſtant Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, reſtoring the wholſom Laws, and ſecuring the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Properties of the Subject?

in ſeveral of their Kings for many Ages, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable good Hiſtorians make appear: Yet to give a Call to the late King in his and our preſent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to return with a <hi>French, Iriſh,</hi> and other cruel Popiſh Crew, were either to make him more miſerable, who could not but be utterly deſtroyed in the Attempt, or the Proteſtants in <hi>Britain</hi> moſt miſerable, by reducing of them all to Popery and Slavery, or to the <hi>French</hi> moſt Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Cruelty, and untolerable heavy yoke, and our foreign Proteſtant Allies and their Confederates, though of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religions, more uneasie, if not in hazard to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the <hi>French</hi> Ambition and Slavery, which is more untolerable beyond doubt than that of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> his dear Confederates; but it ſeems our Biſhops when they deſired to recall a Popiſh King did not mind, or rather did not value the verity of <hi>Claudian</hi>'s Remarque, in caſe the late King did return with the leaſt favour of a reel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing populace,</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Componitur Orbis</l>

            <p>And a little after,</p>
            <q>Mobile mutatur ſemper cum principe vulgus.</q>
            <p>And who doubts, but that if the late King returned by force, the fate of all thoſe of the Reformed Religion (if real Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants) whether Epiſcopal or Presbyterial, would be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Execution, and if invited home, were his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes never ſo fair and ſpecious, the ſame fate would no doubt befall them in a ſhort time: And the Mobile is not always to be truſted for a Bulwark in every Exigence. But to the next Matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>Upon the day of <hi>April,</hi> the Eſtates having fully conſidered that it would be dangerous, to have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102857:16"/>
longer unſetled, and having upon good grounds, too tedious to relate here, reſolved to declare the Crown va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> forfaulted, the Biſhops not only urged frivolous Arguments, but alſo voted againſt it; Notwithſtanding their chearful voting <hi>affirmativè</hi> to the former Acts.</p>
            <p>And there being an Act ordaining the Clergy not to pray for the late King <hi>James,</hi> &amp;c. as King and Prince, their Right being forfaulted, and the Crown declared vacant, the Biſhops all removed without any compulſion, except 2, or 3, who were the moſt moderate; and one of thoſe being deſired at the riſing of the Meeting to ſay Prayers, he, that he might not omit his pretended Allegiance to King <hi>James</hi> in his Prayers, omitted to ſay Prayer in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Form, or <hi>extempore,</hi> but only repeated the Lord's Prayer, deſiring it ſeems to give offence to none: But a perſon preſent alledged, That ſeveral perſons uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their Prayers with the Lord's Prayer, and ſo did that Biſhop; for he ſuſpected it ſhould be his laſt Prayer in that place.</p>
            <p>At the next Sitting of the Eſtates it was moved, That, Conſidering the Biſhops behaviour in the later Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their behaviour in that general Meeting, (where notwithſtanding their being preſent, and voting in ſeveral Acts <hi>Affirmativè,</hi> which they contraveen'd contrary to their profeſſion) their Order ſhould be declared a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the Nation; which motion being remitted to the Conſideration of the Grand Committee, they at their next meeting brought it in as their opinion, That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were one of the greateſt Grievances of the Nation: which opinion the whole Meeting after ſerious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration approved of, and voted them out of Doors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:102857:17"/>After which, all the Biſhops withdrew themſelves in Cabals with ſeveral diſaffected people, called ſeveral of their inferior Clergy together, prompting them to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience in the preſent Juncture: which Principles ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Epiſcopal Clergy did then vent too much in their Preachings and publick Prayers.</p>
            <p>The Eſtates having emitted a Proclamation proclaiming <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> then King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without a contradictory Vote, and only one <hi>Non liquet</hi>;</p>
            <p>And another Proclamation enjoyning the Clergy after the Proclamation to Read the Declaration, and to pray for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; and in doing of which, many did comply, but ſeveral refuſed; yet all, even thoſe of the Epiſcopal Clergy (though not complying with this) who would live peaceably and regularly as Subjects, the Eſtates took into their particular protection, putting forth another Proclamation, prohibiting all or any of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects whatſoever to trouble or moleſt any of them in their Lives or Eſtates. And none will be ſo Impudent as to alledge in publick, that any either of the Biſhops, or their inferiour Clergy, whether complying or not, were ever troubled in their Perſons or Eſtates ſince the ſaid Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and few even before, by the unruly Rabble, unleſs it be thoſe whoſe Deportment no good Men can vindicate, and thoſe moderate Men of untainted Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the Epiſcopal Communion, who have chearfully complyed with the Eſtates, and preſent Government, will declare how they were careſſed by the Presbyterian party in this Juncture, and others who might be nice and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in ſome points, chriſtianly exhorted and invited to joyn with them without Engagements, further than Reading the Declaration, and Praying for King <hi>William</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102857:17"/>
and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; and I have reaſon to think that the preſent wiſe Parliament will impoſe nothing capable to trouble their Conſciences in their complyance with the preſent Government. And truly it would ſeem to be no ſmall reproach to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Biſhopſto hear thoſe who were lately their inferior Clergy now declare in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit and elſewhere, how theſe many years by-paſt, they themſelves have groaned under their Biſhops Tyranny and Oppreſſion of ſeveral kinds. But after the Biſhops were declared a Grievance to the Nation for many undeniable good pregnant Reaſons, and now voted out of Doors, the Eſtates took many calm Methods by Exhortations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with their Clergy, to have their Deportment ſuitable to their profeſſion in the preſent Juncture; but ſeveral of them continued ſo obſtinate, and endeavoured to ſeduce others to the defaming of the Government in publick and private; ſo that they were neceſſitated to deprive ſome of them (though they indulged ſome eminent Men till they adviſed better) and ordered Presbyterian Miniſters to Preach in their Churches: And ſure I am notwithſtanding the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Complaints given in to the Eſtates, of the Epiſcopal Clergy's and their Parties meeting in Cabals with Papiſts and other diſaffected People, to the contempt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government; yet that they were ſo tender of their Character, as Miniſters of the Goſpel, that none of them were once proſecuted by the Eſtates, their Committees, the Privy Council, or the preſent Parliament, ſince their Deprivation, except one Miniſter, who was accuſed to have ſpoken ſome Treaſonable Words; and how tenderly they dealt with him in his Misbehaviour and Infirmities, for fear of bringing a reproach upon any that Preached the Goſpel, whether6 of one Order or another, is well known; And it is too Publick, how one of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102857:18"/>
Miniſters Wives, and others of that perſwaſion, who converſe with Papiſts (as the Effects of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals) were apprehended, endeavouring to get into the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> (with freſh Meat, and other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) when it was block'd up, and declared Treaſon to converſe with, or aſſiſt any therein; and yet how tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were proceeded againſt, is generally known; there are many others of their Evil Practices in the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, might be ſpoken of, too tedious to the Reader; but to conclude with the Epiſcopal Clergy's Behaviour in <hi>Scotland</hi> of late, Who have been more Active, or like to be found more guilty in a Correſpondence with, and aſſiſting the Lord <hi>Dundee</hi> and his Party, now in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and committing moſt inhumane Actions, than ſeveral of thoſe who are called the Regular Clergy? which muſt be publick to their ſhame; beſides, that the late Biſhop of <hi>Galloway</hi> is certainly concluded to be with the late King <hi>James</hi> in perſon in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as a further Evidence of the Eſtates, the preſent Parliament, the Council, and other People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> their favourable Deportment and Lenity towards the Epiſcopal Clergy there, it's undeniable that both the Biſhops and their inferiour Clergy, who by their ill Deportment and late Obſtinacy, deprived themſelves of their Benefices, do Walk and Travel in Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, on Foot, in Coach, and upon Horſeback, at their pleaſure, and live peaceably in their Houſes without any Trouble or Moleſtation whatſoever: And it will be found unqueſtionably true, that neither the Epiſcopal Clergy, nor any other, who have been grievous and great Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors and Invaders of the Religion, and Encroachers upon the Laws, Liberties, and Properties of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects in the late Government, were in the leaſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102857:19"/>
fear of their Lives or Eſtates in that Kingdom, ſince the firſt general Meeting of the Eſtates; Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great Clamours and falſe Aſperſions, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and induſtriouſly invented and ſpread abroad by ſome perſons for their own ends, being either afraid to abide the Teſt of the Law by way of moderate Juſtice, or being uneaſie to themſelves, and troubleſom to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers under any Government, were it never ſo good and eaſie, but where they have a power to gratifie their Luſts and voracious Appetite, and to do Miſchief to others. And as for that Allegeance that the Biſhops, whoſe Order is aboliſhed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Clergy, who have deſerted their Charge, out of an ill Principle, for the moſt part have not a lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or ſubsiſtence, it muſt be very groſs and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for it's well known, that both the Biſhops and thoſe of their Clergy, who have deſerted their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had opulent Benefices, and are rich (though not to ſatisfaction) or might have been ſo in a cheap Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where, with the leaſt management, the half or third part of their yearly Benefices might maintain them and their Families very well; for it's known generally there, that ſeveral Miniſters with leſſer Benefices than any that quit their Charge now, have made good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes for their Children; And it's hardly known that ever their Charity or Pious Acts was the occaſion of their Poverty, though they have had Examples enough from many of their good <hi>Engliſh</hi> Brethren Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and if they lived too ſumptuouſly, <hi>Sibi imputent.</hi> And certain it is, that their Presbyterian Brethren, when they labour'd under the greateſt Poverty and Affliction in the World, by the <hi>Scots</hi> Epiſcopal or Regular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy (call them what you pleaſe) their immediate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102857:20"/>
none of them pitied their Diſtreſs, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them in their Wants in the name of Diſciples, (when it muſt be confeſs'd they were ſheltered and connived at, not only in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but careſſed abroad in <hi>Holland,</hi> and elſewhere) though there is good reaſon to believe that theſe Miniſters and other Presbyterians both pity theſe called lately the Regular Clergy, for their Miſcarriages, and pray for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; Which God grant.</p>
            <p>But I conclude this Point with a good Church of <hi>England</hi> Man's Saying, <hi>That the Biſhops of</hi> England <hi>were like the Kings of</hi> Judah, <hi>and the Biſhops of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>like the Kings of</hi> Israel; <hi>for that there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good Biſhops in</hi> England, <hi>but never one good Biſhop in</hi> Scotland. And though this be a general Rule or Maxim of the <hi>Scots</hi> Biſhops, yet no general Rule wants its Exceptions, there being ſome few Eminent Men of that Order in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who diſſsented from, and diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their violent Procedures, and inhumane and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian-like Practice; But this was <hi>Rara avis in hiſce terris.</hi> And I ſum up all with a Saying of a great Father in the Church, That <hi>whoever is of a perſecuting Spirit, whatever he profeſs outwardly, is of the Devil;</hi> which made <hi>Perſius</hi> in the like caſe in his Satyrs, make that Imprecation to Tyrants in general, or Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, which is the ſame thing upon the matter; both being Tyrants:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Summe parens divum, ſaevos punire Tyrannos</l>
               <l>Haund alia ratione velis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>And tho Tyrants or Perſecutors may have a time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted them to diffuſe their venom to the terror or affliction of others; yet they will meet with their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102857:20"/>
or Judgments here or hereafter, when the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and afflicted ſhall be releaſed.</p>
            <p>And now being that the Order of Prelatical Biſhops is aboliſhed in <hi>Scotland</hi> by an Act of Parliament; It is not once to be ſuppoſed that any other Government can be Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed there in the Church but a Presbyterian; The model thereof I ſubmit <hi>interim,</hi> to the Conſideration and the final and unanimous Reſolution of a Juſt and Wiſe King (who favoured the Peoples general Inclination) and this Wiſe, Loyal and free Parliament. And to make it evident to all unbyaſſed Men, that it is not only the general Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the People, to have the Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed; But alſo, That that Kingdom can never be in Peace, without the Eſtabliſhment of it: Though I might urge many, yet I only offer two undeniable proofs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There being 32 Shires or Counties, and two Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wartries (comprehending the whole Body of the Nation) that ſend their Commiſſioners or Repreſentatives to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and all general Meetings of the Eſtates or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions; of theſe 34 Diſtricts or Diviſions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, there are 17 of them entirely Presbyterians; So that where you will find one there Epiſcopally inclined, you'll find 150 Presbyterians. And the other 17 Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, where there is one Epiſcopally inclined, there are two Presbyterians.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Make but a Calculation of the valued Rent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> computing it to be leſs or more, or compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>argumentandi cauſa,</hi> to be Three Millions, and you will find the Presbyterian Heritors, whether of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or Gentry, to be P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oprietors and Poſſeſſors of Two Millions and more; So that thoſe that are Epiſcopally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined cannot have a Third of that Kingdom; and as for the Citizens or Burgeſſes, and Commonalty of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:102857:21"/>
they are all generally inclined to the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment except Papiſts, and ſome remote, wild, and barbarous Highlanders, who have not a true notion of a Deity, acknowledge neither King nor Superiour, but the Chief of their Tribe, and have little Subſiſtence but by Rapin and Plunder, and who ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and reduced by force, and Garriſons placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; without which, they can never be kept in order, or obliged to ſerve the Precepts of Law or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. All which is true, and can be made appear to a Demonſtration.</p>
