            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For as then God gaue to that people that worthy and godly King, who zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 23.</note> rooted out Idolatrie, and planted Gods true worſhip agreeable to his law: ſo God in great mercy hath giuen vs our moſt gracious Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by whoſe godly meanes Idolatrie hath been aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, Gods true religion and ſeruice reſtored, his holy word truly and ſincerely preached, and peace and tranquilitie among vs long maintained. And as in thoſe daies vnder King <hi>Ioſias,</hi> notwithſtanding that godly and zealous reformation, there was great wickednes among the people, as the ſaid <hi>Sophonias</hi> ſheweth. For there were then which worſhipped vpon the rouffes of their houſes the hoſt of heauen: <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sopho.</hi> 1. 5.</note> and which worſhipped and ſware by the true and

onely God <hi>Iehoua,</hi> and by <hi>Malcham</hi> their Idoll: and ſuch as were turned backe from after the true God, <note place="margin">6.</note> and ſought him not, nor inquired after him: and that did weare ſtrange apparell: and others that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">8.</note> their maſters houſes with robberie and deceite: <note place="margin">9.</note> and ſuch as were frozen in their dregges, and ſaid in <note place="margin">12.</note> their hearts the Lord will neither doe good nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. And Ieruſalem was then a filthie and ſpoyling <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1. 2.</note> citie, which heard not Gods voyce, receiued not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, truſted not in the Lord, and drew not neere vnto her God, &amp;c. Euen ſo how theſe ſinnes abound at this time in this land, I thinke there are but few, but doe ſee: and none that truly feareth God, but doth lament. To omit other ſinnes here mentioned, as then there were which worſhipped <hi>Iehoua</hi> the onely true God, and <hi>Malcham</hi> their Idoll: euen ſo there be now not a few, which to pleaſe the Prince and State pretend outwardly to like of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion eſtabliſhed, and yet inwardly in their hearts fauour Idolatrie and wicked worſhippings repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the ſame. And as then many were turned backe from after God, and ſought him not, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after him: euen ſo now there are many which be reuolted from Gods holy worſhip agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his word, and vtterly forſake the holy aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies where Gods word is truly preached, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are according to Chriſts inſtitution right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſtred, and Gods holy name faithfully called vpon. Theſe with <hi>Lots</hi> wife looke backe vnto So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and are with the Iſraelites in heart turned <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 19.</note> backe into Egypt, deſiring rather to eate onions and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.</note> garlike there, then to feed vpon the heauenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of Gods bleſſed word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7249:3"/>
Of theſe thus turned backe from ſeeking after God, they be moſt dangerous, which being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themſelues, endeuour by all meanes both by ſpeaking and writing to ſeduce and deceiue others. Such be the Seminarie Prieſts and Ieſuites, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be at this preſent time (at leaſtwiſe in outward apparance) at deadly fewd among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, writing moſt bitterly one againſt another: yet they all agree in reſiſting Gods truth, ſeducing the ſimple, and in labouring moſt earneſtly to ſet vp againe their Dagon of the Maſſe fallen downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke of Chriſts Goſpell. To this end they write lewd, lying, and ſlaunderous Pamphlets, wherein they traduce the truth, and faithfull fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers thereof, deceiue the ignorant, and confirme in error their ouer affectioned fauourers, who without triall or examination ouer raſhly receiue, and ouer lightly beleeue whatſoeuer is broached by them.</p>
            <p>Of theſe lying Libels there came one to my hands a yeere paſt and more, pretended to be printed at Antwerpe 1600. wherein is boldly affirmed, but faintly proued, that we haue no faith, nor religion: that of vs both the learned, and ignorant of the Greeke and Latine tongues be Infidels: that wee know not what wee beleeue: that we are bound in conſcience both neuer to aske forgiuenes of our ſinnes, and alſo to auoide all good workes: that wee make God the author of ſinne, and worſe then the diuell. Theſe and ſuch other ſhameles aſſertions and falſe ſlaunders when I read, it came into my heart, that Maſter <hi>Thomas Wright</hi> (with whoſe ſpirit I had been acquainted) was the venter of this ware. In which opinion I was afterward confirmed, for that
<pb facs="tcp:7249:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both ſome of his fauourers could not denie it, and in a written copie therof taken in a ſearch in Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and ſent vnto me, theſe two letters, <hi>T.W.</hi> were ſet in the end of it.</p>
            <p>This lewd Libell although in reſpect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter voide both of truth and learning, deformed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be deſpiſed, then earneſtly anſwered: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the author of it, thinketh ſo highly of himſelf, and ſo baſely and contemptuouſly of vs, giuing out in certaine written conferences, which he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed abroad in this land, and ſome faithfull men haue ſeene, that wee be vnlearned, and ſo giuen to worldly affaires, that we beſtow no time, or but little in ſtudie: I (although the meaneſt and vnmeeteſt of many) was moued to write this anſwere, thereby to confute theſe calumnies, to cleere the truth, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the faithfull, and if by Gods gracious bleſſing it might be, to reclaime and reforme the ignorant and ſeduced. Whereof I haue the leſſe hope, for that as they imitate thoſe wicked Iſraelites, <hi>which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to hearken, turned away their ſhoulder, ſtopped their</hi>

                  <hi>new coyned Goſpell. You requeſt me to ſet downe briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch reaſons as induced me thereunto: the which ſuite I could not deny: for both religion and affection vrged me to ſatisfie ſo iuſt a deſire. For I muſt confeſſe, I loue you as a man, and as an honeſt ciuill Gentleman, and moſt gladly I would haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to loue you as a Catholike Gentleman: for it is great pitie that ſuch a multitude of deteſtable errors, and heynous hereſies ſhould lodge in ſo rarely qualified a ſoule. I haue penned them after an vnaccuſtomed manner following the faſhion of ſchooles, in moſt of them after a ſyllogiſticall method: to the intent that if you ſhould ſhew them vnto your Miniſters, which ſwarme about you, they might not haue ſuch free ſcope and libertie, to range a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with their idle diſcourſes (as they vſe to take) veiling their confuſed conceits with a multitude of affected phraſes: thereby more eaſely to deceiue the ſimple, and loathe the learned. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech you if any ſuch itching ſpirit ſhall attempt an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, to intreate him to performe it briefly, orderly, and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This I requeſt, for that I perceiue that Proteſtants cannot anſwere with breuitie, becauſe their Religion lacketh both cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie and perſpicuitie: And extreame hard or impoſſible it is to replie without perplexitie, where there is no truth nor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And therefore I requeſt you as you loue me, to will them to conſider well, before they anſwere ill: and not to replie with raſhnes, leaſt they retract with deliberation, to their vtter ſhame and confuſion. And that you may perceiue how my wonder ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerued approbation then admiration, and for that order is a fauorite of memorie: I thought good to reduce all my reaſons into two heads; wit and will, knowledge and affection, faith and good life: becauſe the nature of hereſie hath euer been ſuch as did not only inueagle the wit with errors, but alſo ſeduce the will with occaſions of inordmate affections. I ſay the that no excellent goodwit, linked with a religious conſcience, can accept nor affect the Proteſtants new coyned Goſpell: for good wits and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, aſſiſted with Gods grace, may eaſily conceiue the truth, yea by the force of their very naturall faculties, they may iudge credibly of the truth once propoſed; and without great difficultie diſcorne the abſurdities of an vntrue religion.

               <p>YOu wonder that any man in England endued with a good iudgement, conioyned with a religious conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, can either accept or affect the Proteſtants new coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned goſpell. But why do you not ſhew what is the new coined goſpell, which the Proteſtants preach and profeſſe. The Goſpell is the good and ioyfull meſſage of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through Gods mercies purchaſed vnto vs by Ieſus Chriſt. This Goſpell God preached to <hi>Adam,</hi> that Ieſus Chriſt the ſeed of the woman ſhould breake the ſerpents <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 22. 18.</note> preached by all the Prophets, who beare witnes vnto <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43.</note> Chriſt, that through his name all that beléeue in him, ſhall receiue forgiuenes of ſinnes. Now if you can prooue that we preach or maintaine any other goſpell then this, then you may well call it a new coined goſpell: if otherwiſe, take heed you do not belch out blaſphemie, in calling this old and true goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, a new coined goſpell. And let the Chriſtian reader, which tendereth his owne ſaluation well conſider who they be that coine a new, falſe, and counterfeit goſpell. Do not they which teach vs to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into heauen by the bloud of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> coine a <note place="margin">In the popiſh Primer prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1557.</note> new and falſe goſpell? <hi>Tuper Thomae ſanguinem &amp;c.</hi> which they engliſhed in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes thus: By the bloud of <hi>Thomas,</hi> which he for thee did ſpend, make vs Chriſt to come, whither <hi>Thomas</hi> did aſcend.

Thus they prayed: <hi>Quaeſimus vt eius meritis &amp; precibas à gehennae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendijs</hi>

Yes ſurely, for to attribute remiſſion of ſinnes, or any part of ſaluation to the merits of any other, but only of Ieſus Chriſt crucified, is to coine a new and falſe goſpell: for it is not that goſpell of God, which he promiſed afore by his Prophets in the holy ſcriptures, which is concerning his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, our Lord &amp;c. To conclude this point, I ſay woe, woe vnto them that accept or affect any new coined goſpell. And whereas you wonder that men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with iudgement and a religious conſcience, could affect or accept the goſpell that we preach, which you falſely call a new coined goſpell: we may well wonder, that any man that hath any ſparke of knowledge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhould beleeue theſe foreſaid falſe goſpels. We may alſo wonder that men indued with reaſonable ſoules and ſenſes, being the handy worke of God, ſhould bow downe and worſhip a ſtone and ſtock, which hath neither ſoule nor life; hath eyes and ſeeth not; eares and heareth not &amp;c. and is the workemanſhip of mans hands, eſpecially being ſo plainely and expreſly forbidden in Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">

But of theſe iuglings I will write no more at this preſent, God may giue occaſion hereafter more largely to intreate of them. At theſe things we may wonder, but yet we do not ouermuch meruaile and wonder at them, for that the ſpirit of God by Saint <hi>Paule</hi> hath foreſhewed vs, that the time would come, when men ſhould turne away their eares fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whereas you requeſt that he that ſhall anſwere this your pamphlet, will do it briefely, orderly, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, I will indeuor to do the two laſt as God ſhall inable me. But concerning breuitie, I will vſe my libertie, and peraduenture more largely lay downe your abſurdities, then you would be willing I ſhould do. But whereas you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7249:9"/>
ſay, that you make this requeſt, for that you perceiue that the Proteſtants cannot anſwere with breuitie, becauſe their religion lacketh both certaintie and perſpicuitie: I ſay that with one breath you do vtter two vntruthes, or to ſpeake plaine Engliſh, lyes. The firſt that we cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere with breuitie, which how vntrue it is, let it be tried firſt by the briefe and pithie anſweres of that great learned man Doctor <hi>Fulke:</hi> who anſwering many of their bookes, which yet to this day ſtand vndefended, how briefely and pithily he anſwered the ſame, let any man that hath but a graine of indifferent iudgement, conſider and iudge. And particularly I referre them to his anſwere to <hi>Riſhtons</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and to <hi>Allens</hi> booke of Purgatorie, both in one vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume: yea many times in his writings he called them from long and impertinent diſcourſes, to ſhort ſyllogiſmes, whereunto he could neuer bring them. How cloſely that pretious <hi>Iewel</hi> and excellent ornament of this Church of <hi>England</hi> did hold himſelfe to the matter, and how vnlike he was to Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> in his long diſcourſes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, who in his booke intituled, A detection of lyes, &amp;c. diſcourſed two hundred and ſixe whole ſides of paper, onely in preambles and prefaces, before he once ſtept into his matter, as Maiſter <hi>Iewel</hi> truly told him; let the vpright reader indifferently iudge. The like I may ſay of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <note place="margin">Preface to the defence of the Apologie, edition 2.</note> man of famous memorie, Doctor <hi>Whitakers,</hi> who how briefely, ſoundly, and learnedly he hath anſwered <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, Saunders, Duree, Stapleton, William Reynolds,</hi> and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> any man that hath an incorrupt eye may ſee and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. And if <hi>T. W.</hi> be the author of this pamphlet (as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubt but he is) he may remember that one which had conference with him, did write a briefe epiſtle vnto him, and did therein ſet downe ſhort ſyllogiſmes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the controuerſies of prayer to Saints, and the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſſe, and required to haue the like ſhort ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes ſet downe of him for the defence of his aſſertions, and could not receiue one, but a long tedious diſcourſe concerning prayer to Saints, which was confuted, and neuer defended. But whether anſwers be briefe or long,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7249:10"/>
it maketh no matter, ſo that they be learned, ſound and true, to the effectuall confuting of the errour, and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the reader. Now as touching certaintie which you ſay, but do not ſhew, that our religon lacketh: I anſwere and auonch that out Religion is farre more certaine; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant, and agreeable to it ſelfe, then the doctrine of the Church of Rome is: the which if I do not effectually proue hereafter in place more conuenient, I will not require any man (to vſe your owne words) to accept, or affect it. But with what forehead can this man charge our doctrine with want of perſpicuitie, ſeeing he cannot be ignorant how obſcure, darke, and intricate the popiſh religion and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is; as may appeere by their maniſold, both turious queſtions, and intricate diſtinctions, which be their chiefe ſhifts, to elude the plaine truth. And if any would ſee how darke the doctrine and writings of Papiſts are, let him looke into the Schoolemen, <hi>Tho Aquine, Io. Scotus, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander de Hales, Gabriel Biel,</hi> and many ſuch other, amongſt whom he may finde as much certaintie, vnitie, and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitie of doctrine, as he may in holl. But how we ſtudy for perſpicuitie, and ſeeke to make all matters plaine, both in our preachings, and in our writings, auoyding all curious queſtions, and intricate and needles diſtinctions; we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the conſciences of all that reade, and heare vs. As touching your method concerning errours in doctrine, and inordinate affections in maners, if you can prooue that our wits be inueigled with them, and our liues ſtained with theſe, more then we can prooue euen your holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Popes, forſooth <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors, and Chriſtes vicars haue been, you ſhall winne the victorie, You ſeeme to attribute too much to our very naturall faculties, to the iudging and diſcerning of truth propoſed, not conſidering the corruption of our naturall faculties by ſinne, how both the minde is blinded, and the will peruerted.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7249:18"/>
it ſelfe. Now how carefully and diligently we endeuour to doe this, that is to expound the holy Scriptures truely and ſincerely, by the Scriptures themſelues, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, our writings and ſermons doe ſhew, and the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thoſe that reade and heare them can witnes with vs. And this is alſo an argument hereof, that you cannot bring forth any places of the Scriptures which we falſely expound, or ſeeke violently and wickedly to wreſt from the true and ſimple ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt, contained in the holy Scriptures. The which this cauiller ſhould haue done, and thereby declare how we builde our faith vpon priuate and falſe expoſitions. But let vs ſee and examine his proofe of his Minor, which is, that becauſe we builde not our faith vpon the expoſition of the Church, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Councels; therefore we builde vpon our owne priuate expoſitions. I anſwere, that although we reuerence the iudgement of the true Church of God, the holy Fathers and Councels, yet by this that I haue before alledged it plainely appeareth, that we are to fetch the ſenſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Scriptures, not from them, but from the Scriptures themſelues. And whereas you by the Church doe meane the Romiſh Church, I will ſhew hereafter that ſhe hath corrupted and falſely expounded the Scriptures. As touching the Doctors, we are not bound vnto their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which ſometimes be not ſound, and ſometimes differ among themſelues: Yea Cardinal <hi>Caietanus</hi> plainely <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Card. Caietanus in praefatione in lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Moſis.</hi>
                  </note> auoucheth this, and doubteth not to bring ſometimes ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and expoſitions to the Scriptures which be not in all the Doctors. His words be theſe: <hi>Nullus itaque deteſtetur nouum ſacrae ſcripturae ſenſum; ex hoc quod diſſonat à priſcis doctoribus. Sed ſcrutetur perſpicacius textum ac contextum ſcripturae, &amp; ſiquadrare inuenerit, laudet Deum, qui non alliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit expoſitionem ſcripturarum ſacrarum priſtorum doctorum ſenſibus, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Let no man hereupon deteſt or diſlike a new expoſition of the holy Scripture, becauſe it diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from the ould Doctors. But let him more ſharpely ſearch the text and Coherence of the Scriptures, and if he finde it to agree therewith, let him praiſe God, who hath
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7249:18"/>
not bound the expoſition of the holy Scriptures to the ſenſes and expoſitions of the ancient Doctors. Yea Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> a great patrone of the Popes doubteth not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <note place="margin">10. <hi>Roffenſ. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.

Moreouer, whereas Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his foure bookes <hi>de doctrina chriſtiana</hi> entreateth largely of the expoſition of the Scriptures, and giueth many good and learned leſſons concerning the ſame, and namely ſeuen rules of <hi>Ticonius</hi> the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> which he commendeth, and calleth them keyes to open the Scripture, neither he nor <hi>Ticonius</hi> doe make mention of theſe rules, which the author of this pamphlet doth here ſet downe, nor referre vs vnto them. Therefore theſe be new coined rules of your owne, voyde of the teſtimonie of antiquitie. But that the Chriſtian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may ſee, who they be that builde their faith vpon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and falſe expoſitions of the Scripture, let vs come to the examination of ſome particular places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſee who they be that follow priuate and falſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. The wordes of our Sauiour Chriſt: <hi>drinke ye all of</hi>

                  <hi>quod petimus prius obtineamus:</hi> that is, Seuenthly the body of Chriſt is lifted vp to ſhew the goodneſſe of Chriſt: for what greater goodneſſe is there, then that Chriſt vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth to be priſoner vpon the Aultar: whereupon he ſaith in the perſon of <hi>Hieremie</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Behold, I am in your hands; that which is good and right in your eyes, doe yee vnt me.</hi> Note that when any captaine is kept priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for his people, he is held priſoner, and not let goe, vnleſſe he giue a great ſumme of money. So alſo we ought not to let Chriſt our priſoner goe, vnleſſe he giue vnto vs forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and that we receiue of him the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen. Therefore the prieſt doth lift vp the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt vpon the Aultar; as though he ſhould ſay: behold, hee whom the whole world is not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, is our priſoner, therefore let vs not let him goe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we doe firſt obtaine of him that which we require. This place I thought good the more largely to lay downe, that the reader may ſee what diuine doctrine theſe Romiſh Saints haue deliuered, and how finely they haue applied the Scriptures. By this doctrine Chriſt is priſoner in the Maſſe, and he muſt not be let goe vntill he haue paied his ranſome. And this is ſubſtantially proued out of <hi>Ieremie</hi> chap. 26. where <hi>Ieremie</hi> hauing preached the word of God, and denounced his fearefull plagues againſt Iuda and Ieruſalem, the prieſts and people tooke him and went about to kill him, to whom <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſpake ſaying: <hi>The Lord</hi>

But know yee for certaintie that if yee put me to death, yee ſhall bring innocent bloud vpon your ſelues, and vpon this Citie, and vpon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof: For of a truth the Lord hath ſent me vnto you, to ſpeake all theſe words in your cares.</hi> Is not this place finely expounded, and applyed, and doth it not ſubſtantially proue that Chriſt is in the prieſts hands at Maſſe, when

And if the author of this pamphlet, or his companions, can charge vs with the like, then they may truely ſay that we haue followed priuate expoſitions, and be Infidels.

               <p>Where you ſay that we reiect Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and other Fathers, who bring Scripture to proue prayer for the dead, I anſwere, that we refuſe not the alledging of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by any, but vpon good and ſound reaſon, which we will be readie to iuſtifie and maintaine. If you thinke ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in that booke <hi>de cura pro mortuis</hi> which you quote (which is more full of doubtes, then of ſound proofes out of the Scripture) or other Fathers haue any plaine places of Scripture to prooue prayer for the dead, you may produce them, vrge them, and make ſyllogiſmes of them, and we will anſwere them. But you ſpeake many
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7249:23"/>
things generally, and proue few particularly and pithily: For vs to proue and examine by the Scriptures, the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Fathers, is no fault. For if the ſpirit of God commend that good people of Berea for examining <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching by the Scriptures, we cannot be worthily bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for examining the writings and expoſitions of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11.</note> Fathers by the Scriptures, as long as it cannot be proued, that we doe otherwayes, then accept the good, and reiect the euill. So Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking of the writings of godly Fathers ſaith: <hi>Hoc genus literarum ab autoritate canonis diſtinguendum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> This kinde of writing is to be diſtinguiſhed from the authoritie of the canon of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. epiſt.</hi> 48.</note> Scriptures. For they be not ſo read as though a teſtimonie were ſo alleaged out of them, that we may not thinke or iudge otherwiſe, if they haue any where otherwayes thought then the truth required. For we are of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them which doe not diſdaine to accept to our ſelues that which was ſaid of the Apoſtle. If you be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded God ſhall reueale the ſame vnto you.

tranſlated them, but becauſe the ſpirit of God doth beare witnes vnto my hart, that moſt holy, pure, and diuine doctrine is contained in them. And therefore to ſay that thoſe which vnderſtand not the Hebrew, and Greeke tongues, becauſe they vſe the word of God tranſlated to them into other languages, doe rely their faith vpon the Miniſters credit and fidelitie, and haue no faith, is moſt fooliſh and abſurd. And let the Chriſtian reader marke and conſider how this ſottiſh reaſon tendeth to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting not only of vs, but alſo of the moſt part of all godly and faithfull Chriſtians in all ages; yea and to the moſt of the godly Doctors and Fathers of the Church, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all ignorant of the Hebrew tongue, and ſome of the Greeke alſo. The holy Scriptures were tranſlated into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tongues, in the which the people of God did reade and heare them.

Did the ancient faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtians which read and heard the holy Scriptures in theſe ſundrie languages, rely their faith vpon men that did tranſlate them, or vpon the diuine doctrine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of God contained in them? And let this cauiller ſhew ſufficient reaſon, why we are not either to be acquited with them: or they condemned with vs. They could no more iudge of the truth of the tranſlations, then our people can: yet they did to their great comfort, and godly inſtruction and edification reade and heare the holy Scriptures, grounding their faith not vpon the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators, who might be, and ſometimes were euill men; but vpon the ſound, holy and heauenly doctrine therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.

They were not able to iudge of the tranſlations otherwayes, then to diſcerne and perceiue that the doctrine by them deliuered was pure and holy, agreeable to true faith, and godly life. And euen ſo they that be godly in theſe dayes, although they, hauing not the knowledge of the Hebrew and Greeke tongues, cannot iudge ſo exactly of tranſlations, and of the truth of them, as thoſe that vnderſtand them can; yet they may diſcerne whether the tranſlations deliuer ſound and holy doctrine conſonant to true faith, good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the generall heads and principles of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or not.

But yet if any of theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Catholikes will pretend to build their faith vpon the Scriptures, and being ignorant of the Hebrew and Greeke tongues, readeth either the vulgar Latine or Engliſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh tranſlation of the new Teſtament, I would aske how he doth know whether theſe tranſlations be true or falſe, or whether he will ſay that his faith dependeth vpon the credit and fidelitie of the tranſlator or no? But I know what they will anſwere, that the Latine vulgar tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7249:26"/>
is allowed by the Church, that is to ſay, by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Counc. Trident. Seſſi.</hi> 4. <hi>decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> 2.</note> of Trident which repreſenteth the Church, which hath decreed the ſame to be taken for authenticall in readings, diſputations, ſermons, or expoſitions, and that no man be bold or preſume vpon any pretence to reiect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it: whereunto firſt I ſay, that as this decree doth allow the Latine, ſo it doth not approue the Engliſh. Now how ſhall an Engliſh Catholike, that vnderſtandeth not the Latine know whether the ſame be truely tranſlated out of the Latine or no, or ſhall his faith here rely vpon the credit and fidelitie of the tranſlator? I would know what difference there is betweene ſuch a one reading or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that tranſlation, and one of vs reading or hearing ours: And why the faith of the one doth more depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credit and fidelitie of the tranſlator, then the other. Surely this difference there is, that our tranſlations be true, and agreeable to the originall of the Greeke, wherein the holy Ghoſt indited, and the Apoſtles did write the new Teſtament: and their ſaid Remiſh tranſlation is falſe differing from the ſame, in contradictions, additions, and detractions in very many places, as I haue ſhewed in a diſcourſe thereof added to the confutation of the ten fooliſh reaſons, which the Remiſh vſe in the preface of the Teſtament by them ſet forth, which moued them in tranſlating to leaue the originall fountaine of the Greeke, and to follow the corrupt ſtreame of the Latine, which hath been extant in print theſe twelue yeares, and yet to this day neuer anſwered. Now as touching the decree of the councell of Trident for the Latine, made by about fourtie blind Biſhops or Buſſards, I ſay, it is a ſhameful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and a fit one for ſuch a councel, and ſuch a one as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſhewed in any of all the councels, that haue bin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Church of Chriſt, to authorize a tranſlation ſo much differing &amp; diſſenting from the Hebrew and Greeke as it doth, to be authenticall, that is, to haue authoritie of it ſelfe, and not to be refuſed in any readings, preachings, &amp;c. The which tranſlation is ſo corrupt and full of faults, that <hi>Iſodorus Clarius</hi> a Spaniſh Monke profeſſeth that he found
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7249:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eight thouſand faults in it: the which preface of his as they haue ſince ſuppreſſed, ſo it is written that the Spaniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors <note place="margin">

But to admit that this Latine tranſlation is authenticall as the Tridentine councell hath decreed: I would aske one of theſe Catholikes vpon what edition thereof they will rely their faith, whether that which of late yeares was ſet out at Rome by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift, or another two or three yeares after, by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pope <hi>Clemens</hi> the eight. The which editions doe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ in alterations, additions, detractions, contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Maſter <hi>Thomas Iames</hi> hath verie diligently, and largely ſhewed. The former Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift had as he profeſſeth ſuch care to haue the Bible vncorruptly ſet fourth and printed, that he corrected the faults with his owne hand, and charged that none ſhould afterwards be printed but according to that copie, <hi>Ne minima quidem particula mutata, addita vel detracta,</hi> as he in his preface ſaith, that is, not the leaſt particle changed, added or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted: yet this Pope <hi>Clemens</hi> the eight hath, as I haue ſaid, made many great alterations, additions, and detractions in the ſame.

And here let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether the Pope may erre, or not, for that one of theſe Popes erred, eſpecially Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> notwithſtanding all his great care, and diligence in correcting the Bible with his owne hand, it cannot be denied. Such great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie, diuerſitie, and faithles infidelitie I am ſure that the author of this worthie pamphlet and all his companions cannot ſhew in our tranſlators, which he ſeeketh ſo much to diſcredite. As for <hi>Gregorie Martines</hi> pregnant proofes in his diſcouerie, they belong agoe effectually, and learnedly confuted by D. <hi>Fulke;</hi> &amp; to this day ſtand vndefended. And therefore vntil you haue anſwered the ſame, you may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to brag of his pregnant proofs, which were ſo weak, and cauils ſo greate &amp; many, that he rather diſcouered his owne folly; then diſcredited our tranſlators, What Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> writeth concerning our tranſlation I doe not know, neither do I greatly care: yet this I ſay, although that our tranſlations were made in the feare of God; to profit Gods Church and people, according to the meaſure of the grace of God beſtowed vpon the laborers in that holy worke, &amp; be voyd of wilful corruptions either for doctrine or manners: yet I do not thinke them to be voyd of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in reſpect of proprietie of words, and phraſes, wherein they may be ſome what reformed, and amended. And hard it is to haue a tranſlation ſo exact and perfit, but that ſome ſuch imperfectnes may be in it, which yet be not repugnant either to holy doctrine or good life. And for aſmuch as this man of malice would faine if he could diſcredit our tranſlations, and cauſe the Reader to doubt of the truth of them, I will ſhew not onely the good Chriſtian, but alſo the Romiſh Catholike that hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7249:27"/>
of the Latine tongue, how he may diſcerne and know the truth and faithfulneſſe of our tranſlations, and ſo not to rely vpon the credit of our Miniſters. There is a Latine tranſlation of the old Teſtament made from the Hebrew very well and learnedly by <hi>Sanctos Pagni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> an Italian, and a dominicke Frier, a man excellently learned in the Hebrew tongue (for I will giue him and his worke their due and deſerued praiſe, and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not doe as this libiller, and his fellowes vſe to doe, who of enuie and malice, wherewith their harts be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and poſſeſſed, cannot giue a good word to any thing we doe, though it be neuer ſo good and godly.) This tranſlation he did dedicate to Pope <hi>Clemens</hi> the ſeuenth: Let the Reader compare our tranſlations eſpecially of the latter editions with the ſaid tranſlation, and ſee whether in any ſubſtantiall matter of faith and life, he can finde any corruptions and any great and notorious diſſenſions from the ſame. And the like I may ſay of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new Teſtament dedicated to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, and allowed by him. Let I ſay the Reader compare our tranſlations with theſe, and although he may finde ſome difference in words and phraſes, yet in matters of ſubſtance which concerne either the doctrine of faith, or precepts of good life, I am ſure he ſhall finde a goodly and godly harmonie, and agreement to his comfort and contentation. And laſtly I wil offer to this challenger (who offereth challenge of diſputation with vs) and to al his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, that for one fault of moment or weight, that they ſhal finde in our tranſlations, eſpecially, as I ſaid of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter editions, wherein they differ from the originall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Hebrew and Greeke; I will vndertake to finde fixe, yea ten greater and fouler in that vulgar Latine tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, which the councell of Trident hath moſt abſurdly confirmed and made authentical: And therefore let neither the godly Chriſtian Reader, nor the ſeduced Catholike, be diſſwaded from reading of our tranſlations, nor doubt of the truth of them. But this hath been in all ages the drift of the Diuell to ſecke to diſcredite and diffame thoſe

That all men may erre we doe confeſſe, <hi>Omnis homo Mendax:</hi> that is, all men be liers: and generall councels which conſiſt of men may erre, and haue erred we doe not doubt. But of this it ſhall be impertinent to ſpeake at this preſent. I will onely now retort your argument vpon you: Whoſoeuer relyeth his faith vpon man, hath no faith: but all Engliſh papiſts that vnderſtand not the Hebrew, Greeke and Latine, and reade the Remiſh tranſlation, rely their faith vpon man, <hi>videl.</hi> the tranſlator of that Teſtament: <hi>ergo</hi> all ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh papiſts haue no faith. The like may be ſaid of them that reade the Latine, which rely their faith vpon the councell of Trent who were men. Againe, whoſoeuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeth his faith vpon man, hath no faith: all papiſts rely their faith vpon the Pope, who I trow is a man <hi>ergo</hi> all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts haue no faith. And this ſhall ſuffice for anſwere to your third article.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Proteſtants know not what they beleeue, nor why they beleeue: that they know not why they beleeue, I haue ſhewed before. For that the ground of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe is not the authoritie of Scripture, of councels, of Doctors, nor of the Church, but their owne fancie. And that they know not what they beleeue is manifeſt, becauſe they haue no rule, whereby to know what is matter of faith, and what is not. Some will limit their beleefe to their creede, ſaying, that nothing ought to be beleeued, which is not in the Apoſtles creed. But then I would demaund of them, whether that we ought to beleeue that the Scripture is the word of God? that baptiſme is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? that in the Euchariſt is the bodie of Chriſt by faith? to what article ſhould theſe be reduced, ſeeing they are not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the creed? or how ſhall we know infallibly, how theſe be matters of faith: ſince they are not contained in the creed? others deny ſome articles of their creed alſo: for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants deny three articles of our creed, and the puritans fiue: The firſt is the Catholike Church.</hi> Credo eccleſiam ſanctam Catholicam: <hi>I beleeue the holy Catholike Church, the which in very deede they doe not beleeue: becauſe Catholike is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall,</hi>

                  <hi>and ſo the Church of Chriſt which we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, muſt be vninerſall for all time comprehending allages, and vniuerſall for place, comprehending all nations: but that Church which the Proteſtants beleeue, was interrupted all the ages betwixt the Apoſtles and</hi> Luther, <hi>which was</hi> 1400. <hi>yeares, or in very deede was neuer ſeene before</hi> Luthers <hi>dayes, therefore that Church they beleeue, cannot be Catholike. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it vniuerſall in place, being contained within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bounds of England, which is accompted but as a corner of the world, for the Lutherans in Germanie, the Hugonites in</hi>

                  <hi>Fraunce, and the Guines in Flaunders deteſt their religion as much as the Catholikes; neither will they ioyne iſſue with them in diuers eſſentiall points. And therefore the Proteſtants Church which they beleeue, can no more be called Catholike or vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, then England the vniuerſall world: or Kent the Kingdome of England: or a pruned bough a wheate tree, or a dead finger a man, or a rotten tooth, the whole head. The ſecond article is the communion of Saints, the which they many wayes deny. Firſt by not beleeuing that Chriſt hath inſtituted ſeuen Sacraments, wherein the Saints of his Church communicate: and ſpecially the true and real preſence of our Sauiour Chriſt in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, by which all the faithfull receiuers participating of one</hi>

                  <hi>and the ſelfe ſame bodie, are made one bodie, as all the parts of a mans bodie, are made one liuing thing by participating one ſoule. Secondly they denie the communion of the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant and triumphant by exclaming againſt inuocation of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>we in yearth communicate; we by prayer glorifying them, and they by meditation, obtayning our requeſt. Thirdly, they deny the communion of the Church militant, and the ſoules in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, bereauing them of that Chriſtian charitie, which chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table compaſſion and mercifull pitie requireth, and by naturall affection the members of one bodie helpe one another. The third article is remiſſion of ſinnes, for they acknowledge no ſuch effect in the Sacrament of Baptiſme: but onely count it as an externall ſigne, or ſeale of a prereceiued grace or fauour of God, by his eternall predeſtination, againſt the expreſſe word of God: which therefore calleth this Sacrament the lauer of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that in it the ſoule dead by ſinne is newly regenerate</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>by grace. Moreouer they allow not the Sacrament of penance, wherein all actuall ſinnes committed after Baptiſme are can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled:</hi>

                  <hi>and that which exceedeth all in abſurditie, is to deny that our ſinnes are all perfectly forgiuen, but onely not imputed, and as it were veiled or couered with the paſſion of Chriſt: all the botches, and biles the filth and abomination of ſinne ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and as it were exhaling a moſt peſtiferous ſent in the ſight of God. For let them ſhift themſelues as they liſt, and ſcarfe their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>can couer their deformitie of ſinne, from the pearcing eyes of Gods perfit vnderſtanding, from which nothing can be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Fourthly, the puritanes in effect deny that Chriſt is the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24.</note>

                  <hi>of himſelfe, and not God of God: So that he receiued not his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie from his father. The which poſition flatly taketh away the nature of a ſonne, for the nature of a ſonne is to receiue his ſubſtance of his Father, and it implyeth contradiction: that the ſonne receiueth his perſon of his Father and not his ſubſtance and eſſence, for the ſubſtance of God is eſſentiall to euery perſon in trinitie. Fiftly, finally they deny the deſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt into hell, and deſperately defend that he ſuffered the paines of Hell vpon the Croſſe, whereby they blaſpheme moſt horribly that ſacred humanitie: as if Chriſt had deſpaired of</hi>

Wherefore the Church conſiſteth in thoſe perſons in whom is true knowledge, and the confeſſion of faith and truth.

But now let vs ſee what this man and his fellowes hold, beleeue, and call the Catholike Church, forſooth the companie of all them that receiue and profeſſe the religion and doctrine of the Church of Rome, and ſubmit themſelues to be ruled and gouerned by the Biſhop and Pope of Rome. They that doe not this, be Heretikes, Schiſmatikes, out of <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, and out of the Catholike Church. And hereupon it followeth, that the Chriſtians in Graecia, Muſcouia, Armenia, Aethiopia, &amp;c. where Chriſtianitie hath continued vnto this day, and among whom no doubt but ſome haue been of Gods elect and choſen people, yet be they no Catholikes, nor of the Catholike Church, nor in the ſtate of ſalnation: And why? becauſe they neither haue been nor be ſubiect to the Pope of Rome. For ſo it is with many words ſolemnely defined and determined by that holy and vertuous Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. <hi>Subeſſe Romano pontifici, omni humanae creaturae decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus, dicimus, &amp; dofinimus, &amp; pronuntiamus, omnino eſſe de neceſſitate</hi>

And he that married (as I ſaid before) his owne ſiſter, and <hi>Ferdinando</hi> a king Naples, who maried his Aunt, &amp; king <hi>Philip</hi> of Spaine that maried his Neece, becauſe they did theſe things by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſations <note place="margin">Phil.

Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe doctrines concerning this article of our faith, <hi>I beleeue the holy Catholike Church,</hi> be the ſounder &amp; truer, let the Chriſtian reader vprightly iudge.

               <p>And whereas you would make men beleeue, that the Church whereof we are, is contained within the narrow bounds of England, and that the Lutherans in Germanie, the Hugonotes in France, and the Guines in Flanders (as you terme them) will not ioyne iſſue with vs in diuers eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall points of religion, you doe to the offending of God, &amp; deceiuing of your ignorant reader, vtter two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious vntruths. For we (as I haue ſaid before) confeſſe our ſelues to be members of that holy Catholike Church, which hath beene in all ages, and is diſperſed ouer the world, and we haue communion and fellowſhip with all them in all nations, that feare God and obey his truth, eſpecially in the fundamentall doctrines of religion and ſaluation. But how do you truely confeſſe the Church to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7249:34"/>
be Catholike, that is, vniuerſall, comprehending all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in reſtraining it to the religion and ſubiection of the Pope of Rome, and ſo conſequently to a ſmall part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; vnleſſe you will now of late adde the Weſt Indians, where the Spaniards haue committed moe horrible mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then they haue madagood proſelytes. And what an abſurd ſpeech is this, that you call the Church of Rome the Catholike Church, as if a man ſhould call the Church of Corinth or Epheſus the Catholike Church, which if they were holy, are but members of the Catholike Church. This is therefore that which you vntruly attribute to vs, to call England the vniuerſall world: or Kent the kingdome of England, &amp;c. But the Church of Rome now committing fornication with ſtocks and ſtones, is ſo farre from being the Catholike Church, that it is no true member thereof, as M. Doctor <hi>Raynolds</hi> hath learnedly proued. And that <note place="margin">In his Theſes.</note> theſe whom you contemptuouſly call Lutherans, Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes, and Guines, do diſſent from vs in eſſentiall points of religion, you may eaſily affirme, but ſhal neuer be able to proue. Some indeed in Germanie, whom you call Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, do diſſent from vs in one point concerning the Sacrament of Chriſts bodie and bloud: howbeit you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant, but that manie Churches and countries in Germanie ioyne with vs in that matter. And let the reader reade and examine the confeſſions of faith ſet out by the Churches in France, and in the lowe countries, &amp; they ſhall ſee both how great their agreement in doctrine is with vs, and alſo what a ſhameleſſe ſlaunder this is, which this authour hath according to his accuſtomed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner auouched, but not proued. And moreouer I will offer this iſſue to this man, who thinketh ſo highly of himſelfe, that whereas he ſhall proue that there is diſſenſion among vs in one eſſentiall point of religion and doctrine; I will proue that there is in three at the leaſt among them. And this much for this article.</p>
               <p>The ſecond article of the communion of Saints you ſay we many waies denie. Firſt, by not beleeuing that Chriſt hath inſtitnted ſeuen Sacraments, wherein the Saints of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7249:34"/>
his Church communicate. But why do not you bring ſome plaine proofe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Sauiour Chriſt inſtituted theſe ſeuen Sacraments? ſeeing you ſay that the denying of the is the deniall of this article of our faith. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> going about to terrifie the Chriſtians of Corinth from going to idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous feaſts, by the example of Gods fearefull iudgements and plagues poured vpon the Iſraelites for the like ſinnes: to preuent an obiection which the Chriſtians of Corinth might haue made, that the Iſraelits were not the Children of God ſo much as they, and had not ſuch Sacraments of Baptiſme and of Chriſts ſupper, as they had; and therefore God would not deale ſo hardly with them as he did with the Iſraelites: to take away, I ſay this obiection, he ſheweth that they were Gods people, as well as the Chriſtians of Corinth were, and had the ſame ſacraments in ſubſtance that we haue. For the fathers were vnder that cloud, and al paſſed through the ſea, and were all baptized by <hi>Moſes</hi> in that cloud, and in that ſea, and did all eate the ſame ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1.</note> meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpirituall drinke: for they dranke of the ſpiritual rocke that followed them: &amp; the rocke was Chriſt.

Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> alſo writing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby Chriſt hath tied his people together, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention but of the ſame two, in theſe words: <hi>Primum itaque tenere volo quodeſt huius disputationis caput, dominum noſtrum Ieſum Christum, ſicut ipſe in Euangelio loquitur, Leui</hi>

But to returne to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> place: he there diſſwadeth the Chriſtians of Corinth from going to Idolatrous feaſts, by a reaſon taken from the Supper of our Sauiour Chriſt, ſhewing that as the faithfull by eating that bread which there is broken, &amp; drinking that Cup, are made partakers of Chriſt Ieſus: ſo they that did eate thoſe feaſts ordained to the honoring of Idols, were partakers of Idolatrie there committed, or rather of the Diuell that was there ſerued. And as the faithfull by being partakers of that bread haue communion together, and be made one body, to wit, the myſticall body of Chriſt: ſo they that receiue thoſe Idol bankets, haue communion together, and ſhew themſelues to be of one body, <hi>videl.</hi> of the Diuell. Now as there needed no tranſubſtantiation for the one, no more there doth for the other. Alſo this bread which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body of Chriſt is broken; yet I truſt they wil not ſay, that Chriſts body is broken, although Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> cauſed that excellent man <hi>Berengarius</hi> ſo to confeſſe.

                  </note> of the groſſe and abſurd doctrine of tranſubſtantiation I will ſpeake no more at this preſent. You ſay moreouer that we deny the communion of the Church militant, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, by exclaming againſt inuocation of Saints, by which holy exerciſe thoſe bleſſed Saints in heauen, and we in earth communicate, we by prayer glorifying them, and they by meditation (I thinke it ſhould be mediation) obtayning our requeſts. Hereunto I anſwere, firſt that this inuocation of Saints is vnlawfull, and cannot bee proued by the holy Scriptures. And this offer I doe make you, that if you can bring one plaine place out of all the holy Scriptures, wherein it was euer commaunded, or of any faithfull man or woman vſed, I will yeeld vnto you not onely in this, but alſo in all matters of Religion. You quote in your margent <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 48. 16. and <hi>Apoca.</hi> 1. 4. which make aſmuch for prouing inuocation of Saints, as <hi>Tityre tu patule</hi> doth. The words of the place of Geneſis be theſe: <hi>The Angell which hath deliuered me from all euill bleſſe the</hi>

The firſt out of theſe words, <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell which hath deliuered me, &amp;c.</hi> the other out of thoſe, <hi>let my name be called vpon them, &amp;c.</hi> But yet let the reader note this, that of the Papiſts ſome doe finde the one ſaying, and ſome the other ſo weake, that ſome alledge the one, and ſome the other, and I haue not read any one, that doth vſe them both. <hi>T. W.</hi> in a diſcourſe of this matter alledged the former words of the Angell: and <hi>Ecchius</hi> the latter. To the which I wil briefly anſwere: By the Angel is ment Ieſus Chriſt the Angell of the couenant, as <hi>Malachie</hi> calleth him, and the Angell of the great counſell of God. So doth <hi>Aloiſius Lipomanus</hi> that great Catholike Biſhop of Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na both out of <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> and of himſelfe expound it in theſe words: <hi>Cyrillus, Iacob pueris benedicens deum &amp; patrem &amp;</hi>

Conſiderandum quòd dictio</hi> hagoel <hi>vel redimens vel qui redimit propriè reddi poteſt, quo loquendi modo clariſſimè filius dei mundi generalis redemptor denotatur. Et ſi diligenter aduerteris, tacitè propheta domini ſanctiſſimam inuocat trinitatem, patrem ſcilicet, &amp; ſpiritum S. ſub nomine dei bis repetiti, vnigenitum verò dei filium ſub nomine Angell: Angelum verò intelligit redemptorem, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum diuinum, ſaluatorem noſtrum, vel auxilij diſpenſationis diuinae miniſtrum, ipſe, inquam, ille benedicat pueris iſtis:</hi> That is, <hi>Cyrill. Iacob</hi> bleſſing thy children doth name God both the father which did nouriſh him, and the Angell which did deliuer him, to wit, that Angell, whom <hi>Eſay</hi> calleth the Angell of great counſell, becauſe all bleſſing and all grace deſcendeth no other wayes from God vpon men, but by Ieſus Chriſt. We muſt conſider that the word <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goel</hi> may be tranſlated either redeeming or he that redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, by which phraſe of ſpeech the ſonne of God the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7249:37"/>
redeemer of the world, is moſt manifeſtly ſignified: and if thou diligently marke, thou maiſt perceiue, that the prophet in ſecret ſort calleth vpon the moſt holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to wit, the father and the holy Ghoſt, vnder the name of God twiſe repeated, and the onely begotten ſonne of God, vnder the name of the Angell. For by the Angell he vnderſtandeth the redeemer, the word of God, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour or the miniſter of Gods helpe and diſpenſation; euen he, I ſay, bleſſe theſe children. Hitherto <hi>Lipomanus.</hi> who with that ancient Father <hi>Cyrill</hi> truely vnderſtand by this Angell Ieſus Chriſt, and not any other miniſtring ſpirit, or created Angel. And therefore this place proueth the inuocation of Chriſt, but not of other Angels. By the other words, Let my name be called vpon them, &amp;c. <hi>Iacob</hi> meant nothing elſe, but that <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Ephraim Ioſephs</hi> ſonnes ſhould be counted amongſt his ſonnes, to make vp the twelue tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And euen ſo Frier <hi>Lyra</hi> doth truely expound it in theſe words: <hi>Inuocetur ſuper cos nomen meum, quia vocati ſunt filij adoptiui Iacob, &amp; facti ſunt capita</hi>

This phraſe of ſpeech is ſo vſed in other places of Scripture as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>In that day ſeuen women ſhall lay hold of one man, ſaying, we will eate our owne bread, and we will weare our owne garments: onely let thy name be called vpon vs, and take away our reproch.</hi> Whereby is meant, that he ſhould be their husband, and they counted and called his wiues. The like phraſe is 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Hierem.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore that this expoſition of this place, whereby they go about to proue inuocation of Saints, is a priuate and falſe expoſition, any man may eaſily perceiue; And this is the more euident, for that ſome great papiſts are forced to confeſſe that inuocation of Saints is not commended nor commaunded in al the Scriptures. There is one <hi>Francis Hamilton</hi> a Scot, a papiſt, and fugitiue prior of S. <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Herbipolis</hi> in Germanie, who in a diſcourſe concerning inuocation of Saints writeth thus: <hi>Porro li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hic</hi>

For by what words? of what authors? of what booke? of which teſtament? the new or the old? Saints are commended, prayer which they make to God for vs is commended: but that we ſhould call vpon them, and that we ſhould intreate them to pray for vs, is in no place commended. No place ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſhewed, where it is counſelled. Neither was it couenient that it ſhould be either commended or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled, eſpecially in the beginning of the Church ariſing, leſt chriſtians ſhould be thought to make vnto themſelues after the maner of the gentiles moe Gods: ſeeing they were ſuſpected of Idolatrie for worſhipping the true God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the forme of breade and wine. 83. Is it commaunded? It is not commaunded. Hitherto the words of this Papiſt <hi>Hamilton,</hi> by which it appeareth that inuocation of Saints is not commaunded nor counſelled in the Scriptures, and therefore they doe wreſt them, and bring a priuate and falſe expoſition to them, which ſeeke to proue it by them. You quote alſo in the margent <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 4. where at a man might well wonder, that you would quote a place ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent for this purpoſe, but that it is euer vſuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you and your fellowes in ſuch ſort to abuſe the word of God. The words of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> be theſe: <hi>Iohn to the ſeuen Churches which are in Aſia, Grace be with you and peace from him, which is, and which was, and which is to come,</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:7249:38"/>
                  <hi>and from the ſeuen ſpirits which are before his throne, and from Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> What meaneth this man to alledge this for inuocation of Saints? will he by theſe ſeuen ſpirits vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Saints? either he knoweth little, or he cannot be ignorant that this is expounded of the holy Ghoſt, who although he be in perſon one, yet by the communication of his vertue, and demonſtration of his diuine workes in thoſe ſeuen Churches, doth ſo perfectly ſhew himſelfe, as though there were ſo many ſpirits, euery one working in his peculiar Church. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſet out by Doctor <hi>Tunſtall</hi> Biſhop of Dureſme writeth vpon theſe words thus. <hi>Hic to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta trinitas demonſtratur:</hi> that is, heere the whole Trinitie is ſhewed: and a little after: <hi>Per ſeptem autem ſpiritus, ſpiritus ſanctus eò quod ſit ſeptiformis intelligitur:</hi> that is, By the ſeuen ſpirits the holy Ghoſt is vnderſtoode, becauſe he worketh ſeuen manner of wayes. And hard it were, or rather ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, to pray for grace and peace from Saints, and that before Ieſus Chriſt: But vpon this I will not ſtand; onely the reader may conſider how barren this cauſe is, which hath no plainer proofes, and driueth this man to ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and falſe expoſition of Gods word. Now whereas you ſay that by prayer you glorifie the Saints in heauen: I ſay, that by prayer we doe glorifie God: <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie</hi>

As touching the Saints mediation, when Ieſus Chriſt ſhall ceaſe to be our mediator, and to ſit at the right hand of God to make interceſſion for vs, then we will ſeeke to your mediation of Saints. In the meane time take you heede, that in attributing that to the Saints, which is proper and peculiar to the ſonne of God, yea which he hath bought with his bloud, you doe not deny
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7249:38"/>
the Lord which hath bought vs, and that you doe not horribly diſhonor thoſe Saints, and make Idols of them. Furthermore you ſay that we deny the communion of the Church militant, and the ſoules in purgatorie, &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I anſwer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when you ſhal plainely and pithily proue this your fayned fire of purgatorie (which the Greeke Church alwayes hath denyed) then we wil yeeld vnto you, and graunt our ſelues to be to blame, in not helping theſe ſeely ſoules with dirges, maſſes, &amp;c. out of the paines of this forged fire. You quote in your margent for proofe thereof, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 29. Alas poore purgatorie, that hath no better proofes. The words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt place be theſe: <hi>If a mans worke burne, he ſhall loſe, but he ſhall be ſaued himſelfe: neuertheleſſe yet as it were by fire.</hi> Here is mention of fire, and therfore it muſt needs be the fire of purgatorie: for ſuch is the great iudgement of theſe worthie writers, that if they reade in the Scriptures or Fathers this word fire, it is none other but the fire of purgatorie: if ſacrifice, it is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſſe: if confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it can be nothing but auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confeſſion to the prieſt: if tradition, it is vnwritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities or vanities. But touching theſe places of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the author of this Pamphlet doth not alledge them, but barely quote them, I will but briefely touch them. To the firſt I ſay, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaketh not of all men, but onely of teachers and preachers, which be builders of Gods houſe and Church, which euen <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth. Secondly, he ſpeaketh not of all their workes, but onely <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>contr.</hi> 6. <hi>de purgat. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> of their doctrine whereby they build the Church of God. Thirdly, he ſpeaketh not of the purging of workes or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but of the probation of doctrines. Fourthly, the works are ſaid to be proued, and not the perſons. Laſtly, if this place ſhould be vnderſtood of purgatorie, then euery man ſhould bee throwne into it, for it is ſaid the fire ſhall try euery mans worke of what ſort it is: but this is contrarie to the doctrine of the papiſts, who will not haue all men come into purgatorie. Theſe things plainly ſhew that this place cannot be vnderſtoode of purgatorie: Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in many places doth vnderſtand it of the afflictions
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7249:39"/>
and troubles ſuſtained in this life, and not of the paines of Purgatorie after this life, <hi>Enchir. ad Laurentium cap.</hi> 68. <hi>de ciuit. Dei lib.</hi> 21 <hi>cap.</hi> 26. <hi>de ſide &amp; operibus cap.</hi> 16. <hi>in Pſal.</hi> 80. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of triall of doctrine, ſhewing that as the fire trieth mettals, ſo the light of Gods truth trieth do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines: and as gold and ſiluer abide in the fire, and hay and ſtubble be conſumed: ſo true, ſound, and holy doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines abide the light and triall of Gods word; when either vntrue doctrines or vaine ſpeculations periſh and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.

                  </note> This fire is the word of Chriſt, and it is a good fire, which warmeth, but burneth not but onely ſinnes. By this fire that gold of the Apoſtle laid vpon the good foundation is tried. By this fire that ſiluer of manners or workes is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. By this fire thoſe pretious ſtones are lightened: but the hay and ſtubble is conſumed. Therefore this fire clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſoule, and conſumeth error. Hitherto S. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> whereby we may ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> nor S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expound this place of Purgatorie, much leſſe the Greeke Fathers, who neuer acknowledged it. Therfore to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it of Purgatorie, as the Papiſts do, whether it be not a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate &amp; falſe expoſition, let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly reader vprightly iudge.</p>
               <p>The words of the other place here quoted are theſe: <hi>Elſe what ſhall they doe, which are baptized for the dead: if the dead riſe not at all, why are they then baptized for dead?</hi> To picke Purgatorie pickpurſe out of this place paſſeth my skill. Here is mention made of baptiſme for the dead: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Purgatorie, nor of prayer for the dead. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that there be ſundrie expoſitions of this place: yet I doe not remember that euer I read it expounded of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7249:39"/>
or applied vnto it. And therefore I will write no more at this preſent of it, but wil expect a ſyllogiſme to be made of it for the proofes of Purgatorie, and then I ſhall further conſider what to ſay vnto it. We doe beleeue that they onely be members of that bodie whereof Chriſt Ieſus is the head, which be either triumphing with him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: or be fighting for him againſt Satan, ſinne, and the world here vpon earth.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 12. 0.</note> 
                  <hi>make peace by the blood of his croſſe, and to reconcile the things which are in earth, and the things which are in heauen.</hi> That is to ſay, his whole vniuerſall Church, whereof part was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie in heauen, and part remained behinde vpon the earth. They therefore that be in Purgatorie, be no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his bodie, nor are to be deliuered by him: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes creatures, are either by him (who can at his pleaſure emptie and ſcoure Purgatorie) to be deliuered, or elſe ſtill in that fained fire to be tormented. Neither hath true Chriſtian charitie ſo much, as the curſed couetouſnes of Prieſts, been the bellowes to blow that forged fire for the heating of their kitchens.</p>
               <p>Now that I haue anſwered your reaſonleſſe reaſons of our denying this article of Chriſtian faith, the communion of Saints, I will briefly ſhew what is our beleefe of it. We beleeue that al the Saints of God, and members of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Catholike Church haue communion and fellowſhip with Ieſus Chriſt, and are partakers of all his benefits. Of this communion Chriſt ſpeaketh: <hi>I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>forth much fruite.</hi> Of this ſpeaketh S. <hi>Paul: God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by whom ye are called vnto the fellowſhip of his ſonne Ieſus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt our Lord.</hi> This communion or fellowſhip is wrought by faith, by the which Chriſt dwelleth in the hearts of all his elect and faithfull people, and by which wee be graffed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17.</note> into him to receiue all grace and goodnes from him as the branch doth from the vine or ſtocke. And we beleeue that all the faithfull and godly be knit together in loue, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, whereby they are to communicate thoſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 2.</note> graces and gifts, which God hath beſtowed vpon them, to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7249:40"/>
the edifiyng and helping of others, in ſuch ſort as God hath appointed. Yea we beleeue that all the faithfull haue communion and fellowſhip together in that they haue all one heauenly father, one Ieſus Chriſt their redeemer and mediatour, one holy Ghoſt their ſanctifier, are iuſtified by one faith common to all the elect, dedicated to God by one baptiſme, called by one Goſpell to be partakers of one kingdome of glorie. This is the ſumme of our beleefe concerning this article, wherein wee would know what fault you can finde. But your communion and vnion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in being vnder one Pope of Rome, vnder whoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience whoſoeuer is not, you think he cannot be ſaued, as is before ſhewed; neither will you haue communion with him: And therefore whereas Chriſtianitie hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued (as I ſaid before) in Greece, Ruſſia, Aethiopia, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia, and other countries, amongſt whom no doubt but God hath had, and now hath his elect and choſen people, yet you haue no communion or fellowſhip with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be not vnder your owne Pope. And much leſſe haue you communion with the Saints in heauen, becauſe you haue not the faith of Gods elect. For did the faithfull Patriarkes, Prophets, Apoſtles and others beleeue to be <note place="margin">

               <p>Now let vs ſee the third article of our Creed, which you ſay we denie, which is Remiſſion of ſinnes. Here I beſeech the Chriſtian reader to conſider who they be that denie this article, containing a principall point of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and ſaluation, whether wee or this accuſer with his partners. Wee beleeue, that whereas wee be children of wrath, vnprofitable ſeruants, and prodigall children, that haue ſinned againſt heauen and our heauenly father, and are ſo deeply indebted to God, that wee be neuer able to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7249:40"/>
make payment, for the which he might iuſtly throw vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dungeon of damnation for euer: wee I ſay beleeue that he hath giuen his onely begotten ſonne, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beleeueth in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16.</note> life, by whom wee haue redemption through his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 7.</note> blood, euen the forgiuenes of ſinnes, according to his rich <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 14.</note> grace, and that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs for his names <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 12.</note> ſake. And we beleeue that God of his great mercie in Ieſus Chriſt doth forgiue vs not onely our ſinnes, but alſo the puniſhment due vnto them, and which wee haue deſerued by them, accepting vs for veſſels of his mercie, and heires of his glorie. Now this accuſer of vs, and his companions doe firſt beleeue, that they doe make ſatisfaction to Gods iuſtice for their ſinnes: which is a flat deniall of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of our ſinnes. For whereas our ſinnes be called debts, and ſatisfaction is a paiment; it followeth, that if we doe make ſatisfaction for them, then we neither need, nor can haue forgiuenes of them. For our ſatisfaction, and Gods forgiuenes cannot ſtand together. For euen as if I owe a man a hundreth pounds, and I pay him, he doth not forgiue it; and if he forgiue it, I doe not pay it: So if we by ſatisfaction make paiment to God for our ſinnes, then hee doth not forgiue them; if hee forgiue them, then wee doe not make ſatisfaction for them.</p>
               <p>Now let vs ſee, what is the doctrine of theſe men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this their ſatisfaction, whereby they make pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelues to God for their debts. Biſhop <hi>Fiſher,</hi> whom I ſuppoſe the Pope hath ſainted for ſtanding ſo ſtifly in his cauſe, writeth hereof thus: Thirdly, ſome there <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Fiſher in Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>poenitens.</hi>
                  </note> be, which by grace in this life haue ſo puniſhed themſelues for their offences, that they haue made a ſufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for them. Againe: So doth heartie weeping for ſinne, expell ſinne, and is a ſufficient and iuſt recompence <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> for it. And againe: But whereas any creature haue made due ſatisfaction in this life, he neuer after ſhall ſuffer more <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi>
                  </note> paine, and alſo is cleane out of debt, and nothing after that ſhall euer be claimed of him. Againe, They be called <hi>recti corde,</hi> that haue made ſatisfaction ſo plentifully, that God <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:7249:41"/>
can aske no more of them. And in his Latin booke againſt <hi>Luther</hi> he hath theſe words: <hi>Secundo ſupponimus, quod quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam nemo ſit cui non cumulatius praemium in coelis Deus lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giatur,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Idem in confur. aſſert. Luther, articulo</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>quàm hic in terris ipſe meruit, innumeri tamen ſunt, qui longè grauiores aerumnas pertulerunt quàm adſuorum ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſent delictorum expiationem:</hi> that is, Secondly, wee make this ſuppoſition, that although there is none, to whom God doth not giue a greater reward in heauen, then hee hath merited and deſerued: yet there be many which haue ſuffered farre more grieuous griefes and puniſhments, then would haue ſufficed to the expiation and purging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of their ſinnes. This is their doctrine, and is this to beleeue the forgiuenes of ſinnes? or is it not rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> the Lord Ieſus that hath bought vs? For I may ſay with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that if righteouſnes come by the law (or by <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.</note> our ſatisfaction) then Chriſt died in vaine. And with what face can theſe men accuſe vs of denying this article, The forgiuenes of ſinnes, themſelues teaching ſuch blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous doctrine, ſo manifeſtly oppoſite and contrarie vnto it? Againe, they denie the forgiuenes of the puniſhment due for ſinne, ſaying, that Chriſt hath deliuered vs <hi>à culpa</hi> from the fault or offence, but not <hi>à poena</hi> from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or at leaſtwiſe he hath deliuered vs from eternall puniſhment, but not from temporall, which muſt be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained in Purgatorie, whereby our ſinnes or ſoules muſt be purged, and Gods iuſtice ſatisfied. And yet the Popes Pardons, Maſſes and Dirges may diſcharge and deliuer from it. Wherein firſt, what doe they but extenuate, and greatly diminiſh the vertue and power of Chriſts death? For if our Sauiour Chriſt haue not deliuered vs from the puniſhment due to our ſinnes, what great good hath hee done vs? And if he haue diſcharged vs from eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in hell, but not from the temporall in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then is he not a full and perfect Sauiour, but an halfe Sauiour. Haue you the teſtimonie of all Antiquitie for this doctrine? <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Exempto ſcilicet reatu, eximitur &amp; poena:</hi> that is, The guiltines of ſinne being taken away, the <note place="margin">Tertull. lib. de baptiſmo.</note> puniſhment is alſo taken away. And <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7249:41"/>
                  <hi>Vbi enim gratia, ibi &amp; venia: vbi verò venia, illic nulla erit</hi>

                  <hi>poena:</hi> that is, Where grace is, there is forgiuenes: &amp; where forgiuenes is, there ſhall be no puniſhment. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ablato ergo peccato, auferetur &amp; poena peccati:</hi> The ſin <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. de vera relig. cap.</hi> 13.</note> being taken away, the puniſhment of ſinne ſhall alſo be taken away. By this let it be diſcerned who they be that denie this article of the forgiuenes of ſinne. Moreouer, let the Chriſtian reader conſider how they attribute firſt that to their Purgatorie, which is proper to the blood of Chriſt, which, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, clenſeth vs from all ſinne: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.</note> more to their Dirges, Maſſes, Pardons, and ſuch paltries, then they doe to the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt. For they may deliuer from the paines of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but Chriſts death doth not. <hi>O coelum non ſudas, ô terra, non tremes? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now let vs come to your proofe of this your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of our denying of this article. Your firſt reaſon is, that wee acknowledge no ſuch effect in the Sacrament of Baptiſme, &amp;c. We acknowledge that baptiſme is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the forgiuenes of our ſinnes, by the death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, whereby our faith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and wee aſſured, that as water waſheth away the filth of the bodie, ſo all the filth and guiltines of our ſinnes is ſo purged in the blood of Chriſt, that wee be accepted for iuſt and righteous before God. But we do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Baptiſme, or any other Sacrament, do conferre grace of themſelues, or haue grace included in them as in a veſſell: but wee affirme that they be ſeales of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and inſtruments whereby God worketh in his elect and choſen people thoſe graces, which he hath in his word promiſed, and Ieſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for them. But all that be outwardly baptized, be not inwardly clenſed, as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who being baptized, was yet ſtill in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 8.</note> gall of bitternes, and in the bond of iniquitie. For the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God worketh by them in whom, when, and how much it pleaſeth him. Neither doe we beleeue that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ſerueth onely for the remiſſion of ſinnes committed before it, as you ſay here, but that the vſe and benefit of it,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7249:42"/>
pertaineth to our whole life, continually to aſſure vs, and confirme our faith in the forgiuenes of al our ſinnes by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. And whereas you ſay, that this our doctrine is contrarie to the expreſſe word of God, which calleth this Sacrament the lauer of regeneration, for that in it the ſoule dead by ſinne is newly regenerate by grace: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that Baptiſme is ſo farre from being in this place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſed, that it is not mentioned, neither neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be vnderſtanded. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſweet words be theſe: <hi>When the bountifulnes and loue of God our Sauiour towards man appeared, not by the workes of righteouſnes, which wee had</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>done, but according to his mercie he ſaued vs, by the waſhing of the new birth, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on vs aboundantly through Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour.</hi> Where is baptiſme here mentioned? or expreſſed to be the lauer of regeneration? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth here attribute this waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby wee be regenerate and renewed, to the holie Ghoſt, alluding as it were to the words of God, by the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel: Then will I powre cleane water vpon you,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>and ye ſhall be cleane: yea from all your filthines, and from all your Idols will I clenſe you.</hi> By this cleane water is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ſpirit of God, as it is expounded in the two next verſes following. I confeſſe that Baptiſme is a Sacrament and pledge vnto vs of this waſhing and clenſing of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt, to whom this waſhing is to be attributed, and not to baptiſme, as though it were included in it, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to it: for (as I ſaid) many be outwardly baptized, which be not inwardly clenſed, but only the faithfull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, in whom Gods ſpirit inwardly worketh that, which by the word of God is promiſed, and in baptiſme ſealed and confirmed. And therefore this lauer is the ſpirit of God, by whom we be regenerated and renewed. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith well: <hi>Ea demum miſerabilis eſt ſeruitus ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na prorebus accipere, &amp; ſupra creaturam corpoream oculum</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de doctr. Chriſt. cap.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>mentis ad hauriendum aeternu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lumen leuare non poſſe:</hi> that is, This is miſerable ſeruitude to take the ſignes for the things ſignified, and not to be able to lift vp the eye of the minde aboue the corporeall creature to receiue eternall light.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:7249:42"/>
Your ſecond proofe is, that we allow not the ſacrament Penance, wherin all actuall ſins committed after Baptiſme are cancelled. Your popiſh penance conſiſting in ſhriuing to a Prieſt, receiuing abſolution fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; doing ſome <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, wil worſhippings appointed by him, we allow not: but true repentance, which conſiſteth in vnfained ſorrow for ſinne, earneſt confeſſion with remorſe of conſcience both to God and man offended, and a true reformation and amendment of life we allow and commend, and doe iudge that we can do nothing acceptable to God, which proceedeth not from this true repentance.</p>
               <p>The third thing whereby you would proue that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie this article of remiſſion of ſinnes, which you ſay excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all in abſurditie, is that we denie that our ſins are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly forgiuen, but only not imputed, &amp; as it were veiled or couered with the paſſion of Chriſt, &amp;c. Wherunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that you here bring an abſurd diſtinction. For what difference is there betweene forgiuing, not imputing, and couering and hiding of ſinne? Surely it ſeemeth that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> could find no ſuch ods betwixt them as you dreame of, whoſe words be theſe: <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe wickedneſſe is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, and whoſe ſinne is couered.

Not to ſinne is the iuſtice of God: mans iuſtice is Gods mercie. <hi>Bernard</hi> here ſaith, that the not imputing of our ſins vnto vs, is as much as though they had neuer beene committed: And will you ſay that notwithſtanding the not imputing of them, yet their bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, biles, filth and abomination remaine ſtill, exhaling a moſt peſtiferous ſent in the ſight of God? Is not the ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt able ſo to perfume them and vs, that we and all our actions may be ſweet and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable <note place="margin">

Yet we doe not ſay that we can couer or hide all our ſinnes from the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eing eyes of God: but this we ſay, that euen God himſelfe doth hide them with this robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and looking on vs in the face of Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, doth accept vs his members, for ſuch as Ieſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is.

               <p>Now I come to the fourth Article that you ſay the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes in effect denie, which is no leſſe, then Chriſt to bee the Sonne of God. But who bee theſe Puritanes that bee thus grieuouſly charged? what are their names? why be not their bookes named, and ſayings produced?

We beleeue and <note place="margin">Ex Gall. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſione.</note> acknowledge one onely God, who is one onely and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple eſſence, ſpirituall, eternall, inuiſible, immutable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, incomprehenſible, almightie, moſt wiſe, good, iuſt, and mercifull; and that in that one and ſimple diuine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, there be three perſons ſubſiſting, the Father, the Son and the holy Ghoſt. The Father the firſt cauſe in order, and the beginning of all things; the Sonne his wiſedome and euerlaſting word: the holy Ghoſt his true power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie. The Sonne begotten of the Father from euerlaſting: the holy Ghoſt from euerlaſting proceeding from the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7249:44"/>
Father and the Sonne: which three perſons are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, but diſtinct; and yet not deuided, but coëſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall, coëternall, and coëquall. If you miſlike any thing in this confeſſion confute it: if you know any of vs that maintaine any diuers doctrine diſſenting from this, name them, produce their ſayings, and quote the places. But you ſay that theſe (whom you terme puritanes) perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily affirme, that Chriſt is God of himſelfe, and not God of God: So that he receiueth not his diuinitie from his father. I anſwere, that if we conſider of Chriſt abſolutely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the eſſence, he is <gap reason="foreign">

Why doe you then ſay that they deny it? forſooth becauſe they receiue not your expoſition of it, to wit, that Chriſt deſcended in ſoule to Hell, and was there as long as his body was in the graue, and there harrowed Hell, and deliuered thence <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Picus</hi> that learned Earle of Mirandula, and Cardinall <hi>Caietane,</hi> (whom the Pope ſent into Germanie to ſuppreſſe <hi>Luther)</hi> deny this article, who concurre and agree with <hi>Durand:</hi> yea I might ſay that then either Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> or <hi>Ruffin</hi> denyed this article, who expoundeth it of Chriſts buriall. But you ſay that theſe nameles Puritans defend that Chriſt ſuffered the paines of Hell vpon the croſſe, whereby they blaſpheme moſt horribly that ſacred huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, as if Chriſt had deſpaired of his ſaluation, as if God had hated him, and he had hated God, &amp;c. I anſwere that this doctrine of Chriſts ſuffering the paines of Hell vpon the croſſe, is not ſo deſperate, as your collections thereof are falſe, and blaſphemous. What deſperatnes or abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is this, that Chriſt our Sauior, not in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but in that he became our ſuretie, and tooke vpon him our debts, and bare our ſinnes in his bodie vpon the wood as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, did beare and indure in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> the wrath of God, and the paines and torments which our ſinnes had deſerued, to deliuer vs from the wrath of God which we by our ſinnes had prouoked, and from the ſaid paines and torments which we had merited. We are not to thinke, that Chriſt did ſuffer onely an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and corpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ral death, for then he had ſhewed greater weakenes, then many meere natural men haue done, who with great courage and cheerefulneſſe haue gone vnto death: but Chriſt our Sauiour was in ſuch an Agonie, that his ſweate was like drops of bloud trickling downe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 44. <hi>verſ.</hi> 43.</note> to the ground, ſo that an Angel appeared from heauen <note place="margin">

                  <hi>he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was broken for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities: the chaſtiſement of our peace was laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and with his ſtripes we are healed. All we like ſheepe haue gone aſtray: we haue turned euery one to his owne way, and the Lord hath laid vpon him the iniquitie of vs all.</hi> Did not our Sauiour Chriſt heerein ſuffer the puniſhment which was due to our ſinnes? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt hath redeemed vs from the curſe of the law being made a curſe for vs: for <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Galath.</hi> 3. 13.</note> it is written, <hi>Curſed is euery one that hangeth on the tree,</hi> yet Ieſus Chriſt was neuer accurſed of his Father; but he bare in his body and ſoule, the curſe that was due to our ſinnes, to deliuer vs from the curſe of God, and to purchaſe to vs the bleſſing of God. But theſe men (who otherwayes are ſo full of curious diſtinctions) doe herein erre, becauſe they doe not with Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that which appertained to Chriſts owne perſon, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. in pſal.</hi> 21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and that which he ſuffered in the perſon and place of vs, the which if this writer or rather ſlaunderer had done, he might haue abſtained from theſe his blaſphemous collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his owne, and not our aſſertions: As if Chriſt had deſpaired of his Saluation, or God had hated him, &amp;c. Whereunto I anſwere, that Chriſt was farre from ſuch deſpaire, which properly is a ſinne in the reprobate, and not a puniſhment of Gods iuſtice. And we hould that our Sauiour Chriſt ſuffered in our perſon, and for vs thoſe torments, which are righteous puniſhments of Gods iuſtice againſt ſinne, and not ſuch as properly bee ſinnes in the deuils, and in wicked and reprobate men, as are deſpaire and hatred of God. And therefore we confeſſe with our mouthes, and beleeue with our harts, that Chriſt was neuer hated of his Father, but alwayes the deerely beloued Sonne of God, in whom he was alwayes well pleaſed. But he hated ſinne, the which as man had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſo in mans nature Gods iuſtice was to be ſatisfied. The which for that corrupt and ſinfull man was not able to performe, the Sonne of God as I ſaid, became our ſurety, tooke vpon him our nature, and in the ſame hath ſuffered vpon the croſſe, the puniſhment of Gods anger due to our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7249:46"/>
ſinnes, and thereby hath ſatisfied Gods iuſtice, pacified his anger, and purchaſed his loue and mercie to all thoſe that truly beleeue in him. And ſo Chriſt was tormented with anguiſh of minde, not for his ſinnes, as you falſely gather, but for our ſinnes, which hee bare in his bodie and ſoule vpon the croſſe: and God was not enemie to God, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to our ſinnes, which were imputed to Chriſt, that his ſatisfaction and righteouſnes might be imputed vnto vs. To conclude, we beleeue that Chriſt ſuffered vpon the croſſe thoſe puniſhments of ſinne which proceede from Gods iuſtice, and be no ſinnes, which in ſome ſenſe may be called the paines of hell, becauſe that as Chriſt by his Deitie ouercame them, and it was impoſſible for him to be held and ouercome of them: ſo the diuell and the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſhall eternally indure them. And this is no deſperate doctrine, but a moſt comfortable doctrine to aſſure vs, that in Chriſt Gods iuſtice is ſatisfied, our ſinnes are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, hell is conquered, and wee from it be deliuered. So that we may with the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>O death where is thy ſting? O hell where is thy victorie?</hi>

A ſimple and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhift: as though the Biſhop of Rome had in thoſe daies power either to call, or confirme Councels any more then the other Patriarks had. In that ſecond Councel of Nice (moſt vnlike vnto the firſt) not only the wicked worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images was allowed, and the Scriptures for the confirmation thereof moſt ſhamefully abuſed and detor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as appeareth by the ſaid corrupt councell, and <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Mart.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7249:49"/>
another of Frankford vnder <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, in which the worſhipping of images was condemned, did erre.

                     <hi>Platina in Ioan.</hi> 10.</note> hope you will not, or cannot ſay, but that one of theſe Councels erred.

Seſſ.</hi> 13.</note> by the prieſts hands, and torne with the teeth of faithfull people: The which is a groſſe, falſe, and blaſphemous doctrine. The Councell of Conſtance erred moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly in taking away the cup of the Lord from the lay people, contrarie to the word of God, and the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of all antiquitie. And that their laſt Councell of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hath fouly erred, and confirmed falſe doctrine, repugnant to the truth of Gods word, and the Canons of ancient Councels, both theſe excellent learned men <hi>Martinus Chemnicius</hi> and <hi>Innocentius Gentilletus</hi> haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed: and we do, and will proue to the conſciences of all thoſe, whom the God of this world hath not blinded. I am not ignorant what colours that Ieſuite <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to caſt vpon the foreſaid errours of theſe Councels, and ſuch others, and what ſimple ſhifts he ſeeketh to elude and auoid them, the which I wil not ſtand here to anſwer, but I will referre the reader to the anſwers of <hi>Lamb. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> and to that excellent man of bleſſed memory D. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers,</hi> where he may find the weakneſſe and nakedneſſe of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſaid ſhifts plainly diſcouered, and the ſame fully confuted, the which I thinke will ſtand (as other of his works haue done) long vndefended.</p>
               <p>Whereas you note in your margent the ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of Nice, Conſtantinople, Epheſus, and Chalcedon, wherin old heretikes were confuted and condemned: and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7249:49"/>
thereby claime them to appertaine to your Church. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that as it is moſt certaine, that thoſe Councels were not called, not gouerned and directed by the Biſhops of Rome, as now by vſurpation they are; ſo you ſhall neuer proue, that thoſe godly and learned fathers agreed with you in manie great and principall points of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. It were eaſie to ſhew that ſundry things were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by them, which be receiued and vſed by you: And therefore you vainly brag of their names, whoſe doctrine and proceedings you haue forſaken: neither haue you ſo much by diſputation in Councels, as by cruel perſecution through fire and fagot ſuppreſſed ſuch as in all ages haue complained of your idolatry and abominations, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth by hiſtories.</p>
               <p>As it is true that we admit the holy Scripture, or rather the holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking in the Scripture, to bee the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme vmpier and Iudge in matters of controuerſies, and acknowledge him to be the onely infallible interpreter of his own words; ſo is it falſe, that we admit no other iudge, but remit al to euery mans priuate ſpirit, and ſingular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. We ſay, that as the holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures is the high infallible iudge and interpreter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: ſo we acknowledge inferiour Iudges and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters both priuate and publike. Euerie man is a priuate iudge to diſcerne and iudge of the doctrine which he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth or readeth in the Scriptures.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7249:50"/>
in the Scriptures, and the voyce of ſtrangers, deliuering a ſtrange doctrine differing and diſſenting from the ſame, ſuch as is the falſe doctrine of the Church of Rome. We alſo admit publike iudges of controuerſies, both ſeuerally, as learned Biſhops, paſtors, and doctors; who may giue their ſentences and iudgements in matters in queſtion: and coniunctly, when they be aſſembled in Synodes and Councels to examine queſtions of greater difficultie, and to decide the ſame. How beit their iudgements be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible (for all men be lyars, and ſubiect to ignorance and errour) neither haue they any abſolute power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie <note place="margin">

But your meaning is, that the Pope with his Councell is the ſupreme vmpire and iudge in matters of controuerſie, and the infallible interpreter thereof. How they haue moſt falſly interpreted the Scriptures, I haue in ſome part ſhewed before: and that he who is a partie, and whom a great part of Chriſtendome doth accuſe to bee Antichriſt, and guilty of moſt grieuous crimes, as of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, idolatrie, tyrannie ouer the Church, ſacrilege, treaſon, &amp;c. ſhould be iudge in this his owne cauſe, is againſt all <note place="margin">Vide Brutum Fulmen.</note> law and reaſon. It is written in your owne Canon lawe, <hi>Si Papa cum aliquo cauſam habet, non debet ipſe eſſe iudex. i.</hi> If the Pope haue matter with any other, he ought not himſelfe to be iudge.

The Donatiſts affirmed the Church to haue periſhed from the reſt of the world, and to haue remained onely with them in Africa: Doe not the Papiſts in like manner affirme on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly them to be the Church of God, which in a part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope be vnder the obedience of the Biſhop of Rome, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe now they will adde the Weſt Indians, of whom as the Spaniards haue murthered many millions: ſo perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture a few be either perſwaded or coacted to profeſſe Poperie, and ſubmit themſelues to the Pope of Rome. But the Chriſtian Churches in Grecia, Aethiopia, Armenia, Muſcouia and other countries, they acknowledge not for
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7249:53"/>
the Church of God: becauſe they doe not ſubiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the Church of Rome: we acknowledge al them to be of the Church of God, which in all the world hold the truth in the chiefe and fundamentall points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion. The Pelagians held, firſt, that the grace of God, whereby wee be deliuered, is giuen according to our merits. Secondly, that the law of God may be fulfilled of vs. Thirdly, that wee haue free will: the Papiſts herein be ſo like to them, that as they maintaine in effect the ſame matters, ſo for the defence of them they alleage the ſame places of Scriptures now, as the Pelagians of old time did, as appeareth by the writings of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> againſt them. <hi>Nestorius</hi> did (as <hi>Theodoretus</hi> writeth of him) trouble and intangle the ſimple and plaine doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine <note place="margin">

How the Papiſts haue herein ioyned with him, and by their curious Queſtions, and vaine Sophiſtications, haue troubled and peruerted the pure, ſimple, and plaine faith of Chriſt, by their Schoolemen it doth euidently appeare. <hi>Entyches</hi> confounded the two natures in Chriſt, and the properties peculiar to them: So doe the Papiſts, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt to be at one inſtant in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, and infinite places of the earth, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper vnto the Deitie. This ſhall ſuffice to ſhew that the Papiſts be liker to theſe olde heretikes then wee are, whoſe doctrine wee abhorre, and be farre further from it, then they be. Yea I may not onely truly ſay, but can alſo plainly proue Poperie to be an hotchpotch of old hereſies long agoe condemned in the Church of God. The which as I did once in publike place ſhew, ſo I may (if it be the will of God) hereafter more plainly and plentifully proue.</p>

and more confirmed, and our aſſurance thereof increaſed in vs. Laſtly, ſeeing wee daily ſinne, both in doing that which God forbiddeth, and omitting that which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, why ought wee not daily to aske forgiuenes of them? And in praying for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, we deſire all thoſe things which be effects and fruites thereof, as Sanctification and eternall life, &amp;c. And yet wee muſt pray in a true perſwaſion of faith of Gods mercie towards vs to the forgiuenes of our ſinnes not onely paſt, but alſo future and to come. And ſo our praying for the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them, is a crauing of the continuance of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to the continuall pardoning of them, which we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually commit.</p>
               <p>Now whereas hee ſaith, the Maior is euident, and none but an Infidell or mad man would demaund of God, the creation of the world, which hee is aſſured by faith that God hath alreadie created? &amp;c. I anſwere, that none that is well in his wits would make ſuch a fooliſh and abſurd compariſon, as is betweene the asking of God the creation of the world, the incarnation of Chriſt, &amp;c. and the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſinnes. For thoſe are neither commaunded, nor at all to be asked: and will this man ſay, that forgiuenes of ſinnes is not at all of any to be prayed for? Of thoſe things we neede not further to be confirmed, but of the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our ſinnes, our faith had neede to be ſtrengthened, and the feeling thereof in our conſciences to be increaſed. Moreouer (as I ſaid before) for as much as we daily ſin and offend God, wee ought daily to craue Gods mercie in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning our ſinnes. What likenes hath prayer for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, or for the incarnation of Chriſt, &amp;c. herewith? And whereas this man thinketh it ſo abſurd a thing to pray to God to forgiue vs our ſinnes, becauſe wee beleeue the forgiuenes of them, I would aske of him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. <hi>Paul</hi> praying both in the beginning, and in the end of his Epiſtles, for Gods grace to the faithfull, did not aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly beleeue, that they were euen then, and before thoſe his prayers indued with Gods grace? No doubt but hee did beleeue that they were indued with it, for els he would

not haue acknowledged the effectuall faith, the diligent loue, and patient hope of the Theſſalonians, and that they <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 3.</note> were elected of God. Which gifts of Gods ſpirit could not be in them, without the grace of God. Now by this mans diuinitie what a madneſſe was it, for him to pray for grace vnto them, whom hee did beleeue to bee endued with Gods grace alreadie? And where as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Theſe things haue I written vnto you that beleeue in the name</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>of the ſonne of God, that yee may know that yee haue eternall life, and that ye may beleeue in the name of the ſonne of God.</hi> By this mans deepe doctrine, it might ſeeme madneſſe for Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> to write vnto them that did beleeue in the name of the ſonne of God, that they ſhould beleeue in the name of the Sonne of God. But it ſeemed not ſo to S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who writeth to them that as they had bleſſedly begunne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in the name of the Sonne of God, ſo they might ſtill continue, grow, and increaſe in the ſame faith. Moreouer alſo I would aske of this man and his fellowes, whether they praying do beleeue the forgiuenes of their ſins? if they doe not, then are they Infidels, and deny the article of the creede, I beleeue the forgiuenes of ſinnes, which before he falſely obiected to vs. If they doe beleeue the forgiuenes of their ſinnes, why doe they then (by this mans doctrine) pray for it? If he ſay, that he beleeueth that there is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie, a forgiuenes of ſinnes, but particularly he is not aſſured by faith, of the forgiuenes of his owne ſinnes; then what doth his faith differ from the Diuels faith? who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth and trembleth, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith: and what is this his doubting, but (as he himſelfe here ſaith) flat infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie? <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iame.</hi> 1.</note> And no meruaile though theſe men feele in their harts no aſſurance of faith, for that they ground it not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vnmoueable rocke of Gods promiſe, but vpon the vnſure ſand of their owne workes and ſatiſfactions, by the which indeede neither can their faith be aſſured, nor their conſciences quieted. The which falſe doctrine, while they beleeue, I would know how they can aske forgiuenes of their ſinnes? for whoſoeuer maketh ſatiſfaction to God for them, needeth not to aske forgiuenes of them. But the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7249:57"/>
Papiſts maintaine that they make full ſatiſfaction to God for them (as I haue before ſhewed) therefore I may much more iuſtly ſay, then he doth here, that it is madnes to aske forgiuenes of them.

For euen as moſt pure water flowing through a filthie ſinke or priuie, is made foule, filthie, and ſtinking: euen ſo theſe workes, prayer, faſting, &amp;c. which be good workes commaunded of God, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their faithles and wicked hearts and bodies be ſo defiled, that they be but filthie ſinnes in the ſight of God.</p>

&amp;c. He that killeth a bullocke, is as if he ſlew a man: he that ſacrificeth a ſheepe, as if he cut off a dogges necke, &amp;c. Theſe ſayings ſhew that euen the ſacrifices commaunded in the law of God, were wicked and abominable, when they were offered of wicked and prophane perſons voyde of true faith and repentance. So it is in the prophet <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai:</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes, Aske now the prieſts concerning the law. If one beare holy fleſh in the skirt of <note place="margin">

And the prieſts anſwered and ſaid no. Then ſaid <hi>Haggai,</hi> if a polluted perſon touch any of theſe things, ſhall it be vncleane? and the prieſts anſwered and ſaid, it ſhall be vncleane. Then anſwered <hi>Haggai</hi> and ſaid, ſo is this people, and ſo is this nation before me, ſaith the Lord: and ſo are all the workes of their hands, and that which they offer here is vncleane. Agreeable to this is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>Vnto the pure are all things pure, but vnto them that are defiled, and vnbeleeuing is nothing pure,</hi>

without the chiefeſt good, which is God. By this the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian reader may ſufficiently ſee, how falſe the doctrine of the Papiſts, and namely of our fine and delicate Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites is, who teach (as their proctor <hi>Andradius</hi> one of that <note place="margin">

Let the godly reader compare theſe ſayings of this Iebuſite, with thoſe alledged before out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ancient Fathers, and diſcerne which is more ſound and agreeable, not to the blinde reaſon of man, but to the will of God reueiled in his word. Secondly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the workes of there generate, that belong to Gods election and mercie, we ſay, that although they be done with imperfection, and not ſo fully, with their whole ſoule, hart, and minde, as they ſhould be; but carrie the touch of mans corruption, and are not able to abide the ſtrict &amp; ſtreight iudgement of God: yet becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from harts purified by faith, and ſanctified in ſome meaſure with Gods holy ſpirit, they pleaſe God, and the <note place="margin">

Theſe workes be commaunded of God, who commaundeth no ſinnes. We ſay that the corruption of our nature, which is but in part and imperfectly regenerate in this life, doth creepe into them; and therefore they be not ſo purely &amp; perfectly done of vs as God requireth: whereby we acknowledge,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7249:59"/>
that euen the beſt workes we doe had neede of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. So Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith: <hi>Vae etiam laudabili vitae ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum, ſi remota miſericordia diſcutias eam:</hi> that is, Wo be <note place="margin">

Now what reaſonable man will reaſon or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine vs to reaſon thus, that becauſe we doe good workes not ſo purely and perfectly as Gods righteouſneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth and deſerueth, that therefore good workes as prayer, almes deedes, &amp;c. be deadly ſinnes, or are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded of vs.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to examine the proofe of your Minor or ſecond propoſition. You ſay that according to our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and common expoſition of this text of Scripture: we are made all as vncleane, and all our iuſtices are like a ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned cloth: the beſt workes we can doe are infected with <note place="margin">

We indeed expound this place not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of wicked hypocrites, but alſo of the regenerate and faithfull, and ſay that all our owne righteouſneſſe of works is ſo ſtained with the corruption of our ſinfull nature, that it is not able to ſtand before Gods iudgement ſeate, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide his ſeuere triall and examination. For when wee haue done all thoſe things which are commaunded vs, we muſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10.</note> ſay, that we are vnprofitable ſeruants. And if thou O Lord <note place="margin">

                  <hi>generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthines.</hi> Now briefly to anſwere your ſyllogiſme, I reaſon thus: No good workes are to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but faſting, prayer, and almes deedes, being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God, and proceeding from faithfull hearts, are by our doctrine good works: <hi>Ergo</hi> they are not to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7249:60"/>
but diligently in the feare of God to be vſed of vs: but the corruptions of our ſinfull nature which creepe into them, are to be auoided, and reſiſted, and we are to pray vnto God in mercy to pardon them. And ſo we may be aſſured, that as in mercy through Chriſt he hath accepted of vs: ſo he will in like mercie accept our workes as pure and perfit in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>Now I will retort your reaſon vpon your owne head in this ſort: Euery man is bound vpon paine of eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to auoide all ſinne: but faſting, praying and almes deedes, as they be vſed by Papiſts to make ſatisfaction to God for their ſinnes, and to merite and purchaſe heauen, be ſinnes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> faſting, prayer, and almes deedes done in ſuch ſort are to be auoided. The Minor or ſecond propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I proue thus. He that attributeth that to his workes, which is proper and peculiar to Ieſus Chriſt, ſinneth grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly: but to make ſatisfaction for our ſinnes appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth onely to Ieſus Chriſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he that attributeth the ſame to his workes, grieuouſly ſinneth. But I ſhall haue occaſion hereafter more largely to handle this matter, therefore now I omit it, and ſo I will alſo the quotations of <hi>Luther, Caluine,</hi> and <hi>Melanchthon</hi> ſet in the margent, for that they deliuer no other doctrine, but that which I haue before declared, the which I nothing doubt, but it is ſo ſound, that it will indure and abide this mans hammer.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, they defend that men be iuſtified by faith alone, the which</hi> ſolifidian portion <hi>ouerthroweth flatly true repentance, ſorrow for ſinnes, mortification of paſſions, and all other vertues which tend to perfect reconciliation of the ſoule with God, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men only to procure a certaine falſe fantaſtical apprehenſion of Chriſts death and paſſion, the which faith although they er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roniouſly auerre, cannot be ſeuered from charitis, vertues, and good workes; yet both experience teacheth that it may, for alſo few or none haue faith, becauſe few or none of them haue theſe workes: and the Scriptures plainely proue that all faith, yea and the moſt noble faith which hath force to remoue moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, may be without charitie.</hi>

Hereunto I will adde a few places of the ancient Fathers. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith: <hi>Quid boni operari poteſt perditus, niſi quantum fuerit perditione liberatus? Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

Sicut enim qui ſe occidit, &amp;c.</hi> that is, What good can he that is loſt doe, but in as much as he is deliuered from perdition? Can he be reſtored by his free will? God forbid. For man vſing ill his free will, loſt both himſelfe, and it alſo. For as one killing himſelfe, doth kill himſelfe whileſt he liueth, but hauing killed himſelfe, doth not liue, nor can raiſe and reſtore himſelfe being dead: ſo when man ſinned by his free will, ſinne hauing gotten victorie, his free will was loſt. Againe, <hi>Quid tantum de naturae poſſibilitate praeſumis? vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata, ſauciata, vexata, perdita eſt: vera confeſſione, non falſa</hi>

                  <hi>defenſione opus habet. Gratia ergo dei non qua inſtituatur, ſed qua reſtituatur, quaeratur:</hi> that is, What doſt thou preſume ſo much of the power of nature? it is wounded, maymed, vexed and loſt: it hath neede of a true confeſſion, not of a falſe defence. Therefore the grace of God, not whereby the will is ordained, but whereby it is reſtored, is to be ſought. Many ſuch other ſayings he hath in his workes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pelagians, which I omit.</p>
               <p>But this man ſaith, that man may diſpoſe and prepare his ſoule to receiue Gods grace; and this he proueth not by Scripture, but (I will not ſay Aſſedly) by the ſimilitude of a ſicke Aſſe, that cannot diſpoſe, nor prepare himſelfe to ſeeke for his medicine. By this diuinitie men preuent Gods grace, and it doth not preuent them; men firſt ſeeke God, and not God them. For anſwere whereof, I would aske this man, whether it be not with all the of spring of <hi>Adam,</hi> as it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7249:66"/>
was with <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe after his fall. Now whether did <hi>Adam</hi> ſeeke God firſt, or God him: the Scripture ſaith, that God called vpon <hi>Adam,</hi> and that he was ſo farre from <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.</note> ſeeking God, that he and his wife hid themſelues from the preſence of the Lord God. So that if God in mercie had not ſought them, and called vpon them, it ſeemeth that they had neuer ſought nor called vpon God. And euen ſo it is with all his poſteritie, as our Sauiour ſheweth by the loſt ſheepe, whom the Shepheard ſeeketh and bringeth home, the ſheepe nothing diſpoſing nor preparing it ſelfe to ſeeke to the Shepheard, or to returne to the fould. So God ſaith: <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not.</hi> Did <hi>Peter</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65. 1.</note> repent vntill Chriſt had looked on him, and the Cock had crowed? What diſpoſition and preparation was in <hi>Paul</hi> to ſeeke the grace of Chriſt? Therefore I may truly ſay, that as <hi>Lazarus</hi> prepared himſelf being dead in graue, to be raiſed vp by Ieſus Chriſt; ſo doe men dead in ſinne, diſpoſe and prepare themſelues to receiue the medicine of Gods grace. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>God which is rich in mercie, through his great</hi>

                  <hi>loue wherewith he loued vs, euen when we were dead by ſinnes, hath quickned vs together in Christ, by whoſe grace ye are ſaued.</hi> To this doctrine the auncient Fathers beare witnes. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith: <hi>Vt totum Deo detur, qui hominis vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem</hi>

Now if this our doctrine concerning the will of man be the truth of God confirmed both by the word of God, and by the teſtimonies of the moſt learned Fathers, then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blaſphemie it cannot be ſaid to tend vnto looſenes of life, or carnall libertie: it teacheth vs both true humilitie, in acknowledging our owne miſerie and wants, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all to Gods grace and mercie, and to arrogate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our ſelues, and doth it tend to carnall libertie, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7249:66"/>
careles ſecuritie? We are both to exhort others, and alſo to ſtirre vp our ſelues, to feare and ſerue God in holines of life.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. Confeſſ. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 29.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; iube quod vis:</hi> Giue vs O Lord, that which thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeſt vs, and then commaund vs what thou wilt. And therefore they reaſon like doltiſh Aſſes, which inferre vpon the exhortations to grace and godlines which be in the Scriptures, that there is a power and abilitie in vs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thoſe things whereunto God in his word exhorteth vs. Exhortations be Gods inſtruments and meanes which he vſeth, to worke his heauenly graces in vs. I would here end this matter, but that I muſt tell you, that you write improperly and falſely in charging vs, that we ſay all goodnes proceedeth ſo farre from grace, that it lieth not in mans power neither to haue it, nor to refuſe it, but of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie it muſt haue effect. Improperly you write, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>hauing Gods grace,</hi> in ſteede of <hi>obtaining and getting it.</hi> We ſay, it is in man to haue it, when God doth giue it, without which gift it is not in mans power to get it.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7249:67"/>
God is offered to men, when his word is preached, and they be called to repentance; but it is with many, and namely you, as <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſaith: <hi>They refuſed to hearken, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zachar.</hi> 7. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>pulled away the ſhoulder, and ſtopped their eares, that they ſhould not heare. Yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant ſtone,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">As the Papiſts doe now.</note> 
                  <hi>least they ſhould heare the Law and words which the Lord of hosts ſent in his ſpirit by the ministerie of the former Prophets.</hi> I know no man that denieth, but ſuch men doe reſiſt the grace of God, which yet is receiued of them that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the booke of life, whoſe wils it reformeth, and of euill wils maketh good wils, willing and couering thoſe things which be acceptable in Gods ſight. Finally, I thought good for the better ſatisfying of the reader in this matter, to let him vnderſtand: that wheras <hi>Eraſmus</hi> (a man as all men muſt needs confeſſe of great learning) was had in ielouſie of the Papiſts, as too much leaning to <hi>Luther</hi> and his doctrine, he was at the laſt prouoked and ſet on by them to write againſt him: who chuſing this matter of free will, and writing in defence thereof, yet afterward he retracted and reuoked his former opinion and writing, and was not abaſhed to confeſſe the truth, as appeareth by theſe his words. <hi>Verum vt ingenuè dicam; perdidimus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berum</hi>

We haue loſt our free will: in that matter my minde did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to me one thing, and my hand did write another.</p>
               <p>I come now to the ſecond doctrine of ours, which you vntruely charge, and falſely ſlander to tend to looſenes of life, and carnall libertie, that men be iuſtified by faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which you ſcornefully call a <hi>ſolifidian</hi> portion, and falſely ſay, but doe not proue, that it flatly ouerthroweth true repentance, ſorrow for ſinnes, mortification of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all other vertues, which tend to the perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of the ſoule with God, &amp;c. Where firſt I would exhort you (if the ſame might any thing preuaile with you) to take heed that by ſcorning in this manner at Gods truth, you ſhew not your ſelfe to be one of them that ſit in <note place="margin">

                  <hi>are prepared for the ſcorners, and ſtripes for the backe of fooles.</hi> Secondly, as this doctrine which you deride is true, godly, and comfortable, confirmed by the word of God, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers; ſo doth it not exclude, much leſſe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe repentance, or any other good worke, but ſheweth the true and right vſe of them. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a man is iustified by faith, without the workes of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Law.</hi> And in the fourth chapter he reaſoneth thus from <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull: <hi>If Abraham were iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified</hi>

                  <hi>by workes, he hath wherein to reioyce or glory:</hi> But <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> hath not wherein to reioyce or glorie before God. <hi>Ergo, Abraham</hi> was not iuſtified by workes. And after ſaith; To him that worketh not, but beleeueth in him that iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the vngodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſſe. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 16.</note> We know that a man is not iuſtified by the workes of the lawe, but by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, euen we haue belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Ieſus Chriſt, that we might be iuſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the workes of the lawe, becauſe that by the workes of the lawe no fleſh ſhall be iuſtified. This doctrine was neither ſcorned nor denied by the auncient godly Fathers, of ſome of whom I will ſet downe a few ſayings.</p>

               <p>Many ſuch other places out of the Latine and Greeke Fathers I might produce, but I omit them.

Nay this true faith, which neither falſely, nor fantaſtically,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7249:68"/>
but truly and effectually apprehendeth Chriſts death and paſtion, and applieth the ſame as a moſt ſoueraigne ſalue to cure all the ſores of our ſoules, is that which grueth life to repentance, mortification, and all other vertues. For as faith without workes is dead, as S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith: ſo workes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 26. <hi>Cyril in expoſit. Symbol. Nicen. tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Concil. pag.</hi> 543. <hi>Chryſoſt. in</hi> 1. <hi>ad Timoth.

And we truly auerre, that this true faith in Gods mercifull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, by the which Chriſt doth dwel in our hearts, cannot be ſeuered from charitie, vertues, and good workes, as he falſely affirmeth, but faintly and fooliſhly prooueth that it may. His firſt reaſon is taken from experience, becauſe few or none of vs haue faith, for that few or none of vs haue theſe workes. How many or few of vs haue faith and good workes, you are no competent iudge for to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. And therefore wee appeale from your affectionate and erronious iudgement, to the true and iuſt iudgement of God. I doubt not but before I haue ended this article, to proue that we be not ſo void of good workes, &amp; ſo full of abominable wickednes, as your Popes and ſpitefull ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualtie hath been.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond proofe you will draw out of the Scripture, that all faith; yea, and the moſt noble faith which hath force to remoue mountaines, may be without charitie. I <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> anſwere, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh not there of the faith of Gods elect, but of that which is a gift to worke miracles, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.</note> which may be in wicked reprobates, ſuch as <hi>Iudas</hi> was: and ſo doth <hi>Oecumenius</hi> the Greeke Scholiaſt expound it in theſe words: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. i. He ſpeaketh not of the common and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith of the faithfull, but of a certaine gift of faith. For there was a certaine kinde of gift, which by an equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was called faith. So that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as he had before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared charitie with the gift of tongues, and with the gift of propheſying: ſo here he compareth it with the gift of doing miracles. And as thoſe gifts may be in the wicked ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from charitie, ſo alſo may this. Some writers alſo in the former chapter, where S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>To another is giuen</hi>

And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth, that if the whole faith which is in doers of miracles were in him ſeparated from charitie, as it may be, he were nothing. But that faith by which Chriſt dwelleth in the hearts of his elect, neither is, nor can be ſeparated from charitie, but worketh by it.

                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 4.</note> this point, that this doctrine doth not tend to looſenes of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3.</note> life, we teach that they which doe not follow peace and <note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3.</note> holines ſhall neuer ſee God, and that good workes are the <note place="margin">

               <p>The third doctrine of ours, which you vntruly charge <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 10.</note> to tend to looſenes of life, is, That faith once had can neuer be loſt: the which vaine ſecuritie (you ſay) openeth the gap to all libertine ſenſualitie: and hereat you make great exclamations. Here I will firſt cleere the doctrine, and afterward anſwere your vaine cauillations, and needleſſe exclamations. Faith is diuers waies taken in the holie Scriptures. Firſt, it is taken for the doctrine of faith, or the Goſpell which wee beleeue: as, <hi>By whom wee haue receiued</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>grace and Apoſtleſhip, to the obedience of faith among all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> that is, that all nations might obey the Goſpell. Alſo to the Galathians: <hi>This onely would I know of you, Receiued ye the ſpirit by the workes of the law, or by the hearing of faith,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:7249:69"/>
that is, by hearing the Goſpell preached. So wee call the Chriſtian faith, and the Apoſtolicall faith. In this ſenſe faith being taken for the doctrine of the Goſpell: we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that many may know it, make profeſſion of it, and hiſtorically beleeue it, and yet afterwards may fall from it, as <hi>Iudas</hi> and many in Aſia did. Secondly, it is taken for <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.</note> that promiſe which wee make in Baptiſme, whereby wee binde our ſelues to profeſſe true religion, and to beleeue in God, in whoſe name we be baptized. Hereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Refuſe the younger widowes: for when they haue begun to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>waxe wanton againſt Chriſt, they will marrie, hauing damnation becauſe they haue broken the firſt faith.</hi> The which is to be vnderſtood of the firſt profeſſion of faith in Baptiſme, and not of the latter vow of ſingle life, as the Papiſts falſely and fooliſhly expound it. From this faith all they doe fall, which turne either on the right hand to falſe doctrine, or on the left hand to wicked life. Many other waies faith is taken, but this queſtion is of that true, liuely, and iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, which is the faith of Gods elect, whereby Chriſt dwelleth in their hearts, and they receiue nouriſhment <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.</note> and life from him. This faith may be couered by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and falles, as fire in the night with aſhes, but neuer vtterly extinguiſhed. For they in whom this true faith is, are like a tree planted by the riuers of waters, that will bring forth her fruite in due ſeaſon, whoſe leafe ſhall not <note place="margin">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7249:70"/>
the elect, can neuer periſh, nor be vtterly loſt in them. And this true &amp; comfortable doctrine bringeth no vaine ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, nor openeth the gap to any libertine ſenſualitie. For they that by this faith haue taſted how ſweete the Lord is, cannot but loue and feare God, and greatly delight in his commaundements. And that faith which ſwimmeth in mens lips, but is not printed in their hearts, nor ſhineth by <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 1.</note> godlines and good workes in their liues, is a dead faith, and is no more that true faith, whereby we liue vnto God, then a dead man is a man. To conclude this matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we diſtinguiſh betweene iuſtification and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: yet we acknowledge that they be inſeparable, and the one doth neceſſarily follow the other. For whoſoeuer are iuſtified by Gods grace and mercie through faith in Chriſt Ieſus, be alſo ſanctified with Gods holy ſpirit, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre that which is euill, and to cleaue to that which is good, and to ſerue God in true holines and righteouſnes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 75.</note> all the daies of their life. And therefore we teach that they which without repentance perſiſt in ſinne, wallow in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and commit vngodlines with greedines, haue no faith, nor haue any aſſurance of the remiſſion of their ſins: but may be aſſured that the wrath of God hangeth ouer them, and if they doe not truly repent, and bring foorth fruites worthie amendement of life, will fearefully fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. So that you might haue ſpared your vaine and fooliſh exclamations, concerning Epicures, Heliogabalus, Bacchus and Venus, which are more honoured in Rome (as hereafter I will ſhew) then allowed of vs. For of whom did <hi>Mantuan</hi> the Italian Carmelite Frier an 100. yeeres paſt write this, but of your Popes and his fauourers: <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecto ſuperum cultu, ſpreto<expan>

               <p>Concerning the fourth point of doctrine, of keeping Gods commaundements, I haue ſpoken ſufficiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Onely now I ſay that our doctrine tendeth hereunto, to ſhew vs our miſerie by tranſgreſſing of them, that wee may thereby bee moued to hunger for Gods mercie in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7249:70"/>
Chriſt: and although we cannot perfectly fulfill them (for in many things wee ſinne all) yet wee ought according to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 2.</note> the meaſure of Gods grace giuen to vs, haue a care and conſcience to walke in them, and to frame our liues to the obedience of them.</p>
               <p>Whereas fiftly you charge vs, that wee deny the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance, thereby to make men careles how they liue: I anſwer, that although we deny your penance to be a Sacrament, becauſe it hath no outward viſible ſigne, and reiect your clancular confeſſion, your abſurd abſolution, and your ſuperſtitious or rather blaſphemous ſatisfaction, thereby to anſwere Gods iuſtice, and diſcharge your ſins: yet we truly teach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of repentance, as it is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs in the word of God. We teach men to come to the knowledge of their ſins, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of God, which is the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> glaſſe to ſhew vs our ſpots, and the firſt ſtep to repentance: then to lament their ſinnes, whereby they haue offended their gracious God, and mercifull father, to confeſſe their ſinnes with remorſe of conſcience, both to God and men, whom they haue offended: and eſpecially wee call vpon men for amendement of life, in bringing forth fruits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of repentance, without the which there is no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. One part of which amendement is ſatisfaction to our brethren for iniuries committed, and reſtitution of goods vnlawfully and vngodly gotten. As touching our iniuries againſt God, we plead not our owne ſatisfaction, but craue Gods mercie in Chriſt Ieſus, who is our only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and by whom only we ſeeke to haue remiſſion of them. Whereas you ſay, that your confeſſion rubbeth the ſores of ſinne, and cauſeth remembrance of them, I ſay that this more truly and effectually is wrought by the preaching of Gods word, whereby ſinne is more ſhewed, and the wrath, and iudgements of God againſt ſinne are more threatned, and thereby the conſcience more pricked and wounded, then by your confeſſion. So <hi>Dauid</hi> was brought to repentance for his foule ſinnes of adulterie and <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7.</note> murther, by <hi>Nathans</hi> preaching, and thundring Gods iudgements againſt him, and not by his ſecret confeſſing.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe men neede not to boaſt ſo much of their faſting. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that bodily exerciſe profiteth little, but <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</note> godlineſſe is profitable to all things, and hath the promiſe of this life preſent, and that which is to come. Howbeit, as I will not deny, but that there may be leſſe faſting, and more feaſting, then were requiſit: yet that there is more feaſting and ſuperfluitie in fare now, eſpecially in eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical perſons, I thinke it would be too hard for this man to proue. Whence came theſe phraſes, As fat as an Abbot, he hath a face like an Abbot, and an Abbey Lubber, but of their immoderate fare and feeding? And how theſe men were giuen to gluttonie and exceſſe, I will ſhew at this time but by one example. <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis</hi> in his Booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Speculum Eccleſiae,</hi> writeth, that the Abbot and Monkes of Saint <hi>Swithens</hi> in Wincheſter, came to King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, hunting at Gilford in Surrey, and fell downe in myre and durt before him, pitifully crying out. The King asked them, what was the matter. They anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that their Biſhop had taken three diſhes of meate from their dinners and ſuppers. He asked them how many he had left vnto them. They anſwered tenne, but from the foundation of their houſe they had vſed daily to haue thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene diſhes at a meale. The king turned to his Nobles
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7249:72"/>
and ſaid: By the eyes of God (for that was his oath) I thought their houſe had bin burnt, and now I ſee it is but a matter concerning their paunches. And then turning to the Abbot and Monkes ſaid: If your Biſhop deale not with you, as I haue done with my court, to bring you to three diſhes, I would he were hanged. This was the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that theſe gluttonous Monkes found at the hands of that prudent Prince. Where the reader may note, not onely the great gluttonie, but ſhameles impudencie of theſe men or monſters, in making ſuch a lamentable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, for wanting of three diſhes, hauing tenne remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The ſame <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> writeth, that in ſome Abbeies they had at euery meale ſixteene diſhes, which ſlender diet was a good meanes to preſerue their vowed virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <note place="margin">Monkes bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies were Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus barrels.</note> Hereof came the old ryming verſe. <hi>O monachi veſtri ſtomachi ſunt amphora Bacchi, &amp;c.</hi> To come to the next, I wiſh there were more praying, and leſſe playing then there is: yet this wil I ſay, that there is now more true pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the will of God, &amp; leſſe playing then was euer in poperie. Dicing and carding is in ſome reformed Churches aboliſhed, and of thoſe that truely profeſſe the Goſpel leſſe vſed, then it hath been of Papiſts.

                  <hi>Mantuan</hi> here ſheweth, firſt, that many in thoſe dayes miſliked that law of vowing ſingle life. Secondly, that it had bred many monſters, that is to ſay, ſuch as for their wickednes did leade a monſtrous life. Thirdly, that the life of the auncient Fathers that liued in mariage, was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then of theſe which vowed chaſtitie. <hi>Polidorus Virgilius</hi> an Italian, and gatherer of the Popes Peter penſe here in England, writeth thus: <hi>Illud tamen dixerim tantum abfuiſſo vt ista coacta castit as illam coniugalem vicerit, &amp;c.</hi> Yet this I <note place="margin">

Virg. de inuent. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 4</note> will ſay, that this enforced chaſtitie is ſo farre from excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that chaſtitie of mariage, that no crime and ſinne hath brought more ſhame to the order of Prieſthood, more euill to religion, nor more griefe to all good men, than that blot of the filthines of Prieſts. Wherefore peraduenture it were expedient, both for the Chriſtian common wealth, and the eſtate of that order of Prieſthood, that at the laſt the right of publike mariage were reſtored vnto Prieſts, which they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7249:75"/>
might holily vſe without infamie, rather then moſt filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defile themſelues with ſuch a naturall vice. Such a looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and filthines of life, this doctrine of vowing chaſtitie, and forſaking matrimonie hath brought forth: whereof much more might be alleaged, but this ſhall ſuffice. Yet hereunto I will adde not onely their practiſe, but alſo their doctrine of hauing <hi>Lupanaria</hi> ſtewes, where whoredome is publikely permitted; for the reſtoring of which, Frier <hi>Perine</hi> preached at Paules Croſſe in Queene <hi>Marier</hi> daies, and D. <hi>Harding</hi> calleth them neceſſarie euils. And if it <note place="margin">Confut.

God ſaith, <hi>There ſhall be do whore of the daughters of Iſrael, nor</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Another doctrine of theirs tending to looſeneſſe and wickedneſſe of life, is their doctrine of Popes pardons, whereby they falſely faine, that the Pope hauing the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Martyrs (which they cal the treaſure of the Church) to diſpenſe and beſtow at his pleaſure, hee can pardon whatſoeuer ſinne men haue committed, and acquit and diſcharge them both <hi>à poena &amp; culpa;</hi> that is from the ſinne and puniſhment, which is more by their doctrine, then the death and paſſion of Chriſt can doe. What miſerable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe hath flowed from theſe pelting pardons of Popes (from which the ruine of their kingdome hath iuſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded) <note place="margin">By Luthers dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</note> I will declare out of the words of the Princes and eſtates of Germanie in their 100. grieuances exhibited to the Popes Legate at Norenberg <hi>anno</hi> 1522. and printed at <note place="margin">

Rome, or that the Biſhops of Rome promiſed avoyage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turke, they ſucked all the marrow of money from the ſimple and ouer eredulous Germanes. And that which is much more to be regarded, by theſe deceits, and the publiſhers and Preachers of them, the true godlines of Chriſtians is aboliſhed, whileſt they to broach the ſale of theſe their buls, and pardons, giue praiſe vnto their wares, that by theſe bought pardons, great and ſtrange offences both which be paſt, and that are to come, not onely of the liuing, but alſo of the dead, being in the fire of Pargatorie; (as theſe publiſhers of pardons call it) be pardoned, ſo that money be paide, and that it tingle in their right hand. And by the ſale and merchandiſe of this ware, both Germanie of money is ſpoyled, and Chriſtian godlines is extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, when euery one according to the quantitie, which he beſtoweth vpon this ware, doth take vnto himſelfe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and impunitie to ſinne.

               <p>The doctrine of the Popes diſpenſations to what looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and wickednes of life did it tend?

               <p>
                  <hi>Againe it cannot be ſaid: but that God indirectly, and moſt effectually intended their ſinnes; for he that intendeth any effect wherewith another effect is neceſſarily conioyned, conſequently intendeth it: as for example. He that intendeth to burne a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, intendeth conſequently the death of all the men which be in her. In like manner, if God intended that</hi> Iudas <hi>ſhould ſell Chriſt, vnto which action ſinne was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily adioyned, conſequently God intended the ſinne as well as the ſelling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Minor is to too euident. For the Proteſtants deride Gods permiſſion, they ſay that all his actions are energeticall, or effectuall: they deſperately auer, that</hi> Paules <hi>conuerſion, and</hi> Dauids <hi>aduoutrie, were in like manner the workes of God: And as he elected ſome to glorie, before the preuiſion of workes; ſo he reiected ſome from glorie before the preuiſion of ſins. Here hence I infer that according to the Proteſtants principles, God is moſt properly the author of ſinne, becauſe he impelleth moſt effectually thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next that he is the only author of ſinne, for that he inforceth men vpon neceſſitie to ſinne, and they as inſtruments follow the motion of their firſt cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againe, that man ſinneth not; for where there is neceſſitie of ſinning, there is no ſinne, for ſinne is free or no ſinne: beſides, how can man ſinne in conforming his will with Gods will?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally, God is worſe then the diuell: for that the wickednes of the diuell, principally conſiſteth in moouing, perſwading, and inducing of men to ſinne: the which by the Protestants confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, God performeth more effectually then the diuell, becauſe the motions of God are more forcible, and leſſe reſistable, then the illuſions or ſuggestions of the diuell.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Many ſinnes moreouer are acted without the temptations of the diuell, ſome of ignorance, ſome of paſſion, but none without the motions of God: ſo that God is worſe then the diuell, both in cauſing a greater multitude of ſinnes then the diuell, and in the</hi>

For the Minor or aſſumption of this ſyllogiſme, that all Proteſtants ſay, that God commaundeth, perſwadeth, vrgeth, and impelleth men to ſinne, is as true, as that is, that Catholikes in England be wrapped in beares skinnes, and caſt vnto dogges to be deuoured, which was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Rome by a printed booke, and ſet out in tables, confirmed with Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13. priuiledge.

If this cannot be ſhewed, as moſt certainly it cannot, what a ſhameles man is this, to vtter ſuch a groſſe and palpable lye, as euen a blind man may (as it were) feele it with his fingers: and in what miſerable eſtate be thoſe ſimple ignorant ſoules, which credit ſuch lying ſpirits.

Whereby Saint <hi>Iames</hi> meaneth that God is in ſuch ſort good, and ſo the giuer and author of good things, that there is no change or alteration with him, and therefore is the giuer of all good gifts and graces, and neuer of any euill.

                  <hi>and God hath taken, bleſſed be the name of God.</hi> To this ſpoiling of <hi>Iobs</hi> goods, God did not commaund, perſwade, vrge, or impell the Chaldeans and Sabeans; yet the ſame was not done without his prouidence and ordinance, who turned the ſame to his glorie, in prouing and purging <hi>Iob</hi> in the furnace of affliction, in making him a paterne of patience to all poſteritie, and in teaching men thereby not to iudge of men by outward afflictions and aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereunto both the faithfull and wicked he ſubiect. So in the examples here ſet downe, the diuell put into the heart of <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray Chriſt, and impelled the Iewes to crucifie him; yet he was deliuered to them by the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate counſell and foreknowledge of God, to doe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <note place="margin">

                  <hi>fecerunt:</hi> that is, Whereas both the Father gaue his ſonne, and Chriſt gaue his owne bodie, and <hi>Iudas</hi> gaue or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed Chriſt, why in this giuing is God holy, and man guiltie, but that in one thing which they did, there was not one and the ſame cauſe wherefore they did it. This is not to doe euill that good may come of it: for all actions as they are of God are good and righteous. <hi>For if a good tree cannot bring forth euill fruite</hi> as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 18.</note> how much leſſe can God who is the author of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and euen goodnes it ſelfe, bring forth euill actions. Neither doth God directly or effectually intend the ſins of men, nor their danation, but his own glorie, which ſhineth not onely in the manifeſtation of his mercie towards the faithfull and godly, but alſo in the declaration of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt the wicked and reprobate. The ſimilitude of intending the burning of a ſhippe, and conſequently the death of them that be in it, will not here hold. For God (as I haue ſaid before) doth intend neither the ſinne nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man, but his owne glorie, and the execution of his iuſt iudgements. Your owne Angelicall Doctor <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi> to the like ſimilitude of drowning a ſhip an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth thus: <hi>Ad tertium dicendum, quod ſubuer ſio nauis at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributur</hi>

We doe not deſperatly auerre, but you doe falſely and impudently affirme, that we teach, that <hi>Pauls</hi> conuerſion, and <hi>Dauids</hi> adulterie, were in like manner the workes of God. This ſhameleſſe ſaying you haue picked out of <hi>Campians</hi> reaſons, out of which you haue like a <note place="margin">

But you know your friends and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers will beleeue you, though it be neuer ſo falſe. And you haue learned that leſſon, <hi>Audacter calumniare, ſemper ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid adhaeret.</hi> We ſay that <hi>Pauls</hi> conuerſion was a worke of Gods mercie, agreeable to his will reuealed in his word: <hi>Dauids</hi> ſinne of adulterie was a work which he hateth and repugnant to his ſaid will. God wrought mightily in <hi>Paul</hi> by his holy ſpirit, in conuerting his heart, in drawing him out of darknes, and in making him of a perſecuter, a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of his Goſpell, and a miniſter of his mercie. God did
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7249:85"/>
not ſo work at that time in <hi>Dauid,</hi> but left him to himſelfe, to be tempted, drawne away, and ouercome of his owne corrupt concupilcence: yet wee ſay, that God did draw good out of that ſinne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in making him a patterne of true repentance, and example of Gods mercie in forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his ſinnes, and thereby teaching vs to walke warily, and flee carnall ſecuritie. For if ſo excellent a man, that was according to Gods heart, did ſo fouly and fearefully, fall, what may fall vnto vs, if we walke not circumſpectly, and pray not feruently to God to vphold vs with his hand, and to guide vs with his holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Touching Gods permiſſion, you write as though you neither did know what we teach, nor regard what your ſelfe doe write. Doe we teach that God elected ſome to glorie before the preuiſion of workes, and reiected ſome from glorie before the preuiſion of ſinnes? You ſhall find this falſe aſſertion in our bookes, when you finde the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhameles ſlaunder. We do not teach that God elected any to glorie before he did foreſee their workes. For from euerlaſting, he (to whom all things be preſent) did foreſee both the good workes of his elect, and the wicked workes of the reprobate. But this we ſay, that the foundation and cauſe of Gods election and reprobation is not his preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and foreſeeing of the good workes of the one, and the wicked workes of the other, but his owne purpoſe, will, and pleaſure, and that good workes be not cauſes of Gods election, but fruits and effects of it.

                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:7249:86"/>
ſheweth, that Gods election is not his preſcience and foreſeeing of workes to come, but his owne grace, good pleaſure and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now I come to your illations which vpon theſe falſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions you falſely inferre. To the firſt I anſwere, that God impelleth no man to ſinne, and therefore God is not the author of ſinne. Secondly, God inforceth not men vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſſitie to ſinne, but they ſinne willingly, and by the inſtigation of the diuell, who worketh in the children of diſobedience: therefore God is not the author of ſinne. In your third inference, where you ſay, that ſinne is free, or no ſinne: belike you hold with <hi>Pighius,</hi> and ſome other Papiſts, that originall ſinne is no ſinne: for it is not free for vs to be without it. And whereas you aske, how man can ſinne, in conforming his will with Gods will: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that they that ſinne, doe not conforme their will to Gods will, but doe diſobey it, and oppoſe themſelues vnto it. This is the will of God (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,)</hi> your ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ</hi> 4. 3.</note> and that ye ſhould abſtaine from fornication.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Deny the Minor or ſecond propoſition, that <hi>Dauid</hi> in procuring <hi>Vrias</hi> to be killed loſt his charitie. For although in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat betweene the ſpirit and the fleſh in <hi>Dauid,</hi> the ſpirit retired, and the fleſh preuailed; the new man was foyled, and the old man ouercame: yet was not the ſpirit vtterly extinguiſhed, nor the new man cleane killed. In deede <hi>Dauids</hi> faith fainted, his charitie was cooled, and his other gifts and graces couered, yet not cleane quenched: but there remained ſparkes of Gods ſpirit, which afterwards being ſtirred vp, and blowne by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> bellowes kindled and flamed to Gods glorie, and <hi>Dauids</hi> eternall comfort and ſaluation. Shall we thinke that <hi>Dauid</hi> had loſt all loue of God, of his law and of man? was he cleane depriued of Gods ſpirit? it appeareth by his owne words that he was not. Who vpon <hi>Nathans</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reprouing of his ſinne, prayed and ſaid: <hi>Take not thy holy ſpirit from me.</hi> Whereupon I reaſon thus: He that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51. 11.</note> was not cleane depriued of Gods ſpirit, had not wholy loſt faith and charitie: But <hi>Dauid</hi> was not cleane depriued of Gods ſpirit; therefore he had not wholy loſt faith and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7249:87"/>
The firſt propoſition is euident by the words of <hi>Dauid:</hi> the ſecond is manifeſt. For it is abſurd to ſay, that the ſpirit of God ſhould continue in him, that hath loſt all graces and gifts of the ſpirit. It is with Gods elect and choſen children, as it is with fire which in the night is ſo hid and couered, that none appeareth; and yet in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is ſtirred vp, and is made to burne and to flame: and as with a tree, which in the winter hath neither fruite nor leafe vpon it; yet it hath a ſappe fallen into the roote, which in the ſpring ſpringeth, and bringeth forth both leafe and fruite: So is it with Gods holy Saints, they be ſometimes ſo ouertaken and ouercome with temptations, that they ſeeme to be as trees without fruite, withered, and periſhed: yet there remaineth a ſappe of Gods ſpirit and grace in them, which afterward riſeth and buddeth forth good fruite. And therefore to the ſecond propoſition of your ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Syllogiſme I ſay, that although <hi>Dauid</hi> by thoſe foule and fearefull offences deſerued eternall death: yet he did not remaine in death; and although God hated thoſe ſinnes, yet hee neuer hated <hi>Dauid.</hi> For whom God loueth, he loueth to the end, and the gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If we loue a man, and yet hate ſome ſinne that he committeth, might not God, who is loue it ſelfe, hate <hi>Dauids</hi> ſinne, and yet loue him, and keepe ſome ſparkes of his ſpirit and grace in him, and ſo preſerue as the externall life of the body, ſo the internall life of the ſoule in him? So that neither <hi>Dauid</hi> remained in death, neither was his loue, no not to <hi>Vrias</hi> altogether extinguiſhed in him. No doubt but he did loue him as his true and faithfull ſubiect, and might loue him, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God: yet in that temptation his owne ſelfe loue, and deſire to couer his owne ſinne and ſhame, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt his loue to <hi>Vrias,</hi> and did draw him to doe an act, which was no fruite nor effect of loue and charitie, and yet did not wholy quench loue in him.

                  <hi>giuen himſelfe for me.</hi> Let this man ſhew two ſuch plaine places of Scripture, to proue charitie to be the life of the ſoule. Properly Chriſt is the life of our ſoules. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the place before alledged ſaith, <hi>Chriſt liued in me.</hi> And when Chriſt which is our life ſhall appeare. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 6.</note> when wee were dead in ſinnes, hee hath quickned vs, and at he hath reſtored life vnto vs, ſo hee doth continually nouriſh and preſerue life in vs. But this is attributed to faith, becauſe by it Chriſt dwelleth in vs, and we by it be put into the poſſeſſion of Chriſt, and of all the benefits of his paſſion. Concerning the place of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> becauſe you doe not vrge it, I will not ſtand vpon it. We doubt not, but men may and doe fall from God, and iuſt actions vnto wicked and vngodly deedes, and may haue a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall faith, and fall away from the grace of God. But this we ſay, that true faith in Gods elect, which are ſealed with the ſpirit of adoption, and to whoſe ſpirit Gods ſpirit doth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> beare witnes, that they are the ſonnes of God, is neuer wholy luſt in them, and the ſame ſpirit worketh by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which in them may bee cooled, but neuer cleane quenched. But of the loſing of faith, and of the coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof with charitie, I haue before intreated.</p>
               <p>Now to returne this argument in ſome ſort vpon you, whereas the Papiſts auerre, that the Popes faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faile, I reaſon thus: He that loſeth his charitie, may loſe his faith: the Pope may loſe his charitie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Pope may loſe his faith. The firſt propoſition I haue proued alreadie, and haue ſhewed that true faith is not ſeparated from charitie, but worketh by it. And moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it is by Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> that the faith which is without charitie, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 26.</note>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:7249:88"/>
and good workes is dead: So that if the Pope be without Charitie, then hee hath but a dead faith. And a dead faith, is as much faith, as a dead man is a man. That the Pope may bee without charitie, I thinke they will not deny: and if they doe, it may be proued by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>To the Maior or firſt propoſition I anſwere, that with men wages is giuen for workes: but with God <hi>(whoſe thoughts are not as our thoughts: nor waies as our waies)</hi> it is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. 8.</note> otherwaies. Man may do labour and ſeruice to man, which may merit and deſerue by equitie and iuſtice wages and reward. For that there may be a proportion betweene the ſeruice and reward, and alſo a benefit and commoditie commeth to him to whom the ſeruice is done. As in this
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7249:91"/>
example here alleaged, the Lord Deputie, or ſome other may doe ſome ſuch ſingular ſeruice in Ireland, that if her Maieſtie ſhould beſtow vpon him 1000. pound a yeere, he might in ſome proportion deſerue it, and her Maieſtie may receiue double benefit by it. But can wee doe any workes, that can either merit and deſerue the kingdome of God, or bring any benefit vnto God? <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>My weldoing extendeth not to thee.</hi> And as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that all <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18.</note> the afflictions of this preſent life, are not worthie of the glorie that ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs: ſo may I ſay, that all our imperfect and ſtained workes are not worthie of the kingdome of God, which we haue not deſerued, but Ieſus Chriſt by his death and paſſion hath purchaſed for vs. Can a bond ſeruant by any ſeruices looke to deſerue an earthly kingdome? and can we which are bond ſeruants to God, in reſpect both of creation, and of redemption, looke to deſerue the kingdome of God? Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith: Doth he thanke that ſeruant, becauſe hee did that which was commaunded vnto him? I trow not. So <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 9.</note> likewiſe ye, when ye haue done all things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded you, ſay we are vnprofitable ſeruants: we haue done that which was our dutie to doe. If he that hath done all things which were commaunded, muſt confeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be an vnprofitable ſeruant, how much more muſt wee confeſſe our ſelues to be vnprofitable ſeruants, who haue both omitted many things commaunded, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many great and grieuous ſinnes prohibited? So ſaith <hi>Hierome: Si inutilis eſt qui fecit omnia, quid de illo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendum</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hieron. ad Cieſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phont. aduerſ. Pelagian.</note> 
                  <hi>eſt qui explere non potuit?</hi> .i. If hee be vnprofitable that hath done all, what is to be ſaid of him, that could not fulfill all? Therefore wee are not to truſt in our owne merits, but in Gods mercie, which importeth our miſerie, and not worthines.</p>
               <p>But for the proofe of your Minor, you alleage the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Sauiour Chriſt: <hi>Call the labourers, and giue them</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>their wages.</hi> I graunt that God doth giue to them that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in his vineyard, a reward which is called wages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7249:91"/>
it followeth pietie and good workes, as outward wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges followeth labour. But that this heauenly wages is not deſerued by our workes, as that other is by our labour, it euidently appeareth by that parable, where they that had wrought but one houre, receiued as much as they did which had borne the burden and heate of the day. Which ſheweth, that this reward came of grace, and not of merit, and ſo S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth expound it: <hi>Non labori praemium</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ambroſ. de vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. Gent. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>ſoluens, ſed diuitias bonitatis ſuae in eos quos ſine operibus eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, effundens, vt etiam hij qui in multo labore ſudarunt, nec am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plius quam nouiſſimi acceperunt, intelligant, donum ſe gratiae, non operum accepiſſe mercedem.</hi> i. Not paying a reward vnto our labour, but powring foorth the riches, of his goodnes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, whom he hath choſen without works, that they alſo which in great labour haue toyled, and haue receiued no more then the laſt, may know, that they haue receiued a gift of grace, and not a wages of workes.</p>
               <p>To your other places Apocal. 20. 12. and 1. Cor. 3. 8. I ſay with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that God will reward euery man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his workes, but not for the merite and deſert of their workes. <hi>To them that continuing in well doing ſeeke</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>glorie, honour, and immortalitie, hee will giue euerlaſting life: and vnto them that are contentious, and diſobey the truth, and obey vnrighteouſneſſe, ſhall be indignation and wrath, tribulation, and anguiſh vpon the ſoule of euery man that doth euill.</hi> But you will ſay, why is not euerlaſting life the wages of good workes, as euerlaſting death is of euill workes and ſinnes. I anſwere, that our euill workes be ſimply euill, and being tranſgreſſions of Gods righteous law, offend his infinit maieſtie, prouoke his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit wrath, and deſerue infinit paine and puniſhment. But our workes are not ſimply and perfectly good, but be imperfect, and are ſtained with the corruption of our finfull nature (as I haue before declared) and therefore cannot ſatisfie Gods infinit iuſtice, nor pacifie his infinit anger, nor deſerue his infinit glorie, but rather require Gods great mercie, as hath been ſhewed. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſixt to the Romanes hauing ſaid, that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7249:92"/>
the wages of ſinne is death, doth not ſay (which had been moſt meete to haue been ſaid, if this phariſaicall doctrine <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.</note> were true) the wages of good workes is eternall life: but hee ſaith: the gift of God is eternall life, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, as alſo <hi>Oecumenius</hi> doth wel obſerue.</p>
               <p>You confidently affirme, that the Proteſtants who are enemies to merits, ſhall neuer attaine to the kingdome of Heauen, which is purchaſed by good workes and merits. Where firſt I would aduiſe you to take heede, that you be not brethren to thoſe old heretikes called Hieraclitae, to whom Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth aſcribe this as an hereſie, that they denied infants to appertaine to the kingdome of Heauen, becauſe they had no merits. His words bee theſe: <hi>Hieraclitae ad regnum coelorum non pertinere paruulos</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Haereſ. Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ.</hi> 47.</note> 
                  <hi>dicunt, quia non ſunt eis vlla merita certaminis, quo vitia ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perentur. i.</hi> The Hieraclites ſay, that infants belong not to the kingdome of Heauen, becauſe they haue no merits of ſtrife, whereby to ouercome vices. How neere you iumpe with theſe old Heretikes, as you doe in many matters with many others, let the Chriſtian reader indifferently iudge. Secondly, I ſay, that we are enemies neither to thoſe true merits of Gods mercies, and Chriſts ſufferings before mentioned, nor to mans good workes, but to the merit of them, and vaine confidence put in them. We ſay with Saint <hi>Auguſtine: Si vis alienus eſſe à gratia, iacta merita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua. i.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. praefati. in Pſal</hi> 31.</note> If thou wilt be voyde of grace, boaſt thine owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Thirdly, wee beleeue that the kingdome of Heauen commeth to vs by inheritance, and not by the purchaſe of our workes and merits. Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my father, take the inheritance of the kingdom prepared for you,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>from the foundation of the world.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>If we be children, we are alſo heires, euen the heires of God, and heires</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>annexed with Chriſt.</hi> Thus the kingdome of Heauen is ours, in that we be coheires with Chriſt. By whoſe bloudie and bleſſed merits it is purchaſed to vs: and not by the workes and deſerts of vs vnprofitable ſeruants, and prodigall children, who haue alwayes neede to pray and ſay: <hi>Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:7249:92"/>
                  <hi>that liueth be iuſtified: and if thou O Lord ſtraightly markeſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>iniquitie, O Lord who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, you that ſo ſeuerely cenſure vs, looke to your ſelues, and take heed you be not like that proud Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, who gloried of his workes, and diſdained the ſinfull <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 17.</note> Publicane: and that you be not like the Angell of the Church of Laodicea, who ſaid <hi>that he was rich, increaſed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Athaneus lib.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>with goods, and had need of nothing, and did not know that he was wretched, miſerable, poore, blind, and naked.</hi> And that you be not like that mad man of Athens, called <hi>Thraſelaus,</hi> who comming in his madnes to the hauen named Pyreum, did vainely imagine, that all the ſhippes and riches there, were his owne: but being cured, and brought to good vnderſtanding, he ſaw his pouertie, and perceiued that he ſcarce had a penny in his purſe. Euen ſo if you were throughly cured of this phrenſie of Poperie, you would acknowledge your owne miſerie, and hunger for Gods mercie: confeſſe your owne pouertie, that Chriſt may inrich you: your owne nakednes, that he may with the robe of his righteouſneſſe couer you: your owne guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that he may acquite and iuſtifie you; and finally humble your ſelfe, that hee may exhalt you. For it is hee that filleth the hungrie with good things, and ſendeth the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 53.</note> rich emptie away. I would you would ioyne with your owne Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> in this poynt, who miſliking of <hi>Oſorius</hi> booke <hi>de iustitia</hi> dedicated to him, for attributing too much to mans iuſtice and righteouſneſſe, did adde this worthie ſaying, and worthie by al meanes to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, That we can neuer attribute too much to the mercie and righteouſneſſe of God: nor too much take from the righteouſneſſe of man. This is written not only by Doctor <hi>Haddon</hi> in his booke againſt <hi>Oſorius:</hi> but alſo by <hi>Pruilus</hi> his Secretarie in his life, as that excellent Antiquarie, and learned man my good friend Maſter <hi>Camden</hi> did tell me. To conclude, bee not like the froward Iewes, who hauing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. 3.</note> a zeale towards God, but not according to knowledge, being ignorant of the righteouſneſſe of God, and going about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, haue not
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7249:93"/>
ſubmitted themſelues to the righteouſneſſe of God. For Chriſt is the end of the lawe for righteouſneſſe vnto euery one that beleeueth, but obey the counſell and calling of God: <hi>Ho, euery one that thirsteth, come yee to the waters, and yee that haue no ſiluer, come, buye and eate: Come I ſay, buye</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
