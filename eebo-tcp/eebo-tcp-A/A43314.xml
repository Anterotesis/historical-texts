         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>MY desires at this time to know and to make
known to others the form of Government and
order of worship used in the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
have brought these following lineaments to light.
There come daily into my hands without my seeking;
some one forme of Church Government or other, as
the divers Authors, from their love to Reformation
in their judgements did conceive: But I must confesse
they did the lesse relish with me that they were dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and modells without the example or practise of
any of the Christian Churches, and were <hi>Abstract Idea's</hi>
of discipline in the minds of men and not <hi>Disciplina in
Subjecto.</hi> One I had, Titled <hi>The forme of government used in
the Church of Scotland,</hi> but, being nothing but an Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and containing generalls onely, It did not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.
I found also many of the godly much wearied of
the Prelacy, who yet bow their shoulder to bear, and
couch down between the two burthens, because, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unacquainted with the Government of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches, they do not know what to choose, and
fear (as to them who are in the dark is usuall) they know
not what. Such as these do rather suffer themselves to
be led away with the policy of <hi>Pacuvius</hi> at <hi>Capua,</hi> which
in such a case was cmmendable, then resolve to follow
the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> when the Lord called him, <hi>Get the
out of thy Countrey, &amp;c. into a Land which I will shew thee,
Gen.</hi> 12. 1. What he was to forsake, and the <hi>Terminus à
quo</hi> of his removing, he did know; But whether he
<pb facs="tcp:37092:3"/>
was to go and the <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> he did not know,
resting assured that God would shew it him. In our
own affairs we may think the evill known to be better
then the good unknown; But it holdeth not in the
matters of God, nor when we speak of <hi>Malum turpe</hi>
and <hi>bonum honestum,</hi> the evill of sinne and the good of
obedience. But as they who travell from the South to
the North, losing the sight of the one Pole come in
sight of the other, and as they go on the North Pole
is elevated to them by degrees: So is it here, if men
would once forsake and turn their back upon that
which they know to be wrong, and would ask the way
to <hi>Zion</hi> with their faces thither ward, the Lord would
teach them his way.</p>
            <p>I must confesse that I did give too much ear and audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the misinformation of many (so may I call it
now after true imformation) who would have made
me to believe, 1. That the true government of that
Church was Episcopall, and that beside the order of
Episcopacy, there was nothing in that Church, but
disorder and confusion through the Parity of their
Ministers, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that all did speak and no
man did hear any thing of another. 2. That they had
no certain rule or direction for their publike worship,
but that every man following his extemporary fansie,
did preach and pray what seemed good in his own
eyes. And 3. (which was to me an huge rock of
offence) That they were enemies to Kings for no other
cause, but that they are Kings: and, out of a desire of
Anarchy, did preferre Democracie to Monarchicall
Government: Great crimes I can not deny, and much
to be abhorred, for they are destructive of all Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
and Civile Order, and do break both the staves
of beauty and of bonds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37092:3"/>
But upon tryall I did remember that, if accusation
were guiltinesse, no party conld be innocent, and found
that it was nothing so as was alledged: for concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the first, I called to minde the practise of a painter
of old, who being desired to represent the body of
<hi>Hercules,</hi> did expresse nothing of the lineaments of his
face, stature or members, but did onely make a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of the Lyons skin, which he was wont to carry
about as the badge of his strength, and the Trophee
of his honour. Episcopacy was never the face nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of that Church. In the most part of their assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
have they conflicted with it, and by the strength
of God obtaining the victory both of old, and much
more of late They may well number it among their
spoiles. The order of their Ministers each one standing
in his own station, and none usurping over another, and
the Subordination of their foure kindes of assemblies,
joyning the consent and obedience of the people, are
the face and strength of that Church. Against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
The form of prayers, administration of the
Sacraments, admission of Ministers, Excommunication,
solemnizing os marriage, visitation of the sick, &amp;c.
which are set down before their <hi>Psalm</hi>-Book, and to
which the Ministers are to conforme themselves, is a
sufficient witnesse: for although they be not tyed to
set formes and words; yet are they not left at randome,
but for testifying their consent and keeping unity, they
have thelr directory and prescribed order. No where
hath preaching and the ministery more spirituall and
lesse carnall liberty, the Presbytery and assemblies
encouraging to the one and restraining from the other.
And against the third, Their Confession of Faith, the
doctrine and prayers of their Church, their late decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb facs="tcp:37092:4"/>
and remonstrances, and what is contained in

               </gap>he conclusion of this Treatise, expresse as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and reverence to magistracy, as any Christian
Prince will require.</p>
            <p>I was also strongly drawn to the liking of that
Church by the Testimonies given unto their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
by some of the most famous witnesses of this
age.</p>

The house of God shall be builded in it, yea it shall not
lack (watsoever the enemy imagine to the contrary) the very
top-stone; the glory of God shall evidently appear, and shall
once triumph in despight of Satan. But alas, if the people shall
be after unthankfull, then fearfull and terrible shall the plagues
be that after shall follow. <bibl>Hist. of the Church of <hi>Scotland,

The fourth of King <hi>Iames</hi> of happy memory.
<q>The Religion professed in this Countrey, wherein I was brought
up, and ever made profession of, and wishes my son ever to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in the same, as the onely true form of Gods Worship, &amp;c.
I do equally love and honour the learned and grave men of either
of these opinions, that like better of the single form of policy in
our Church, than of the many Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
&amp;c. I exhort my son to be beneficiall to the good men of
the Ministry, praising God that there is presently a sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of good men of them in this Kingdom, and yet are they all
known to be against the form of the English Church. Basil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.
To the Reader, And in the Assembly 1590 his
Majesty praised God, for that he was born to be a King in
the sincerest Church in the world, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The fift is of <hi>Brightman,</hi> our own Countryman, who
joyneth the Churches of <hi>Helvetia, Suevia, Geneva, France,
Holland,</hi> SCOTLAND, all together into one Church,
for the Counter-payn of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
because, <hi>saith he,</hi> 

               <q>they almost live by one and the same laws and
manner of Government, as touching any matter of moment.
Neither doth the distance of place break off that society which the
Conjoyning of mindes and good will coupleth together,
having thus joyned them into one Church, he subjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
concerning it. Loth would I be to provoke any man to
envy, or to grieve him with my words, yet this I must say there
is no place, where the doctrine soundeth not more purely, the
worship of God is exercised more uncorruptly: where more
faithfull diligence of the Pastors doth flourish, or more free aud
willing obedience is given by the people, nor yet where there is
greater reverencing of the whole Religion among all orders.
And afterward, Neither doth it onely keep the doctrine of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
free from corruption, but it doth also both deliver in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and exercise in practice that sincere manner of government,
whereby men are made partakers of salvation,

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To these may be added what upon the one hand is
<pb facs="tcp:37092:5"/>
said by these of the separation in their first petition to
to King <hi>Iames,</hi> insert in their Apology to the Doctors of
<hi>Oxford.</hi> 
               <q>We are willing and ready to subscribe to these grounds
of Religion published in the Confession of Faith made by the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hoping in the unity of the same Faith to
be saved by Jesus Christ: being also like minded for and with
other Reformed Churches in points of greatest moment.
And upon the other hand, That the meetings of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
for interpreting Scripture, like unto their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries
were allowed by <hi>Arundell, Hutton</hi> and <hi>Matthew,</hi>
three Archbishops in <hi>England,</hi> and proved very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
in the Northern parts for increase of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
both in Ministers and People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But all these and the like testimonies were to me but
like the saying of the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> to her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men,
till I did more fully understand the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and order of that Church. Then did I believe,
not because of their testimonies, but because I did see
and know. And from that which I have seen and do
now know when I have walked and gone round about
that Church, when I have told the Towers thereof,
marked well her Bulwarks, and considered her pallaces,
I may without offence affirm three things.</p>
            <p>First, That God hath not dealt so with every nation,
if envy would permit, I might say, any nation, as he
hath dealt with them. Whereof no cause can be given
but his own good pleasure, he showeth mercy, and
maketh his Sunne to shine on whom and were he will,
and of him, and through him, and for him are all
things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that it is no marvail if that Nation stand
to the defence of their Reformation, had the Lord been
pleased to blesse us with the like at the time of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb facs="tcp:37092:6"/>
we would not have been so unwise as to
make exchange of it with Prelacy, we would have
forsaken all things rather then have forsaken it, It is
more strange that any should have been found amongst
them at any time to speak or to do against their own
Church:<note place="margin">Sed quum omnia ratione animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que lustraris, omnium societa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nulla est gravior, nulla ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, quum ea quae cum Repub. unicuique nostrum est. Cari sunt Parentes, Cari liberi, propinqui, familiares; sed omnes omnium caritates patria una complexa est, pro qua quis dubitet mortem oppetere, si ei sit profuturus? quo est detestabilior istorum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitas qui lacerarunt omni scelere patriam &amp; in ea funditus delenda occupati sunt &amp; fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, <hi>Cicer. Offi. l.</hi> 1.</note> But after you have with
your reason and minde made a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
survey of all societies there
is none more grave, more dear then
that which each one of us hath
with his Countrey; Parents are
dear, Children, Friends, familiars
are dear; But our native Countrey
alone taketh all these within her
compasse, for which what good
man would doubt to die, could his
death serve her for good? So much
the more detestable is their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
who have with all kinde of
wickednesse rent asunder their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Countrey, and both are and
have been exercised in overturning her from the very foundation.
If a Patriote spoke so of his Countrey, a Citizen so of
his Republike, what should the Christian born, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
and bred in <hi>Scotland</hi> think and say, if he have been
borne there not only to this mortall, but to that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
and everlasting life: No children on earth have
better reason to say, Wee are not ashamed of our
Mother, and it were to be wished that the saying were
reciprocally true.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, having the pattern of all the Reformed
Churches before us, and this example so neer unto us,
what need we to stand amazed, as not knowing what
to choose; To abide that which we have been, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
profitable nor possible, To conjoyn the two in one
is but the mixture of Iron with Clay, and must needs
<pb facs="tcp:37092:6"/>
make the distemper greater. It were well for us (and
no other well for us can I see) that laying aside our
high conceit of our selves, and the low esteem of other
reformed Churches We would resolve to follow them
as they follow Christ, and not to despise the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ, because they seeme to be but Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils;
But to conforme to them, because they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to Christ, and to the pattern shewed in the
Mountain. What reciprocation of giving and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in matters of Religion, hath beene betweene
this and the Scottish Nation may be knowne by the
words of <hi>Beda,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nec multo post illi quoque qui insulam Hii incolebant Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi Scoticae Nationis, cum bis quae sibi subdita erant monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis, ad ritum paschae, &amp; ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surae Canonicum, domino pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curante, perducti sunt &amp;c. <hi>And afterward,</hi> Quod mira divinae factum constat dispensatione pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, ut quoniam Gens illa qua noverat scientiam divinae cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis, libenter ac sine invidia, populo Anglorum communicare curavit, ipsa quoque postmodum per Gentem Anglorum, in eis quam minus habuerat, ad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectam vivendi norman perve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niret. <hi>Beda eccles. hist. gentis Angl. l. 5. c.</hi> 23.</note> but speaking

The Lord bringing it so to passe
(he should have ascribed it to
another spirit). Which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was done by the marvellous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of divine mercy, that
because that Nation, who had the
science of divine knowledge, did
willingly and without envy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the same to the people of
<hi>England;</hi> that the same Nation
afterward should by the Nation of the <hi>English</hi> attain unto the
perfect rule of living in these things which they had not before.</p>

in the Christian Church, so long as

               <p>The Office of a Bishop consisting in

all the branches of that Hierarchy, and all
the offices, titles, dignities, and courts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
thereupon as may be seen in their
confession of faith, Books of discipline, and
acts of assemblies of old, and of late.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of their reformation
they had no constitute Presbyteries, nor
such provinciall and generall assemblies as
they had afterward, and upon the other
part they had <hi>superintendents, visiters of

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37092:9"/>
for how soon it was possible for them, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries

brought to passe, But superintendents and
all others of that kinde, which at first were
of necessary use in visiting the Country, and
in planting of Churches, were declared
to be neither necessary nor expedient for the

working of civill authority, and by the
corrupt assemblies of Ministers, had some
footing, and was in end raised to a great

yet the office of a Bishop was never received

               <p>AS no man ought to presume to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any office Ecclesiasticall without an
inward calling from God, who only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
the intentions, and desires of the
heart, whether they be earthly or heavenly,
whether they be set upon the glory of God,
and edifying of the Church, or upon the
means of this life; So are there none here
admitted without the approbation and
judgement of men according to the rules
of the Word, and the received order of the
Church.</p>
               <p>This outward calling of the Officers of
the Church doth consist in Election and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
after due triall and examination of
their soundnesse in religion, and godlinesse
of life: For the better understanding of the
order of the calling of their Ministers, it is
to be considered,</p>
               <p>That in every one almost of their <hi>Classes,</hi>
or greater Presbyteries, there be Students of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37092:10"/>
Divinity; whereof some, if they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of their Studies, do make their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
within the bounds of the Presbytery,
and attend the meetings thereof: Others,
who are the greater part, stay at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
and in the time of vacation come
home and wait upon the Presbytery.</p>
               <p>The abilities of both the one sort and the
other, are tryed in private, before the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
and how soon they are found fit to
come in publike, they enter upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
or prophecy with the Ministers of
the Presbytery, and at sometimes are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
and allowed to preach before the
people: By which mean their gifts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
are known to the people, as their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are manifest by their conversing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
               <p>Out of the number of these Proposants,
or (as they call them) <hi>Expectants,</hi> the Pastor
is nominated to the vacant place by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership,
and by the Minister, if any be, with
the consent and good liking of the people,
and if they can pitch upon none within the
bounds of their own Presbytery they have
their liberty to make their choice of an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectant</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37092:10"/>
of good esteem and report in some
other Presbytery.</p>
               <p>The Person thus known and nominated,
is by the particular Eldership, named to the
greater Presbytery, where he is examined
of his skill in the Languages, <hi>Latine, Greek,</hi>
and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in his interpreting of Scripture,
in the controversies of Religion, in his gift
of exhortation, in the holy and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
History and Chronologie; And first of
all, Of his life and manner of conversation;
wherein if he be found vitious or scandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
he is not to be admitted to any other
examination; Being thus examined, and
found qualified for that charge, he is sent to
the vacant place, that the people hearing
him, may have the greater assurance of his
gifts for edification.</p>
               <p>After the people have heard him, some
Minister of the Presbytery is appointed to
preach to that people of the necessity of the
Ministery, of the excellency of a faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
of the qualities of a Minister, and of
the obedience due to the Gospel, or of some
such Theme: And at the same time a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Edict is served, That if any person or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37092:11"/>
persons, have any thing to object against the
literature, doctrine, or life of such a man,
why he may not be a profitable Minister of
such a Parish, They shall appear before the
Presbytery in such a place, and at such a
time, that their objections may be tryed and
discussed.</p>
               <p>Upon the day appointed, the Door-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Presbyterian meeting, doth call
three severall times, if there be any to object
against the Person nominated, and if any
thing be alleadged against him by any of
that particular flock, or any other to whom
he is known, it is duely and equally ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Presbytery, and if it be found to
have any weight, or the case be doubtfull,
the ordination is suspended till a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
triall; Otherwise if there be nothing but
silence, they use to proceed.</p>
               <p>So that no man is here obtruded upon
the people against their open or tacite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and approbation, or without the voices
of the particular Eldership with whom he
is to serve in the Ministery. But if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
nominated be a Pastor of some other
flock, and his faithfulnesse known in his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37092:11"/>
former charge, this processe is spared, and his
translation more speedily expede, if there be
no impediments of another kinde.</p>
               <p>Upon the day appointed for accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his election, and for his ordination,
which is in due time made known to the
Congregation, and agreed upon with them,
a Fast is ordained to be kept, with more
than ordinary supplication for the assistance
and blessing of God, in a work of so great
concernment: And one of the Pastors of the
Presbytery is appointed to preach to that
people of the mutuall duties of Pastor and
people. All which being done, the party,
(who, during the time of the exercise of
publike worship, hath been sitting in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
place before the Pulpit, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with the Elders, and some Ministers
of the Presbytery) is called up, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning his willingnesse and desire to
serve the Lord JESUS, for the good of that
people; with other questions of that kinde;
and the people also are demanded, whether
they will receive him for their Pastor, and
submit themselves unto his Ministery in the
Lord. Both having declared their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37092:12"/>
and mutuall consent, The Minister
cometh from the Pulpit, and with so many
of the Ministers present, as may convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come neer, lay their hands upon his head,
and in the Name of JESUS do appoint him
to be the Pastor of that people, praying that
from JESUS CHRIST, who is at the
right hand of the Father, and giveth gifts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men, he may finde the demonstration of
the Spirit, and the power and blessing of
GOD in his Ministery, to the comfort of
that people. Therafter the whole Eldership
give unto him the right hand of fellowship.
And last of all, the Minister goeth to the
Pulpit, and concludeth the whole action
with pertinent thanksgiving and prayers, a
Psalm is sung, and the Assembly dissolved
with the blessing.</p>
               <p>By this it may appear that Pastors or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
are not there admitted at large, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
assignation to a particular flock, like
Masters of Art, or Doctors of Physick. They
conceive it to be as preposterous for Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to go before the Election of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in the Church, as it is first to Crown a
King, or Install a Magistrate, and thereafter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37092:12"/>
to choose him: next in the ordination of their
Ministers they use none of the ridiculous
toyes, and apish conceits of Popery; but,
according to the simplicity of the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and ancient Church, content themselves
with Fasting, Prayer, and Imposition of
hands; Prayer, to bring down a blessing
upon the person on whose head the hands
are laid, and Fasting, to make the prayer to
ascend the more fervently.</p>
               <p>This liberty of Election is in part prejudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
&amp; hindred by Patronages and Presentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which are still in use there, not by the
rules of their discipline, but by toleration of
that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they cannot amend, in the mean
time procuring, that in the case of presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by Patrons, the examination and tryall
by the Presbytery, is still the same. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
where he who is presented is to
serve, is called, if they have ought to object
against his Doctrine or life, after they have

And if he be found <hi>Reus ambitus,</hi> or to have
gone about to procure a presentation, he is
repelled, &amp; declared incapable of that place.</p>
               <p>No Pastor may thrust himself upon a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37092:13"/>
flock, nor after his entry, desert his charge, or
remove himself to another Congregation at
his own pleasure. The Deserters, if any be,
are appointed to be admonished, and in case
of obstinacy, to be excommunicated. If a
Minister, upon lawfull and urgent causes,
desire to remove from one Congregation to
another, of if a Minister be called to another
Congregation, for which he is more fit, or
be called forth upon grave considerations
for some publike employment, tending to
the common benefit of the Church; This is
not done by private transaction, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
agreement of Ministers and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
but by the wisedom and authority
of the Presbyteries or Assemblies of the
Church; Nor is it done by them, but upon
such reasons as should move that Church,
wherein for the present he ministreth, to
give her consent: for whose supply also, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a convenient course is presently taken, or
the way of supply is seen to be easie.</p>
               <p>The Minister thus removed from one
Church to another, receiveth no new ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but by vertue of his first ordination
he serveth in the place, unto which he is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37092:13"/>
called and elected: Only at his admission
one of the Presbytery, who is appointed to
preach of the duty of Pastors and people,
and to pray for a blessing, recommendeth
him to the Congregation, who have before
declared their willingnesse and desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, and the Congregation to his care
and fidelity, And the Pastor, if any be, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Elders, with whom he sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
before the Pulpit, take him by the hand.</p>
               <p>Pastors and Ministers of the Word,
through old age, sicknesse, or other infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
being disabled to bear the weight, and
discharge the duty of their Pastorall charge,
Do notwithstanding still retain the honour
of their office, and comfort of maintenance
during their lifetime. And they performing
what they are able in reaching, government,
visitation and catechising, others are joyned
with them by the Presbytery, and with
the consent of the people to be their fellow
labourers, and to undergo the main charge.</p>
               <p>The same course of election and admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for substance, and in form according to
the nature of their office, is observed in the
calling of other Officers, as <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:37092:14"/>
and <hi>Deacons:</hi> At the beginning, and where
there be none, the Pastor, with the gravest,
holiest, and those of the soundest judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and best affection to Religion, do
choose them with the consent of the rest of
the people. And where particular Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
are already constitute, the Pastor and
the Elders who are now in office, do choose
such as are to succeed those who are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by death, or any other way, or by vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde
are to relieve such as are now in
place; And that the election of one or moe
at first, or afterward may proceed with the
consent of the people, their names are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
and made known to the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Pastors, that if ought may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against any of them, why they may
not be received to the office of an <hi>Elder</hi> or
<hi>Deacon,</hi> it may be examined, and, if it be
found important, others may be chosen.
When the day of their admission cometh,
the Pastor having fram'd his doctrine to the

one in his own quarter, for trying the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

in like manner, he first readeth, and shortly
expoundeth the words of Institution, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

breaketh the bread, taketh and eateth himself,

grave and reverent manner, do attend about
the Table, that all who are admitted to the
Table, may have the bread and wine in their

               <p>THe Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath had no other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
but Masters and Professors of Divinity,
in Universities and Colledges, of which, some use
to be chosen to be Elders of particular Churches,
and Commissioners to the Nationall Assembly, and
besides these the Teachers of more private and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Schools.</p>
               <p>They use to be examined and tried, both in their
learning, and life, by the Presbitery, and their charge
is not only to bring up their schollers in humane li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature
and liberall Arts, but also in Civill Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37092:21"/>
and good manners, but especially in the
Grounds of Christian Religion, by way of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme.</p>
               <p>As the Doctors of Colledges do keep the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Presbitery, and by course do prophesie,
or make the exercise with the Ministers, so also do
the masters of private Schooles for the greater part
of them, who therefore are a part of the Seminarie
of the publike Ministery, are numbred among the
expectants, how soon they are enabled, to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the exercise, and sometimes are imployed by the
Ministers to help them, in teaching and Catechising
of the people.</p>
               <p>The Universities also use to be visited by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
delegated from the Nationall assembly,
that there be nothing taught by the Professors and
Doctors, but what is sound and consonant to the
confession of faith, and the received doctrine, and
order of the Church; and to see that both Masters,
and Schollers do their duties diligently, especially
that their be no scandall nor corruption of maners.
In like maner the more private schooles, are visited
by the Presbiteries, poore schollers of good ingines
and expectation are provided in a great part of their
maintenance, by places of the foundation of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
which are appointed by the Founders, or

               <p>THe Calling, Election, and admission of Elders
is before spoken of. The number of Elders in
every Parish is not definit, but doth vary according
to the number, and necessity of the people; In some
parishes ó, in some 10, or 12, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Such are chosen to be Elders as come neerest to
the gifts, and qualities required, by the Apostle, and
after they are chosen, are at all occasions exhorted
by the Pastor to be ensamples to the flock, and to
watch over them faithfully, against all corruptions,
in religion and life. And as the Pastor should bee
diligent in teaching and sowing the seed, so are the
Elders desired to be carefull in seeing and seeking
the fruits in the people.</p>
               <p>The Elders do attend with the Pastor in Chate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising
the people, do assist him In visiting the sick,
In admonishing all men of their duty, and if any
will not heare them, they bring the disobedient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Eldership; In causing the acts of the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
as well particular as generall, to be put in
execution; But a principall part of their duty is to
joyne alwayes, with the Pastor in the particular El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership,
and in the other assemblies of the Church,
as they shall be called, for exercising of discipline,
and governing the whole Congregation.</p>

               <p>WHat maner of persons the Deacons ought to
be, the Scripture is plain, and such they make
choise of as are so qualified, so far as may be; The
forme of their election is before expressed. Their
number must be considered of, according to the
number of the poore, and the proportion of the
Congregation, as we spake before, of the Elders.</p>
               <p>Their maine duty, is to collect, receive, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
not onely the almes, for the poore, but the
whole Ecclesiasticall goods, which are not assigned
and appointed, for the maintenance of particular
persons.</p>
               <p>These duties they must performe, at the ds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
and by the appointment of the Pastor, and
Elders; for which cause, and not for government,
they are to be present at the ordinary meetings of
the Eldership.</p>
               <p>The meanes for the maintenance of the poore
are collected, by the Deacons, the first day of the
weeke, and other dayes of the publike assembling
of the people to the worship of God, at the entry of
the Church. And if this prove not a competency,
then do the people either bring in their Charity, on
such dayes as are appointed by the Eldership, or are
willing to be taxed, according as they shall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be able. In some Cities, and Parishes, where
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37092:23"/>
this order hath been carefully observed, none have
been suffered to beg, and none have lacked.</p>
               <p>Their Ministers, beside their Gleab and Manse,
are all provided to certaine, and the most part, to
competent stipends, which are paid either in victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or moneys, or in both: And if the charge of their
family be great, and their children put to Schooles
or Colledges, they are helped, and supplied by the
charity of the people, which useth also to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
if need be, toward their widows and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,
after their decease, of which the whole El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership

how often, and at what times the Lords
Supper is most seasonably ministred: all which
are proper for keeping of order in that Church,
and cannot be so fitly determined by a superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
assemblie; the Elders also do here delate
scandalous persons, and bring them to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
repentance according to the forme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the greater assemblies: But if there
be any doubt or difficultie, or if the offences
and scandals be great and hainous, or if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
adde obstinacie and impenitencie to

the greater Presbyterie there to receive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for their censure, or to be sent home again
to give satisfaction, or to make their repentance
in their owne Church where they have given
offence, and where the fault was committed:
For example, a man behaving himselfe scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louslie
with a woman, both unmaried and
single persons, is first admonished and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
if fornication appeare, he is called before

the Eldership, brought to the sense and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his fault, and ordained to make his
publick repentance according to the order of
the Church, and to abstaine from all scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
behaviour afterward. But if he prove ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate,
hee is conveened before the greater
Presbyterie, the matter is examined, and either
he promiseth to give obedience to his owne
Eldership, or in case of continued obstinacie,
the censures of the Church proceed against
him. But if there bee a scandall of adulterie
or murder, the noise and scandall whereof is
far spread, and filleth all mens eares round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
the parties are brought before the greater
Presbyterie, and the particular Eldership doth
before prepare the parties for their appearance

               <p>The same faults which are brought before
the particular or greater Presbytery in an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
way, are also punished by the civill
magistrate, and the pecuniall mulct or penalty
is given to the Deacons to bee kept in the
Church treasure for the benefit of the poore, or
other pious uses.</p>
               <p>Nothing useth to bee done by the lesser or

               <p>The Minister and Elders use all meanes in

the parish to knowledge, faith, and holinesse of
life, that they may be fitted for the Lords Table.</p>

and by many degrees, the censure being so
weighty, and they desirous to gaine the sinner
to repentance.</p>
               <p>If any person walke unworthy of the

the scandall bee publike and notorious)
admonished first secretly by one, next by two
or three more. And thirdly, If he contemne
both, then according to the order prescribed by
our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. The matter is brought
before the Minister and Elders where he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
both of the trespasse and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
If he cannot yet be brought to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
then is the matter in some measure
made knowne unto the Congregation, and
hee called before the greater Presbytery;
where if he give signes of his repentance, he is
remitted to satisfie his owne session. But if
he persist in his obstinacie, then by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Presbytery, the particular elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37092:27"/>
is to proceed against him with the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

               <p>The matter being thus heard knowne and

then do they at the appointment of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie,
give order for his publick repentance,

warning all that have any thing to

If nothing be objected, or if none for him
witnesse any appearance of repentance, then is
the danger of the person, and the weight of
the sentence laid open the next Sabbath, and
he the second time prayed for publickly. If at
last upon the next Sabbath there be no signe
of repentance, then is he praied for the third
time, and there being no meane unassaied, nor
remedy left to reclaime him, hee is strucken
with the terrible sentence of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with calling upon the Name of God to
ratifie the sentence in Heaven, and the people
warned to hold him as an Heathen, or a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,
and to shun all communion with him,
except in naturall and civill duties to be still
performed by such as are bound. It is to bee
understood, that where the crimes are such
that they cry to the heavens for revenge,
waste the conscience, and by the law of
God deserve death, and the transgressor cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

as on the other part of absolution, the time
would be longer, and the triall of repentance
more exact.</p>
               <p>After excommunication, he is permitted to
come to the preaching of the Word, yet so as

having communion with the Church. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is he debarred from private counsell, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
admonition, and prayer, that in
end his spirit may be saved. If after excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication

the excommunicate, declaration of the griefe
of his heart, and his humble submission to the

where the crime inferreth a perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie,
are they never readmitted to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
except upon the unanimous and most
earnest desire of the whole Church where they
served before.</p>

               <head>IV. Of greater Presbyteries or Classes.</head>
               <p>THe Presbyterie or Classicall meeting
doth consist of particular neighbouring
Churches in such a circuite as may conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
meet together, to the number of ten, six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene,
twentie, or so many as the vicinitie of the
places, and parishes may well accommodate.</p>
               <p>It is supposed that the whole particular El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derships
cannot well assemble in one place or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
neither is it necessarie. There be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beside the Minister or Ministers of the
Congregation who are supposed to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
members of the Presbyterie, some of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
note chosen out of the Elders &amp; by them,
who receiving from them commission may
represent the whole; from each particular El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership,
one of the Elders with the Minister
or Ministers repaireth to the place of meeting:
so that the members of this Presbyteriall
meeting are all the Ministers within the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,
and one Elder delegated from each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Eldership.</p>
               <p>None of the Ministers are permitted to be
absent, unlesse they be detain<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by necessarie
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37092:30"/>
impediments or extraordinarie imployments.
And therefore the day of the meeting of the
Presbyterie may not be destinate to ordinarie
preaching? Nor are they to wait that day up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
solemnizing of mariages. The names are
called by the Clerk, and the absents are noted
and examined the next day upon the reasons
of their absence; and if any happen to absent
themselves many dayes without reasonable
causes, they are set apart and censured as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the contempt or neglect of the order of
the Church. But the Elders are not so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
tied to ordinarie attendance; but if there be
any matter of great weight to be handled, they
are all warned to be present: And if hee who
was formerly Commissioner may not assist, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Commissioner in his place may bee
chosen by the Eldership.</p>
               <p>It is permitted to the expectants having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
before upon the publick exercise or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
to sit by the Ministers and Elders in the
meeting of the Presbyterie, and to give their
judgement of the doctrine, but they have no
voice when matters of doctrine or discipline
are debated. And in the handling of some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which are thought fit to be concealed and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37092:31"/>
kept secret, till they be by common consent
published, they use to be removed.</p>
               <p>Because the whole discipline in a manner is
in the hands of the Presbyterie, they are to
meet once a week or fortnight upon a certaine
day, and in a certain place, but in some places,
through the length and deepnesse of the way
in winter, they do not meet so often.</p>
               <p>The subject and matters treated in the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
are all the Ecclesiasticall matters of
weight, which concern the particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
there represented, as the examination, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
suspension, and deposition of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
scandals of Ministers in doctrine, life,
or any part of their calling; the decerning of
excommunication, references, and appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from particular Elderships, and the amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of any thing that hath beene negligently
or weakly done by them; the answering also
of questions and requests from other Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,

The Ministers and Elders who are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
together with the expectants and
others who are pleased to be present, meeting
in the place, and at the day and houre appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which useth to be one halfe houre after
nine a clock in the forenoone, whereof warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is given by the sound of a bell, that so all
the affaires of that day (unlesse there be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
extraordinary to hold them longer) may
bee exped against mid-day, doe begin with
prayer, and proceed to the textuall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Scripture, which is done by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
each one in his own place by course, or
by the expectants, whose names are set forth in
a table, or written in the Register of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie
for that end; after the first speaker, some
other who followeth in order, and is also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Presbyterie the day before,
speaketh in the second place, collecting some
doctrines one or moe upon the text expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and shewing the use thereof. The second
speaker having ended about eleven a clock, the
exercise is closed with thanksgiving by him
who spake first. The matter of each dayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
is some portion of that particular book
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37092:32"/>
of the Old or New Testament agreed upon in
the Presbyterie: once every moneth some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
place or controversie is handled, unto
which the exercise giveth place for that day.
The ground is read in Scripture; the state of
the question propounded, the arguments for
the truth pressed and vindicated from the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistication
of the adversaries; but the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<hi>contra</hi> are left to bee proponed in the
Presbyteriall meeting by such Ministers as are
called by the Moderator to dispute upon the
propositions, or <hi>Theses</hi> exhibit, the day of the
meeting next before, by the contraversar, and
are propugned by him, the Moderator being
<hi>praeses</hi> of the disputation. That the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
may go thorow all the controversies, they
have also a table wherein they are all digested
in order, so that each minister or expectant
knoweth a moneth before what is next to be
treated.</p>
               <p>The exercise or common head of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
ended in publick, the people depart, and
the Ministers and Elders with others, who are
permitted to bee present, goe to the private
place of their meeting, where all being set in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37092:32"/>
order, and the Moderator having begun with
prayer, the doctrine delivered in publick is
examined, and each one of the Presbyterie and
expectants, either approveth, or in charity and
sobernesse of spirit, propoundeth his doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any point spoken of, which being done,
the speakers for that day are called upon (they
being apart at this time) their interpretation
and doctrine approved, and they encouraged
or (if there be cause) they are in a brotherly
manner admonished. The doctrine censured
(for this they call the censure of the doctrine.)
The matters before mentioned to be the subject
of the Presbyteriall jurisdiction, are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
modestly debated, and either concluded,
or taken to further deliberation, or remitted to
the Synod, and so the meeting concluded with
prayer. The Moderator either continueth in
his place betweene one Provinciall Synod and
another, or for a shorter time, but they think it
not fit to change the Moderator at every
meeting.</p>
               <p>The Presbyteries also do visit the severall
Churches within their bounds, either by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their full meetings at the Churches, or by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37092:33"/>
sending their commissioners thither, that they
may see how the ordinances of Christ are used
and obeyed, by the Minister, Eldership, and
all the congregation, and that if any thing be
amisse, it may be rectified.</p>

fit for such an assembly; and after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

if any difficultie arise which doth not fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

That it may be in a brotherly manner censured,

                  <head>The Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>IN the authoritie of these assemblies Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall,
Presbyteriall, Provinciall, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
and in the subordination of the lesser
unto the greater, or of more particular El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derships
to the larger and generall Eldership,
doth consist the externall order, strength, and
stedfastnesse of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
is lovely and comfortable to all fearing God,
whether Pastor or professors, and hath beene
very awefull and terrible, as an Armie with
Banners, to all Papists, to all Hereticks, Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37092:37"/>
Hirelings, and all ungodly persons:
As upon the one part they break not the brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
reed nor quench the smoaking flax, but do
cherish and labour to bring to ripenesse and
use, the graine of Mustardseed in sincere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners,
and the smallest talent in Preachers
having the zeale of God: So upon the other
part, no scandall of proud sinners escapeth
censure, no heresie or error is sooner hatched,
but is either presently spied out and crushed
by some of the inferiour assemblies, or, if it be
kept on foot and gather strength, it is quite
suppressed and extinguished in the generall
assemblie which meeteth once in the year, and
never suffereth such bastard births to grow to
be one yeare old, which is a true and maine
cause why no sects nor errours have appeared
in the reformed Church of <hi>France,</hi> and in the
Churches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
so long as they enjoyed the libertie and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of assemblies, which they did no sooner
by the mercie of God recover, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at their brightnesse, the mists and mildewes
gathered before were scattered and evanished.
And as, by the order and power of these assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37092:38"/>
Foxes are taken that they spoile not the
Vines, and Gangrenes are prevented that they
spread not against truth and unity, all sorts of
lewd and wicked men are discouraged and
put to shame: So is there excited among the
Godly Ministers an holy emulation by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
conference, and by perceiving
the gifts one of another, which maketh them
returne from the assemblies, with a meane and
humble conceipt of themselves, and with new
and strong resolutions for greater diligence in
their studies, and faithfulnesse in every Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
duty, to the common benefit and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the Churches; all the Ministers are
made more wise in matters of Governement;
and all the Congregations are affected with
reverence to what is required of them by their
particular Elderships, as having the consent
and approbation of the whole Church. Many
such fruits are reaped of these assemblies,
which without them no particular person or
congregation can have any ground to hope for
or expect.</p>
                  <p>They have no Arch-bishops, Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Suffraganes, no Chapters, no Curats,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37092:38"/>
dumbe nor idle Ministers, no hirelings, non-residents,
nor pluralists, no Deanes nor
Arch-Deacons, no Chanters, Sub-chanters,
nor Treasurers, no Chancellors, Officials, nor
Apparitors, no Canons, Peti-canons, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends,
Singingmen nor boyes; And yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
these and the like, they have practise and
use of all the ordinances of Christ; all matters
Ecclesiasticall determined, remitting questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of tithes, mariages, divorcements, &amp;c.
to the civill Judge to whom they properlie do
belong, and all petitions, complaints, and
Church grievances heard and redressed, which
they esteeme as the sweet yoke of Christ, and
think it a great ease both to their consciences
and estates to be free of such bundles and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
of trash and superfluities. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that to erect Presbyteries, Synods, and
Nationall assemblies, and still to keepe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
and the members of that Hierarchie is, in
the matter of Church government, not unlike
the Popish adding of Traditions to Scripture
in the rule of faith, or works unto faith in the
point of justification, &amp;c. additions to Christs
institution, being not only in respect of their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37092:39"/>
author humane inventions, and for any use
they can have idlements, vanities, and follies;
but that they do also corrupt the purity, and
eat out the life of the ordinances of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Here there is a superiority without tyrannie,
for no Minister hath a Papall or Monarchicall
Jurisdiction over his own flock, far lesse over
other Pastors, and over all the Congregations
or a large Dioces. Here there is a paritie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
confusion and disorder, for the Pastors are
in order before the Elders, and the Elders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Deacons; the Church is subordinate
to the Presbyterie, the Presbyterie, to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
and the Synod to the Nationall assembly.
One Pastor also hath priority before another,
for age, for zeale, for gifts, for his good deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of the Church, each one honouring him
whom God hath honoured, and as he beareth
the image of God, which was to bee seene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Apostles themselves. But none
hath power or jurisdiction above others: even
as in nature one eye hath not power over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
only the head hath power over all, even
as Christ over his Church. The same may bee
seene in the Common-wealth, and in some of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37092:39"/>
the offices of the Roman Church it selfe. And
lastly, here there is a subjection without slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
for the people are subject to the Pastors
and Assemblies, yet there is no Assemblie
wherein everie particular Church hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and power; nor is there any thing done,
but they are, if not actually, yet virtually called
to consent unto it.</p>
                  <p>As they have done and suffered much for
vindicating and maintaining the libertie of
their Religion, that what belongeth unto God
may be rendred unto God; So do they desire,
that according to the rule of righteousnesse,
each man have his owne, and above all men,
That the things which are <hi>Caesars</hi> be rendred
unto him, and to give him that which is Gods
were a wronging both of God and <hi>Caesar.</hi> They
have ever beene willing to taxes and to pay
subsidies above that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they were able. They
joyne w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the inward reverence of their hearts,
externall honour and obedience in all things
lawfull. They powre forth their prayers to
God in private and publick, for all blessings
spirituall and temporall upon his Royall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Government, and upon his Progenie;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37092:40"/>
and for the same blessings upon the Queenes
Majestie, especially that God by his Spirit
would give unto her the knowledge and love
of the truth. They long for her conversion as
an happinesse to her selfe, and a meane of great
happinesse to the King, to their Children, and
to all their Subjects. And, that the Lord may
answer their praiers, they think it incumbent
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor can any bond
whatsoever oblige them to the contrarie, to
use the best and most powerfull meanes, and
would most willingly in all humilitie, love
and respect, joyne their endeavours for that
blessed end. And as they thus present their best
desires and prayers, so are they readie to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
their lives to God for his Majesties good,
and in their hearts are grieved that their loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which they account their no small glorie,
should have beene called in question.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this all. But moreover they doe
acknowledge that his Majestie, as supreame
Magistrate, hath not onely charge over the
Common-wealth, but doth watch and hath
inspection over the Church and Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but in a civill way. <hi>Vos Episcopi in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:37092:40"/>
(saith <hi>Constantine) Ego extra Ecclesiam Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus
à Deo constitutus sum.</hi> And therefore that
he is, by his high calling and place, <hi>Custos u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius<expan>
                           <am>

tabulae,</hi> to command the precepts of the
first table as well as of the second table to bee
obeyed: That he is <hi>Vindex Religionis</hi> by his
sword, as the Spirit of God in Scripture is <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex,</hi>
and the Church is <hi>Index:</hi> That hee hath
power to turn the constitutions of the Church
into lawes, and to confirme them by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
sanction in Parliament: That he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
all his subjects to do dutie in matters of
religion, and may punish the transgressors:
That when debates arise about Religion, hee
hath power to call the Assemblies of the
Church, to be present and civilly preside in
them, and to examine their constitutions, that
he may discerne of them both as a Christian
caring for his own soule, and as supreame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
watching over his people: and that he
may do all things which can prove him to be
a kinde and carefull nursing Father. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
all that is vomited out to the contrarie,
[as, that they liked Anarchie better then Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie,
and that they would turne a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:37092:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into a democratie,] to be but the fictions
and calumnies of the malitious enemies of God
and his truth; not unlike the lies which
were devised against the Christians of old:
their consciences, their words, writings,
and actions, even then when the world
did put the worst constructions upon them,
were witnesses of the integritie of their hearts.
They doe still hold that there can bee no
antipathy betwixt one ordinance of God and
another. <hi>By him Princes do reigne,</hi> and hee
hath also appointed the Officers and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his own house. They do desire nothing
more then that the Sonne of God may reigne,
and that with and under the Sonne of God, the
King may command, and they, as good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to Christ and the King, may obey.</p>
