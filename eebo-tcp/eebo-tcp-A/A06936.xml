         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And thus you may also lay these strings ouerthwart Riuers or Brookes, and so, as they may almost very neere touch the water, nor neede you heerein at any time to make shorter your strings but pricking downe the first ende, goe from boughe to boughe till you haue couered so much of the Riuer all ouer, as you shall thinke to bee fit and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and so as if any Fowle light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they may not fall out of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, or from your danger: as thus for example.</p>

Touching the taking of the greater sort of Wild-fowle with Lime-twigges: our Fowler must prouide himselfe of good store of rodds, the best kind whereof are the long, smale, and streight growne twigges, or roddes which growe on the bushie branches of the Willow, being cut of an euen length one by another; and these twigges of which we speake, being for the greatest sort of Fowle, should be of the greatest length and thicknes, yet but small, light, and slender, being apt to play, winde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and cleaue to the least feather

Now these Engines are euer better and more proper for the water then the Land, and though they will serue very fitly for both, yet are they more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uient for the Water, by reason that the Water hideth all their imperfection, and maketh them appeare to the Fowle one and the same thing which at the first they did seeme.</p>

Also you must obserue in the Stalke to turne that side euer vpon the Fowle which is plaine without splents, or other markes more then the painting onely for feare of offence, and these are as good as any liue Horse for this vse being arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully handled in the motion, and made to mooue by slow degrees at leisure, as a Horse doth, and not suddenly or rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that will discouer them and breed affight in the Fowle.</p>

And this will most assuredly affoord you great store, both of pleasure and profit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the haunts of the Birdes are, for if there be plenty you shall take plenty, if their be few, yet of those few you shall haue your share.</p>

               <p>For the manner of <hi>Bat-fowling</hi> it may be vsed either with Nettes, or without Nettes: If you vse it without Nettes (which indeede is the most common of the two) you shall then proceede in this manner.

               <p>Thus being prepared and comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bushy, or rough ground where the haunts of Birds are, you shall then first kindle some of your fiers as halfe, or a third part, according as your prouision is, and then with your other bushy and rough poales you shall beat the Bushes, Trees and haunts of the Birds, to enforce them to rise, which done you shall see the Birds which are raysed, to flye and play about the lights and flames of the fier, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Next to these general takings of birds in the darke of night, either in Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine or Woody grounds, wee may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexe and place the taking of Byrds with the Sparrow net, which is an excercise to be vsed after Sunne-set in the euening and before Sunne-rise in the morning, which is either after birds goe to their roust, or before they stirre in the morniug.</p>
               <p>The Engine or <hi>Sparrow-nette</hi> which is to be made for this purpose, must carry this fashion or proportion.</p>
               <p>First, you must haue a long poale of the bignesse or quantity of a handsome Haukes poale, and at the vpper ende thereof must be fastened strongly, either with one, two or moe graines, a small square crosse wood like vnto the head of an ordinary Hayrake, but of a much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger length and size and of a little longer square, according to the fashion or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of this figure following.</p>

Then you shall make another staffe in all proportions like vnto this, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a third part in length at the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most this shorter Crosse-Staffe you shall ioyne to the longer, with a strong small Coard so loosely that at your pleasure it may fall two and froe from the longer Crosse-Staffe, and when both the Crosse-Staues meete together, that then they may be both of one equall length and height, and ioyne euen and iust together without any difference; for otherwise they will be out of order, and that which you seeke to take will escape away by meanes of such disorder, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iust and euen, the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will shew you this Figure following.</p>

These two Crosse-staues being thus ioyned together euen &amp; fit to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you shall then both to the one &amp; to the other, fixe a large &amp; wide Purse-net hauing that liberty at the toppe that the Crosse-staues may fall and part the one from the other a pretty distance and the lower ende of the Nette shall bee straite and narrow, and fastened fast to the same hole in the longer Crosse staffe, to which the shorter Crosse-staffe was before fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then shal you haue twosmale coards or lines, which with knots shall be faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to each ende of the shorter Crosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasse passing through the two holes, and so through the holes of the longer Cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staffe, through which they may goe and come at your pleasure, and then shall the other two ends of the wards be tyed on a knot together, at such an euen distance that the shorter staff may fal at your plea sure from the longer as farr as you thinke meet, or the widenes of the Net wil suffer it, and then another single ward being made fast to that last knot of the to cords (which single ward you shal euer carry in your right hand) with it you shal at your pleasure drawe the Crosse staues close
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12389:63"/>
together, and close vp the Net as you shall finde occasion, and also with it you shall make the staues and Net flye open &amp; widden as the place shal require where you are to set it; for you must haue great regard in the vsing of this Engine euer to place it close, for if you leaue any parte open either by too much slacknesse, or the whole haunte not couered by too much straightnesse, the Birds will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde it, and so escape and get away before you can come to your purpose: But euery thing being made handsome and fit, and the Lines yare and ready to passe too and froe with ease and gentel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then will the whole and intyre Engine, cary the fashion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of this figure which heere followeth.</p>

Now for the vse of this <hi>Sparrow-Net,</hi> is (as was before said) to be vsed late in the Euening, or early in the Morning, by seting it against the Eues of thatcht Houses or other houses, or against the eaues of Stackes, Houeles Barnes, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and other out-Houses, or against the eaues of Doue-coates, and being set close against them to knocke and thrust the Crosse-staues close against the same, making such a noyse as may inforce the Birds to flye out of their holes &amp; haunts into the Net, and then presently to draw the longe single Line and shut vp the Crosse-staues close, and then to take out the Birds so taken, and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you may in an Enening, or else in a Morning, goe ouer all your Houses, Barnes or Stacks, where are any haunts of Birds and take so many as you please.

               <p>The chiefe benefite of it is for the

mewing of Hauks, or geting into lust and strength, sicke and weake Haukes, for with this Engine you may Euening, and Morning take so many Birds as you please, and no more: and so giue them warme to your Hauke, which is the greatest nourishment that can be, and both raiseth a Hauke soone, and makes her mew fast, because they are as it were taken out of their owne nest, and from their owne liberty and freedome of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereas Birds that are taken longe before they are vsed, and so preserned day after day for these vses, they mourne and fall away, growing leane, vnsauory, and vnholesome, and the Haukes fedd and nourisht therwith, prosper but little better then with ordinary Dogges flesh, or other flesh that is lest nourishing. And thus much for Land-Fowle and the generall taking of them, as well by day as by night; Euening, or Morning.</p>

               <p>There is yet another way of taking <note place="margin">Vse of Stales with the Lime-Bush.</note> these small Birds with the great Limbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushe (before mentioned) and that is if either you want a call, or haue not the true vfe of a call: then you shall imploy the Stale, (of which there are diuers) as thus for instance: when your Bushe is placed as was before shewed, you shall then take a night Batte or two, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and place them vpon the obiect which is next of all to your Lime bushe, and in such apparant manner, that no Birde thereabouts but may behold them, which will no sooner be perceiued, but euery Byrde will come to gaze and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at them; then hauing no other conuenient lighting place but the Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushe, they will flocke as thicke into the same as may be, and so you may take them at your pleasure.</p>
               <p>Now as these night Batts, so the Oule is of like nature, and may be employed after the same manner; and by reason that she is lesse stirring and more melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly then the Batte, as also of greater

quantity, and sooner to bee perceiued, shee is a better Stale then the Bat.</p>
               <p>Now if you haue not a liue Owle or a liue Batte, if you can get but the skins of either and stoppe them with woole or flockes, they will serue as well as if they were aliue, and continue (with carefull keeping) twenty yeeres and better. I haue seene some that for want of either of these hath had an Owle so liuely cut out in wood, and so artificially painted, that it hath serued him for this purpose, as well as any liue one could doe, and he hath taken Byrdes in wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull great abundance therewith.</p>

               <p>For the manner and forme of Mayling <note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Mayling Hawkes.</note> of your Hawkes, it is thus to bee done; you shall take a handkercher, or any square piece of Linnen cloth, Canuas, or the like, and then knit the two ends of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one side together in such straite and close manner that the Hawke may onely thrust her head thorow it and no more, and that the pynions of the wings may rest vpon the noosse, and stay the body from going thorow; then you shall draw the rest of the handkercher all ouer the Hawkes body, and folding it close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about her traine, wrap it in such sort

And herein is also to bee vnderstood that this latter kind of Mayling of haukes (a trussing vp of the wings) is nothing neare so good as the first Mayling with the handkercher, nor carrieth a Hawke so easily nor yet so free from danger, becanse it not onely pincheth the wings and maketh the pinions sore and tender, but also, a little bruseth the fethers, which being but newly quilled are not come to their full strength and hardnesse, and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them chance to be in bloud (as all Hawkes (though of one Ayrie) yet some not at one instant) then it is great odds but this trussing them either breaketh or bruseth them in their bloud, whereby those feathers are made vnseruiceable, for all that yeare following.</p>
               <p>There bee some that when they take <note place="margin">The See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Hawkes.</note> these young Hawkes, doe neither Mayle them nor Trusse them, but onely Seele them after this manner.</p>
               <p>They take a Needle with a square point (which we commonly call a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Needle) being fine, smale and much worne, and put in it a Crymson silke, then put the Needle betweene the Hawkes eye, and the neather lidde of the eye, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12389:83"/>
so drawe the silke thorow it, and then bring it crosse ouer the Hawkes heade, and there taking the Needle from the Silke, bring the two endes of the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the toppe of the Hawkes head, and so drawing both the nether liddes close o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the eyes, knit them with a fast knott vpon the crowne of the Hawkes heade, and so carry her either in your handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or vpon your hand, at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>But this manner of Seeling of hawkes <note place="margin">Discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in Seeling of Hawkes.</note> is both troublesome, painefull, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the hawke, and except the man haue a steedy hand and a cunning eye that doth it, hee may not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage the putting out of the Hawkes eye with the point of the Needle; but also by any little ouer straining of the silke, teare out the skinne of the lydde, and thereby both cause a foule blemish and sometimes blindnesse as is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seene in dayly experience.</p>
               <p>To helpe then this discommodity of <note place="margin">Helpe for the discom modities.</note> Seeling; If you haue neither skill to Mayle your Hawke, nor to trusse your Hawke (rather then you shall Seele her) you shall take a plaine Ruffter hood
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:12389:84"/>
which some call the first hood) being made of soft and gentle leather, large and easie for the head, and put it vpon her, and so carry the Hawke home.</p>
               <p>The next manner of taking of hawkes <note place="margin">Taking Hawkes in their Sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> (according to their seasons) is to take them in their sorage, which is indeede from that time they haue preyed for themselues and are masters of their owne strengthes and courages, being able to make a true choise of their prey, and to conquer it; vntil the first whole yeare be fully expired, and that they haue mewed and exchanged either all, or at least, most part of their first feathers, after which time of the second coat, they are no more called Sore-hawkes, (or hawkes in their soreage) but entermewers, (or hawkes of the second Coat) and they are most easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be distinguished from the first, for the feathers of the second coat are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more palish blew, and not so blacke as are those of the first, and euery time that she changeth, her coate is paler and paler till she come to bee called a white Hawke, which you shal so much the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier distinguish, if you obserue the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of her feathers, for no hawk mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:12389:84"/>
so entirely but she leaueth euer some feather of the former yeare vnmewed, &amp; those are so easily to be distinguished one from an other, that any diligent obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you shall be euer able to knowe of what yeare or age your hawke is. Now to proceed to the maner of taking these hawks in their sorage, or after they prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for themselues, you shall (being perfit in the knowledge of the ayrie for that is euer first to be intended) most diligently marke their morning and euening going forth to find out their prey, and how and where they prey, as also the manner of their returning home, &amp; where they take their stand (that is, on what bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches of the tree they do most vsually sit) for hawkes are the constantest of all birds to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherunto they inure &amp; woont them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, neither will as others doe sit one while in one place &amp; another while on an other. Therfore when you are acquainted with their hours of going out &amp; the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wher they sit at their returne, you shal then take aduantage of her going out, &amp; when shee is absent about her prey, you shal climb the tree wher her stand is &amp; in a strait place through which necessarily
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:12389:85"/>
she must passe, you shall take a paire of those Nettes, which Faulkoners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doe call Vrines, or Vrnes, being not much different in shape from the nets formerly described for the <hi>Branchers</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are much, larger and more hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in compasse, and indeede are to bee bought almost of any Barbar, or Nette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers which dwell in the Wood Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and they must be of strong twisted browne thride, and dyed either Blewe or Greene, as aforesaid, with a reasonable large mashe, for that sooner entangleth and holdeth the faster.</p>
               <p>These Vrines you shall place in euery <note place="margin">Placing of the Vrines</note> seuerall passage, and in sundry Trees round the stand which the Hawkes vseth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as she may come no way to the stande without danger of the Nettes, into which if at any time she strik, she is presently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and then to be disposed as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly described.</p>
               <p>Now because you may not in any wise suffer the Hawke to hang too long in the Nette for feare of bruising and hurting her selfe, you shall as soone as your Vrines are placed, take vp some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and vnseene place, where you may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12389:85"/>
lye and watch the comming of the hauke and assoone as you see her strike or be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, presently (with as conuenient speed as you can, and not doeing any hurt to your other sport) you shall assend vp to the tree, and take downe the hauke and mayle, trusse or hood her as you shal finde occasion.</p>
               <p>Now if by the vncertainetie of the <note place="margin">Taking with stales</note> Hawkes comming home, or the opennes and liberty of the passages which these young Hawkes haue, you finde that this manner of worke auaileth not, you shall then rise two howres at the least before day, and come as neere to the Hawkes stand (or resting place) as you can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly get (without giuing of any affright or amazement to the young Hawkes) and ascending vp into such trees as you see doth most face those places where the Hawkes sit, and are so plaine in their viewes that they cannot rise without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them, and in such trees amongst the most conuenient branches you shall pitch and place your Vrines, and vnder the guard of them you shall fixe Stales of such Birdes, either great or little, as you see the Hawke dayly preyeth vpon,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12389:86"/>
and these Stales you tye at such a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient liberty, that they may flutter with their wings, and flye a little vp and down about the Nette, yet by no meanes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the guard of the Nettes, nor so as the Hawke may not in any wise come vnto them, or offer to stricke at them without the certaine danger of the Nettes.</p>
               <p>And hauing thus placst your Nets round about the stande in euery conuenient place, you shall then descend and lodge your selfe in some secret place where you may lye and watch what issue doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of your businesse; Then you shall see that assoone as the day openeth, and the Hawke beginneth to rouse her selfe vpon her stand, and to gaze and looke about her (as it is the nature and manner of euery Hawke) and hath also cast vp her casting of plumadge, or feathers which shee had receiued into her body the day and night before, and is then sharpe, eager, and hungry, as of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie and likelyhood shee must needes be. Then will shee no sooner espie your Stales, but with all speed possible she will flye vnto them, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:12389:86"/>
will compell her) shee will presently be intangled in the Neetes, so as you may take her at your pleasure; and thus in one morning with a little diligence and temperance, in one morning you may take the whole Ayerie; But if out of too much rashnesse and hastinesse, or for the couetousnesse to bee Master of one Hawke you rise vp to soone, and shewe your selfe, whereby the rest of the Hawkes doe take affright or dismay; presently those Hawkes vntaken will mout and flye away, and so all the rest of your hope is vtterly lost for that day, and you must begin againe and be more ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>There bee some that for the taking of <note place="margin">Taking with Lime diuersly.</note> these Sore-hawkes doe vse Lime-roddes, or a little small Lime bushe artificially made of fine twigges fixt so gently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a little socket of woode made like a handle, that assoone as any thing toucheth or striketh them they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depart from the socket and clappe close to the thing that toucheth them, whereby they are intangled, these little bushes are artificially placed about the stand wher the hauk vseth to sit, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passing

it so about that the Hawke cannot come to the same, whether with winges opened or wings close, but she must of necessitie touch the points of the roddes, (for more then the points must not come neere the stand, or appeare, aboue it for feare of giuing affright) and then assoone as the points are touched, (leauing the socket) they clap vnder the Hawkes wings and so entangle her.</p>
               <p>As for the Lime-roddes which are to be vsed single by themselues, they must be fixed to the neerest branches to the stand, comming sloapewise so neere vnto the stand that the Hawke cannot come in, or settle her selfe vpon the same, but must of force touch some one point or other of them, which no sooner shall be touched, but presently it must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the place where it was fixt and clap vnto the Hawke; which assooue as shee feeleth, and beginneth to be angry, and to beate or strugle with her wings, then instantly the rest clap about her, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together intangle her.</p>
               <p>And here is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> to bee noted that these Lime-rods must not be onely placed in and about the Stand, or that particular

place where the Hawke most vsually sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but also in and about all passages and places of likelihood through which the Hawke goeth, or flyeth when shee comes to the stand; yet in such secret &amp; close maner and so sheltered with leaues, and other branches, that the Hawke may by no meanes discerne or distinguish them from the naturall spraies or twiggs of the tree. And here is further to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that these single Lime-twigs or Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodds may be of a good size or length, as a foot, or a foot and a halfe, and Limed either halfe or three parts, as occasion shall serue, yet the smaller and finer that these roddes are the better they are, and doe much sooner catch and more safely entangle. But for those that are to bee vsed Bush-wife in the wooden sockets or handles, containing some a dozen, and some sixteene rods in a cluster, yet so as one may not touch another; these must be as small as small may be, as not aboue sixe inches at the most, and limed about foure inches and no more, two inches being left cleane and vnlymed: that is to say, halfe an inche which must stand in the socket; and also an inche and a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12389:88"/>
halfe aboue the Socket, which is preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the Man to handle and touch, when either hee putteth the Roddes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Socket, or taketh them out of the Socket.</p>
               <p>Now for the manner of making of <note place="margin">The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the little Lime bus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e.</note> this little Lime-Bush with the Socket, it is two wayes to be framed, that is to say, if the Socket be round and thicke and of a large compasse, whereby it is to be fixt into the Stand, and nothing but the rods to appeare aboue, then must all the holes (in which the Lime-Rods must stand) be made aboue sloape-wise all of one iust height and iust depth, and the Rods of one true and equall length without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>But if the Socket must bee small and slender whereby it cannot containe aboue a hole or two on the toppe of the Socket, and that it is to be fixt amongst the branches as a naturall branch, or a maine spray of the Tree, then must the holes be made sloapewise downe all the length of the Socket, and in such wise as you see twiges grow, that is to say not one iust oposite to another, but one in the mid part or middle space betweene
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12389:88"/>
two, as by cutting of any naturall bushie branch whatsoeuer, you may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</p>
               <p>And in this case you shall not haue your Roddes all of one entire length, but the vppermost must bee the shortest, (as about the scantling before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of sixe Inches) and then the next longer by so much more as there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the holes, and so as the toppes may meete, and bee of an equall height, the next longer then that, so as it may also meete in an euen height with the first; and so consequently euery one longer then other, yet so as none at the toppe may be longer or shorter then the first, but all meete of one equall height and make the Bushe of one entire and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen proportion.</p>
               <p>Nowe although this manner of taking <note place="margin">Discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of taking with lyme.</note> with Lyme is very safe and certaine and may bee doue with more ease and lesse trouble then any of the former, yet is it nothing so good nor so neate: First, in respect it fouleth the feathers and gleweth them together, whereby the hawke is depriued the perfit vse of them, for the Bird-lyme (whose cleauing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12389:89"/>
and sticking nature almost no man is so Ignoraut as not to vnderstand) when it is gotten vpon the feathers, doth so stick &amp; felter vpon the same, that it is almost in no wise to be taken away, but doth so disable the Hawke, that I haue seene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in mine owne experience, that albeit they did try many experiments, yet could they neuer make their Hawkes (once li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) cleane againe, till those feathers were mewed &amp; new came in their place; Secondly it fouleth and disableth not the ordinary and vselesse feathers (as the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage on the breast, or the small feathers on the backe, but the maine and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall feathers belonging to the winges, and without which a Hawke cannot at all mooue, or beare her selfe in the Ayre.</p>
               <p>And lastly it is of such a melting and loose Nature, that albe it touch or hurt but a feather or two at the first; yet with strugling and striuing, or much rubing and handling of the Lime, or seeking to wash away the Lime with things not fit for that purpose, it presently spreadeth farther and farther, so that where there was but a few feathers infected, presently
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:12389:89"/>
you shall haue the whole Hawkes body, and hardly any feather free from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of the Lime.</p>
               <p>Now in asmuch as the manner of take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Remedies against Lime.</note> of Hawkes is most common, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause most easie) both among Fowlers, and Faulconers; and that indeed oulde Hawkes are very hard or sildome got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton without the helpe of Lime, as well in respect oftheir Naturall winge, and skill to apprehend and find out what they imagine may hurte them, as also in respect of their vigilance and care to flye and eschew all manner of affrightes, and shewes which shall interpose and happen betweene them and the places which they haue chosen for their haunts: And because that euery man is not a taker of Hawkes, but may and doth many times buy his Hawke from the Fowler or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Land-taker, and that indeede the Fowler or Land-takers, may and doe happen very many times light of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent principall choyce Hawkes, both <hi>Haggards</hi> and others, that therfore this offence of Lime may neither hinder you of a good Iewell when it is tendered you. nor abate from the Fowler any part of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:12389:90"/>
the iust reward and merrite which is due to his labour, as also that ignorance in this case may not hinder you of a full yeares sport, (as many times it doth when this mischance hapneth) but that you may clense and make cleane your Hawke; presently as soone as you see this pollution and foulnesse, you shal first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue to take off your Lime-rods with your wette hands, (hauing for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose euer water in readinesse) so gently and easily as may be, not rowling (as some doe) the Lime-rods vp and downe and so spreading them farther, but (lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them vpright and putting a white paper betweene the Lime-rodd and the feathers) deuide them gently without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further anoyance, and betweene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery feather and another that is touched with the Lime, (as neere as you can) put a little piece of white paper, for this will both keepe the other feathers from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infection, and also sucke in the Lime and make it much apter and easier to be taken away, nor will it let the lime spred any whitt further then it was at the first applying, then hauing thus guarded all the rest of the feather, you may very well
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:12389:90"/>
mayle vp your Hawke (if shee be a wilde one) or otherwise put on a Rufter-hood, and so bring her home (but mayling is the better) when you haue brought her home, you shall vnmayle her; and first, take away one paper (beginning with the principalest feathers) and then hauing very fine clarified Capons Grease, or at least Goose-grease, annoint the lymed feather very well and thicke therewith, then take of the finest hower glasse sand and scatter it as thicke as you can vpon the oyntment; which done goe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infected feather and doe as much, and so consequently to as many feathers as you can well handle at one time, and then hauing warme water ready, bathe the infected feathers (thus drest as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) in the same, and then gently rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and chafing the Lymed feathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene your fingers, working off the Lyme, which you shall finde will come away in thicke little rough roules so fast as you can wish or desire it. But if it so happen that you cannot come to bathe these feathers in the warme water, then (hauing annointed them as aforefaide, and pounvst on the sand) you shall take a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:12389:91"/>
piece of spundge, and dipping it in the warme water, bath the feathers therwith and then working them betweene your fingers you may easily bring away the Lyme as aforesaid, and make your hauke as cleare as she ewas before her taking, obseruing euer and anone when the Lime sticketh &amp; commeth not away so round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and quickly as you would haue it, then presently to powre on more of the sand, and so to continue, till the Hawk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> be thorowly clensed.</p>
               <p>Now there is another maner of taking <note place="margin">Taking Hawkes with the Lanthorne</note> of theseyoung Hawkes, and indeede no more generally for them then for other elder hawkes of what nature or quallity soeuer they be, so they take their stands either on Trees, Rockes, Towers, or any place aloft which is assailable, and where a man may climbe without danger or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent perill, and especially this maner of taking is excellent for the regaining of all such Hawkes as shall happen to breake out of the Mewe, where hauing bin long kept and without familiaritie with the man (more then the receiuing of their foode) they are becomed almost vterly wild and Haggard againe.</p>
               <p>

And also for all such hawkes as shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to escape or break away before they be reclaimed or made to know the man and obey his voyce, or for any other wilde hawke as hath been before spoken. Any of which chaunces or mischaunces <note place="margin">The Art how to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a hawk fledde.</note> when they shall happen vnto you, you must first diligently pursue and follow the Hawke both by inquisition and Art: By inquisition, as by enquiring amongst Field-keepers, Shepheards, Heardsmen, and the like, if they haue seene or heard of a Hawke, and by Art in taking aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the wind and weather, for if there blow any stiffe or loud gale of wind then commonly, a Hawke will flye downe the winde, but if the Ayre be milde, gentle, and pleasant, then now and then shee will put vp into the winde. Also you must haue a very diligent eye to note in your pursuit if you see any Checke arise, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Crowes, Pydgions, Rauens, or any other birds, for it is tenne to one that there you shall be sure to finde your Hawke.</p>
               <p>Now that you may know what a Check <note place="margin">What a Checke of any Fowle</note> is, you shall vnderstand that whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you see any flockes or multitudes

Now when by this atificiall search and inquirie you haue fonnd your Hawke, you shall then with all care and diligence watch and pursue her from place to place till you bring her to the euening or night stand, which will be about the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or setting of the Sunne, (for it is to be presupposed, that this Hawke is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ramadge and wilde, and not to bee taken by any Call or Luer:) when you haue therefore brought her to the stand, and see her safely and constantly setled, which you shall know by the rousing of her selfe and shaking of her feathers, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by her feaking, pruning, and such like delights, which shee will take in her selfe after she is constantly setled, (for before you shall see no such motion come from her) then you may be bould to depart and leaue her, for without some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie affright, nothing will moue her till the next morning; then hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided all things, fit for your purpose, both for clyming vnto her, as also for the matter and manner of her taking, you shall then in the dead of the night, and when it is at the vttermost darkenesse, (for no night can bee too darke for this

                  </gap> artificially steale vp your other hand in which the Lanthorne is not, and with it take her fast by the legges, thrusting your great singer betweene her legges, and your forefinger on the outside of one legge,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:12389:94"/>
and your middle finger and little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on the out-side of the other legge, and so hold her that shee can neither stirre nor moue; then hauing a hooke or some other crooked engine at your side whereby to fasten your Lanthorne, presently clap the Hawke to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary side with one hand and stay the batting of her wings with the other, and then hauing your handkerchife or some other linnen cloth in a readinesse, presently mayle the Hawke and so bring her downe from the stand and carry her home.</p>
               <p>This is a certaine and most infallible way for the taking of any of those wilde Hawkes before mentioned, yet if in this worke you observe to couer your face with a close hood either, of greene or blew collour leauing onely two loope holes for your eies and the rest of your face concealed, your worke will be more easie, and you shall come to your prey with a great deale lesse suspition, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is so affrightfull in this case as the face of the man only.</p>
               <p>And albe the glimmering or light of the candle mixt with the darknesse of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:12389:94"/>
night is a guard sufficient, because the flame of the candle is the onely obiect which taketh vp the Hawkes eye, yet neuerthelesse in as much as your hand may now and then chance sometime to fayle in the carriage of the Lanthorne, and partly by looking for your right way, and to auoide daunger, and partly to make sure your prey, so that you may neither come too rashly vpon her, nor yet goe too farre away or wide on either hand, you may now and then let your Lanthorne slip from before your face to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and losse of all your labour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is most expedient that you haue this hood before spoken of to couer and conceale your face, and then you shall not neede to feare, but your worke will prosper and goe on according to your wish, and in the fulnesse of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Now there is another wilde Hawke <note place="margin">Of the old wild Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</note> (which is of a great deale more price and value then any of these which we haue formerly written of) which will hardly or neuer bee taken with any of these waies, meanes, deuices, or engines

before recited, because she is a Hawke of more age, circumspection and cunning and that is the <hi>Haggard Faulcon gentil,</hi> and now and then (though seldome) the <hi>Gerfaulcon</hi> or the <hi>Gerkin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Hawkes come into this Land <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the wild Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</note> (or any other of like clymat or tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) in the beginning of Winter, and (according to the opinions of the best Faulconers and Fowlers) to come in by the pursuing of Wild-foule (at that sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the yeare) from other more col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Nations, where the waters and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers are closed vp and couered with ice, so as they can neither finde reliefe nor pleasure, nor any thing to sustaine them; and heere commonly they doe continue from October to March (if the season of the yeare doe fall out any thing wet) but after that time they depart againe and will not stay by any meanes; whence it comes that your skilfullest Faulconers will not (after March is spent, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before it be gone) in any wise let their Haggards flie either at the Ryuer or at any other prey (as the <hi>Hearne</hi> or the like) for by a very naturall instinct and mouing of their owne bloods at that

time of the yeare, they are forced vpon euery toy or conceit to flie away, nor will turne tayle againe, till they come into those colder Regions from which before they departed; where finding the riuers beginning to open, and all sorts of foule to come in and resort, there she presently meeteth with her <hi>Tercel,</hi> where coopling and ingendring, they bring forth their ayries together vpon the rocks, clyffes, and other high places bordering neere the Sea side.</p>
               <p>Now when the <hi>Haggard</hi> (whether it <note place="margin">The haunts of Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</note> be <hi>Tercel</hi> or <hi>Faulcon</hi>) is comed into this Kingdome, you shall vnderstand that their haunts are euer for the most part both vpon great and small riuers which runne through low and lardge leuelled valleies or plaines, where there is euer some drie ground whereon to land her prey when she hath taken it, and where all kinde of the middle sort of foule doe resort, as <hi>Duck, Mallard, Tayle, Widge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Shel-foule</hi> and <hi>Greene-foule;</hi> and vp and downe these riuers she will beate and flie at an extraordinarie high pitch, so that if any foule happen either vpon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright or otherwise to rise vp; or if any

               <p>As they doe haunt thus vpon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and mouing streames, so also they will haunt vpon the plashes and blanke waters; in the open seasons, and when they are not closed and bound vp with ice, and also vpon pits and quarries where stone hath beene digged, and vpon small rundles or little narrow and shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low streames when any Foule vse but to frequent and lye vpon the same.</p>
               <p>Now heere is a principall thing to <note place="margin">To know the good Hawke from the bad.</note> be obserued, that in searching the haunts of these <hi>Haggards,</hi> such <hi>Haggards</hi> as you shall finde to prey vpon the great, lardge and strong waters, whether they be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers or blanke waters, that you shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count euer those Hawkes to bee the best, as in that greatnesse and strength of conquest to be euer most valiant, most cunning and nimble and the highest fliers, and such Hawkes as shall prey vpon little pits, small plashes, or narrow rundels

and small riuellets, that those are the weaker Hawkes, lesse skilfull, and lesse valiant.</p>
               <p>Now when you haue either heard of, <note place="margin">How to take these Haggards.</note> or shall by your owne especiall obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion see the comming in of any of these Hawks and from the knowledge of their owne worth and value shall be desirous to make your selfe owner and possessor of so gentlemanly and rich a treasure, you shal first then early in the morning by the spring of day rise vp to watch her haunt, and as neere as you can see her manner of preying (not so much for any thing that is auaileable therein to the taking of the Hawke, as to haue a true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her worth and excellencie) when you haue seene her take her prey and feede, you shall then see her rouse her selfe and goe to her place of reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, where after she hath fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:12389:97"/>
themselues against in the Sommer sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or else vpon the withered trunke or armes of some old, dead and decayed tree; To which stand when you haue watcht her, and see her safely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly setled; you may then depart away about any of your other businesse, for she will not begin to stirre (from that place) till it be towards euening, which commonly is betweene three and foure of the clocke in the after noone; Now about three quarters of an houre, or halfe an houre (at the least) before that time you shall come forth againe, and watch her as before vnto her euening prey, and so from thence to her night stand; which commonly will be either vpon some medow-stake, mearestone, or else some of the other things before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed: Now when you haue thus found out both her day stand and her night stand, to which these Hawkes are wonderfull constant, you shall then the next morning come to the day stand and hauing noted the arme or the braunch whereon she most vsually sitteth: you shall mount vp to the place and hauing very fine small long lyme rods well ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

with the best lyme, you shall of them make a cradle, that is, you shall crose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">The Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Cradle.</note> place your lymerods on the branch or stake on penthouse wise hanging ouer another, that when the Hawke commeth in with her spread wings to light vpon the stand, that then as she gathereth in her wings together, she may so draw in the lymerods vnder her wings, and by that meanes be intangled and taken, and these lymerods you shall place so yare and nimble to rise and fall about the Hawke, that vpon the least touch of any feather they may presently in an instant cleaue vnto her, and one lymerod must depend and by a small string be so faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto another. that when the Hawke toucheth but one rod, presently in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant all the rest may suddenly clap about her.</p>
               <p>Now that I stand not more seriously and in larger tearmes to discribe this Cradle, the true manner figure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, I hold it a matter halfe needlesse because it is a thing so exceeding fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent amongst all sorts of Faulconers and Foulers, that hardly one man in ten if he haue any skill or delight that way)
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:12389:98"/>
but can shew you how to performe it, Besides, these things which consist onely in action and not in relation, are so hard to be set downe in words (especially that an ignorant vnderstander may get profit thereby, multiplicitie of words confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding memory, and scarcitie of words wanting satisfaction) that I had rather referre the diligent learner to a <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>When you haue thus placed your cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle on the day stand, you shall then goe to the night stand and there doe as much, placing your cradle in the same manner as was before shewed; and this must be

done during the time that the Hawke is vpon her day Stand, which performed, you shal then go againe to the day stand to see what effect your worke hath taken and if you finde that the Cradle is either too largewhereby the Hawke commeth into her Stand without touching it, or too lowe &amp; narrow, that all her feathers are so high aboue it that any of them can touch it; then you shall vpon her first departure reforme all those errours, and out of the true Iudgement of your eye, make it so fite that by no meanes possib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly she may escape the second time, and then fourthwith hauing the true scantling of the first Cradle, make the second (which is that vpon the Night-Stand) sutable and answerable in all poynts to the former, and so either in one or the other, you cannot chuse but accomplish your purpose, which assoone as you haue attained, you shall fourthwith take the Hawke and draw off the Lime-rods in such sorte as hath beene before shewed, then Mayle her vp, bringe her home, clense away the Lime, and then man and order her according to the arte of a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Faulconer: and so keep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>There be other Fowlers which vse to take these kind of Hawkes) which goe a neerer way to worke (yet nothing more sure then this, or certaine) and that is they will find out their hauntes, some times by the Check and trouble of foule, which rising from the water will present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enewe and turne backe againe to the Riuer as not daring to goe forward in their passage, or by the comming in of Fowle, and presently seeing them wheele about and turne backe againe as fast as wing can beare them, and sometimes by seeing the bald Buzzard, Ringtaile, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such like cowardly byrdes of pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

you cannot haue a better guide vnto the haunt of a Haggard then one of these Buzzards, for they will direct you at a haire to the place of their preying.</p>
               <p>Now therefore others which will not take this paines neather, but thinke it much to tedious, and therefore they will onely desire to informe themselues of the Hawkes stands, and they care for no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whence it doth come that they wll labour about to search in the most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places to finde out the stands, and when they come truely to the place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede and where the stand is, they may perfectly knowe it by the Mutings and Slycings of the Hawke, which indeede differeth much from any other Fowle whatsoeuer, and these Mutings or Sly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seyngs will be in great plenty both vpon the stand, and also round about the Stand.</p>
               <p>Now if it be the day Stand, then you <note place="margin">How to know the Day-stand from the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</note> shall find about it nothing but Mutings, &amp; Slyscing without any mixture of other matter; But if it be the night Stand, then you shall finde lying amongst the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings many and diuers castings of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, plumage and the like, which you

               <p>The next way to take <hi>Partridges</hi> is <note place="margin">Taking of Partridges with Lime.</note> with lime or lime-rods, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: You shall first take of the fairest, strongest and lardgest Wheate-strawe you can get (of which, that which is called the whole straw wheate, is the best, or for want of it the fairest and lardgest Rye-straw) and cutting them of betweene knot and knot (obseruing the lowest ioints or knots are the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest and best) you shall then lime these with the strongest and best lime, in such manner as hath beene formerly deelared in other Chapters for the liming of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rods or wands, and so comming to the, haunts where <hi>Partridges</hi> doe vsually frequent, after you haue called a little, and find that you are answered againe, you shall then in such manner and forme as hath beene formerly shewed you for other roddes, prick downe these limed strawes round about you in many

crosse rowes and rankes, and that not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neere you, but a prety distance off, yet not out of the compasse of your eye, but so as you may discerne when any thing toucheth them: and these lymed strawes you shal place not onely crosse the Lands but the furrowes also, taking at least two or three Landes within your circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; which done, you shall then lay your selfe downe closse and secretly and beginne againe to call, not ceasing till you haue drawne them toward you, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they cannot come, but they must of necessitie passe through the Lime, which they shall no sooner touch, but presently they are taken and intangled and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that they come flocking and closse together, like so many Chickins, they wil so besmeare and daube one another, that if there be twenty in the Coouy hardly any one will escape.</p>
               <p>Now here is to bee noted, that this manner of taking of <hi>Partridges</hi> with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

in woods, in pastures, or meadowes with Lyme, then you shall vse the ordinarie Lyme-rods made of wooden wandes, as hath bin before shewed, and pricke them downe, and order them in all points in such sort as is already mentioned of the Lymed strawes, for it is both the safest certainest, &amp; best course that can be taken</p>

by the eye, by the eare, or by the haunt all which aske the same obseruations and carracters which haue beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared touching the <hi>Partridge,</hi> and with the same causions exceptions and difficulties.

               <p>Now you are to obserue in the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">Diuersitie of Notes.</note> of these Byrdes, that they haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers notes and tunes, some belonging to the male Byrdes, and some vnto the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, all which you must haue per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Now for the manner of taking of any, <note place="margin">How to take them.</note> or all of these Byrds, it is one and the same with the taking of the <hi>Partridge</hi> and may be done either by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Now although some may thinke it strange that a Dogge should be brought to Set this small game, yet there is no strangenesse therein; for Dogs in this Arte are made to any thing that they are accustomed, so it be not a thing meerely contrary and against their natures, which this is not; for it is the nature of euery Spaniell, naturally to hunt all manner of

Byrdes, or any thing that hath wing (though some with more earnestnesse &amp; greedinesse then othersome.) Now these are Byrdes and haue wing, so that they are naturall for the Spaniel to hunt, and there then remaineth nothing but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customing the Dogge thereunto, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with your minde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, that this is the thing which you would haue him hunt, which assoone as he vnderstands, instantly hee pursues and followes it, and is as earnest in it, as in any other chase, prey or pleasure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.</p>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:12389:142"/>
so both saue his purse and make his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and profit both more sure and more delicate; for this I must assure all men, (that buy their dogges from mercinary teachers) that euermore those sales-men doe reserue in their owne bosomes some one secret or another, for the want of knowledge, where of the purchaser quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly findes his dogge imperfit, and so is forced vpon euery disorder or alteration of keeping to send the dogge back to his first master a new to be reformed, which drawing on euer a new price, makes the dogges certaine price with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, without valuation.</p>
               <p>This falt to redresse; and to make euery man the true master of his owne worke, I will shew you heere in a briefe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious manner al the mysteries and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets which lie hidde in this laboursome businesse.</p>
               <p>The first thing therefore that you must learne in this art, is to make a true electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your dogge, which you intend to apply to this purpose of Setting, and in this election you shall obserue, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though any dogge which is of perfit and good sent, and naturally adicted
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:12389:143"/>
to the hunting of feathers, as whether it be the Land-Spaniell, Water-Spaniell, or else the Mungrell betweene either of both those kindes, or the Mungrels of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of those kindes, either with the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low flewed hound, the tumbler, lurcher, or indeede, the small bastard Mastiffe may bee brought to this perfection of Setting (as I haue seene by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, both in this and in other Nations) yet is their none so excellent indeede as the true bred Land-Spaniell, being of a nimble and good size, rather small then grosse, and of a couragious and fierie mettall, euermore louing and desiring toyle, when toyle seemes most yrksome and wearie, which although you cannot know in a whelpe so yong, as it is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he must be, when you first begin to traine him to this purpose, yet may you haue a strong speculation therein, if you choose him from a right litter or breede, wherein by succession you haue knowne that the whole generation haue beene endued with all these qualities, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that he is a strong, lusty and nimble raundger, both of actiue foote; wanton tayle, and busie nostrill, that his toyle is
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:12389:143"/>
without wearinesse, his search without changeablenesse, and yet, that no delight nor desire transport him beyond feare or obedience; for it is the perfectest charracter ofthe most perfectest Spaniel, euer to be fearefull and louing to him that is his Master and keeper: I confesse I haue seene excellent rare Setting dogs made in the Low-Countries, which haue beene of a Bastard tumblers kind (for indeede a true Lande-Spaniel, is there Gaysson) and indeede, I haue found in them (if I may so tearme it) a greater wisedome (which indeede is but a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feare) then in our Land-Spaniels, but comparing the whole worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is the labour in raundging, the scent in finding, and the art in Setting, they haue beene much inferior to our dogs, and not able to stand vp with them in the lardge and spatious Champaines, nor yet to brush through or make their waies in the sharpe thickets and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some couerts. To speake then in a word touching the best choice of this Setting dogge, let him be as neere as you can the best bredde Land-Spaniell, that you can procure, and though some haue beene
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:12389:144"/>
curious in obseruing of their colours, as giuing prehominence to the Motley, the Liuer-hude, or the White and Blacke spotted; yet questionlesse, it is but a vaine curiosity, for no colour is amisse for this purpose, prouided the naturall qualities bee perfit and answerable for the worke to which ende you intende them.</p>
               <p>Now when you haue thus made a good election of your Dogge, you shall beginne to handle and instruct him at foure monethes olde, or at sixe moneth at the vttermost, for to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>When all these things aforesaid are perfitly learned, it is to be imagined that by this time the whelpe will be at least twelue moneths of age, at which time (the season of the yeare being fit) you may very well aduenture to goe into the field and suffer him to raunge and hunt therein, yet with such carefulnesse and obedience, that albe his spirit and mettall do neuer so much transport him, yet vpon the first (<hi>Hem</hi>) or warning of your voice that he stop and looke backe vpon you, as who should say (doe you call) and vpon the second, or reitterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your voice, that forthwith he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forbeare hunt further, or else come into your foote and walke by you, till you giue him new incouragement; and in

this raunging or hunting of the whelpe, you finde that through wantonnesse or foolishnesse he be giuen to babling or opening without cause, you shall then at first chide him therefore, but if that preuaile not, you shall then correct him much more sharpely, as by bite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him hard with your teeth at the rootes of his eares, or else lashing him hard with a sharpe whip-corde-lash, till you haue made him so staunch that he will hunt close and warily, without once opening either through wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or the rising vp of any small birds before him.</p>
               <p>Now when you haue brought your dogge to this staunch and obedient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hunting, and that he will bestow himselfe in such manner as you please to appoint him, then as soone as you finde him to come vpon the haunt of any <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> (which you shall know both by his greater eagernesse in hunting, as also by a kinde of whimpering and whining in his voice being greedily desirous to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, onely feare and awe keepes him in an vnwilling obedience) you shall then speake vnto him as warning him to take

heede, by saying, (<hi>Be wise, Take heeede</hi>) or the like, but if notwithstanding he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rush in and so spring them, or else open or vse any other meanes by which the <hi>Partridge</hi> escapeth, you shall then presently take him and correct him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry soundly, and then cast him off againe and either let him hunt those in such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as you haue markt them, or else in some other haunts where you are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some Couey lodgeth; and then as before shewed, being commed vpon the haunts, giue the dogge warning, and if you see that out of feare he standeth still and waueth his taile, looking forward as if he did point at something, then you may be sure that the <hi>Partridge,</hi> or that he hunteth, is before him, then you shall make him lie close, and your selfe taking a lardge raunge or ring about him, shall looke if you can finde the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge:</hi> which as soone as you haue found, if he haue set them farre off, you shall then by saying (goe nearer) make the dogge creepe on his belly nearer to the Couey, but if he be neare enough you shall then make him lye close without stirring, and then drawing your nets
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:12389:148"/>
take the <hi>Partridge</hi> as hath beene before shewed, and then cheerish the dogge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much, first by giuing him the heads, necks and pinions of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> and then by clawing and clapping him, and by giuing him either bread or other foode which you must euermore at those times carry about you; but if it happen that as before, so againe hee chance to spring vp the game, by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>want of taking heede or other rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then againe you shall correct him more then before, and so take him vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your string and leade him home, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him vp for that night, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him any thing more then a bit of bread and water to keepe and maintaine life in his bosome, and then the next day haue him to the field, and doe as before shewed, yet with somewhat more terror and hard countenance, that hee may not onely call to minde his former falt, but also see that yet he hath not gotten your fauour, and there is no question but he will be much more carefull then hee was before, &amp; striue in al things more readily to obey your commandements; and then when he performeth your will

and doth according to your expectation you must by no meanes forget to bestow vpon him all the cheerishings that may be, as those of the voice, the hands, and of foode also, whereby the dogge may be delighted and encouraged to increase and goe forward in his well doing. And heerein you are to obserue also, that when your dogge setteth the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> if he doe stand vpright vpon his legges looking as it were at, or ouer the <hi>Partridge,</hi> that then such standing is a fault and may giue a blinke or offence to the <hi>Patridge,</hi> and therefore in this case you shall speake vnto the dogge and chide him, saying vnto him, Be wise, or lye close, not leauing till you see him lay himselfe downe vpon his belly on the ground.</p>
               <p>Againe, you shall obserue, that when you goe in vnto the Couey to spring the <hi>Partridge</hi> vp into your nets, that if the dogge rush hastily after you, and offer to spring them either before, or as soone as you, that likewise it is a great fault, and you must correct him very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Many other obseruations there be, but none more materiall then these already rehearsed; so that being carefull and diligent to vse and obserue these accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth of their natures, there is no doubt but you shall bring your whelpe in one foure or fiue moneths to that full perfection which can be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of any reasonable iudgement.

or Goose-grease, finely clarified (but Capons-grease or Goose-grease is the best) and set it one a very gentle fire and there let them melt together, and stirre them continually, till they be both incorporated together, and that you cannot discerne any seperation of bodies, but all one entire and perfit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, then take it from the fire and coole it, stirring it still till it be cold</p>

the stronger, and not so apt to bruise or breake in pieces, and therefore in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening and working of them you shall not doe it with a little quantitie or a few together, but still as many as you can well gripe, tossing and turning them, and working them before the fire, till they be all besmeared, and that euery straw haue his true proportion and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of lyme, which as soone as you see it is done in perfection, you shall then haue cases made of leather, in which to put in your seuerall bunches of roddes, and so set them vp and keepe them till you haue occasion to vse them.</p>
