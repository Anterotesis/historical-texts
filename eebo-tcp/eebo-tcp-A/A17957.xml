            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Herrings Tayle.</head>
            <l>I Sing the strange aduentures of the hardie Snayle,</l>
            <l>Who durst (vnlikely match) the weathercock assayle:</l>
            <l>A bold attempt, at first by fortune flattered</l>
            <l>With boote, but at the last to bale abandoned.</l>
            <l>Helpe sportfull Muse to tune my gander-keaking quill,</l>
            <l>And with inck blotles of sad merriments it fill,</l>
            <l>With drum of clapped wings, and with the shrilly blast</l>
            <l>Of his throte trumpet, Chaunticleere, now third and last,</l>
            <l>Had sounded a discharge vnto the welkin watch,</l>
            <l>To leaue their stand, and giue their shot, and quench their match.</l>
            <l>And dame <hi>Aurora</hi> now faithfull Ambassadresse</l>
            <l>Of the new borne day, and of the nights decease,</l>
            <l>The purple violets, and crimson roses, culd</l>
            <l>In <hi>Paradise,</hi> had from her fragrant chaplet puld,</l>
            <l>And strowde before <hi>Dan Phoebus</hi> feete, and now gan hee</l>
            <l>With peacock priding rayes, th'awaked worlds glee,</l>
            <l>To climbe the Easterne hils, and with light skips to play</l>
            <l>Betweene the wrinckles of the furrow faced sea,</l>
            <l>When rested <hi>Lymazon,</hi> thrusteth his fenceles head</l>
            <l>Out at his dooreles house, and with eye measured,</l>
            <l>How farre he climed had, how farre he had to clime,</l>
            <l>What guesse proportion plots, to cunning toyle and time:</l>
            <l>Where whiles he humbleth sight to the disdained ground,</l>
            <l>More then his hope could craue, he his atchiuement found.</l>
            <l>But raysing looke againe to reliques of his race,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:5145:3"/>
Lesse then his wish would haue, did his attempt embrace.</l>
            <l>Thus ioy of what was past, and feare of what was left,</l>
            <l>Though wonder much it gaue, despayre not wholie reft.</l>
            <l>Sore grieues he at the paine, but more he doubts the shame:</l>
            <l>For vnbegun then not to end, breedes meaner blame.</l>
            <l>What may he then resolue? retire is infamous,</l>
            <l>Still standing friuolous, ascending dangerous.</l>
            <l>So haue I seene a gallant Impe, of sturring blood,</l>
            <l>Presuming greatest blisse, in the vntried good,</l>
            <l>By his vaine copesmates drawne, and by his promise tide,</l>
            <l>In quest of fleeting gaine, some wooden horse to ride:</l>
            <l>Where while on traytor sea, and mid the mutiue windes,</l>
            <l>His freedome thralde, health paird, and life engagde he findes,</l>
            <l>Not able to forgoe, nor to performe his taske,</l>
            <l>What there he makes, doth with too late repentance aske:</l>
            <l>Yet cloake of vertue on necessitie he throwes,</l>
            <l>And rather blam'd then sham'd, at last he homeward goes.</l>
            <l>So <hi>Lymazon</hi> goes on, and climes the haughtie towre,</l>
            <l>Haught more then that which <hi>Caesars</hi> ashes did embowre:</l>
            <l>Or those of <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> who with ambitious strife</l>
            <l>By their death houses deem'd to ouerliue their life.</l>
            <l>This apizing in shape and hew, the spiry fire,</l>
            <l>Like stying doth to his like element aspire:</l>
            <l>And for this cause was built,</l>
            <l>Fame sayes, when <hi>Vther</hi> to the fayre <hi>Igernas</hi> bed,</l>
            <l>Made way on carkasse of her husband slaughtered:</l>
            <l>She causer of the fact, not partner of the guilt,</l>
            <l>Washt with her teares the blood by others hand yspilt,</l>
            <l>And sought with price of borrowd merits to enrich</l>
            <l>Her either make, who did, and suffered too much:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tyntagill</hi> was the place where she exchanged loues,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tyntagill</hi> was the place where to both their behoues</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:5145:3"/>
She reares a stately house, which lowly Munks may haunt</l>
            <l>For their soules <hi>requiem,</hi> sad spels to chat and chaunt:</l>
            <l>Whose Cels enuironed a temple rare of frame,</l>
            <l>For substance rare, more rare for forme that deckt the same:</l>
            <l>But rarest for the steeple, which with wonder rose</l>
            <l>In that huge temples waste, and wonder ouergrowes:</l>
            <l>The foote whose large assise this Giant bodie bare,</l>
            <l>Were squarie faced stones, with sides outlayed square,</l>
            <l>Marble the stones, the sides, rule (king of measure) skand,</l>
            <l>Three hundred broad to stretch, high fiftie foote to stand:</l>
            <l>Within a labyrinth of wenlace thwarting wayes,</l>
            <l>By searchers errors blaz'd the Craftmans readie praise:</l>
            <l>Such one he once deuisde to hide a hatefull Loue,</l>
            <l>Whose vnflidge bird did skils flight by falling proue:</l>
            <l>And such one made the first and great'st <hi>Plantagenet,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>His worlds rose, but rose vncleane, there safe to set,</l>
            <l>Vnhappie spur to draw, vnhappie clew to sow,</l>
            <l>Beloueds death, the wiues reuenge, and husbands woe.</l>
            <l>But what <hi>Daedale</hi> began, and <hi>Harrie</hi> followed,</l>
            <l>Art and experience here past mendment perfected.</l>
            <l>This platformes shoulders vnderwent th'abating weight</l>
            <l>Of Porphirie Pyramides, which tolde in height</l>
            <l>Three hundred halfes of feete, and halfed that at base,</l>
            <l>Their number fiue, and Quiueunx wise they stood in place.</l>
            <l>At point, each broached a beguiled ropper mound,</l>
            <l>All which a Petasus of fine Electre crownd,</l>
            <l>Whose edgeyfrendged rang with siluer bels about,</l>
            <l>Charme taught the winde, winde them, and the shauen rout,</l>
            <l>When Dorter loath to leaue, when people loathed quire,</l>
            <l>Thereon vp second climeth a foure taled spire,</l>
            <l>Fine skore the foote did skore along their Iasper side,</l>
            <l>Their tops of polisht Geat, a table paued wide:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:5145:4"/>
So our Deawes-sonne sometimes an hold most circle makes,</l>
            <l>Now lines in angles sharpe, now in obtuse he brakes:</l>
            <l>There true loue knots he twines, here paints some flowres or tree,</l>
            <l>Vncouth the shapes, but bootfull to his bent they bee.</l>
            <l>The Circles to compasse, the Angles vp to get,</l>
            <l>The knots to binde, the trees and flowers a grace to set,</l>
            <l>And where so Art, or fortune taught, or brought his waies,</l>
            <l>Auernishon his footsteps smooth and bright he laies:</l>
            <l>Smooth as the path, which vnder walking fingers yeelds,</l>
            <l>And twixt two hillocks leades vnto th' <hi>Elician</hi> fields,</l>
            <l>Bright as the worme, whose tayle the high wayes side bestarres,</l>
            <l>And on the helme for Canuisado serues in warres:</l>
            <l>And now by scale he shortned had the steepe ascent,</l>
            <l>And with glad eye layd holdfast on the battlement:</l>
            <l>When <hi>Alectrauemos</hi> from battlement espide</l>
            <l>Another steeple cleauing to that steeples side,</l>
            <l>Which strange Geometrie, follies Impe, wonder bred:</l>
            <l>Wonder, by reason the strangenes examined;</l>
            <l>If life it had, where is the shape that bodies beare?</l>
            <l>If life it lackt, so farre, so high, how stuck it there?</l>
            <l>If somewhat els it brought, where was the bringer gon?</l>
            <l>If selfe it came, where were the feete it went vpon?</l>
            <l>If walled house, how it to moue so could he see?</l>
            <l>If moue it did, a walled house how could it bee?</l>
            <l>Yet it a life enioyed, and life a bodie clad,</l>
            <l>And bodie feete possest, and feete were skild to gad:</l>
            <l>And all this had a house, and house all this did hold,</l>
            <l>And both did moue, and both were mou'd, as shall be told.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Saturne</hi> by reuenge (whereto euen natures kinde</l>
            <l>Bindeth what so she breedes) did ouertaken finde</l>
            <l>His neuer turning course of vnkinde crueltie,</l>
            <l>And headlong tumbled from that godlike sou'raigntie:</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:5145:4"/>
Whose fraile foundation on wickednes was pight,</l>
            <l>Dislikte, withstood, fought with, vanquisht, chased to flight,</l>
            <l>An old man by a yong, a father by his sonne,</l>
            <l>A King by his subiect, he all forlorne did wonne:</l>
            <l>Sometimes on mountaines rough, sometimes on surging waues,</l>
            <l>Sometimes in forrests wilde, sometimes in hollow causes,</l>
            <l>Of safetie as vnsure, as sure of miserie,</l>
            <l>Still doubting least his very hides would him descrie,</l>
            <l>The hils by their rising, by their roring the floods,</l>
            <l>The vaults by ecchoing, by whispering the woods:</l>
            <l>Amongst those refuges, sillie refuges sought,</l>

Had more then thrice three times borrowd her brothers light</l>

            <l>Which egge disclosde a chick in his due worne time,</l>
            <l>Which chick grew to a bird, which bird begat this time.</l>

            <l>The field the steeple top, the lists the steepe downfall,</l>

            <l>Ambition and Enuie, on the assailants side,</l>
            <l>On the defendants, parraines came, disdaine and pride:</l>
            <l>The equall Iudges chosne by both fortune and fate,</l>

Th'assailants house-shield for defence him best did arme,</l>

            <l>Yet the defence, meanes to offend, did also lend,</l>

            <l>With nature, whiles not forth direct his march he takes,</l>
            <l>But a wide winding circuit of his way he makes:</l>

            <l>When he approacheth his foes fort more sure then fast,</l>

            <l>To what so he attempts or th'other offred:</l>
            <l>But <hi>Alectrauemos</hi> of stature great and tall,</l>
            <l>Greater in might, and in stout heart greatest of all,</l>

            <l>The ruine threatning point bent to his enemie,</l>

            <l>A battered breach where troopes of wounds may enter in.</l>
            <l>Thus his aduantage each and disaduantage wist,</l>

            <l>In both, skill courage led, and courage armed skill,</l>

Durst hopeles him assault, thus minded, armed thus,</l>
            <l>They brought vertue comparde victorie to discusse.</l>

            <l>So these braue champions did at their first approach,</l>

            <l>Yet them dread fardest flies, as perill fastest growes,</l>
            <l>Like glowormes light which neerer brought the lesser showes.</l>
            <l>Thus lauish blowes they deale, of which each formost striu'd</l>
            <l>To run, postillion of death each seem'd arriu'd,</l>
            <l>More thick they fall then haile that eares and stalkes of corne</l>

            <l>More heauy seeme then thumping engine that downe beates</l>
            <l>The plumped piles, which serue for wayfare bridges seates,</l>
            <l>More lowd they sound, then at the forge in smoaky caue</l>
            <l>Did <hi>uulcans</hi> sledge, when battred gads to plates in draue,</l>

            <l>He then eke curteous shape for <hi>AEneas</hi> might:</l>
            <l>But as the twinny Themis and arme of Ocean flood</l>

            <l>Yet where they meete, and (cosens) kindly should embrace,</l>

            <l>And iudgement in him stablisht resolution:</l>
            <l>So as the sparkes of his quencht courage quicker grew,</l>
            <l>As sturred wine, new setled, wonts more strength accrew:</l>
            <l>Wherefore with spite and rage, his bloodles vaines filling,</l>
            <l>And to one moments seruice, his sprights coniuring</l>
            <l>A horned push, with force by furie creast he driues,</l>

The fathers bitter griefe, and our bothes infamie:</l>

            <l>Who can you strangers know, if first you be not showne?</l>
            <l>Who will? who dares? who can you show? if thus wise rest,</l>

            <l>Return'd, pay you no more with offred sacrifice:</l>
            <l>Then the prescribing steale-toll Miller neuer shall</l>

            <l>But either you I know not, or I know full well,</l>
            <l>Nor so small reake, nor so base thoughts in you to dwell:</l>
            <l>You that your mother Earths void wombe reuisiting,</l>
            <l>And there gainst kinde forclosde, bounsing, and rumbelling</l>

            <l>You that from vnder <hi>Thetis</hi> feete the mite vprake,</l>
            <l>And therewith smeere her face, and for your pastime sake,</l>
            <l>To low depressed vales, and high stirring mountaines,</l>

            <l>You that from coast to coast the clowdes doe hold in chace,</l>
            <l>Till melting downe in teares, conquerd they yeeld you place:</l>
            <l>Can you endure a creature of th'inferiour sort,</l>
            <l>Void of discourse, a worme of so vnworthie port,</l>
            <l>As neither stature, beautie, strength, nor ought beside,</l>

            <l>Of honor, state and life, and with you counterstriue?</l>
            <l>Nay first let heauen and earth perish confusde in one,</l>

Ere least iot minisht taint your reputation.</l>

            <l>Ere he of setling time doe you of speede preuaile.</l>
            <l>To quench this kindled fire, vse force, vse policie:</l>
            <l>Let valour be your god, fortune and destinie.</l>
            <l>From the vsurped height him thrust and tumble downe,</l>
            <l>Let shame his onset let, let fame your atchieement crowne.</l>
            <l>These makebate breaths brookt not the patience to attend,</l>
            <l>Vntill his tale were closed in a perfect end:</l>
            <l>But from the folkmote rusht to broyle the skie, and band</l>
            <l>Sharpe fight against the great Realmes both of sea and land,</l>
            <l>And with waightier effect t'accomplish their pretence,</l>
            <l>By set accord they faine a iarring difference,</l>
            <l>And ranckt in facing troopes they entershock amaine,</l>
            <l>Like stalworth Knights whose Iusts faire Ladies entertaine:</l>
            <l>But more impetuous were their brunts, which coupling wilde</l>
            <l>So rough a storme begat, as winter neuer childe.</l>
            <l>Like foule brought fourth, the altred heau'ns were ouerlayed</l>
            <l>With mourning black, as in their limits should be played</l>
            <l>A tragedie, for which a stage they gan prepare,</l>
            <l>And wherein they a part (too nighly-bowred) bare,</l>
            <l>For with the thunders rore they cracking seem'd to rip,</l>
            <l>And burne with lightning flashes, which confusely skip.</l>
            <l>But price and wager sole of their contention,</l>
            <l>And naue where their spoakes furie met was <hi>Lymazon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Of him they sore disdaine, themselues despisde to see,</l>
            <l>Gainst him their threats, their blowes, their hurts all bended bee:</l>
            <l>So whil'st in sea of blisse he sayled all aflaunt,</l>
            <l>Of his good fortune proud, of his fate ignorant,</l>

            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:5145:17"/>
Then the tempest foresee, or change he could bethinke:</l>
            <l>Whence though of courage no such share he did possesse,</l>
            <l>But he some inward touch felt of dismaiednes:</l>
            <l>Yet neither were his coward sprights depressed so,</l>
            <l>But that he sham'd his port should it too fully show,</l>
            <l>And faine he would in equall peize of iudgement rest,</l>
            <l>As one that could despise the worst, yet hopte the best:</l>
            <l>But hope was wan, and countnance vaine, where earth and skie</l>
            <l>Against his state, seem'd linked in conspiracie:</l>
            <l>For in th'ascendent ballance <hi>Mars</hi> was faring back,</l>
            <l>And Ladie <hi>Venus</hi> detriment did threaten wrack:</l>
            <l>Eke <hi>Saturne</hi> his ruler falling in house of foes,</l>
            <l>Against his vassals good did his dire beames oppose,</l>
            <l>And th'earth quaking nodded with second ruine spire,</l>
            <l>To throw him headlong downe, if he would not retire,</l>
            <l>Whom windes no way to scape, nor power to stay affoord,</l>
            <l>But him on foreship, quarter, sterne (the whiles) aboord</l>
            <l>Both voore and Auft doe lay, so in <hi>pell mell</hi> to ruze,</l>
            <l>And though his steps (like <hi>Lympet</hi> toucht) he faster giues,</l>
            <l>Yet him so long assaile, so oft they doe surround,</l>
            <l>That out at last a chinke to enter in they found.</l>
            <l>Like as the raine enriched flood, which tumbling low</l>
            <l>From the high mountaines, menaceth to ouerflow</l>
            <l>The fruitfull plaines, and make the fardest sea his gole,</l>
            <l>If the blinde pioner, or fostred rat, some hole</l>
            <l>Him wimble through, then forced banck, the same doth reame</l>
            <l>To such a gaping gap, that at his mouth the streame</l>
            <l>Out belks with rushing noise, till euery furrow flote,</l>
            <l>And husbandman to lost paines tunes a plainfull note:</l>
            <l>Or as long delued oke, whose vndermined roote</l>
            <l>Doth purchase heauens sight, with many knocks to boote,</l>
            <l>If once to shoulders shog he yeeld, is loosed more</l>
            <l>

And more, till on the brused earth his length he skore:</l>
            <l>So this small entrance won, the windes wedge wise in driue</l>
            <l>Their blasts, and stitch by stitch his clibbie belly riue:</l>
            <l>From the vnloosed hold thus looseth he his place,</l>
            <l>And leaues the emptie roome a witnes of his case:</l>
            <l>Then downe he falles, like shell-fish vp by Eagle borne,</l>
            <l>That from the greater height he may the more be torne:</l>
            <l>Then downe he falles like dart from th'Eagles masters hand,</l>
            <l>Whose firie wings beares vengeance to th'offending land,</l>
            <l>And with him fall his enuie hate and surquedrie,</l>
            <l>His hopes, his plots, his prankes, his ioy and iollitie.</l>
            <l>But who did fixe a naile in Fortunes rolling wheele,</l>
            <l>Whereon he headlong downe past helpe began to reele,</l>
            <l>And how he sau'd the game, thus driuen to his trumps,</l>
