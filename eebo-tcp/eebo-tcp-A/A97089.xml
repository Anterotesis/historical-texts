         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>DOctor <hi>Henry More</hi> is a Perſon,
whoſe Learning and Parts have
brought Him into a Name, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Profeſſors of the refined Arts
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151863:5"/>
and Sciences. Fame ſpeaks Him a great
Philoſopher. And his publick works are
ſaid to avouch no leſs. Nay, ſome have
paſſed ſo far in favour of his Character,
as to term him, <hi>The great Reſtorer of the
Platonick Cabbala.</hi> And truly, if this be ſo,
I conceive the Gentleman had done him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a great deal of right, if he had ſtill
kept to his own Element; for as much as
his late unlucky engaging in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſial
Diſputes, cannot but prove a blot to
his former undertakings: for the learned
World muſt needs acknowledg that Dr.
<hi>More</hi> the Controvertiſt, is much degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from Dr. <hi>More</hi> the Philoſopher.
He hath lately ſet forth an Expoſition of
the Seven Epiſtles, to the Seven Churches
of <hi>Aſia.</hi> The whole Piece is of a pure
Romantick ſtrain, wherein the Authors
fancy being broken looſe from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Reaſon, and leaping over all
boundaries of Church-Authority, and
the Faith of his Anceſtors, runs on at
Elevenſcore, as if he were upon a warm
ſent, giving chaſe to ſome of his Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
ideas: To this he has adjoyned, a
pretended Antidote againſt Idolatry, with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151863:5"/>
Application to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and
<hi>for the putting a ſtop</hi> (as he phraſes it) <hi>to
the Romiſh infection.</hi> His moſt formidable
Weapon is that harſh and unmanly Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
called railing. His phraſe is rough,
and clogged with much dirt, which he
throwes too bountifully upon Perſons,
which never deſerved it at his hands. His
Objections are bold, uncivil, irreligious;
not without a deep tincture of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
And therefore were it not, that the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his ſuppoſed abilities, may caſt a
favourable reflection, upon all that iſſues
from his brain, and gain credit to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote,
amongſt his vulgar Zealots, to the
irreparable dammage of their Souls, his
work might have lain neglected, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Reader, ſo without an Adverſary.
But in regard the Doctor has prefixed his
Name to the Book as Author; and that a
great Name is a great Argument with
ſome, to evince the truth of the contents;
and that no Doctrine is ſo abſurd, but
may ſpread under the profeſſed Patronage
of a fam'd Divine; therefore ſome things
muſt be ſaid by way of Rejoynder to the
Antidote, leſt ſome unwary Readers ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151863:6"/>
the Doctor ſo full gorg'd againſt <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi>
Idolatry, and repeating his invectives
almoſt in every Page with endleſs tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies,
ſhould tamely ſuffer themſelves
to be born down the ſtream with big
words, and think all is Goſpel and well-grounded,
that falls with ſo much noiſe
and confidence from the mouth of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
And indeed I am already informed,
that ſome well-meaning Proteſtants, who
have a great kindneſs for the Author, and
no leſs a value for the Work, have call'd
for an Anſwer to it, with a kind of inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accent, as conceiving that no ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
could be given. They (poor Souls)
thinking, that ſurely the Doctor would
never have been ſo poſitive in his aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if the ſtrength of his evidences were
not ſuch, as might bear all the ſtreſs he
lays upon them. Wherefore ſeeing the
concern of Souls is at ſtake, whom he
ſeeks by a pernicious wile to ſeduce, vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Poyſon guilded over with the ſpecious
title of an Antidote; the deſign of theſe
few Pages is, to ſumme up briefly the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
Arguments, allowing to each a due
reflexion, and to repreſent the nullity and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151863:6"/>
inconcluſiveneſs of all that is material in
Him, as to his foul and odious charge of
Idolatry, drawn up againſt his, and our
common Mother-Church.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>The Firſt Section.</head>
               <head type="sub">Containing an Anſwer to his Firſt
Chapter.</head>
               <p>THere are two ways in general (ſays
the Doctor) of diſcovering what
is, or ought to be held Idolatry amongſt
Chriſtians; the one, divine declaration;
the other, clear and perſpicuous reaſon.
And accordingly he ſpends his firſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
in explicating <hi>what Idolatry is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to divine declaration:</hi> And his ſecond
pretends to declare, <hi>What Idolatry is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the determination of clear and free
reaſon.</hi> Theſe are the Titles of the two
firſt Chapters. The firſt of which, (to the
end he might give us a Treatiſe, <hi>Girt up
in the most cloſe and convictive method that
may be;</hi> for ſo ſpeaks his Preface:) he
thought good to divide into ten ſeveral
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151863:7"/>
Concluſions, as Principles of his enſuing
Diſcourſe: To each of which I ſhall
ſpeak ſingly by it ſelf, taking them in the
ſame order they lie.</p>
               <p>The firſt Concluſion tells us, <hi>That as
in civil Governments it is the right of the
Supreme Power to define and declare, what
ſhall be, or be held to be treaſon, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as ſuch: ſo it is moſt manifestly the
right of God Almighty, who is alſo Infinitely
good and wiſe, to define and declare unto his
People, what ſhall be, or be held to be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
To this Concluſion, I only return
this brief Remark; That the learned Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile,
wherin the Doctor ſpends very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
words, might well have been diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with, without any offence to Logick,
or impeachment to the Authors judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For the Simile ſeems to aim at the
clearing and ſetling the unqueſtionable
Prerogative of an increated Power, upon
the right of a meer humane Juriſdiction.
Which is in effect an unskilful Piece of
<hi>Hyſteron Proteron;</hi> making a truth of the
higheſt rank to truckle-under an inferiour
principle; which (conſidering <hi>there is no
power but of God,</hi> Rom. 13.) can have no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151863:7"/>
truth in it, but by preſuppoſing that very
truth, which it pretends to illuſtrate and
eſtabliſh.</p>
               <p>His Second Concluſion would univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
beg our belief, <hi>That what is declared
Idolatry by God to the Jews, ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
Idolatry by us Chriſtians.</hi> Firſt,
Becauſe Chriſtianity being a far more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Religion, than that of Judaiſme,
There cannot be the leſt relaxation to the
moſt rancid of all Superſtitions, Idolatry.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe all kind of Idolatry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forbidden in the Second Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the whole Decalogue being
Moral, Chriſtians can plead no exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from it, any more than <hi>Jews.</hi> Now
that the whole Decalogue is Moral, he
makes ſome needleſs attempts to prove,
chiefly for the Second Commandements
ſake. All which proofs, 'tis eaſie to take
off by this ſingle anſwer. I ſay then, that
as to the Second Commandement (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
at preſent the firſt Table divided into
four Precepts) If he expound that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
ſo, as only to prohibit the
making and worſhipping of Idols, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
of falſe Gods, I ſhall readily grant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151863:8"/>
it to be Moral, and ſtrictly binding, both
as to <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians. But if he puts
any other meaning upon the Text, he begs
the queſtion: And he muſt excuſe me,
if I call for his further proof, not to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
the Morality of the Decalogue in
general, or of this Commandement in
particular, but alſo as taken in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſenſe, which he gives it. This I ſay,
becauſe I conceive, the Doctor will not
ſtick to grant that one and the ſame Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the Decalog, may be (as conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under a double reſpect) both Moral
and Ceremonial. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That ſome,
both Catholick and Proteſtant Divines
own no more than a Ceremonial Precept
in the Second Commandement, if extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to an Univerſal Prohibition of all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
and under that notion given only
to the <hi>Jews.</hi> And to call this a Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Idolatry amongſt Chriſtians, (as
the Doctor does) may prove an Argument
of his miſtake, but none to evidence the
truth of his Concluſion; no more than
the generally allowed uſe of ſervile works
upon Saturday, can be called a Relaxation
to the breach of the Sabbath. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151863:8"/>
the Doctor is ſo poſitive in his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto-unproved
concluſion, I have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
for him to pauſe upon, if he pleaſe
to accept of it. Some of the learned,
grounding themſelves upon the firſt of
<hi>Kings,</hi> ch. 12. and <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 26. are of
Opinion, that burning Incenſe was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
in the old Law, as not being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Laity, but tyed only to the
Prieſtly Function; and that the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
did Sacrifice in this ſort to the Brazen
Serpent. Now, I would gladly know, by
what certain topicks the Doctor will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
either that burning incenſe was not
a Sacrifice in the old Law, or that it is a
Sacrifice and Act of Latria in the New?
Unleſs he means to draw an Univerſal
Conſequence from <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> to the
Goſpel, and ſo to thruſt our Heads under
<hi>Moſes</hi> his Girdle, and make us ſtoop to
all the Legalities of the Old Teſtament:</p>
               <p>The Doctor proceeds to his third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
<hi>That whatever was Idolatry in the
Heathen, the ſame is Idolatry in Us, if we
commit it.</hi> I doubt much whether the
Doctor underſtands his own Concluſion:
For the aſſertion, taken as it lies in its
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151863:9"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are expreſſions, ſounds like one of thoſe
Identick Poſitions, which ſurfeit of too
much truth: as much as to ſay, We are
guilty of Heatheniſh Idolatry, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Heatheniſh Idolatry: But, if the
Doctors meaning be, that whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
act of worſhip was Idolatry in the
Heathen, is alſo Idolatry in Us, if apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Us to any other being on this ſide
God; then I have a caſe to offer to his
ſecond and better thoughts: Suppoſe then
that ſome of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s new Converts,
<hi>whom in Chriſt Jeſus he had begotten by the
Goſpel,</hi> looking upon him as their ſpiritual
Father, had paid him the duty of the knee,
humbly asking his bleſſing: And that a
Heathen of <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> had at the ſame
time, upon his knees adored the Apoſtle
for the god <hi>Mercury,</hi> (as ſome of them
were ready to do, <hi>Acts 14.)</hi> is it the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
ſenſe, that this external act of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
which in the Heathen would queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs
have been Idolatry, muſt alſo be ſo
in the Chriſtian? If ſo, then his Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is abundantly confuſed by the daily
and uncontroulable practiſe of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
themſelves, kneeling to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151863:9"/>
God-Fathers and God-Mothers.
Whence it evidently appears, that the
ſame kind of external act, which in a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
is Idolatry, may prove duty in a
Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The fourth Concluſion, <hi>The Idolatry
of the Pagans,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>conſiſted in
this,</hi> viz. <hi>in that they either took ſomething
to be the ſupreme God, that was not, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
it for ſuch; or elſe worſhipped the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God in an Image; or gave religious
worſhip, that is to ſay, erected Altars, Temples
and Images, offered Sacrifice, made Vows to,
and invoked ſuch, as they themſelves knew
not to be the ſupreme God, but either the ſouls
of Men departed, or other demons, or elſe
particular appearances or powers of nature.</hi>
And concerning theſe demons, he adds in
his eighth concluſion, <hi>That the Pagans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
exquiſitely Anſwer to the Chriſtian
Saints and Angels, in this point; ſaving
that this ſpiritual fornication is a rape upon
our Saints and Angels, but ſingle fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Heathen with thier impure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
Thus far the modeſt Doctor. But
what proof does he give us for all this?
Truly he does not ſo much as offer at any.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151863:10"/>
And in that, we muſt not envy him the
due commendations of his diſcretion:
For the beſt proof of a proofleſs aſſertion
is ſilence. Of all the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s concluſions,
there is none more intrinſeck and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to the ſubject now under debate;
nor any that ought to ſpeak more, or doth
ſpeak leſs to the point, than this. For it is
moſt fondly erroneous, and moſt diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
obtruded upon the eaſy credulity
of the vulgar; <hi>That the Pagans demons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely
anſwer to the Christians Saints and
Angels.</hi> And no leſs proofleſs and falſe
is it, <hi>That they</hi> (the Pagans) <hi>worſhipped the
ſupreme God in an Image.</hi> But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
(inſtead of worſhipping the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God in an Image,) his concluſion
ſhould have added for another branch of
<hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry; That they worſhipped
their very Images for gods: They call'd
them gods; they took them for gods;
they ſacrificed to them as gods. And the
ſame is to be ſaid of thoſe ſouls of Men
departed, demons or other particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
or powers of nature; all which
they took and worſhipped for gods: For
gods I ſay; which, this mincing conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151863:10"/>
ſeeks moſt warily to conceal. <hi>Firſt</hi>
then, that they called their Images, Gods,
(to omit other inſtances) is clear from
<hi>Dan. 5. 4. They drank Wine, and praiſed
the gods of gold, and of ſilver, of braſs, of
iron, of wood, and of ſtone. Secondly,</hi> That
they took their Images for Gods is as
clear. Why elſe does the
Spirit of God labour ſo
much in Holy Writ,<note place="margin">Iſa. 46.</note> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
and reaſon the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
out of their folly,<note place="margin">Pſal. 115.</note> by
proving that their Images,<note place="margin">Habac. 2.</note> or Idols were
not gods, if they did not take them for
ſuch? Did not the Heathen charge S. <hi>Paul,
that he had perſwaded and turned away
much People, ſaying that they
be no gods,</hi>

were thoſe, who conceiving the World
to be animated, worſhipped the ſouls of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151863:11"/>
thoſe material parts; as of Sun, Moon,
Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is there any the leſt hint here,
either from divine or humane Record, of
the <hi>Pagans</hi> worſhipping the ſupreme God
in an image, but rather the contrary;
viz. <hi>That the things, which the Gentiles ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
they ſacrifice to devils, and not to God.
1 Cor.</hi> 10. Can any ſober divinity brook
ſuch an inference from theſe premiſes,
<hi>That the Pagans demons exquiſitely anſwer
to our Saints and Angels?</hi> Do we worſhip
Saints and Angels for gods? do we call
them gods? do we take them for gods?
do we ſacrifice to them as gods? far be
it, as from our hearts to intend it, ſo from
an ingenuous adverſary to object it.</p>
               <p>The next Concluſion that comes in
play is the Fifth, <hi>That both divine decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and the common conſent of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
do avouch to Us, that all the aforeſaid
Pagan modes of idolatry practiſed by them,
were in thoſe Pagans practiſes of idolatry.</hi>
All the anſwer that truth can allow to this
Fifth Concluſion, is <hi>Nego ſuppoſitum:</hi> for
the Doctor here ſuppoſeth that he hath
given us a true and adequate diviſion of
the <hi>Pagan</hi> idolatry, in the precedent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151863:12"/>
according both to divine decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and the common conſent of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom;
whereas I have already ſhew'd
his hypotheſis to be falſe, and laid open
his foul and groſs miſtakes; ('tis a favour
to call them ſo:) which indeed are ſuch,
as might invite a modeſt Man to wipe his
Pen, and lay it aſide, till he had taught it
a more awful regard to ingenuity and
truth.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Concluſion: <hi>That giving
religious worſhip, that is to ſay; erecting
Temples, building Altars, invoking, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vows, and the like, to what is not the
ſupreme God, though not as to him, but as to
ſome inferiour helpful beeing, is manifeſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</hi>
This Sixth Concluſion looks
back upon the Fifth, and calls to it for
help. But till the Fifth has learned to
ſtand upon its own leggs, it is not in a
condition to lend any proof or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>upport to
its Neighbours. And ſo I might paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this Sixth Concluſion, as proofleſs;
but only that the Doctor calls me back to
hear a Confirmation of it; ſaying, <hi>That
idolatry was very rare amongst the Nations,
eſpecially the Romans, if this mode of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151863:12"/>
be not truly idolatry: And ſearce any
thing will be found idolatry amongſt them,
but taking that to be the ſupreme God, which
is not, and adoring it for ſuch.</hi> This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
whereby the Doctor
confirms his Concluſion,<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. 5. Praepar. c. 15</note>
minds me of a paſſage in
<hi>Euſebius,</hi> concerning the
number of the <hi>Pagan</hi> gods. <hi>Triginta, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit,
deorum millia in terra eſſe cenſet Heſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus;
ego autem multo plures lapideos, atque
ligneos homines creatores eſse video. Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
here adds to <hi>Heſiod</hi>'s Thirty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
gods, many more of his own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
amongſt which, one only could
be ſupreme, and the reſt muſt needs ſit
down with the title of inferiour Deities.
Now comes the Doctors Sixth Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and tells us that giving religious
worſhip, to what is not the ſupreme God,
though not as to him, but as to ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
helpful beeing, is idolatry. Why
ſo? becauſe, ſays the Doctor, unleſs we
grant this, (that is, unleſs we grant that,
the worſhipping of ſome Thirty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
inferiour Deities, (for thoſe are his
inferiour helpful Beeings:) is Idolatry,)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151863:13"/>
a great and manifeſt inconvenience will
follow, to wit, That Idolatry was very
rare amongſt the Nations; and ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing will be found Idolatry amongſt
them, but taking that to be the ſupreme
God, which is not, and worſhipping it
for ſuch. Which being ſo profound a
truth, I conceive ſew of the moſt ſevere
and Cynical complexions can paſs it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
without a ſmile. But if the <hi>Doctor</hi>
ſhould chance to reply, that by (an <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
helpful Beeing)</hi> he means not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
helpful Deity, but ſomething elſe
beſt known to himſelf; Then his confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
is moſt falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing will be found Idolatry amongſt
the Heathens, but taking that for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God, which is not, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it for ſuch; when as we find, they
worſhipped ſo many Thouſand Deities:
So that, whether he underſtand by (infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
helpful Being) an inferiour Deity,
or no, his confirmation is either falſe, or
ridiculous. Before I proceed to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Concluſion, let me entreat the
<hi>Reader</hi>'s patience for a brief Parentheſis:
Catholicks uſually diſtinguiſh two ſorts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151863:13"/>
of worſhip: For example, To ſacrifice,
ſay they, to erect Temples and Altars, are
acts of Latria, that is, of the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
worſhip poſſible, only due to the
One Almighty and Everlaſting God, the
firſt Principle and end of all created Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Though none of theſe acts, neither
ſacrifice it ſelf, nor dedication of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or Altar, excludes a Secondary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
or titular honour of the
Saints. There are other acts of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
reſpect, which the Doctor may at
his pleaſure, without offending Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Divinity, chuſe whether he will call
a religious worſhip, or no: As the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
we give to Saints and their Images,
burning Incenſe or Candles, bowing the
Body, and the like. Theſe acts are of
themſelves indifferent, and variouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable,
by the particular tendency of
the inward affection, either to a divine, or
only a civil worſhip. As for inſtance ſake,
<hi>Abraham</hi> with the ſame kind of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Body, did adore God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.
worſhip Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. and Men, <hi>Gen.
23.</hi> Where we evidently find that the
ſame poſture of bowing the Body, only as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151863:14"/>
intentionally directed by a different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the heart, is a divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
in reſpect of God; an inferior kind
of worſhip, in reſpect of Angels, and a
civil worſhip as referr'd to Men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he who will ſpeak diſtinctly to the
Catholick Tenet, muſt diſtinguiſh theſe
ſeveral modes of worſhip one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
or elſe ſhew cauſe why, he ranks
them all, under one and the ſame ſpecies
of Religious worſhip. Otherwiſe he will
make it appear, that he loves darkneſs
more than light, and ſeeks not to cope
with his Adverſary like a Scholar. Have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
premiſed this Obſervation.—The
<hi>Doctor</hi>'s Seventh Concluſion, which ſpeaks
thus; <hi>(That to ſacrifice, or burn Incenſe, or
make any Religious obeyſance, or incurvation
to an Image in any wiſe, as to an object of
this worſhip, is idolatry by divine declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.)</hi>
This concluſion, I ſay, will appear
to have as much pertinent ſenſe in it, as
if a Junto of Civilians being requeſted to
declare by a common vote, what Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is; ſhould give-in their learned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
with a Reſolved upon the queſtion,
That to take away a Man's life wilfully,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151863:14"/>
and without cauſe; or to cut off a limb,
or draw blood, is Murther. Juſt ſuch a
wild medley of truth and falſhood, is the
<hi>Doctor</hi>'s Concluſion. Sacrificing to an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and bowing to an Image, ſuit not
well together. The firſt is Idolatry, and
the very crime which the Catholick
Church condemns in <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> and
his Adherents. But, that bowing to an
Image of Chriſt, or his Saints, ſhould be
idolatry; rather then bowing to the Ark
of the Covenant; or that honouring the
Picture of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> rather than the Name
of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſhould be liable to the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
this, I ſay, ſhould have been
more ſtrongly proved than by meerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
a broken Text of Scripture, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not bow to them, nor worſhip them;</hi>
which yet is all the Doctor does, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an old thred-bare gloſs upon it, which
ſhall preſently be anſwered. Only firſt I
obſerve, that when Proteſtants read this
their Second Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt
not make unto thee any graven Image, or any
likeneſs, that is in Heaven above, or that is
in the water, under the earth; Thou ſhalt
not bow down thy ſelf to them, nor ſerve
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151863:15"/>
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>) and withall are informed that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
make Pictures and Images of Chriſt,
place them in their Churches, put off
their Hats, and bow the Knee before them,
preſently they endite the practiſe within
their breſts as guilty of idolatry; moſt
inconſiderately, no leſs than uncharitably,
charging Idolatry upon the practice of
the Church, for doing thoſe ſelf-ſame
things, which God himſelf commanded
the <hi>Jews</hi> to do, to whom he gave this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Precept.<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 18.</note> Did not God
command <hi>Moſes</hi> to make
two Cherubims of gold in
the two ends of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Seat?
<note place="margin">2 Chron. c. 3. v. 7. <hi>ibid.</hi> v. 10.</note> Were there not
graven Cherubims on the
Walls of the Temple?<note place="margin">Pſal. 99. 5.</note>
Were not the two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims
in the moſt Holy
Place,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 28. 2.</note> of Image-Work?
Were not the People to pray in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and commanded to worſhip at the
Foot-ſtool of our Lord, that is, the Ark
of the Covenant; over which were the
Cherubims of Image-Work! and could
this poſſibly be done, without bowing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151863:15"/>
Images? Behold now what an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable
conſequence is drawn from hence.
God himſelf commanded the making of
Images, even after he had given the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Commandment of the Decalogue:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> Papiſts can make no Images, but
they are Idolaters. Images were placed
in God's own Temple; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Papiſts are
Idolaters in placing Images in their
Churches. God's People were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to bow down and proſtrate
themſelves where it could not be done,
without bowing before Images: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
Papiſts, who kneel before an Image are I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters.
If Proteſtants did but reflect
how much this miſtake of theirs is againſt
Scripture, as well as againſt Charity, they
would be more ſparing of their cenſures.
Now to the Objection, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow
down to them, nor worſhip them: Of which
undoubtedly the ſenſe is, (ſays the Doctor)
They ſhall not be in any wiſe the Object of
that worſhip, which thou performeſt in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
way—For the Second Commandement
certainly is a declaration of the mind of God
touching religious worſhip.</hi> Let us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may not have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151863:16"/>
any cavil about words. The Catholick
Church no where commands us to call
the honour exhibited to Saints and their
Images, a religious honour or worſhip.
But, with the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s good leave, Why
may there not be ſome intermediate kinds
of worſhip, between a divine, and a meer
civil worſhip? Why may we not ſay,
that ſuch was the worſhip, which was
given to the Ark? which <hi>Abraham</hi> gave
to the Angels? and which we are all
commanded to give to the Name of <hi>Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Nay, why may we not add, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and reſpect of the Knee, which is
given to God-fathers, and God-mothers
is ſuch, as being not founded upon any
bare relation of blood, or any meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
or civil excellency, but given wholly
upon a ſpiritual account? And how is it
proved, that ſuch an intermediate honour
as this, may not ſecurely be given to
Saints, and their Images? Let the <hi>Doctor</hi>
find out a ſuitable name for it, beſides that
of <hi>Religious,</hi> and we ſhall not ſtand upon
terms with him, but freely ſpeak his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
But if nothing will ſerve his turn,
but that religious and divine worſhip
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151863:16"/>
muſt be all one. Then we utterly deny
that we are in any wiſe concerned in his
Objection: for we give no ſuch <hi>religious</hi>
worſhip to the Saints themſelves, much
leſs to their Images. And I ſhall ſhow
in my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anſwer to his Eighth Chapter, how
weakly and diſingenuouſly he makes uſe
of the Second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> to make
out his charge againſt us.</p>
               <p>The Eighth Concluſion, ſcorning to be
behind the Seventh in point of Scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
loudly proclaims, <hi>That to erect Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Altars, Images, or to burn incenſe to
Saints and Angels, to invoke them, or make
vows to them, and the like is plain Idolatry.</hi>
This Concluſion for its proof appeals to
the teſtimony of four falſe witneſſes, to
wit, the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth
Concluſions; and as ſuch, I juſtly except
againſt them.</p>
               <p>The Ninth; <hi>Religious incurvation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Crucifix or the Hoſt, or any Image,
as to an object, and not a meer unconſidered
accidental circumſtance, is Idolatry.</hi> This
Concluſion having thus coldly drawn up
an enditement againſt us, pleads its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
out of the Seventh and Eighth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151863:17"/>
And ſo leaning upon two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Reeds, falls to the ground, where I
am ſure, neither Reaſon or Authority wil
ever ſtoop to take it up.</p>
               <p>We are now arrived at the Tenth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
where we are told, <hi>That to uſe on
ſet purpoſe, in religious worſhip, any figure
or image only circumstantially, not objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but ſo as to bow towards it, or to be upon
a Man's knees before it, with eyes and hands
devoutly lifted up towards it.—Yet this</hi>
even taken in its moſt favourable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<hi>is a moſt wicked and impious mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God;</hi> ſays the Doctor. And he
adds, <hi>That if the image be the object of theſe
poſtures and incurvations, (as it ſeems to him
plain, and beyond all queſtioning that it will
be ſo) then he ſays it will be idolatry.</hi> To
this I return, that I hope the Ethicks can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be offended with me, no more than
divinity can be able to reprove me, if I
ſay, this Concluſion gives God the lie,
and makes Him the approver, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and rewarder of Sin, even idolatry it
ſelf. For God promiſed a reward to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
made in the Temple, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 15.
Where notwithſtanding there were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151863:17"/>
Angels or Cherubims upon the wals.
And he commanded his People to adore
the Ark, over which were Cherubims or
Angels of Image-work; where the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper
could not poſſibly make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes,
but he muſt needs bow at leſt
circumſtantially, though not objectively
towards an Image. And yet Pray'r, even
thus circumſtanced, was approved, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and declared by God himſelf
rewardable. Now this is the very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
both for act and object, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
down with the Doctor, but he muſt
needs have it to be idolatry; and his
moſt charitable gloſs upon the action, can
afford it no name, under an impious and
wicked mocking of God. Whence if
reaſon may be allowed to make the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Tenth Concluſion muſt
needs be found guilty of giving God the
lie, and making him the approver, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
and rewarder of ſin, even the ſin
of idolatry.</p>
               <p>Having thus made our way through all
the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Ten Concluſions, the Reader
may pleaſe to obſerve, how far he forgets
himſelf, and over-runs the Title of his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:151863:18"/>
Chapter, inſomuch that he ſcarce ever
faces about to it from the beginning to
the end: for whereas the Title promiſed
to deliver, <hi>What idolatry is according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
declaration;</hi> and that he himſelf
makes his boaſt in the end of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<hi>To have abundantly convinced the
Church of Rome of multifarious idolatries;
if they will stand,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to divine defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,
or the declarations of holy Scripture
in this point;</hi> Yet on the contrary 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
there are not even ſo many Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-quotations,
<hi>in this point,</hi> as may
make up ſo much as a duall number.
The only way then for the Doctor to
make out the title of his Chapter, and
his vapouring Rodomontado againſt
God's Church, is to deify his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions;
that is, to make his own word
paſs for the Word of God, and his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
for divine. And then truly we
have no reaſon to be offended at him, for
taking upon himſelf ſo kindly that very
imputation, which he ſeeks no leſs weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than injuriouſly to pin upon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and practice of the Church.</p>

               <p>THis Chapter, compared with the
former, is but a ſecond part to
the ſame tune: longer in words, but as
weak in performances to the full, as its
Predeceſſor. The Title promiſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
<hi>What Idolatry is according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of clear and free reaſon; and
this in 25. ſeveral Concluſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His firſt, ſecond, and third Concluſions
quite digreſs from the charge in hand,
ſhowing what a grievous ſin idolatry is:
which is much more largely and learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared by our own Authors, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
granted by us, with this further al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
that if he can fix the crime up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, with any ſhew of reaſon, we ſhall
freely acknowledg our guilt to be of a
double dye, to what it was in the <hi>Jew</hi> or
<hi>Gentile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth and fifth, tell us that ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151863:19"/>
neceſſarily involves in it, ignorance,
or miſtake, in the act of worſhip, or the
object. The fifth advances a ſtep further,
and concludes very abruptly, that <hi>becauſe
all idolatry involves in it ſome ignorance or
miſtake; therefore no ignorance or miſtake
can excuſe from idolatry:</hi> very learnedly:
From the Fourth and Fifth, the Doctor
makes a long ſtride to his One and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Concluſion, where he peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concludes, that <hi>becauſe miſtake does not
excuſe him from idolatry, by Concluſion the
Fourth and Fifth, therefore the adoration of
any object, which we out of miſtake, conceive
to be the true God, made viſible by hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
union therewith, is manifeſt idolatry.</hi>
Thus he. But let us put the caſe, that
ſome Chriſtian, contemporary to Chriſt
our Lord, whilſt he ſo journed upon earth,
had through meer miſtake, adored ſome
other Perſon, for Chriſt: Here the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ariſes, whether this Man's error would
have pleaded his excuſe, I, or no? The
reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> in their
Apology by <hi>Daille'</hi> declare for the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative.
And truly Reaſon ſeems clearly
to be on their ſide. For what reaſon or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151863:19"/>
equity will condemn a loyal ſubject, who
intending an addreſs to his Prince, ſhould
take <hi>Hepheſtion,</hi> for <hi>Alexander,</hi> a Peer
for his Soveraign, and ſo make tender of
his allegiance to another Perſon, whom
he innocently miſtakes for his Prince? Let
us parallel the two caſes. As this loyal
Subject's addreſs is intended only to his
Prince; ſo the Chriſtians addreſs in the
inſtance above-ſaid, is directed only to
Jeſus Chriſt. In both theſe caſes there
intervenes an error of fact: both the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
and civil worſhip being miſplaced
as to the circumſtance, though not as to
the object. And why this error ſhould
be imputable, either to treaſon in the one
caſe, or to Idolatry in the other? or,
why more to idolatry in the one caſe,
then to treaſon in the other? is that,
which it will concern the Doctor to ſpeak
to, if he means to maintain his concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And till he hath done this, he ſhall
never be able to prove, what he aims at
in his 22. Concluſion, that any idolatry is
committed though it ſhould ſo fall out,
through inadvertence, or any other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that an unconſecrated, or untran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151863:20"/>
Hoſt, were expoſed to the
veneration of the People: for as no ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is here due, ſo none is intended,
but only to Jeſus Chriſt, adorable where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he is.</p>
               <p>The <hi>6th. 7th. 8th. 10th. 11th. 12th. 13th.
14th. 15th. 18th.</hi> and <hi>24th.</hi> Concluſions
talk big againſt Invocation of Saints. But
the beſt ſpeaks amongſt them are the
<hi>8th. 10th.</hi> and <hi>12th.</hi> The Eighth leads the
Van in theſe terms: <hi>Any actions, geſtures,
or words, directed to any creature as to an
object, which naturally imply or ſignify ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the incommunicable or incommunicated
eminencies of God, is the giving that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
that is the right and due of God alone;
to that creature, and that injury againſt the
divine Majeſty, which is termed idolatry.</hi>
Then follows the Tenth, and in a high and
mighty language ſpeaks thus: <hi>An omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percipient
omnipreſence, which does hear, and
ſee whatever is ſaid or tranſacted in the
world, whether conſidered in the whole, or
as diſtributed into terreſtrial, celeſtial, and
ſupercelestial; not only all theſe omnipercipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
but any one of them is a certain excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in God, and for ought we know, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151863:20"/>
to any Creature.</hi> The Twelfth
brings up the Rear with an Ergo; <hi>If om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence
or omnipercipience, at lest terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial
(if not celestial) be not communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Saints and Angels by God, the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of either is palpable idolatry.</hi> Behold
then the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Argument. Invocation
implies an incommunicated excellency in
the Saints; <hi>viz.</hi> an omnipercipient omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence,
at leſt terreſtrial, if not celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
and ſo communicates that right to
them, that appertains only to God. <hi>Ergo</hi>
invocation of Saints and Angels is palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
idolatry. Now if we can but acquit
our ſelves handſomely in a fair return to
this Argument, all the reſt that is to be
found in the aboveſaid 11. Concluſions,
will amount to no more than meer empty
and inſignificant nothings. We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
then the ſtate of the Church, with
reference to different circumſtances of
time. The one wherein it was a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
amongſt the Orthodox, whether the
Saints entred into Heaven before the Day
of Judgment, or were confined to ſome
other place of reſt, excluded from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atifick
Viſion? And this was not fully
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:151863:21"/>
determined till the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi>
which Council cleared the Point, define<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>The Souls of the dead, as ſoon as
cleanſed from all ſin, are received into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and ſee God clearly, as he is in himſelf.</hi>
Now as for thoſe elder Centuries before
the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> they held invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Saints, for an undoubted truth,
though ſome of them doubted, whether
they heard our Prayers or no; becauſe no
Church-definition had as then aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them of their full beatitude. Let ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Antiquity ſpeak for it ſelf by the
mouth of a Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> who in his Book
<hi>De cura pro mortuis,</hi> c. 16. ſpeaks thus.
<hi>This question exceeds the reach of my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how the Martyrs relieve thoſe, who
are certainly aſſiſted by them? whether they
are pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent by themſelves, at the ſame time,
in ſo many ſeveral places where the benefit
of their ſuccour is received? or being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
from the converſation of men, in ſome
place proportioned to their merits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there
interceding for the relief of thoſe that call
upon them, as we pray for the dead, who are
not really preſent with them; and know not
how they are, nor what they do: God omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151863:21"/>
and ever preſent, hearing the Prayers
of the Martyrs, grants to Men by the miniſtery
of Angels, thoſe helps where he will, when
he will, and how he pleaſeth.</hi> Thus B. S.
<hi>Auſtine.</hi> Here we have it from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
work of this great Saint and
Doctor, (owned by himſelf in his Retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations)
<hi>Firſt,</hi> That Invocation of Saints
was the conſtant, avowed practiſe of thoſe
elder and purer days. <hi>Secondly,</hi> (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Doctor's <hi>15th.</hi> Concluſion, and
all his Phariſaical ſcruples.) Here is a
ſure and certain ground of this invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
to wit, unqueſtionable, ancient, and
immemorial poſſeſſion, and the often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
benefit of it by thoſe, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing
themſelves to the Holy Martyrs
mediation, were (ſays S. <hi>Auſtine) certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſiſted by them. Thirdly,</hi> That the
Saints <hi>preſence, at the ſame time in ſo many
ſeveral places,</hi> (which is equivalent to the
Doctor's terreſtrial Omnipercipient Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence)
does not at all in Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>'s
Opinion, either imply an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
or entrench upon any of the divine
excellencies; for then he would certainly
have rejected it, which yet he does not.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151863:22"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Waving this Omnipercipient
Omnipreſence, S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> renders it eaſily
intelligible, how the Saints might (even
without that, and without their hearing
our Prayers) relieve thoſe that called
upon them: Viz. <hi>God omnipotent and ever
preſent hearing the Prayers of the Martyrs,
and granting to Men, by the Miniſtery of
Angels thoſe helps—when he will, where he
will, and how he pleaſeth.</hi> Out of all
which, I deduce this inference, which is
home to the point, That, if S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> be
to be credited before Dr. <hi>More,</hi> It is good
and profitable to invocate the Saints,
though we knew not whether they heard
us or no. And till the Doctor can prove
the contrary, his main Hypotheſis upon
which he builds, (to wit, that an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percipient
omnipreſence is the only
ground of invocation of Saints) is fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally
ſubverted, and all his vapou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
pretences of idolatry, end in ſmoke
and fancy. This which I have already
ſaid, renders invocation of Saints main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable,
though it were not certain they
heard us; which yet is moſt certain from
their bliſsful viſion of God, not gain-ſaid
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151863:22"/>
even by Proteſtants: For if Devils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and aſſiſt Witches and Sorcerers
upon their invocation, Shall we deny this
to the Saints in Glory? The Saints are
<hi>as the Angels of God in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 22. 30.
And of the Angels 'tis written: <hi>See you
deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones, for I ſay
unto you, their Angels in Heaven always ſee
the Face of my Father which is in Heaven:</hi>
Mat. 18. 10. And again, <hi>There ſhall be joy
in, Heaven upon one ſinner that doth pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi>
Luc. 15. 7. Why therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
the Saints hear our Prayers, as the
Angels ſee the contempt of one of thoſe
little ones, and as thoſe in Heaven ſee the
repentance of a ſinner? The Schools in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
may freely diſpute how this is done,
and every one may freely abound in his
own ſenſe, and offer their ſeveral modes
and ways; and learned Dr. <hi>More,</hi> may
(as he does, <hi>p. 23.)</hi> in calling them all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
ridiculous, render himſelf no leſs
ridiculous in his weak cenſure; and when
all this is done, the uncertainty of the
manner does not argue againſt the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the thing it ſelf: For it is a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
uncontroulable Maxime in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151863:23"/>
of Chriſtianity, that, <hi>Poteſt conſtare
de re, quando non conſtat de modo rei;</hi> and
he who denies this, may with equal
ground except againſt the myſtery of the
incarnation, together with the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibility
of the Unity and Trinity
of God.</p>
               <p>In the next place follows the Ninth
Concluſion, which was left behind, as a
ſtragler from the reſt of the Flock, being
owned by none of its next Neighbours as
any thing akin to them, and ſpeaks thus;
<hi>That the uſing any of thoſe actions or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
or doing any of thoſe things, that the
true and ſupreme God did chuſe and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
in the ſetting out the mode of his own
Worſhip, towards or in reference to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as to an object, is idolatry. Becauſe
ſuch a mode of worſhip does thus manifeſtly
appear to be the peculiar right of God, which
none can transfer to another, but God himſelf.</hi>
Thus the Doctor. Let us then ſtate the
queſtion, whether any of thoſe exterior
actions or geſtures, which God did chuſe
in the ſetting out the mode of his own
Worſhip, for example, <hi>Incurvation or
bowing down</hi> the Body may be exhibited
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:151863:23"/>
to a Creature without Idolatry? No,
replys the Doctor. Let us now take this
Concluſion for granted, and ſee what
will be the Sequel. The uſing any of
thoſe actions, or geſtures, ſays he, that
the true and ſupreme God did chuſe and
challenge, in the ſetting out the mode of
his own Worſhip, towards, or in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to any Creature, as to an object, is
idolatry. But according to his ſixteenth
Concluſion, <hi>Incurvation</hi> of the Body is
one of the actions, or geſtures, which God
did chuſe, in ſetting out the mode of his
own Worſhip: Ergo, <hi>Incurvation</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
or in reference to any Creature,
as to an object, is idolatry. Now I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume:
But <hi>Abraham</hi> uſed this <hi>incurvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
towards Men, and Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. and
23. And the beloved Diſciple of <hi>Jeſus</hi>
reiterated the like <hi>incurvation</hi> towards an
Angel, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 9. I ſhall leave the <hi>(ergo)</hi>
to the Doctor: for the premiſes being
his, I ſhall not envy him the glory of the
Concluſion, which makes <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
Saint <hi>John</hi> Idolaters.</p>
               <p>The <hi>16th. 17th. 19th.</hi> and <hi>20th.</hi> talk
much of a ſymbolical preſence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curvation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:151863:24"/>
towards it. Whereof the <hi>16th.</hi>
refers to the Ninth, and has its Anſwer
there. The <hi>17th. That the Pagans wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
their demons, though not as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God, by ſymbolical preſences, &amp;c.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Ipſo Facto</hi> Idolaters. To this I
have already anſwered, ſhewing that the
<hi>Pagans</hi> gave the worſhip and title of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
to their demons, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Ipſo Facto</hi> Idolaters. The <hi>19th.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
magiſterially; <hi>That incurvation in
way of Religion towards an open or bare ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
preſence, be it whatever Figure or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
as to an object, is flat Idolatry.</hi> Here
I would gladly know of the Doctor, why
he calls a Figure, or Image a ſymbolical
preſence, but only becauſe the Image is
a ſign or token, ſignifying or repreſenting
the Perſon, whoſe image it is? Then I
enquire further, whether (for the ſame
reaſon) the Name of a Perſon, be not a
ſymbolical preſence in its kind, as well as
the image? foraſmuch as both of them
are ſigns or tokens repreſenting the ſame
thing, with this only difference, that the
Image repreſents it to the eye, the Name
to the ear? And why then, may we not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:151863:24"/>
bow to the Image of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as well as to
the Name of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> or how can the one
be condemned of idolatry, but the other
muſt incur the like brand? The <hi>20th.</hi>
Harping ſtill upon the ſame ſtring of a
ſymbolical preſence, will needs maintain,
<hi>That religious incurvation towards a bare
ſymbolical preſence, wittingly and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
directed thither, though with a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
reſerve, that they intend to uſe it meerly
as a circumſtance of worſhip, is notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
real idolatry.</hi> To me this Concluſion
ſeems big with a ſpirit of contradiction,
as being manifeſtly againſt Scripture,
againſt the practice of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and laſtly againſt Dr. <hi>More</hi>
himſelf. That it is clearly againſt Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
(beſides what I have ſaid in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the laſt Concluſion of the firſt
Chapter) is ſufficiently evidenced from
the <hi>incurvation</hi> the Scripture commands
to the Name of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> which is as
much a <hi>religious incurvation,</hi> as any we
give to thoſe ſymbolical preſences, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Images. That it is againſt the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
proves that all Proteſtants, who kneel at
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:151863:25"/>
the Euchariſt are Idolaters, I conceive to
be no leſs manifeſt: for Proteſtants in
their Communion acknowledge [See the
Proteſtant Rubrick after Communion.]
<hi>no corporal</hi> and real, but a bare figurative
and ſymbolical preſence of <hi>Chriſts natural
fleſh and blood.</hi> And religious incurvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards a ſymbolical preſence, being
real idolatry, according to the Doctor:
What follows by a clear ſequel, but that
all Proteſtants, who bow the knee at the
Euchariſt, are Idolaters? And if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant-Communicant,
in his vindication,
chance to fly to a mental reſerve, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
for his excuſe, that he uſes it meerly
as a circumſtance of worſhip; and that
his intention terminates not in the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
preſence, but looks up to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Jeſus Chriſt; the Doctor will ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
tell him, (for they are his own
words in the like caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Concl. 19.) <hi>That
direction of our intention here is but a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical
juggle, and that the uſing it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a circumſtance of worſhip,</hi> is ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;
and ſo he cuts him off from that
plea, and leaves him without all excuſe.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is againſt the Doctor, I
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:151863:25"/>
appeal to the Doctor himſelf, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>16th.</hi> and his <hi>20th.</hi> Concluſions
face to face. The <hi>16th.</hi> openly avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>That the erecting of a ſymbolical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
with incurvation thither ward, was
declared by the ſupreme God, the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
one of the manners of worſhip due to
him.</hi> The <hi>20th.</hi> runs counter, and ſtifly
preſſeth, <hi>That religious incurvation towards
a ſymbolical preſence</hi> (without exception
of any) <hi>wittingly and conſcientiouſly dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
thither, is real idolatry.</hi> Theſe two
Concluſions, as I conceive, do thwart each
other no leſs, than if he had ſaid in direct
terms: All religious incurvation towards
a ſymbolical preſence, is idolatry: Not
all religious incurvation towards a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
preſence, is idolatry: For the
<hi>20th.</hi> is a Univerſal affirmative, and

leſs, than what is aſſerted in the ſecond.
The <hi>22th.</hi> and <hi>23th.</hi> Concluſions weakly
cavil at the adoration of the Hoſt, as ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
either in Catholiques or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.
But theſe petty niblers at the
moſt bleſſed and ever adorable Sacrament
ſhall have their anſwer in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:151863:26"/>
where the Doctor treats this Subject
<hi>Ex profeſſo:</hi> Only here I add, that for
Proteſtants indeed to adore the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who believe no corporal preſence
of Chriſt there; but that the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Bread and Wine remain ſtill in their
<hi>natural ſubſtances</hi> (ſo ſpeaks their above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Rubrick:) would be the like crime,
as for an unconverted <hi>Jew</hi> to adore Jeſus
Chriſt, in whom he believes not. But
what is this to the Doctor's purpoſe?
Both the <hi>Jew</hi> and the Proteſtant lie under
the prejudice of an erroneous perſwaſion,
which upon application to rational and
ſound motives, may and ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>25th.</hi> and laſt Concluſion, the
Doctor ſtarts a pretended Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his charge of idolatry in the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Euchariſt, and overflows whole
Pages in anſwer to it. But the Catholique
Church makes no ſuch Reply, nor ſtands
in need of any ſuch vindication of her
doctrine and practiſe. And therefore I
leave the Doctor to the pleaſure of his
own thoughts, raiſing his Aery Caſtle
with one hand, and beating it down with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:151863:26"/>
the other. And ſo I paſs on to the Third
Section.</p>

               <head>The Third Section.</head>
               <head type="sub">Which anſwers to the Doctors Third
Chapter.</head>
               <p>THe Title of this Chapter delivers it
ſelf in theſe terms; <hi>That the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts
worſhip the Hoſt with the higheſt
kind of worſhip, even that of Latria, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the injunction of the Council of Trent,</hi>
and that it is moſt groſs idolatry ſo to do.
It had been ingenuous in the Doctor,
whilſt he ſtates Catholique Doctrine, to
ſpeak Catholique language. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> (even as quoted by himſelf)
mentions not the Hoſt, but only the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
of the Bleſſed Sacrament, or
(which is the ſame) of Jeſus Chriſt in the
Sacrament. Which is a quite different
thing from that uncatholique expreſſion
of worſhipping the Hoſt: For Catholick
Principles own nothing of the Hoſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
after conſecration, but the ſpecies or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151863:27"/>
ſymbols. Nor does the Council enjoyn
the worſhip of Latria to the ſymbols, but
to Jeſus Chriſt veiled with the ſymbols.
In this Chapter, the Doctor pretends to
undeniable demonſtration; which, if we
take it ſumm'd up briefly, <hi>and girt up in
his cloſe and convictive method,</hi> gives us
this brisk aſſault. Tranſubſtantiation is
a meer figment and enormous falſhood
(ſo he ſpeaks, <hi>p. 49.) Ergo</hi> the adoration
of the Euchariſt is palpable idolatry. The
greateſt part of the Chapter is ſpent in
proof of his Antecedent. The conſequence
he conceives no leſs then evident: becauſe
if the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation be
falſe, then the <hi>Cultus Latriae</hi> is exhibited
to a meer Creature: And <hi>Coſterus</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
ſticks not to grant the ſequel; <hi>Viz.
that if our Church be miſtaken in the doctrin
of Tranſubſtantiation, we Ipſo Facto stand
guilty of ſuch a piece of idolatry, as never
was before ſeen or known in this World.</hi> I
anſwer: Firſt, as to <hi>Coſterus,</hi> the Doctor
deals not fair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y with him; for <hi>Coſterus</hi>
does not ſo much as name Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
in that place. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
both here and elſewhere boaſts much
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:151863:27"/>
of <hi>Costerus</hi> his conceſſion, but wholly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
the ground of it. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterus</hi>
argues thus;<note place="margin">Coſterus in Enchirid. <hi>c.</hi> 8 de Sanct. <hi rend="sup">mo</hi>. ſacram<hi rend="sup">to</hi>. n. 10</note> If in
the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt
the true Body of
Chriſt be not contained,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> has dealt unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with his Church, as having abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and permitted her to fall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
for Fifteen Hundred Years together,
in ſuch error and idolatry, the like to
which was never ſeen nor heard of, and
all this, by occaſion of his own words.
Here is the ground of <hi>Coſterus</hi> his conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
If the true Body of Chriſt be not
in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, <hi>Christ</hi>
had dealt unworthily with his Church;
and by conſequence would not be the true
<hi>Chriſt;</hi> and therefore the adoration of the
Euchariſt, would be, not only a miſtake,
as to the circumſtance, but alſo as to the,
object; there being no ſuch adorable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in the World, as a true <hi>Chriſt,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this ſuppoſition, and ſo the <hi>Cultus
Latria</hi> would be exhibited to a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Wherefore, to gratify the Doctor,
if he can but prove his Antecedent, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:151863:28"/>
Tranſubſtantiation is a meer figment, and
enormous falſhood, I ſhall not at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
his conſequence with him, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
grant as much as <hi>Coſterus</hi> to the
full. He begins then, and undertakes to
evince by undeniable demonſtration, that
the doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation is falſe.
For, ſays he, <hi>Thus the Body of Chriſt will be
in God knows how many Thouſand places at
once, and how many Thouſand Miles diſtant
one from another. Whereas Amphitruo</hi>
(ſays the Doctor) <hi>expoſtulates with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
Soſia, and rates him for a Mad-man
or Impostor, that he would make him believe,
that he could be in two places at once.</hi> This
indeed is a fair demonſtration that Dr.
<hi>More</hi> is acquainted with <hi>Plautus</hi> his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
and can (when he pleaſes) deſcend
from the divinity chair to a piece of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
mirth and ſtage-drollery. But
let this paſs, as a pleaſant skirmiſh before
the main charge. In the next place he
muſters up all the Arts and Sciences, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
Phyſicks, Metaphyſicks, and Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
againſt us, to prove that one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
cannot be in two places at once. His
firſt evidence is drawn from the Phyſicks.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:151863:28"/>
                  <hi>It is a principle, ſays he, of Phyſicks, that
that internal ſpace, that a Body occupies at
one time, is equal to the Body that occupies it.
Now let us ſuppoſe one and the ſame Body
occupy two ſuch internal places or ſpaces at
once. This Body is therefore equal to thoſe
two ſpaces, which are double to one ſingle
ſpace; wherefore the Body is double to that
Body in one ſingle ſpace; and therefore one
and the ſame Body double to it ſelf; which
is an enormous contradiction.</hi> To this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
I anſwer: <hi>Reſpicientes ad pauca
facile definiunt.</hi> The Doctor reckons here
without his Hoſt. You ſay, Mr. <hi>Doctor,</hi>
'Tis a Principle in Phyſicks, that the ſpace
which a Body occupies, muſt be equal to
the Body that occupies it. But what
Phyſicks tell you, that a Body in one
place, occupying a ſpace equal to it ſelf,
cannot poſſibly at the ſame time be elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
without occupying there any place
at all; (that is) be preſent there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a local preſence? And if this can
poſſibly be, your Phyſicks are quite ſtruck
dumb, and your Demonſtration blown up
from its very foundation. Now that this
ſuppoſition is more than meerly poſſible,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:151863:29"/>
is clear from the common opinion of the
learned, who maintain that actually the
ſupreme Heaven occupies no place. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
Allowing the Doctor his own ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
<hi>That one and the ſame Body, at
the ſame time occupies two different places,
equal to it ſelf.</hi> What follows? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Firſt,</hi> (replies the Doctor) <hi>This Body
is equal to thoſe two ſpaces, which are double
to one ſingle ſpace. Therefore 2dly, The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is double to that body in one ſingle ſpace.
And therefore 3dly, One and the ſame body
is double to it ſelf.</hi> I deny all theſe three
<hi>Therefores;</hi> which are no more than
meer empty Paralogiſmes. Let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the firſt inference (of which the two
others depend) concluding from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
being in two places at once, that the
ſaid body is equal to thoſe two ſpaces.
What needs that, Mr. <hi>Doctor?</hi> It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that in each of thoſe two ſpaces, it
be only equal or commenſurate to that
determinate place it there occupies (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of ſix Cubits;) and in neither of
them, equal or commenſurate to a ſpace
of 12. Cubits. But yet further, admit
the body were made equal to thoſe two
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:151863:29"/>
ſpaces, which are double to one ſingle
ſpace. How does it follow from hence,
that the body is double to it ſelf? Let us
ſuppoſe a body of one Cubit, rarified to
its double dimenſion of two Cubits.
Will Philoſophy allow this inference for
current? <hi>Viz.</hi> This body is now equal to
two places, which are double to a place
of one ſingle Cubit. Therefore the body
is double to that body, in the place of one
ſingle Cubit; Therefore double to it ſelf.
What anſwer you give to this inſtance,
will ſerve for an Anſwer to your own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
Again, let us take a rational
ſoul, informing a body a ſpan in length:
Then let us ſuppoſe the ſame body grown
up to two ſpans, and ſtill informed by the
ſame ſoul. Behold now another parallel
of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Argument. This Soul is
co-extended and commenſurate to two
ſpans, which are double to one ſingle ſpan;
therefore the ſoul is double to that ſoul,
which was under one ſpan; therfore dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to it ſelf. Is not this rare divinity?
Let the Doctor ſhow a material diſparity
in theſe two caſes, or elſe acknowledg the
inconcluſiveneſs of his own objection. But
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:151863:30"/>
he may pleaſe to remember, that the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being continued, or diſcontinued, in
one or the other caſe, will nothing avail
him, unleſs he can demonſtrate, that
which the Schools will not eaſily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
unto; to wit, that each ſubject ows
its unity, to the unity of place; and not
to its own intrinſick eſſence. Thus much
in Anſwer to his Phyſicks.</p>
               <p>In his Second Objection, the Metaphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks
are up in armes againſt us, in defence
of their great Maxime; <hi>That the notion
of Unum, is to be Indiviſum a ſe, as well
as Diviſum a quolibet alio.</hi> The firſt part
of which Maxime ſeems to be manifeſtly
infringed by us, putting a poſſibility of
one Bodies being in more places at once:
For in this caſe, the body will be <hi>Diviſum
a ſe, and both Unum and Multa.</hi> Thus the
Doctor. And I ſhall crave the favour to
return my Anſwer in the ſame Language
the Objection ſpeaks. To the firſt then,
I reply thus: It will be <hi>Diviſum a ſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum
ſubſtantiam;</hi> I deny it. It will
be <hi>Diviſum a ſe quoad locum; tranſeat.</hi>
Then <hi>Secondly,</hi> I deny, that it will be <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
&amp; multa;</hi> but only <hi>Unum in multis:</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:151863:30"/>
One and the ſame in many places. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
I anſwer to the Objection, that
the Doctor here rowles the ſame Stone,
and relapſes into the ſame error, which
was reproved in the former Objection,
as building upon a falſe and ruinous bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom;
for he ſuppoſes that eſſential unity
is derived from the unity of Local pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and not from the intrinſick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Subject: For unleſs we grant
this ſuppoſition, it will not follow, that
the ſame body being in divers places at
once is divided from it ſelf, any more than
it is divided from its intrinſick Principles,
which it can never be by plurality of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
preſence, they being wholly extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
to the ſubject. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I anſwer, that
both this, and the precedent Objection
are of pernicious conſequence, as putting
armes into the hands of Infidels, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
againſt the miſtery of the ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable
Trinity. For, as the Doctor ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
that if one body can be in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at once, it will follow that the ſaid
Body <hi>is double to it ſelf:</hi> So it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with 'greater plauſibility by the
Antitrinitarian, that if one and the ſame
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:151863:31"/>
divine nature, can be in three diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
at once, it will follow that the ſame
nature will <hi>be treble to it ſelf.</hi> And as he
objects that from the hypotheſis of one
Bodies being in divers places at once, the
ſequel will be, that the ſame body will be
<hi>Diviſum a ſe,</hi> contrary to <hi>one piece of a</hi>
Metaphyſical Principle; of the notion of
<hi>Unum,</hi> being <hi>Indiviſum a ſe:</hi> So may the
Antitrinitarian object with a more cloſe
Logick, that from the hypotheſis of one
nature being in three diſtinct Perſons, the
ſequel will be, that the ſame nature will
be <hi>Diviſa a ſe,</hi> and alſo not <hi>Diviſa ab aliis</hi>
(becauſe really identified with three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Perſons) which is contrary to <hi>the
whole Metaphyſical</hi> Principle of the notion
of <hi>Unum,</hi> being <hi>Indiviſum a ſe, &amp; diviſum
a quolibet alio.</hi> And if there be any diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the caſe, it is wholly on the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitarians
ſide, and to his advantage.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Third Objection is from
the Mathematicks. I ſhall give it <hi>Verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi>
from his own Pen. <hi>The Council of Trent
ſaying, that in the ſeparation of the parts of
the ſpecies (that which bears the outward
ſhow of Bread and Wine) that from this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:151863:31"/>
there is a parting of the whole, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into ſo many entire bodies of Chriſt, the
body of Chriſt being always at the ſame time
equal to it ſelf, it follows that a part of the
diviſion is equal to the whole, againſt that
common notion in Euclid, that the whole is
bigger than the part.</hi> The Reader may
pleaſe to take notice that the Doctor here
gives us his own Paraphraſe for the words
of the Council. Now to the Objection.
Surely the Mathematicks, which lent the
Doctor this notion, never gave him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to abuſe his borrowed Principle
by ſo unskilful a miſapplication: For his
Argument is this: It follows from the
Council's doctrine, that a part of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
is equal to the whole, contrary to
the generally eſtabliſhed notion of the
Mathematicks, that the Whole is bigger
than the Part. I anſwer: The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is meer Cobweb ſtuff; half an Eye
is enough to look through it: For theſe
words of the Doctors <hi>(That a part of the
diviſion is equal to the whole)</hi> either refer
to the ſpecies (and then it is falſe that a
part of the diviſion is equal to the whole)
or they point at the Body of Chriſt (and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:151863:32"/>
then the words are <hi>De ſubjecto non ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nente:)</hi>
for there is no diviſion of any part
of Chriſt's Body from the whole.</p>
               <p>His Fourth Objection is from Logick.
<hi>In Logick (ſays the Doctor) it is a Maxime,
that the parts agree indeed with the whole,
but diſagree one with another. But in the
aboveſaid diviſion of the Host or Sacrament,
the parts do ſo well agree, that they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
the very ſame individual thing. And
whereas any diviſion, whether Logical or
Phyſical, is the diviſion of ſome one into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
this is but the diviſion of one into one,
and it ſelf.</hi> My anſwer to this is, that I
may with much more reaſon ſay, that this
and the precedent Objection is but <hi>the
diviſion of one into one and it ſelf.</hi> For this
is the ſame in effect with the former, and
requires no new Anſwer. Becauſe theſe
his trifling expreſſions, if applied to the
ſeparated ſpecies, are falſe; if to Chriſts
body, then they proceed upon a falſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
as hath been declared in my
Anſwer to the Third Objection. And
therefore Logick hath great reaſon to take
it ill at the Doctor's hands, for making
her inſtrumental to ſuch an illogical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:151863:32"/>
But the Doctor diſtruſting the ſtrength
of his Logick, calls in his Metaphyſicks
again to her relief, and gives us a Fifth
and mixed Objection from Logick and
Metaphyſicks. <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, ſays he,
implies that the ſame thing is, and is not at
the ſame time. For that individual thing,
that can be, and is to be made of any thing,
is not. Now the individual body of Chriſt is
to be made of the Wafer conſecrated, for it is
turned into his individual body. But his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
body was before the Conſecration.
Wherefore it was, and it was not at the ſame
time. Which is againſt that Fundamental
Principle in Logick and Metaphyſicks, that
both parts of a contradiction cannot be true:
Or that the ſame thing cannot both be, and
not be at once.</hi> Thus far the Doctor in
his own expreſſions. Now before I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
his Objection; there are two or
three particulars deſerve a curſory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.
And firſt a knowing Reader can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuſe but ſmile to ſee, <hi>(Can be)</hi> or a
capacity of being brought in for a piece
of an Argument to prove that a thing is
not: <hi>That individual thing that can be (ſays
the Doctor) and is to be made of any thing,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:151863:33"/>
is not. Secondly,</hi> It is here obſervable,
how fondly the Doctor plays the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Dogmatizer, aſſerting as evident (for
in this Chapter he profeſſedly pretends to
evidence an undeniable demonſtration.)
<hi>That that individual thing that can be and
is to be made of any thing, is not.</hi> As if
forſooth it were evidently demonſtrable,
that that individual thing, which is to
day actually in being, could not poſſibly
be deſtroy'd, and made anew again to
morrow by a ſecond generation. For if
this be abſolutely poſſible, it will be falſe
to day to utter this Propoſition: <hi>(That
individual thing that can be, and is to be
made of any thing, is not.)</hi> And is not this
raſhly to fetter God's Omnipotency, and
to go about to wreſt a power out of his
Almighty Hand, which he may have, for
any thing the Doctor knows to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is pitty to obſerve
his words in the next Propoſition. <hi>The
individual body of Chriſt, ſays he, is to be
made of the Wafer conſecrated.</hi> Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
as much as if the Water were the
material cauſe of Chriſt's body. What
Philoſopher ever ſpoke thus unphiloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically?
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:151863:33"/>
Yet to make amends, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
contradicts himſelf, and adds,
<hi>That the Wafer is turned</hi> (or converted)
<hi>into his individual body.</hi> Which is a much
different thing from being <hi>made of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</hi>
But the particle <hi>(for)</hi> goes beyond
wonder. <hi>The individual body of Chriſt is
made of the Wafer conſecrated</hi> (mark the
word) <hi>for it is turned into his individual
body.</hi> Which is a piece of as learned non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe,
as if he ſaid in open terms, Becauſe
the Wafer is turned into Chriſt's body,
by a total Converſion, which excludes a
material cauſe; therefore his Body is
made of the Wafer by generation, which
requires a material cauſe. Thus unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
are the Acts and Sciences, when
they engage againſt GOD's Church. I
come now to his Argument. <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
ſays he, implies that the ſame
thing is, and is not, at the ſame time.</hi> This
I deny. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe Phyſicks have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it probable, that a thing which actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
is, may be reproduced, without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
its actual exiſtence. And if we ſhould
ſay, that Chriſts body is thus reproduced
in the Sacrament, it will not follow, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151863:34"/>
the Body of Chriſt is, and is not at once:
to wit, before the Conſecration: but
only that it is by a firſt production, and
is not by a ſecond production, till after
the Conſecration. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will aſſign
the Doctor another way, whereby to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
his contradiction: for as in nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and augmentation, when new matter
is added to the body, (by converſion of
our food and ſuſtenance into fleſh) the
Soul preſently begins to inform this new
matter. And there is no need of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a new Soul, which was not before;
but only the Soul begins to be, where
it was not before: So when the Hoſt is
converted into the Body of Chriſt, no
neceſſity enforces us to grant the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a new body, which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but only that the body begins to be,
where it was not before.</p>
               <p>Let the impartial Reader now judge
what great cauſe the Doctor had to cry
Victory before his time, and ſo manfully
to word us down, and conclude Hector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
as he does; <hi>That nothing could be
more fully and entirely contradictious, and
repugnant to all ſenſe and reaſon, to all indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151863:34"/>
Principles of all Art and Science, then
this figment of Tranſubſtantiation: ſo that
any one (ſays he) that is not a meer Bigot,
may be as aſſured that Tranſubſtantiation is
a meer figment, or enormous falſhood, as of
any thing elſe in the whole World.</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whether they be not as meer Bigots,
with the Doctor, whoever believe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of the Holy Trinity. For let him
but compare the myſteries of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation
and <hi>Trinity</hi> together, and
then he ſhall be to me more than a great
<hi>Apollo,</hi> if he can ſhew that there is any
thing <hi>more fully and entirely contradictious,
and repugnant to all ſenſe and reaſon, to all
indubitable Principles of all Art and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
in the firſt miſtery, then in the later.
And <hi>that any one who is not a meer Bigot
may be more aſsured, that Tranſubſtantiation
is a meer figment or enormous falſhood,</hi> then
Trinity. And I deſire him to inſtance in
particular by what Argument he has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to conclude the impoſſibility of
one Bodies being in divers places at once,
which is not emboldened from hence to
lift up its head much more plauſibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Unity and Trinity of God, to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:151863:35"/>
evince the impoſſibility of one divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in three diſtinct Perſons, really iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with each Perſon, and yet moſt
ſtrictly one in eſſence, undiſtinguiſh'd and
undivided from it ſelf.</p>
               <p>If Dr. <hi>More</hi> would proceed as every
good and well-grounded Chriſtian ought
to do, he ſhould rather make the ſeeming
impoſſibility of theſe two myſteries an
argument of their being true and divinely
inſpired doctrines: For ſo we may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay in reſpect of both; <hi>The more incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
the more credible.</hi> That is, by how
much the more incredible theſe myſteries
are, if we only conſult our ſenſes, and the
bare ſentiments of the natural man; by
ſo much the more credible it is, that
there lies a divine revelation at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome;
and that no art, perſwaſion, force,
or any thing elſe in the whole World, but
a divine Authority, could ever have
wrought ſo firm and general a belief in
the hearts of men of ſuch high and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent

               <p>IN the entrance of the Fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Doctor falls foul upon the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> for teaching, <hi>That the
Saints raigning with Christ offer up their
Prayers for Men; and that it is good and
profitable humbly to invocate them, and to
fly to their mediation, aid and ſuccour, for
the obtaining of God's bleſſings, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Christ his Son.</hi> This the Doctor terms
making the Saints the more exactly like
the <hi>Pagans Dii Medioxumi,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
that negotiated the affairs of Men
with the higheſt Deities. Now to prove
that this kind of invocation of Saints is
down right Idolatry, and by conſequence
that we are worſhippers of falſe Gods, he
conjures up a ſpirit, which for its many
names, and bad qualities, may well be
termed Legion: <hi>Viz.</hi> the <hi>3d. 4th. 5th. 6th.</hi>

               <p>In the reſt of this fourth, and the two

we are to meet with a great dearth
of reaſon: Three entire Chapters having
much ado to furniſh out matter for one
Argument, and that a poor one too, God
knows. His buſineſs is to lay down, and
amuſe his Reader with a number of ſet
formes of Invocation of Saints, which he
pretends to be egregiouſly idolatrous.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:151863:36"/>
Yet ſcarce ever mentioning the Churches
Publique Prayers, as her Liturgys, Litany,
Canonical Hours, Pontifical or Ritual;
he plays at ſmall game and ſerves in the
gleanings of his own obſervation, picked
up here and there, out of ſeveral Books
of devotion; as the Roſary of our Lady,
the <hi>Mary</hi> Pſalter, and others: importing
(as he gloſſeth upon his Text) that the
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> in their Prayers to Saints (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the Bleſſed Virgin) ask of them
ſuch things as are only in the power of
our great Saviour and Redeemer <hi>Chriſt</hi>
to grant: Such as are, to protect us from
all evil, and from all the frauds of the
Devil; To grant us ſtrength, courage, and
patience; ſpiritual illumination of the
Soul, and purgation thereof from the filth
of Sin; To comfort and ſupport us in the
agony of death, and to conduct us hence
into Eternal Life. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He recounts
ſome particular addreſſes to the Bleſſed
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi>
as begging ſalvation of her, with a
<hi>Domina ſalvum me fac: O Bleſſed Lady,
ſave me.</hi> From whence he deduceth theſe
conſequences, as the bounteous overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:151863:37"/>
of his Pen. <hi>That we ask ſuch thing; of
her, as are in the power of none but of Jeſus
Chriſt as he is God, to grant: That we make
the Eternal God-head as hypoſtatically uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Virgin, as with Chriſt Himſelf:
That we make Her a She Chriſt, and the
Daughter of God, in as high a ſenſe, as Chriſt
is his Son.</hi> As to the fidelity of his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
(having not the Books at hand to
examine them) I can neither accuſe nor
acquit him. But I ſhall allow him all
the fair play in the World, by ſuppoſing,
his allegations to be true, and freely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them upon truſt; Though his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
hitherto gives us no great cauſe to
ſuſpect him guilty of too much candor
in that kind. Let us then ſingle out one
of the moſt harſh-ſounding forms of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
that is to be found throughout
all the three Chapters: and if that, which
is ſeemingly the unſoundeſt (nay virtually
includes all the reſt) and grates upon a
Chriſtian eare with the greateſt ſhow of
offence of all others, may yet admit of an
Orthodox ſenſe, and this by clear warrant
from Holy Scripture; then I hope the
reſt, which are not ſo ſeemingly injuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:151863:37"/>
as this, may in all reaſon be excuſed
from that odious Epithite of <hi>Idolatrous,</hi>
and I from the labour of all further apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
in their behalf. And there is no form
of invocation produced by the Doctor of
a higher or harſher ſtrain than this, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſalvation ſeems to be begged of our
Lady, ſaying, <hi>Domina ſalvum me fac.
Bleſſed Lady ſave me.</hi> But, why muſt this
form needs be idolatrous? Muſt the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
which yields a wholeſome juyce to
the induſtrious Bee, needs be bad, becauſe
the venomous Spider turns it into poiſon?
<hi>Hony ſoit qui mal y penſe,</hi> is an uſeful piece
of morality in things of ambiguous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
For in this caſe, the evil is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to him, that evil thinks. And it is very
poſſible that he who makes this form of
Invocation a piece of his Litany; <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
ſalvum me fac. Bleſſed Lady ſave me.</hi>
May think no more evil in it, nor be in
any more danger of committing idolatry
thereby, than Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was, when wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the <hi>Romans</hi> (Rom. 11. 14.) he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
theſe words: <hi>If by any means I may
provoke to emulation, them which are my
fleſh, and might ſave ſome of them.</hi> Or,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:151863:38"/>
when he ſpeaks to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in this
ſort (1 Cor. 9. 22.) <hi>I am made all things
to all Men, that I might SAVE all:</hi> or, as
you read, <hi>That by all means I might SAVE
ſome:</hi> which is all one, as to our preſent
purpoſe. Conceive now that ſome hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and well meaning ſuppliant had made
his applications to the Apoſtle in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
form of Prayer; <hi>Holy Apoſtle SAVE
me.</hi> What idolatry had it been to Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for a favour, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
himſelf both ready and able to
grant? for here the Apoſtle cleerly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
in himſelf not only the will, but
the power of <hi>ſaving Souls.</hi> But in what
ſenſe? not in the quality of a God, but
as inſtrumental to their ſalvation by his
Prayers and Preaching. So that <hi>(Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
SAVE me:)</hi> had ſignified no more,
then, <hi>Holy Apoſtle teach me the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
or, <hi>Holy Apoſtle pray for my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
Say now the ſame in our caſe;
that as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had upon Earth, ſo the
Virgin hath in Heaven the like, or a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
power of SAVING Souls, by her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage,
Prayers, and Mediation: Her
dignity and place (as Mother of God) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:151863:38"/>
her a neerer acceſs to the Throne
of Grace, And if the words of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid
Invocation be expounded in this
manner (as taking our meaſures from the
Apoſtles own words and meaning) it will
be one and the ſame kind of addreſs, to
ſay; <hi>Bleſſed Lady ſave me:</hi> or, <hi>Bleſſed
Lady pray for my ſalvation.</hi> And ſo all
the forms of Prayer aſſigned by the <hi>Doctor</hi>
taken in the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to no more than a meer <hi>Ora pro
nobis.</hi> Now whereas the Doctor was
pleaſed to diſcharge his Vollies of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
againſt us, upon the account of
this, and the like formes of Invocation;
let him turn his Paper-pellets againſt the
Apoſtle, and diſcharge the overflowing
of his gall upon him, as aſſuming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Soul-ſaving Power in the Texts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid;
and he may pleaſe to tell him;
<hi>That hereby he takes upon him to do ſuch a
thing, as is in the power of none but Jeſus
Chriſt, as he is God, to do; That he makes
the Eternal God Head as hypoſtatically uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to himſelf, as with Chriſt; and ſo makes
himſelf a ſecond Chriſt, and the Son of God,
in as high a ſenſe, as Chriſt is his Son.</hi> The
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:151863:39"/>
inference is equally concluding, either in
both caſes or neither: And therefore it
ſhall be at the Doctor's choice, either to
clear us, or condemn the Apoſtle, with
whom we ſhall not fear to ſtand, or fall.</p>

That the Images of Chriſt, of the bleſſed
Virgin, and other Saints are to be had and
retained in Churches, and that due honor
and reverence is to be done to them. Here
the Doctor gives us a learned antitheſis,
between the Commandement of God, and
the decree of this Council. <hi>Thus much,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>as the Council of Trent has decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
touching Images is plain and open idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
by the Seventh Concluſien of the firſt
Chapter, and expreſly againſt the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, who forbids us to make a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:151863:39"/>
graven Image to bow down to, or worſhip.
But the Council of Trent ſays, yes, ye may
make graven Images of the Saints, and ſet
them up in their Temples, and give them
their due honour and worſhip; nay, ye ought
to do ſo; and instances in the very act of
bowing, or kneeling and prostrating our
ſelves before them.</hi> The like Rhetorical
flouriſh he uſes againſt the Second Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice</hi> in the next Chapter. But how
weak, frivolous, and Phariſaical this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis
is, I have ſufficiently declared in
my Anſwer to the Second, and Seventh
Concluſions of the firſt Chapter. He
goes on, ſaying, <hi>That this definition of the
Council is ſo palpably againſt the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, that they are fain to leave the
ſecond Commandement out of the Decalogue,
that the People may not diſcern how groſly
they go againſt the expreſs Precepts of God,
in their ſo frequent practiſes of idolatry.</hi>
This charge from the Pen of a divine
looks ſomething more than ſtrange; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been ſo often anſwered, and yet no
notice taken of the anſwer, nor any reply
made to it. That the Commandements
are Ten, we have Scripture for it, <hi>Exod.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151863:40"/>
34. 28. Deut.</hi> 4. 13. But that any part of
the Decalogue, which our Catechiſmes
leave out, is One of the Ten, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not yet in beeing, by which it can
be made out. The Scripture indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
the Decalogue unto us in the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> (which we own
to a tittle) but doth not divide and parcel
it out ſo punctually unto us, but that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Divines (even Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> and
Saint <hi>Hierome)</hi> have been divided amongſt
themſelves about the diviſion of it. As
for theſe words; <hi>Thou ſhalt not make unto
thee any graven Image, or any likeneſs of
any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is
in the Earth beneath, or that is in the Water
under the Earth: Thou ſhalt not bow down
thy ſelf to them; nor ſerve them.</hi> Theſe
words I ſay according to our School-men
(following herein the opinion of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine)</hi>
do make but one with the firſt of
not worſhipping other gods. Hereupon
divers of our Catechiſmes, as being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviations
of Chriſtian doctrin, fitted to
the weaker memories of the vulgar, leave
out the aboveſaid words, together with
divers others which follow in the fffth
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:151863:40"/>
and ſixth Verſe; as alſo others belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Commandement of keeping the
Sabboth, in the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh
Verſe. Now as our Catechiſmes leaving
out theſe laſt words, through meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendence
to the capacities of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
are not, nor cannot juſtly be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Proteſtants, as omitting any one
Commandement of the Decalogue: ſo,
before the Doctor could rightly charge
us with leaving out the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
he ought at leſt to have gone
about to prove, that that which he calls
the Second, is really a diſtinct Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
from the firſt: and that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
is not the ſame, whether we
divide the Precepts of the firſt Table in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three, or into four Commandements.
This he abſolutely omitting to do, his
charge proves a meer calumny, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
falſe witneſs againſt his Neighbour.
And ſo whilſt he pleads for his Second,
he very uncharitably breaks his Ninth
Commandement.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Doctor having diſcharged
his paſſion againſt the Council's doctrin,
his next exception is againſt the ground,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:151863:41"/>
or reaſon of the ſaid doctrine: for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Council declares, that due honour
and reverence is to be done to Images,
becauſe the honour done to the Image is
referr'd to the Prototype, or thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.
Againſt this, the Doctor argues
in this ſort. <hi>This reference, ſays he, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in vertue of that ſimilitude the images
have with thoſe Perſons they repreſent: Or
elſe this reference (without any regard to
perſonal ſimilitude) is from the direction of
the intention of the devotionist.</hi> Then he
ſuppoſing that neither of theſe ways are
maintainable, he infers that by no means,
can the honour done to the image be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to the Prototype, or thing repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Now that this reference is not in
vertue of the ſimilitude the images have
with thoſe Perſons they repreſent, he
proves, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe it is oftentimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
whether there be any ſuch ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of figure betwixt the Image and the
Prototype. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It may ſo happen,
that the Image may be more like ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, then it is to the Prototype:
For example, the Image of a Saint, may
poſſibly be like ſome ſinner, in which caſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:151863:41"/>
this wicked Perſon will intercept the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due to the ſame. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> No Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
can be like the Saints, who are now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
Souls. Fourthly, <hi>What terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Image</hi> (ſays the Doctor) <hi>can poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
him, that is truly</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>God-Man,
and is not the object of our adoration,
but as he is this divine Complexum, as well
of the divinity, as of the humanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Argument I anſwer, that this
reference is in vertue of that ſimilitude,
which the Image hath with the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type,
as including the direction of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Devotioniſt, <hi>Ipſo Facto,</hi> that
he is ſuppoſed to be a rational Agent.
And therefore the Doctor's disjunctive
Dilemma is very vain and defective. To
the firſt of the four proofs, my Anſwer
is, that the honour done to the Image
may be referr'd to the Prototype, though
there be no perſonal ſimilitude of figure
betwixt the Image and the Perſon it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents.
For beſides the ſimilitude of
figure, there is another ſimilitude, which
the Doctor, if he pleaſe may call a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of ſignification; the Image ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the dignity, quality, or other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:151863:42"/>
of the Prototype: Thus, though
there be no perſonal ſimilitude of figure,
betwixt God and man, yet man was <hi>made
after the Image and likeneſs of God,</hi> Gen.
1. 26. And he who honours man, as he
is the Image of God, honours God in his
Image. And therefore, if where there is
no ſimilitude of figure, ſurely much more
where there is a ſpecifical ſimilitude of
figure, the honour done to the image, may
be referr'd to the Prototype; as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in the caſe of the Images of Chriſt,
and his Saints. To the Second I anſwer,
that the caſe the Doctor puts is more
than poſſible: For it did actually ſo fall
out in the images of the Angels or Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims
over the Ark, which (if we regard
perſonal ſimilitude of figure and feature)
were more like ſome material and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial
Beeings, then thoſe incorporeal
intelligences; and yet the honour done
to them was referred to the Prototypes.
Whence it appears that it is the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of ſignification, more than the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of figure and feature, which draws
the honour after it. My Anſwer to the
Third is, that our Images pretend not to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151863:42"/>
repreſent the Saints, as deveſted of their
Bodies, but only according to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſtate under the Church militant, with
ſome additional marks of a Crown, or
Lawrel, or ſome ſuch ſignificative repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives
of their triumphant ſtate in
Glory. Yet, under favour, why may not
an image be like a ſeparated Soul, as well
as like an Angel or Cherubim? If any
one reply, that according to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the late revived Platonick Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
Angels have their Bodies, and why
may not thoſe Bodies have their Images?
Such a Replyer may pleaſe
to reflect, that (beſides
that no one ever yet got a
ſight of thoſe Angelical
Bodies)<note n="α" place="margin">See the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Author of <hi>Lux Orientalis,</hi> or the Pre-exiſtence of Souls, (a happy Pen, and worthy of a better Subject) and a great honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of Dr. <hi>More.</hi>
                  </note> The ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
allow unto Souls
ſeparated and diſcharged
from theſe groſs terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Elements, the like Aerial or Aetherial
Vehicles with Angels; and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this notion, either both, or neither of
them, are capable of an imagery repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
To the fourth, I anſwer, that the
Doctor's queſtion, either comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:151863:43"/>
or to ſomething worſe than nothing,
which is at leſt indirect blaſphemy: for,
if a terreſtrial Image can poſſibly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that Perſon, who is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> God-Man,
then the Doctor's Query falls to
nothing. But if a terreſtrial Image can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
then neither can a terreſtrial eye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
that Perſon, who is truly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
God-Man; and ſo the Apoſtles, whilſt
living, did never ſee that Perſon, who was
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God-Man; which is no leſs
than blaſphemy, and ſo worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
implying that that Perſon, called
Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Apoſtles daily
beheld with their eyes, was not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
God-Man.</p>
               <p>Having done with the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> the Doctor begins to pick quarrels
with the Second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the doctrine of this Council
touching the worſhip of Images to be
groſly idolatrous; and to this purpoſe he
produceth divers Objections, which it
were a ſin againſt Logick to call proofs;
ſo little there is of manly reaſon in them.
But becauſe he gives us not the Councils
own words, but contents himſelf with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:151863:43"/>
inſtancing in one or two weak arguments
of his own molding, which he would
gladly father upon the Council, we ſhall
not wrong him ſo much, as to rob him of
the child of his own brain, till he pleaſes
to take the pains to prove it to be none of
his own. Nor doth he end here, but
whereas the Council relates ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
in favour of the due honour given
to the images of Chriſt and his Saints,
theſe he moſt profoundly confutes by an
unanſwerable laughter: From laughing,
he immediately falls a louring; and the
reaſon is, becauſe this Council declares
that it is lawful to burn Candles, Incenſe,
and Perfumes in honour of the Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Images, which he in an angry
mood concludes to ſmell rankly of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
even (ſays he) <hi>by the authority of
Grotius himſelf upon the Decalogue.</hi> Good
Doctor, deceive not your ſelf. <hi>Grotius</hi>
was no Papiſt, as you ſeem to imagine.
And if you will not believe me, take it
upon truſt from your good friend Doctor
<hi>Pierce</hi> againſt <hi>Baxter.</hi> As for us, we
have nothing to do with ſuch amphibious
heads, ſuch ſelf-divided Humoriſts, halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:151863:44"/>
on both ſides, as <hi>Grotius;</hi> As if <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
his ſingle word were of weight to
counterballance the Authority of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council. After this he produceth
the Collections of <hi>Photius</hi> in <hi>Justellus,</hi>
and adds that according to theſe; <hi>One
would think that they meant</hi> (the fathers of
this Second Council of <hi>Nice) the Cultus
Latriae to the Image of Chriſt; they uſing
the word</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>as if that worſhip, which
was done to the Image paſſed through to
Chriſt himſelf, which would not be ſuitable
to him, if it were not divine worſhip.</hi> Here
is a diſcourſe indeed, wherein all confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
are concerned: For if an intelligent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
be asked, whether, when they bow
the Knee at the Euchariſt, (which to them
is a bare figure, or ſymbolical preſence)
the Church of <hi>England</hi> intends this act of
worſhip to terminate in the figure, or to
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and paſs on to Chriſt? If it
be anſwered, that this worſhip is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
and reſts in the bare figure, then Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>More</hi>'s Twentieth Concluſion of his
Second Chapter concludes them abſolute
Idolaters. But if they profeſs their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:151863:44"/>
in this caſe not to be abſolute, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Sacramental Bread and Wine,
but relative, and to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and paſs on to
Chriſt, then the Doctor may pleaſe to
addreſs his aboveſaid argument to them,
in his own terms, and ſay; <hi>One would think
that they</hi> (that is, all conformable Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
kneeling at the Euchariſt) <hi>meant
the Cultus Latriae to the Figure, or ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
preſence, they uſing the word</hi> (or at leſt
the ſenſe of) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>as if that worſhip
which is done to the figure or ſymbolical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
paſſed through to Chriſt himſelf, which
could not be ſuitable to him, unleſs it were
divine worſhip.</hi> Let him, I ſay, turn this
Argument againſt his own Brethren; and
I leave it to him and them to debate the
Point. His next pretence is to prove po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
by the teſtimony of <hi>Photius,</hi> that
this Council gives the worſhip of Latria,
to the Image of Chriſt; <hi>and ſuch a kind
of worſhip to the Images of the Virgin Mary,
and the rest of the Saints, as that while we
adhere to their Images or Statues, we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be made fit for, and to be vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
a tactual union with God Himſelf.</hi>
This done, he inſultingly tapers up, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151863:45"/>
tours himſelf over us, with a double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory.
<hi>Can any thing, ſays he, more
inflame the Souls of Men with that myſtical
luſt after Idols, then the doctrine of this Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
Synod? What Philtrum more effectual
to raiſe up that Idolomania, that being mad
and love-ſick after images and idols, then
this?</hi> Thus the high-flown Doctor walks
in wonders above himſelf. But why all
this laviſh of a paſſionate Rhetorique?
The Doctor had plaid his Maſter-prize
if he had given us all this rable in the
Councils own words. But inſtead of
that, he feeds upon reverſions at ſecond
hand, takes his quotations from <hi>Photius</hi>
(a Perſon of as much credit, as himſelf)
and makes <hi>Photius</hi> the Paraphraſt and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of the Councils meaning. But
what if the Council ſay no ſuch thing?
Nay, what if the Council deliver the
quite contrary doctrine? How blank then
will the Doctor's charge look, upon the
diſcovery of ſuch diſingenuity? And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had the Doctor but taken ſo much as
a curſory ſurvey of Catholique Authors
on this Subject, he might have found
them frequently and truly quoting this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:151863:45"/>
very Council, <hi>act.</hi> 7. to prove that the
Image of Chriſt is not to be honoured
with the worſhip of Latria: but that
ſuch honour and reverence is due to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in general, as is to the Books of the
Goſpel, and the holy Utenſils of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.
Now therefore whereas the Doctor
was pleaſed to ask; <hi>What Philtrum more
effectual to raiſe up that Idolomania, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mad and love-ſick after images, then this?</hi>
We ſhall give him leave to take to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
this Idolomania and love-ſick humor
after the images of his own fond concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the idol of his own fancy: for
therein, and in nothing elſe conſiſts the
main of his charge againſt us.</p>
               <p>Next follows the Ninth Chapter, the
Title whereof looks big, and ſpeaks thus.
<hi>The meaning of the doctrine of the Council
of Trent, touching the worſhipping of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
more determinately illuſtrated, from the
general practiſe of the Roman Church, and
ſuffrage of their Popes, whereby it is depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
to be stil more courſely and Pagani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
idolatrous.</hi> It cannot be denied, but
here is a fair flouriſh of words. But the
queſtion is; <hi>Quid dignum tanto tulit hic
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:151863:46"/>
promiſsor hiatii?</hi> Mark the words; <hi>(from
the general practiſe of the Roman Church.)</hi>
And yet inſtead of the ſaid general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, He begins
with the particular and generally rejected
ſpeculation of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> and Saint <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure,</hi>
both of them declaring (as
the Doctor words it) that the Image of
Chriſt <hi>is</hi> to be worſhipped with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Latria. Good Doctor, there is a
great difference between <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>may be.</hi>
The one implies an obligation, the other
a bare permiſſion: and you produce no
proof of any ſuch obligation aſſerted by
theſe holy Doctors; each of which was
too much a Divine to be ignorant what
Idolatry is, and too much a Chriſtian to
commit it. Now indeed that the Image
of Chriſt <hi>may be</hi> worſhipped with the
worſhip of Latria (though expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the doctrine of the Second Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice)</hi> is the commonly ſuppoſed
Opinion of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure.</hi>
Who, as they never mention,
ſo in all likelihood they never ſaw the ſaid
Council, nor the eighth General Synod,
both of which lay concealed from the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151863:46"/>
World a long time, and we owe the
publiſhing of them, only to the later and
more inquiſitive diſcoveries of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Age. It is hard to ſay what was
the meaning of theſe two Doctors: for
when they come to unfold their aſſertion,
they wind about, and enter into ſuch nice
diſtinctions, as requires a long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with, and deep inſight into the
Schools, only to underſtand, much more
to foil, and confute them. Wherein
Dr. <hi>More</hi> might very much oblige the
World, if he pleaſed to engage upon ſuch
a task, as a noble eſſay of his ſpeculative
faculty.</p>
               <p>After Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
comes in <hi>Azorius</hi> the Jeſuit, he alſo
affirming (as the Doctor pretends) <hi>that
it is the conſtant Opinion of the Theologers,</hi>
(ſo the Doctor calls them) <hi>that the image
is to be honoured and worſhipped with the
ſame honour and worſhip, that he is, whoſe
Image it is.</hi> Which (ſays the Doctor)
<hi>is not unlike that of the Council of Nice,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>in the foregoing citation.</hi> Here is a
proofleſs accuſation, which the learned
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:151863:47"/>
call a calumny, whereby <hi>Azorius</hi> is made
the Author of a great untruth, without
any the leaſt allegation to evidence the
charge. As to the Tenet, which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
ſpeaks of, it is far from being the
conſtant Opinion of our Theologers;
whereas 'tis now generally rejected by
them, unleſs limited by that reſtriction
and qualifying diſtinction of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which the Doctor either forgot, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
omitted, in his long tranſlation
out of <hi>Photius,</hi> in the laſt Chapter, though
it was the only material word in the
whole citation: For divers indeed (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this reſtriction along with them)
teach that the Image may be honoured
and worſhipped with the ſame honour
and worſhip with the Prototype; not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivocally
but analogically, as the Schools
ſpeak; which comes to a meer verbal
conteſt, and in reality imports a much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
kind of honour done to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
than what is due to him in his
own Perſon, whoſe Image it is. I ſhall
briefly open the diſtiction. As a Man
and a Lion differ ſpecifically: ſo a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Man, and a painted Lion differ no leſs.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:151863:47"/>
Whence it is, that the painted Man is
reduced analogically to the ſpecies of
Man, and not to that of a Lion: no more
than the painted Lion, to the ſpecies of
Man, ſo that a Man, and a painted Man
are (though not univocally) yet analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
the ſame. Now, ſays our Doctors,
look what proportion the painted Man
holds with the Man himſelf; the like
compariſon is to be made between the
honour exhibited to the painted Man,
and the Man himſelf, or to the Picture,
and the Prototype. And therefore as the
Man, and the painted Man, are analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
the ſame: So the honour done to
the painted Man, and the Man himſelf,
or to the Picture and the Prototype, are
(not univocally but) analogically the
ſame. Thus do <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and ſome others
interpret Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.</hi>
If the Doctor underſtand the
diſtinction, and like it not, he hath his
Chriſtian liberty to impugne it. If he
underſtand it not, he may do well to lay
down the Cudgels, and leave theſe great
Divines to themſelves and their ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and not to obtrude their School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niceties
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:151863:48"/>
upon us, as part of our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
Faith, or practiſe; whereas he himſelf
acknowledgeth in the beginning of this
Chapter, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
mentions any ſuch worſhip of Latria
due to the Image of Chriſt. And two
General Councils, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
and Eighth,<note place="margin">Council. 7<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. actio. 7. Conc. 8<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. actio. ult. can. 3.</note> declare
definitively for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to what the Doctor
pretends: For, ſpeaking of
the Veneration which is to
be given to Images, they compare it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with that reverence which is due to the
Books of the Goſpel, and the Utenſils of
the Altar. Which are both of them to
be honoured with due Veneration; the
one, as ſignifying holy things; the other,
as conſecrated to holy uſes; both which
conſiderations joyntly concur in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Chriſt and his Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, </hi>The Doctor pretends,<hi> That
the Conſecration and Worſhip of Images
makes them perfectly as the Idol-gods of the
Heathen, as Octavius jearingly ſpeaks of the
Heathen-gods, in Minucius felix: ecce fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur,
fabricatur, ſcalpitur, nondum eſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:151863:48"/>
—Ecce ornatur, conſecratur, oratur, tunc
poſtremo Deus eſt. Behold it is clothed, or
adorned, it is conſecrated and prayed unto,
then at length it becomes a god. And if
this will do it, the Church of Rome's Images
will prove as good Idol gods, as any of them
all. </hi>Here is a calumny indeed of the firſt
magnitude, moſt uncharitably implying
that the<hi> Roman </hi>Church<hi> prays to Images, </hi>as
the Heathens did to their Idol-gods. The
beſt excuſe for ſo foul a charge is the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
groſsneſs of it, whereby it may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be hoped, that no Perſon, that is but
one remove from a fool, can either believe
the Doctor, or think that he believes
himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He inveighs againſt two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
forms of conſecrating Pictures,
which he does not profeſs to have ſeen
himſelf. But, ſays he, <hi>Chemnitius recites
them out of the Pontifical he had read.</hi> Here
is a third proofleſs accuſation, called a
Calumny: For <hi>Chemnitius</hi> his word is
no proof with us, who is a known Sinon,
a Perſon of that tried integrity, as that he
who never truſts him, ſhall be ſure never
to be deceived by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:151863:49"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He brings a form of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
of Images, out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall:
<hi>Grant, O God, that whoſoever before
this Image ſhall diligently and humbly upon
his Knees worſhip, and honour thy only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son, or the Bleſſed Virgin, or this
glorious Apoſtle or Martyr, Confeſſor, or
Virgin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That he may obtain, by his, or
her merits and interceſſion, grace in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
life, and eternal glory hereafter.</hi> Upon
this Prayer, the Doctor deſcants after this
manner. So that, ſays he, <hi>The Virgin and
other Saints are fellow-distributers of grace
and glory with Chriſt himſelf to their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants
before their Images; and that upon
their own merits; and for the ſervice done
to them in kneeling and pouring out their
Prayers before their ſtatues or ſymbolical
preſence.</hi> Thus far is the Doctor's charge
who might have done well to have lent
us his Opticks, or elſe to have ſet down
in Capital Letters that ſentence, word,
or ſingle ſyllable in the aforeſaid Prayer
(which yet differs from that in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Rituall) whereby he pretends to infer his
triple conſequence. For, there is no ſuch
expreſſion in the whole Prayer, as <hi>Grant
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:151863:49"/>
O Virgin;</hi> or <hi>Grant O Saint:</hi> but, <hi>Grant
O God.</hi> How then do we here make the
Virgin and other Saints fellow-diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of grace and glory with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
Much leſs do we make them fellow-diſtributers
of grace and glory with
Chriſt, upon their own merits, who have
no merits of their own, but ſuch as flow
from, and have their abſolute dependance
of the merits of Chriſt. And leſt of all
are they here made fellow-diſtributers
of grace, <hi>for</hi> the ſervice done to them in
kneeling and praying before their ſtatues;
there being no ſuch cauſall as that <hi>(for)</hi>
ſpecified at all in the Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> His weak Eye-ſight cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the light of Wax-candles, no more
than his head the ſmoke of incenſe burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before the images of Saints; both
which he pretends to be idolatrous. This
he confidently affirms, but never offers to
prove, and thereby proves himſelf guilty
of a Fifth Calumny. As for Temples and
Altars, I have already told him we erect
Temples and Altars to God alone, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only a ſecondary honour or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
for the Saints. I ſhall not foul
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:151863:50"/>
my Paper with taking notice of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly
brothel-language, as fills up his
next Page. It is enough to ſay, it is more
than becomes a modeſt Doctor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He touches at ſome more groſs
extravagancies, which, ſays he, <hi>Though
they have connived at, yet they would be
loth to own upon publick authority: ſuch as
the making images to ſweat, their eyes to
move, the making them to ſmile, to loure,
look ſad, to feel heavy or light, and the like.</hi>
The Doctor's Book would give me the
lie, if I ſhould term this any thing leſs
than a Calumny, for he brings not ſo
much as any one ſingle inſtance to back
his accuſation, charging our Church with
connivance at ſuch unchriſtian impoſtures
which have ever been the object of her
ſharpeſt cenſures, and moſt exemplar ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities
when-ever detected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> He quotes a Rhyme to the face
of Chriſt, called the <hi>Veronica.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this was no part of any Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Office, for which the Church might
be juſtly thought reſponſible, he teares a
piece of a Hymn out of the Breviary,
which he preſents under the Title of a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:151863:50"/>
blind devotion. <hi>O crux, ave ſpes unica,
hoc paſſionis tempore; auge piis juſtitiam,
reiſque dona veniam.</hi> Then he runs divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
upon this Text, in this ſort. <hi>This,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>muſt ſound very wildly and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly
to any ſenſible Ear. And yet the
invoking any Saint before his image, for aid
and ſuccour (the image bearing the name
and repreſentation of the Saint) with eyes
and hands lift up to it, is as arrant talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a ſenſleſs stock, or a ſtone, as this,
and as groſs a piece of Idolatry.</hi> If you
had but added one clauſe more Mr. <hi>Doctor,</hi>
which is every whit as well grounded as
your own, you had done your deed, and
changed your calumny againſt us into
blaſphemy againſt God: for, as you ſay,
<hi>The invoking any Saint before his Image for
aid and ſuccour, (the Image bearing the name
and repreſentation of the Saint) with eyes
and hands lift up to it, is as arrant talking
with a ſenſleſs stock or ſtone, as this:</hi> So
might you have added with no leſs colour
of truth; That invoking Almighty God
before the Ark of the Covenant, (the
Ark being but a figure or ſymbolical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and of Wood, and had in it the Rod
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:151863:51"/>
of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Tables of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant)
with eyes and hands lift up to it,
was as arrant talking with a ſenſleſs ſtock
or ſtone, as this which you object againſt
the Worſhip of Images. As for the
Churches Hymn, <hi>O crux ave ſpes unica;</hi>
I recommend to the Doctor this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Text of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 18.
For the preaching of the Croſs is to them
that periſh, fooliſhneſs, but unto us which are
ſaved, it is the power of God.</hi> Where the
Croſs is figuratively taken for the Perſon
crucified, which is <hi>Chriſt the Power of God,</hi>
expreſly ſo called, <hi>v.</hi> 24. of the ſame
Chapter. Wherefore as thoſe, who
preach the Croſs, may by an eaſy trope
be ſaid to Preach Chriſt crucified: So,
allow but charity for Interpreter, and
thoſe who ſpeak to the croſs, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſcruple be ſuppoſed to ſpeak figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to Chriſt crucified. So that the
ſame interpretation which clears the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
will abſolve the Church; and her
apoſtrophe to Chriſt crucified (under the
Title of the Croſs) ſhall paſs for canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
as long as this, and ſuch like Texts,
ſhall continue in being, to pattern and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:151863:51"/>
patronize the expreſſion. And therefore
I end with this parallel of the Apoſtle's
Text; that as <hi>the preaching of the Croſs,</hi>
(ſo an addreſs to the Croſs) <hi>is to them that
periſh, fooliſhneſs; but to us it is the power
of God, and wiſdome of God.</hi>

6. 9. neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters
ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God. And
thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are bound
to continue Idolaters, as long as they
live, or elſe to renounce their Church;
and therefore they are bound to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by adhearing to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:151863:52"/>
unleſs they could live in it for ever. But
becauſe ſome Proteſtants have declared
for the poſſibility of ſalvation in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi>
Church, this piece of charity, in
ſome of our party, they turn to the fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
off all imputation of idolatry from
themſelves, arguing thus: That no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
can be ſaved: but thoſe in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi>
Church may be ſaved, according to
thoſe Proteſtants Opinion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; therefore
thoſe in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church are no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.
But moſt aſſuredly in that ſome
of our Church do ſay they may be ſaved,
upon a ſincere and hearty implicit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
of all their ſins, (wherein they
include the idolatries and all other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
which they knew not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
guilty of, by reaſon of the blind
miſinſtructions of their Church) no more
is given them by this, then thus; <hi>viz.</hi>
That they are ſaved by diſowning of, and
diſmembring themſelves from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church, as much as it is in their
power ſo to do, and by bitterly repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them that they were ever of that
Church, as ſuch; and by being ſo mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that if they did know what a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:151863:53"/>
Church it is, they would forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſeparate from it.—In which poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if there were any truth, it will
reach the honeſt-minded <hi>Pagans</hi> as well.
I conclude therefore with
the Spirit of truth in the
divine Oracles, declaring
the See of <hi>Rome</hi> the ſeat<note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 2. 13.</note>

               <p>This is mellifluous Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s ſweet
harangue, with a long-winded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> too
tedious to be inſerted here. Now I would
gladly know what there is in all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
which an ingenuous Son of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> will not be heartily
aſhamed of, and even bluſh for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
ſake. Here is, I confeſs, ſtout rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
diſingenuity more than is neceſſary
for a Doctor, and an ill-grounded and
ſchiſmatical diſcourſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Thorndike in his just Weights, and Meaſures.</note> even
admitting a Proteſtant <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
for Umpire in the caſe.
As for our Doctor's dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
in the learned Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of railing, I envy it
not; nor hath the Church of <hi>England</hi> any
great reaſon to glory in it: For ſhe may
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:151863:54"/>
remember but too well, that in the black
days of the late apoſtacy, when loyalty
lay a gaſping, and Religious Rebellion firſt
took poſſeſſion of the Pulpit, ſhe felt the
ſmart of this language her ſelf, whilſt he
was looked upon as the beſt Man, and
the greateſt Servant of the Lord, who
knew how to <hi>Curſe Meroz</hi> the loudeſt;
And there are not wanting in this Nation,
thoſe who can find a <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to
make <hi>Meroz</hi> of it when they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>But his great diſingenuity, in averring
ſo peremptorily that no Proteſtants allow
us a poſſibility of Salvation, but only in
caſe of ſuch a repentance, as implies an
abſolute renunciation of our Religion, and
its idolatrous doctrines and practiſes, by
diſowning of, and diſmembring our ſelves
from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; this I ſay, will
ſcarce appear pardonable in the eyes of
his Fellow-Doctors: For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Arch-Biſhop
<hi>Lawd</hi> in his Fam'd Relation, § 35.
expreſly grants us this Poſſibility of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and to clear himſelf, and ſhew
that he is not alone, he cites Biſhop <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,
Hall, Hooker, Field,</hi> and others, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with him in the ſame Opinion;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:151863:54"/>
and this without any ſuch renunciation
of our Religion, as the Doctor pretends;
or diſowning and diſmembring our ſelves
from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. I cannot paſs
by Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s remarkable expreſſion
upon this Subject, in his diſcourſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
§ 17. <hi>For my part, ſays he, I
dare not deny the poſſibility of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who have been the chiefeſt inſtruments
of ours. Secondly,</hi> Beſides the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
and the above mentioned Doctors,
Dr. <hi>Potter.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and others glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much of the charitable Principles of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and object want
of charity to us, for maintaining, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy
unrepented deſtroys Salvation.
Now if the Objectors ſhould retaliate,
and ſay that Popery unrepented deſtroys
Salvation, I would willingly be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by Dr. <hi>More</hi> wherein lies the charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and moderation they boaſt of. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
Nothing is more current amongſt them,
when they are preſſed with the crime of
Schiſm, then to return the charge upon
us, from other grounds: Saying, that as
the Donatiſts and Luciferians <hi>were,</hi> ſo we
<hi>are</hi> Schiſmatiques, in cutting off from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151863:55"/>
the Body of Chriſt, and the Hope of
Salvation, other Churches from which we
are divided in Communion. Whence is
evidently inferred, that thoſe who make
this Objection, cannot cut us off from
the hope of Salvation, unleſs they mean
to evacuate the force of their own proof,
and fall into the Pit, which they had dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for their Neighbours. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Dr. <hi>More</hi> makes the pretended Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the ground
of his diſſuaſive from Popery: That this
Method of arguing is abſolutely ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
(even allowing the caſe to be ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi>'s Juſt Weights, and
ruled according to his Meaſures) Dr. <hi>More</hi>
may find abundant ſatisfaction in the firſt
Chapter of the aboveſaid Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>But, in regard I have mentioned ſo
eminent a Perſon, and Member of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> I
ſhall make bold to turn him into the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſts,
againſt Dr. <hi>More.</hi> The antitheſis of their
doctrines is very remarkable; for they
run diametrically oppoſite one to another.
Dr. <hi>More</hi> affirms the Worſhip of the Hoſt
in the Papacy to be Idolatry. Dr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:151863:55"/>
(ch. 19.) denies the Worſhip of the
Hoſt in the Papacy to be Idolatry. Dr.
<hi>More</hi> holds that the placing and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Images i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Churches, is Idolatry. <hi>Dr.
Thorndike</hi> (ch. 19.) holds that the placing
and reverencing Images in Churches, is
not Idolatry. <hi>Dr. More</hi> will have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints to be inexcuſable Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
<hi>Dr. Thorndike</hi> (ch. 16.) excuſes
Invocation of Saints from Idolatry. <hi>Laſtly,
Dr. More</hi> exhorts all Men to ſeparate from
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Idolaters. But
<hi>Dr. Thorndike</hi> (chap. 1.) avows to all the
World, that thoſe who ſeparate from the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Idolaters, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſchiſmatiques before God. When the
two <hi>Doctors</hi> are fully agreed upon theſe
Points, <hi>Dr. More</hi> ſhall hear more from me,
